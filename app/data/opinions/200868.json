Plaintiff John C. Karvelas brought\n\nthis qui tam action against defendants Melrose-Wakefield Hospital,\n\nMelrose-Wakefield         Healthcare      Corporation,   and   Hallmark     Health\n\nSystem, Inc., alleging violations of the False Claims Act (“FCA”),\n\n31   U.S.C.    §    3729,     et   seq.    The   district   court    granted     the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a\n\nclaim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                 On appeal, Karvelas\n\ncomplains that the court wrongly applied the particularity pleading\n\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) for averments in fraud to this\n\nFCA case.      He further argues that the court wrongfully dismissed\n\nhis claim of retaliation by the defendants for conduct protected by\n\nthe FCA.    After examining the issues raised by this appeal, some of\n\nwhich have not been addressed before in this circuit, we affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n              John C. Karvelas was employed as a respiratory therapist\n\nat the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, Massachusetts, from\n\n1982 until January 1997.              He claims that from 1994 until the\n\ntermination        of   his   employment    at   the   hospital     in   1997,   the\n\ndefendants knowingly submitted false claims to the United States\n\ngovernment in order to obtain Medicare and Medicaid payments, in\n\nviolation of the False Claims Act.               In essence, Karvelas alleges\n\nthat Melrose-Wakefield Hospital and its parent corporations failed\n\nto comply with federal standards for patient care as required by\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fthe Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\")1 for Medicare and\n\nMedicaid reimbursement.         He claims that the defendants falsely\n\ncertified that they were in compliance with these standards and\n\n\"wrongfully billed Medicare and/or Medicaid,\" presumably on the\n\nbasis of services that were being provided improperly or not at\n\nall. Karvelas further claims that he was discharged in retaliation\n\nfor   his   investigation    of   the   defendants’   noncompliance      with\n\nregulatory standards and violations of the FCA.\n\n            On April 6, 2001, Karvelas filed the present qui tam\n\naction against the defendants in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts.2          On May 3, 2002, the United\n\nStates gave notice that it did not intend to intervene in the case.\n\nThe   district   court   then     ordered   the   complaint   unsealed    and\n\nauthorized service on the defendants.        The defendants subsequently\n\nmoved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        The district court granted the motion and\n\ndismissed the case with prejudice, ruling that Karvelas had not met\n\nthe requirement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) that allegations of\n\n\n      1\n      The Health Care Financing Administration became the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") on June 1, 2001.\n      2\n      This was the second federal lawsuit that Karvelas has\ninitiated against the defendants in connection with their alleged\nfraudulent activities. His first complaint, which was filed in May\n2000, alleged essentially the same retaliation claim pleaded in\nthis case, as well as various state law claims. The district court\ndismissed the action, without prejudice, for failure to state a\nclaim. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Civ. No. 00-10991\n(D. Mass. May 5, 2000).\n\n                                     -3-\n\ffraud be stated with particularity.3      It further held that Karvelas\n\nhad failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for False\n\nClaims Act retaliation.4   This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n          We review de novo the district court's dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         Morales-\n\nVillalobos v. Garcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51, 52 (1st Cir. 2003).         We\n\naccept the plaintiff's well-pleaded facts as true and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.        Doran v. Mass.\n\nTurnpike Auth., 348 F.3d 315, 318 (1st Cir. 2003).            However, we\n\nreject claims that are made in the complaint if they are \"bald\n\nassertions\"   or   \"unsupportable    conclusions.\"   Arruda    v.   Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).       Our objective is\n\n\"to determine whether the complaint . . . alleges facts sufficient\n\nto make out a cognizable claim.\"      Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d\n\n231, 241 (1st Cir. 2002).     In making this determination, we may\n\naffirm on any independently sufficient basis. Id.\n\n\n     3\n      The court noted that the judgment was without prejudice to\nany claim that the federal government could have raised in the\naction, explaining that the government \"remains free to exercise\nits discretion and judgment regarding its own litigation posture\nwith respect to matters related to or suggested by claims the\nplaintiff ha[d] unsuccessfully presented to this court.\"\n     4\n      The district court also dismissed Count V of Karvelas's\ncomplaint alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organization (RICO) statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq.\nKarvelas does not appeal the dismissal of this claim.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fB.   The False Claims Act\n\n          The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq., prohibits\n\nthe submission   of   false   or   fraudulent   claims   to   the   federal\n\ngovernment.   The statute was first adopted during the Civil War in\n\nresponse to widespread fraud in wartime defense contracts. See Vt.\n\nAgency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S.\n\n765, 781 (2000).      Its \"qui tam\"5 provisions authorized private\n\nindividuals to sue on behalf of the federal government and were\n\nintended to aid the government in discovering fraud and abuse \"by\n\nunleashing a posse of ad hoc deputies to uncover and prosecute\n\nfrauds against the government.\"      Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah\n\nRiver Co., 176 F.3d 776, 784 (4th Cir. 1999)(citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).6\n\n          The most recent amendments to the FCA, passed in 1986,\n\nsee S. Rep. No. 345, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 2 (1986), reprinted\n\nin 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, were intended to encourage the filing of\n\n\n     5\n      \"'Qui tam' is an abbreviation for qui tam pro domino rege\nquam pro seipso, which literally means 'he who as much for the king\nas for himself.'\" United States ex rel. S. Prawer & Co. v. Fleet\nBank, 24 F.3d 320, 324 n.7 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). Qui\ntam provisions first became popular in thirteenth century England.\nThey permitted private individuals to bring suit on behalf of the\nKing and served as a supplement to official law enforcement. Id.\n     6\n      The historical background of the False Claims Act and its\nsubsequent amendments has been described in detail by this and\nother courts. See, e.g., Prawer, 24 F.3d at 324-26; United States\nex rel. Springfield Terminal Ry Co. v. Quinn, 14 F.3d 645, 646,\n649-51 (D.C. Cir. 1994); United States ex rel. Williams v. NEC\nCorp., 931 F.2d 1493, 1496-98 (11th Cir. 1991); United States ex\nrel. Stinson, Lyons, Gerlin & Bustamante v. Prudential Ins. Co.,\n944 F.2d 1149, 1153-54 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fprivate qui tam actions, yet also included provisions designed to\n\nprevent \"parasitic\" lawsuits, in which \"relators, rather than\n\nbringing to light independently-discovered information of fraud,\n\nsimply feed off of previous disclosures of . . . fraud [against the\n\ngovernment].\"   United States ex rel. Siller v. Becton Dickinson &\n\nCo., 21 F.3d 1339, 1347 (4th Cir. 1994).      The amendments thus\n\nrepresent the latest chapter in a long history of \"'repeated\n\ncongressional efforts to walk a fine line between encouraging\n\nwhistle-blowing and discouraging opportunistic behavior.'\" Prawer,\n\n24 F.3d at 326 (quoting Quinn, 14 F.3d at 651).\n\n          The FCA imposes liability upon persons who 1) present or\n\ncause to be presented to the United States government, a claim for\n\napproval or payment, where 2) that claim is false or fraudulent,\n\nand 3) the action was undertaken \"knowingly,\" in other words, with\n\nactual knowledge of the falsity of the information contained in the\n\nclaim, or in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the\n\ntruth or falsity of that information. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1), (b).\n\nThe statute does not require proof of specific intent, that is,\n\nintent to present false or fraudulent claims to the government.\n\nId. § 3729(b) (stating that \"no proof of specific intent to defraud\n\nis required\" to prove liability under the FCA).        The statute\n\nfurther prohibits \"conspir[acies] to defraud the Government by\n\nciting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.\"         Id. §\n\n3729(a)(3).   Individuals who violate the FCA are liable for civil\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fpenalties and double or treble damages plus the costs incurred in\n\nbringing the FCA lawsuit.        Id. § 3729(a).\n\n            Not all fraudulent conduct gives rise to liability under\n\nthe FCA.    \"[T]he statute attaches liability, not to the underlying\n\nfraudulent activity or to the government's wrongful payment, but to\n\nthe 'claim for payment.'\"        United States v. Rivera, 55 F.3d 703,\n\n709 (1st Cir. 1995).       Evidence of an actual false claim is \"the\n\nsine qua non of a False Claims Act violation.\"                United States ex\n\nrel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., 290 F.3d 1301, 1311 (11th\n\nCir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1105 (2003).                  Therefore, a\n\ndefendant violates the FCA only when he or she has presented to the\n\ngovernment a false or fraudulent claim, defined as \"any request or\n\ndemand . . . for money or property\" where the government provides\n\nor will reimburse any part of the money or property requested.              31\n\nU.S.C. § 3729(c); see also Harrison, 176 F.3d at 785 (\"[T]he False\n\nClaims Act at least requires the presence of a claim – a call upon\n\nthe government fisc – for liability to attach.\").\n\n            As noted above, the FCA's qui tam provisions allow a\n\nprivate individual or \"relator\"7 to file a lawsuit alleging FCA\n\nviolations on behalf of the United States.                31 U.S.C. § 3730. An\n\nFCA   qui   tam   action   may   not   be    based   on    publicly   disclosed\n\ninformation unless the relator is the original source of that\n\n\n      7\n      A \"relator\" is \"[a] party in interest who is permitted to\ninstitute a proceeding in the name of the People or the Attorney\nGeneral when the right to sue resides solely in that official.\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1289 (6th ed. 1990).\n\n                                       -7-\n\finformation.       Id. § 3730(e)(4)(a).          The relator must first serve\n\nhis or her complaint upon the government, where it remains under\n\nseal for sixty days.        Id. § 3730(b)(2).         If the government elects\n\nto intervene, it takes over the suit and adopts any or all of the\n\nallegations contained in the qui tam complaint, in which case the\n\nrelator is entitled to 15-25 percent of any proceeds recovered.\n\nId. § 3730(c)(1), (d)(1).          If the government does not exercise its\n\nright to intervene in the suit, the relator may serve the complaint\n\nupon the defendant and proceed with the action.               Id. § 3730(b)(2),\n\n(b)(4)(B), (c)(3). If the relator succeeds in recovering funds for\n\nthe government, he or she is entitled to 25-30 percent of the\n\nrecovery.       Id. § 3730(d)(2).\n\nC.     Failure to Plead Fraud with Particularity\n\n            We must consider whether the district court erred in\n\ndismissing Karvelas's complaint on the ground that it failed to\n\nplead fraud with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Karvelas claims that a complaint\n\nstating a violation of the False Claims Act need not comply with\n\nRule    9(b).      He   argues    in     the    alternative   that   Rule   9(b)'s\n\nparticularity requirements should be relaxed in his case. Finally,\n\nKarvelas claims that even if we do not relax these requirements,\n\nhis    complaint    alleges   fraud       with   sufficient   particularity     to\n\nsatisfy     Rule    9(b).        After    first     describing   generally     the\n\nrequirements of Rule 9(b), we address each of these arguments in\n\nturn.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f              1.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\n\n              Under the general pleading requirements of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, a federal civil complaint need only state\n\n\"a   short    and    plain    statement     of    the   claim    showing    that    the\n\nplaintiff is entitled to relief.\"                Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).      However,\n\nthe federal rules recognize limited exceptions to Rule 8(a)'s\n\nsimplified pleading standard.              For example, claims of fraud are\n\nsubject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 9(b), which provides: \"In all averments of fraud or\n\nmistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be\n\nstated with particularity.            Malice, intent, knowledge, and other\n\ncondition of mind may be averred generally.\"\n\n              We have said that Rule 9(b) requires that a plaintiff's\n\naverments of fraud specify the time, place, and content of the\n\nalleged false or fraudulent representations.                    Arruda, 310 F.3d at\n\n18-19.       The purpose of this requirement is to \"give notice to\n\ndefendants of the plaintiffs' claim, to protect defendants whose\n\nreputation     may    be     harmed   by    meritless     claims     of    fraud,    to\n\ndiscourage 'strike suits,' and to prevent the filing of suits that\n\nsimply hope to uncover relevant information during discovery.\"\n\nDoyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 194 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              We have recognized that, under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff may\n\nmake allegations of fraud on the basis of personal knowledge or on\n\n\"information and belief.\"             New England Data Services, Inc. v.\n\nBecher,      829    F.2d   286,   288      (1st    Cir.   1987).      Hence,       such\n\n                                           -9-\n\f\"information   and   belief\"   allegations   remain   subject   to   the\n\nparticularity requirements of Rule 9(b).     Moreover, allegations of\n\nfraud made on information and belief are also subject to the\n\nadditional requirement that \"the complaint set[] forth the facts on\n\nwhich the belief is founded.\" Id.; see also In re. Cabletron Sys.,\n\nInc., 311 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that \"this circuit\n\nimposed a strict requirement [on security fraud allegations based\n\non information and belief] under 9(b) before enactment of the PSLRA\n\n[Private Securities    Litigation   Reform   Act]\")(citing   Romani v.\n\nShearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Where\n\nallegations of fraud are . . . based only on information and\n\nbelief, the complaint must set forth the source of the information\n\nand the reasons for the belief.\") (superceded by statute)).8\n\n          2. Applicability of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\nto the FCA\n          Karvelas argues that the district court erred in granting\n\nthe defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion because a complaint that\n\nalleges a violation of the FCA need not comply with Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n9(b)'s requirement that \"in all averments of fraud . . . the\n\n     8\n      In Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 73 &\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2000), we noted that while \"a plaintiff can make\nallegations either on the basis of personal knowledge or on\n'information and belief,'\" there is an \"exception . . . in cases\nwhere the tougher pleading standards of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)\nreplace the more liberal requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8.\" To\nthe extent that this language suggests that information and belief\npleading is impermissible under Rule 9(b), it is dicta and it is\ninaccurate.    Information and belief pleading is permissible,\nsubject to Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement and the additional\nrequirement that pleadings on information and belief set forth the\nfacts on which that belief is founded.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcircumstances    constituting         fraud    .   .   .   shall          be   stated     with\n\nparticularity.\"          He claims that the district court should have\n\napplied the more lenient general pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(a).\n\n             In support of his theory that Rule 9(b) does not apply to\n\nthe   FCA,    Karvelas       cites    the     Supreme       Court's            decision     in\n\nSwierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002), which held that\n\nemployment discrimination claims are not subject to a heightened\n\npleading     standard.        Karvelas's       reliance         on    Swierkiewicz          is\n\nmisplaced.     It is true that the Court held in Swierkiewicz that\n\n\"Rule 8(a)'s simplified pleading standard applies to all civil\n\nactions, with       limited    exceptions.\"        Id.     at    513.          However,     it\n\nexpressly    noted    that    one    such   exception       is       Rule      9(b),    which\n\n\"provides for greater particularity in all averments of fraud or\n\nmistake.\"     Id. (emphasis added); see also Leatherman v. Tarrant\n\nCounty Narcotics Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (noting that Rule\n\n9(b) imposes a particularity requirement on the pleading of fraud\n\nor mistake).\n\n             We do not agree with Karvelas that \"the False Claims Act\n\nis not a 'fraud' statute\" and therefore does not fall within the\n\nscope of Rule 9(b).          Section 3729(a)(1) of the FCA imposes civil\n\npenalties    when    a    person     knowingly     presents          or    causes      to   be\n\npresented to the government \"a false or fraudulent claim for\n\npayment or approval.\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1).                        Section 3729(a)(3)\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fprohibits any conspiracy \"to defraud the Government by getting a\n\nfalse or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.\" Id. § 3729(a)(3).\n\n              The legislative history of the 1986 FCA Amendments and\n\nthe Supreme Court's interpretations of the statute further support\n\nthe conclusion that FCA claims involve \"averments of fraud\" that\n\nmust be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b).                  See, e.g., Vt.\n\nAgency   of    Natural   Res.,   529    U.S.    at   781   n.10    (noting   \"the\n\nunobjectional proposition . . . that the FCA was intended to cover\n\nall types of fraud\") (emphasis in the original); United States v.\n\nNeifert-White Co., 390 U.S. 228, 233 (1968)(\"[The FCA] protect[s]\n\nthe   funds     and   property   of     the    Government    from     fraudulent\n\nclaims\")(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); United\n\nStates v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 309 (1976) (explaining that the\n\nFCA was originally enacted to stop \"the massive frauds perpetrated\n\nby large contractors during the Civil War\"); S. Rep. No. 99-345, at\n\n6, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5271 (describing the FCA as \"a\n\ncivil remedy designed to make the Government whole for fraud\n\nlosses\").     In short, \"[i]t is self-evident that the FCA is an anti-\n\nfraud statute.\" Gold v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., 68 F.3d 1475, 1476\n\n(2d Cir. 1995).\n\n              Moreover, we reject Karvelas's argument that the False\n\nClaims Act is not a \"fraud\" statute because, under the statute,\n\n\"liability depends on the defendant's knowledge, not on his fraud,\"\n\nand therefore only the second clause of Rule 9(b), which allows\n\nknowledge of fraud to be averred generally, applies.                  Under the\n\n                                       -12-\n\fFCA, liability depends upon the defendant's act (presentation of a\n\nfalse or fraudulent claim to the United States government) and\n\nmental   state   (knowledge,    or   deliberate   ignorance     or   reckless\n\ndisregard of the truth or falsity of the information presented).\n\nThat Rule 9(b) allows \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other\n\ncondition of mind of a person [to be] averred generally\" does not\n\nmean that particularity requirements do not apply to FCA claims.\n\nRather, it simply means that a qui tam relator need not plead with\n\nparticularity     allegations    concerning       defendants'    knowledge,\n\nreckless disregard, or deliberate ignorance of the submission of\n\nfalse claims.    The characterization of a state of mind, after all,\n\ndoes not lend itself to detailed pleading.         On the other hand, the\n\ndetails of the actual presentation of false or fraudulent claims to\n\nthe government can and must be pled with particularity in order to\n\nmeet the requirements of Rule 9(b).\n\n           Finally, every circuit court that has addressed this\n\nissue has concluded that the heightened pleading requirements of\n\nRule 9(b) apply to claims brought under the FCA.

Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions § 5.04\n\n(2d ed. 2000 & Supp. 2003)(\"It is widely accepted by courts that\n\nbecause the essence of a False Claims Act is fraud, Rule 9(b)\n\napplies to FCA cases. . . . The applicability of Rule 9(b) to qui\n\ntam actions is by now beyond dispute.\"). For the reasons discussed\n\nabove, we now join this consensus and hold that Rule 9(b) applies\n\nto claims under the FCA.     Thus, the district court did not err in\n\nrequiring Karvelas to plead with particularity the defendants'\n\nalleged violations of the FCA.\n\n           3.   Relaxation of Rule 9(b)'s Particularity Requirements\n\n           Karvelas argues that even if Rule 9(b) applies to FCA\n\nclaims, its requirements should be relaxed in his case because the\n\ninformation necessary to plead with particularity is within the\n\npossession and control of the defendants.          There is some confusion\n\nabout the meaning of a \"relaxed rule of pleading\" under Rule 9(b).\n\nAt times, Karvelas seems to equate a relaxed rule of pleading with\n\npleading on information and belief. The district court, citing the\n\nFifth Circuit's decision in Thompson, 125 F.3d at 903, stated that\n\nthe effect of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard is that \"fraud may be\n\npled on information and belief.\"         Other courts have adopted this\n\nunderstanding    of   what   it   means    to     relax    9(b)'s   pleading\n\n                                  -14-\n\frequirements.     See, e.g., Clausen, 290 F.3d at 1314; United States\n\nex rel. Russell v. Epic Healthcare, 193 F.3d 304, 308 (5th Cir.\n\n1999).    However, as we have already explained, see Part II. c.1\n\nsupra, we subject \"information and belief\" pleading under Rule 9(b)\n\nto particularity requirements.              There is, in other words, no\n\nrelaxation of the particularity requirement for \"information and\n\nbelief\" pleading. Instead, when we refer to the relaxation of Rule\n\n9(b)'s particularity requirements, we refer to an opportunity for\n\nthe plaintiff to plead generally at the outset and then later amend\n\nthe complaint, filling in the blanks through discovery.                    That is\n\nthe meaning of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard that we apply here.\n\n            For   example,   we    have     said   that   Rule    9(b)    pleading\n\nstandards   may   be   relaxed,    in      an   appropriate    case,     \"when   the\n\nopposing party is the only practical source for discovering the\n\nspecific facts supporting a pleader's conclusion.\"                Boston & Maine\n\nCorp. v. Hampton, 987 F.2d 855, 866 (1st Cir. 1993).                       In such\n\ncases, \"even for a plaintiff's allegations of fraud, if the facts\n\nwould be peculiarly within the defendants' control, a court may\n\nallow    some   discovery    before     requiring     that      plaintiff    plead\n\nindividual acts of fraud with particularity.\"                  Id. (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Whether    discovery      is    warranted     to    correct     general\n\npleadings that do not initially meet the requirements of Rule 9(b)\n\nmay turn on the nature of the statute under which the plaintiff's\n\ncause of action arises.       For example, we have relaxed Rule 9(b)'s\n\n                                      -15-\n\fpleading requirements pending further discovery for allegations of\n\nmail and wire fraud pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act \"because of the apparent difficulties in\n\nspecifically pleading mail and wire fraud as predicate acts.\"                  New\n\nEngland Data Servs., 829 F.2d at 290-91.9                      See North Bridge\n\nAssoc., Inc. v. Boldt, 274 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 2001)(noting that\n\nin the RICO context, where \"the specific information [concerning\n\nthe   defendants'      use   of   interstate    mail   or     telecommunications\n\nfacilities] is likely in the exclusive control of the defendant,\n\nthe court should make a second determination as to whether the\n\nclaim as presented warrants the allowance of discovery and if so,\n\nthereafter    provide        an   opportunity    to     amend    the     defective\n\ncomplaint\")(quoting Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d\n\n34, 43 (1st Cir. 1991)).           We have not, however, had occasion to\n\nconsider     whether     this     relaxation    of     Rule     9(b)'s    pleading\n\nrequirements should be extended to cases arising under the False\n\nClaims Act.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n      On the other hand, prior to the enactment of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act, we strictly applied Rule 9(b)'s\npleading requirements in securities fraud cases even when the fraud\nrelated to matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the\ndefendants because of our concern that \"a plaintiff with a largely\ngroundless claim will bring a suit and conduct extensive discovery\nin the hopes of obtaining an increased settlement.\" Id. at 288;\nsee also Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1985) (in a\nsecurities fraud case, Rule 9(b) \"does not permit a complainant to\nfile suit first, and subsequently to search for a cause of\naction\")(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -16-\n\f          Although some courts have recognized in theory that the\n\nparticularity requirements of Rule 9(b) may be relaxed in an FCA\n\nqui tam action where the information relevant to the fraud is\n\n\"'peculiarly within the perpetrator's knowledge,'\"   United States\n\nex rel. Doe v. Dow Chem. Co., 343 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting Russell, 193 F.3d at 308), few courts have actually\n\napplied a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard to an FCA qui tam action.   See\n\nBoese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions, § 5.04[D] (noting\n\nthat \"[r]arely some courts will grant qui tam relators 'additional\n\nleeway' under Rule 9(b) when information is exclusively in the\n\nhands of the defendant\").10   The district court, quoting the Fifth\n\nCircuit's opinion in Russell, 193 F.3d at 308, refused to apply any\n\nversion of a relaxed standard in this case because \"documents\n\ncontaining the requisite information [were] possessed by other\n\nentities, such as the Healthcare Financing Administration.\"      This\n\nreasoning apparently assumes that where the required information is\n\nin the hands of the government, a relator can gain access to those\n\ndocuments and fill in the blanks on that basis.   See Clausen, 290\n\n\n\n     10\n       For the rare cases, see, for example, Wilkins ex rel. United\nStates v. Ohio, 885 F. Supp. 1055 (S.D. Ohio 1995)(holding that\nrelator's failure to meet the particularity requirements of Rule\n9(b) did not bar his claim where the relator was a former employee\nof the defendants and lacked access to records and documents in the\npossession of the defendants that contained information necessary\nto plead with particularity); United States ex rel. Kozhukh v.\nConstellation Tech. Corp., 64 F. Supp. 2d 1239 (M.D. Fla.\n1999)(same).\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fF.3d at 1314 n.25 (refusing to apply a more lenient pleading\n\nstandard to relator's allegations of fraud because the government\n\nhad access to the relevant information and the relator was \"not\n\nwithout avenues for obtaining [that] information\").\n\n           However, as Karvelas correctly notes, every FCA qui tam\n\naction involves allegations of false or fraudulent claims submitted\n\nto the government.    In many of these cases, the information needed\n\nto fill the gaps of an inadequately pleaded complaint will be in\n\nthe government's hands.       In addition, if the relator seeks to\n\nobtain the requisite information from the government, for example\n\nby submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act\n\n(FOIA), he or she may encounter Section 3730(e)(4) of the FCA,\n\nwhich prohibits qui tam actions based upon publicly disclosed\n\nallegations unless the relator is an \"original source\" of that\n\ninformation. 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B); see, e.g. United States ex\n\nrel. Mistick PBT v. Housing Auth., 186 F.3d 376, 383 (3d Cir.\n\n1999)(agency report prepared in response to a FOIA request is based\n\nupon   publicly   disclosed   information   for   FCA   purposes),   cert.\n\ndenied, 529 U.S. 1018 (2000);     United States v. A.D. Roe Co., 186\n\nF.3d 717, 723-24 (6th Cir. 1999) (information received pursuant to\n\na FOIA request is publicly disclosed); United States ex rel. Lamers\n\nv. City of Green Bay, 998 F. Supp. 971, 979-80 (E.D. Wis. 1998)\n\n(same), aff'd 168 F.3d 1013 (7th Cir. 1999).            The FCA defines\n\n\"original source\" as someone \"who has direct and independent\n\nknowledge of the information on which the allegations are based,\"\n\n                                  -18-\n\f31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B).      This language excludes individuals who\n\nmust rely    upon   information   already       in   the   possession   of   the\n\ngovernment to adequately state their claim.                 Thus, Karvelas's\n\nargument for a relaxed pleading standard because the information he\n\nneeds to plead with particularity is in the possession and control\n\nof the defendants cannot be answered by the court's suggestion that\n\nhe could have obtained that information from the government prior\n\nto filing his complaint.\n\n            Nonetheless, we do not agree with Karvelas that \"it is\n\ninherently inconsistent with the goals of the False Claims Act\" to\n\nrequire a qui tam relator to specify \"the time, dates, places, and\n\nidentities\" of the individuals involved in the fraud or \"the\n\nspecifics in the documents prepared and submitted by the defendant\n\nto obtain the funding\" at the time that the complaint is filed and\n\nprior to any additional discovery.11         The False Claims Act requires\n\na qui tam relator to serve on the government \"[a] copy of the\n\ncomplaint and written disclosure of substantially all material\n\nevidence    and   information   the    person    possesses.\"    31   U.S.C.    §\n\n\n     11\n      Contrary to Karvelas's suggestion on appeal, the district\ncourt did not hold that Rule 9(b) required the production of actual\ndocumentation. The court's occasional references to the absence of\nactual documents do not suggest that the court \"refused to consider\nany documents referred to in the complaint because Karvelas failed\nto produce them.\" Nor did the district court's \"insistence that\nthe qui tam relator has to plead fraud with particularity mean []\nthat the relator must plead the particulars of each document to\nwhich reference is made.\" Rather, as the district court correctly\nrecognized, Karvelas was required to describe with particularity\nsome of the documents containing false claims for payment that the\ndefendants allegedly submitted to the United States.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f3730(b)(2).    The complaint is filed in camera and remains under\n\nseal for 60 days during which time the government considers whether\n\nto intervene.     Id.    As a leading commentator has suggested,\n\nallowing a qui tam relator to amend his or her complaint after\n\nconducting further discovery would mean that \"the government will\n\nhave been compelled to decide whether or not to intervene absent\n\ncomplete information about the relator's cause of action.\" Boese,\n\nCivil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions § 4.04[C].12           Thus, allowing\n\na relator to plead generally at the outset and amend the complaint\n\nat the 12(b)(6) stage after discovery would be at odds with the\n\nFCA's procedures for filing a qui tam action and its protections\n\nfor the government (which is, of course, the real party in interest\n\nin a qui tam action).\n\n          Other courts have repeatedly refused to allow qui tam\n\nrelators to rely on later discovery to comply with Rule 9(b)'s\n\npleading requirements.    See, e.g., Clausen, 290 F.3d at 1313 n.24.\n\n(noting that allowing a plaintiff \"to learn the complaint's bare\n\nessentials    through   discovery    .     .   .   may   needlessly   harm   a\n\ndefendant['s] goodwill and reputation by bringing a suit that is,\n\nat best, missing some of its core underpinnings, and, at worst,\n\n[contains] baseless allegations used to extract settlements\");\n\n\n\n     12\n          Although the government may intervene later in the\nlitigation, \"such intervention is not mandatory. . . . Moreover,\nwhile it may intervene, the government will no longer have an\nopportunity to conduct a confidential and unhurried investigation\nof the new claims in the amended complaint.\" Id. at § 4.04[C].\n\n                                    -20-\n\fRussell, 193 F.3d at 308 (holding that \"a special relaxing of Rule\n\n9(b) is a qui tam plaintiff's ticket to the discovery process that\n\nthe statute itself does not contemplate\").                 The reluctance      of\n\ncourts to permit qui tam relators to use discovery to meet the\n\nrequirements of Rule 9(b) reflects, in part, a concern that a qui\n\ntam   plaintiff,   who   has    suffered     no   injury    in   fact,   may   be\n\nparticularly likely to file suit as \"a pretext to uncover unknown\n\nwrongs.\"   United States ex rel. Robinson v. Northrop Corp., 149\n\nF.R.D. 142 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (noting Rule 9(b)'s discouragement of\n\npre-textual claims in rejecting special 9(b) treatment of a qui tam\n\nplaintiff).13      In   light   of   the    prevailing     precedent     and   the\n\nprocedures for filing and serving a qui tam complaint under 31\n\nU.S.C. § 3730(b)(2) (providing for service on the government), we\n\nhold that a qui tam relator may not present general allegations in\n\nlieu of the details of actual false claims in the hope that such\n\ndetails will emerge through subsequent discovery.14\n\n\n      13\n       This requirement also applies where the complaint refers to\n\"a regularly-filed document prepared by the defendants.\"        We\ndisagree with Karvelas that such documents are excepted from Rule\n9(b)'s heightened pleading standard.\n      14\n      In a final variant of his claim for relaxation, Karvelas\nasserts that the district court should have applied a relaxed Rule\n9(b) standard because the defendants' alleged fraudulent schemes\nwere complex and occurred over a period of several years. While we\nhave not adopted such an exception to Rule 9(b)’s pleading\nrequirements, a few courts have found that a relaxed standard may\napply to FCA qui tam complaints where the alleged conduct took\nplace over a long period of time or involved numerous occurrences.\nSee, e.g., United States ex rel. Butler v. Magellan Health Servs.,\nInc., 74 F. Supp. 2d 1201, 1215 (M.D. Fla. 1999); United States ex\nrel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare, 20 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1039\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            4.    The Compatability of Karvelas's Complaint with Rule\n9(b)\n            Applying Rule 9(b) to Karvelas's complaint, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Karvelas failed to \"state with specificity\n\nwhat the precise [false] claims were\" or to \"provide specifics\n\nregarding   the       documents      submitted     to    HCFA     to    make   the    false\n\nclaims.\"    After carefully analyzing the sixteen \"schemes\" that\n\nKarvelas described in his 93-page complaint, the court found that\n\nhe had failed in each to \"allege violations of the False Claims Act\n\nsufficiently to meet his Rule 9(b) obligation.\"                          Similarly, the\n\ncourt held that the complaint failed to \"provide reference to\n\nactual documentation\" of the false claims that allegedly had been\n\nfiled with the government.\n\n            As we have emphasized, liability under the False Claims\n\nAct    requires       a    false   claim.      See      Rivera,    55    F.3d    at    709.\n\nTherefore, the defendant's presentation of false or fraudulent\n\nclaims to the government is a central element of every False Claims\n\nAct case.         A       health   care   provider's     violation       of    government\n\nregulations or engagement in private fraudulent schemes does not\n\n\n\n\n(S.D. Tex. 1998). Although we do not preclude the possibility of\nsuch an exception in a future case, we do not think that three\nyears presents an exceptionally long period of time. Nor do we\nfind any basis in the history or requirements of the FCA, or in\nmost of the precedents, for relieving Karvelas of his burden of\npleading fraud with particularity because he chose to allege\nsixteen complex schemes.     See Yuhasz, 341 F. 3d at 564 (\"[A]\nplaintiff should not be able to avoid the specificity requirements\nof Rule 9(b) by relying upon the complexity of the edifice which he\ncreated\")(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                            -22-\n\fimpose liability under the FCA unless the provider submits false or\n\nfraudulent claims to the government for payment based on these\n\nwrongful activities.15   See Clausen, 290 F.3d at 1311 (\"Without the\n\npresentment of [a false or fraudulent] claim, while the practices\n\nof an entity that provides services to the Government may be unwise\n\nor improper, there is simply no actionable damage to the public\n\nfisc as required under the False Claims Act.\")(emphasis in the\n\noriginal); United States ex rel.

Underlying schemes and other wrongful\n\nactivities that result in the submission of fraudulent claims are\n\nincluded in the \"circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\" that\n\nmust be pled with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b).     However,\n\nsuch pleadings invariably are inadequate unless they are linked to\n\nallegations, stated with particularity, of the actual false claims\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      A number of courts have also found FCA violations where a\ndefendant falsely certifies compliance with certain conditions\nrequired as a prerequisite for a government benefit or payment in\norder to induce that benefit. See, e.g., Thompson, 125 F.3d at 902.\nIn such cases, false certification for the purpose of receiving a\npayment or benefit becomes the practical equivalent of a statutory\nfalse claim.\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fsubmitted to the government that constitute the essential element\n\nof an FCA qui tam action.\n\n          As applied to the FCA, Rule 9(b)'s requirement that\n\naverments of fraud be stated with particularity – specifying the\n\n\"time, place, and content\" of the alleged false or fraudulent\n\nrepresentations, means that a relator must provide details that\n\nidentify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to\n\nthe government.16    In a case such as this, details concerning the\n\ndates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted,\n\ntheir identification numbers, the amount of money charged to the\n\ngovernment,   the   particular   goods   or   services   for   which   the\n\ngovernment was billed, the individuals involved in the billing, and\n\nthe length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the\n\nsubmission of claims based on those practices are the types of\n\ninformation that may help a relator to state his or her claims with\n\nparticularity.      These details do not constitute a checklist of\n\nmandatory requirements that must be satisfied by each allegation\n\nincluded in a complaint.     However, like the Eleventh Circuit, we\n\nbelieve that \"some of this information for at least some of the\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      In the FCA context, the concept of \"place\" holds less\nrelevance for allegations about fraudulent bills or other claims\nallegedly submitted to the government. It remains an important\ndetail in pleadings concerning the underlying tests, schemes, or\nother conduct that is linked to the submission of false claims.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fclaims must be pleaded in order to satisfy Rule 9(b).\"                  Clausen,\n\n290 F.3d at 1312 n.21.17\n\n              In describing at considerable length the defendants'\n\nsixteen schemes to defraud the government, the complaint alleges\n\nthat    the   defendants    submitted    false   claims      to   the    federal\n\ngovernment, including cost reports that were falsely certified as\n\ncomplete, true,     and    correct.     It   states   that    the   defendants\n\nwrongfully billed Medicare and Medicaid, and refers generally to\n\nfalse confirming orders and progress notes. However, the complaint\n\nnever specifies the dates or content of any particular false or\n\nfraudulent claim allegedly submitted for reimbursement by Medicare\n\nor Medicaid.      It provides no identification numbers or amounts\n\ncharged in individual claims for specific tests, supplies, or\n\n       17\n      In a related context, we held that courts will allow private\nsecurities fraud cases \"to advance past the pleadings stage when\nsome questions remain unanswered, provided the complaint as a whole\nis sufficiently particular to pass muster under the PSLRA.\"\nCabletron, 311 F.3d at 32; see Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194\nF.3d 185, 193 (1st Cir. 1999)(stating that the pleading\nrequirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\n(PSLRA) \"embody in the act itself at least the standards of Rule\n9(b)\"). We found that Cabletron's complaint satisfied the PSLRA's\nparticularity requirements because \"the fraud allegations advanced\nin [the] complaint, with their consistent details provided from at\nleast half a dozen different sources across various alleged\nschemes, reinforce each other and suggest reliability of the\ninformation reported.\" Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 33. By contrast, as\nwe discuss below, Karvelas's complaint does not allege the\nparticulars of any of his allegations concerning the presentation\nof false claims to the government, and therefore, considered as a\nwhole, the complaint does not meet the particularity requirements\nof 9(b). See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 204 (finding that the absence of\nany of a number of enumerated \"basic details\" describing alleged\nPSLRA violations was \"indicative of the excessive generality of\nthese allegations\").\n\n                                      -25-\n\fservices.     It does not identify or describe the                  individuals\n\ninvolved in the improper billing or allege with particularity any\n\ncertification of compliance with federal regulations in order to\n\nobtain payments. As Karvelas himself concedes in his brief to this\n\ncourt, his complaint \"did not set forth the specifics . . . of any\n\none single cost report, or bill, or piece of paper that was sent to\n\nthe Government to obtain funding.\"          Nor does the complaint provide\n\nthe source of information and factual basis for his conclusory\n\nallegations      that   the   defendants     submitted     actual      false   or\n\nfraudulent claims to the government.\n\n            For example, in describing Scheme A, Karvelas alleges\n\nthat the defendants \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they\n\npresented claims for medical items or service that they knew were\n\nnot provided as claimed\" and \"filed claims that were based on codes\n\nthat the defendants knew would result in greater payments than what\n\nan appropriate code would have provided.\"          Karvelas further claims\n\nthat \"staffing numbers in the Medicaid and Medicare filings were\n\nmake   believe    throughout   the   entire    hospital.\"       However,       the\n\ncomplaint does not specify the individuals who filed these claims,\n\nthe dates on which any such claims were filed, the nature and\n\ncontent of any documents submitted, or the amount claimed from the\n\ngovernment based on the particular medical items and services that\n\nwere   allegedly    improperly   provided     or   on    the   \"make    believe\"\n\nstaffing levels.\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f           The complaint alleges in Scheme A that \"from 1994 to 1997\n\nthe Hospital was certifying 12 respiratory therapists when in\n\nreality the hospital had only 7 full time respiratory therapists,\"\n\nyet it provides no details concerning the particular dates and\n\ncontent of the alleged certification, nor, assuming that the\n\nallegation was based on information and belief, does it set forth\n\nthe source of that information or the facts on which the belief was\n\nfounded.   Karvelas also alludes to various documents, referring to\n\nfalse \"Respiratory Therapist time schedules for 1994 into 1997\" and\n\n\"documents signed under the penalty of perjury and false statement\n\nsubmitted to the United States Government [that] certified that\n\nthere were 11.8 Respiratory Therapists during this period of time.\"\n\nHowever, he provides no particular details about the nature of\n\nthese documents or the circumstances of their submission to the\n\nUnited States government.\n\n           With somewhat more specificity, Karvelas alleges in his\n\ndiscussion of Scheme B that the blood gas laboratory \"performed\n\napproximately 21,000 arterial blood gas tests (ABG's) in the three\n\nyear period beginning in June, 1994 through April, 1997 at $50.00\n\nper test.\"    However, while he states that the Hospital \"billed\n\nMedicare and Medicaid for the costs of the testing on a large\n\npercentage of these patients with each bill certified to Medicare\n\nor Medicaid that the ABG laboratory had in fact complied with the\n\nCAP and CLIA standards,\" Karvelas does not specify which of the\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f21,000 tests were billed to the government, supply any details\n\nabout the particular bills and certifications submitted, or provide\n\na factual basis for his allegation that the defendants falsely\n\ncertified compliance with federal standards in order to secure\n\nMedicare    or   Medicaid    benefits.     This   lack   of   particularity\n\ncharacterizes     all   of   Karvelas's    allegations    concerning    the\n\nsubmission of false claims to the federal government.18\n\n            In summary, Karvelas alleges serious violations by the\n\ndefendants of federal standards governing the provision of patient\n\ncare.      However, alleged violations of federal regulations are\n\ninsufficient to support a claim under the FCA.           See United States\n\nex rel. Hopper v. Anton, 91 F.3d 1261, 1266 (9th Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"Violations of laws, rules, or regulations alone do not create a\n\ncause of action under the FCA.\");        Clausen, 290 F.3d at 1311 (\"[I]f\n\nRule 9(b) is to be adhered to, some indicia of reliability must be\n\ngiven in the complaint to support the allegation of an actual false\n\nclaim for payment being made to the Government.\") (emphasis in the\n\n\n     18\n      Indeed, with one exception, Karvelas's complaint does not\nspecify which of the particular violations of patient care\nstandards that Karvelas witnessed involved Medicare or Medicaid\npatients.   That exception involves the allegation that hospital\nadministrators instructed him and others to falsify test results so\nthat a trustee/patient of the hospital would qualify for Medicare\npayment for home oxygen. He further states that on January 26,\n1997, the trustee/patient admitted to him that the results of the\ntest were falsified.    However, while this allegation provides\nspecific details about the purported fraudulent activity, it does\nnot identify or describe the false claims that were allegedly\nsubmitted to Medicare in connection with the trustee's treatment.\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\foriginal).     While Karvelas does describe the procedures allegedly\n\nused by the hospital to submit false claims to the United States,\n\nthe alleged existence of such procedures does not permit us to\n\nspeculate that false claims were in fact submitted.            See, e.g.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Walsh v. Eastman Kodak Co., 98 F. Supp. 2d\n\n141, 147-48 (D. Mass. 2000) (dismissing complaint under Rule 9(b)\n\nwhere relator set out a methodology by which the defendants might\n\nhave produced false claims without citing an actual false claim).\n\nAs the district court correctly concluded, Karvelas's failure to\n\nidentify with particularity any actual false claims that the\n\ndefendants submitted to the government is, ultimately, fatal to his\n\ncomplaint.19\n\nD.   Retaliation Claim\n\n          Karvelas    argues   that   the   district   court   improperly\n\ndismissed Count IV of his complaint for failure to state a claim of\n\nretaliation under 31 U.S.C. § 3720(h).20      Congress added 31 U.S.C.\n\n\n     19\n      Because we conclude that Karvelas has             not stated with\nspecificity allegations of actual false claims         submitted to the\ngovernment, we need not consider the adequacy          of his pleadings\nconcerning the defendants' alleged \"schemes\" or        failure to comply\nwith patient care standards.\n     20\n      The defendants urged the district court to reject Karvelas's\nretaliation claim on res judicata grounds because the court had\npreviously dismissed a similar claim filed by Karvelas against the\ndefendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. See Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Civ. No. 00-\n10991 (D. Mass. May 5, 2000). Although it acknowledged that there\nis circuit authority for the proposition that a Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal has res judicata effect, the court declined to dismiss\nthe case on that ground because its order of dismissal in the\n\n                                 -29-\n\f§ 3730(h) to the False Claims Act in 1986 to protect employees who\n\npursue, investigate, or contribute to an action exposing fraud\n\nagainst the government.     This section provides:\n\n     Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended,\n     threatened,   harassed,    or   in   any   other   manner\n     discriminated against in the terms and conditions of\n     employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts\n     done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others\n     in furtherance of an action under this section, including\n     investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or\n     assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this\n     section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to\n     make the employee whole. . . .\n\n\n31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).     To prevail on a False Claims Act retaliation\n\nclaim, a plaintiff must show that 1) the employee's conduct was\n\nprotected under the FCA; 2) the employer knew that the employee was\n\nengaged   in   such   conduct;   and   3)    the   employer   discharged   or\n\ndiscriminated against the employee because of his or her protected\n\nconduct. See, e.g, McKenzie v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 219 F.3d\n\n508, 514 (6th Cir. 2000); United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard\n\nUniv., 153 F.3d 731, 736 (D.C. Cir. 1998).           Once the employee has\n\nestablished a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to\n\nthe employer to prove that the employee would have been terminated\n\nor subjected to other adverse action even if he or she had not\n\nengaged in the protected conduct.           Hutchins v. Wilentz, Goldman &\n\nSpitzer, 253 F.3d 176, 186 (3d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S.\n\n\n\nearlier case, entered without prejudice, had \"noted that\nplaintiff's False Claims Act litigation was in its early states.\"\n\n                                   -30-\n\f906 (2002); Yesudian, 153 F.3d at 736 n.4 (quoting S. Rep. No. 99-\n\n345, at 34, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5300).\n\n             In the instant case, the district court determined that\n\nKarvelas's complaint did not allege facts sufficient to support the\n\nsecond    element   of   his   FCA   retaliation   claim     (the   employer's\n\nknowledge that he was engaging in protected conduct).               On appeal,\n\nKarvelas argues that the district court erred in dismissing his\n\nretaliation     claim    because     his    complaint   is    \"replete    with\n\nallegations that at every stage Karvelas witnessed activities that\n\ncould lead to False Claims Act allegations, that he reported these\n\nactivities, and that he was threatened and finally terminated for\n\ndoing so.\"    For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision\n\nof the district court, although on somewhat different grounds.21\n\n             In order to satisfy the first element of a cause of\n\naction under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h), a plaintiff must demonstrate that\n\nhe or she engaged in activity protected under the FCA.                    This\n\nelement of a retaliation claim does not require the plaintiff to\n\n\n     21\n      In his complaint, Karvelas states that \"throughout [his]\nemployment at Melrose-Wakefield, he complained to management about\ndeficiencies in the care and about the activities hereinbefore\nrelated within his department and throughout the Hospital.\" He\nexplains in his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss\nthat the phrase, \"hereinbefore related,\" includes every allegation\npled in the prior paragraphs of his complaint. We agree with the\ndistrict court that \"it is not sufficient to plead in this\nparagraph that '[Karvelas] complained to management about' each\nactivity pled in the previous 458 paragraphs\" and, like the\ndistrict court, we consider only those allegations that concern\nKarvelas's interactions and communications with his employers and\nactivities that were the subject of those communications.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fhave filed an FCA lawsuit or to have developed a winning claim at\n\nthe time of the alleged retaliation.     See Yesudian, 153 F.3d at\n\n741.   Rather, an employee's conduct is protected where it involves\n\n\"acts done . . . in furtherance of\" an FCA action.      31 U.S.C. §\n\n3730(h). The statute's legislative history states that \"protection\n\nshould extend not only to actual qui tam litigants, but those who\n\nassist or testify for the litigant, as well as those who assist the\n\nGovernment in bringing a false claims action.   Protected activity\n\nshould therefore be interpreted broadly.\" S. Rep. No. 99-345, at\n\n34, reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5299.\n\n           Courts have adopted various standards for determining\n\nwhether conduct is \"in furtherance\" of an action under the FCA.\n\nSome have said that a \"plaintiff must be investigating matters\n\nwhich are calculated, or reasonably could lead, to a viable FCA\n\naction.\"   Hopper, 91 F.3d at 1269; see Yesudian, 153 F.3d at 740.\n\nSome have found that activity is protected under § 3730(h) where\n\nlitigation was \"a distinct possibility\" at the time that the\n\nemployee made his or her disclosures to the employer.    See, e.g.,\n\nChildree v. UAP/GA AG Chem., Inc., 92 F.3d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.\n\n1996); Neal v. Honeywell, Inc., 33 F.3d 860, 864 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\nTwo circuits have drawn on Title VII's anti-retaliation provision,\n\nrequiring the fact finder to determine that the plaintiff had a\n\ngood faith and objectively reasonable belief that the defendant was\n\ncommitting fraud against the government.     Wilkins v. St. Louis\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fHous. Auth., 314 F.3d 927, 933 (8th Cir. 2002); Moore v. Cal. Inst.\n\nof Tech. Jet Propulsion Lab., 275 F.3d 838, 845 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\nAlthough there is no particular magic in the word choice, we follow\n\nthe approach    of   the    Fifth   Circuit   and   interpret   \"conduct   in\n\nfurtherance of an action under the FCA\" as conduct that reasonably\n\ncould lead to a viable FCA action.          We think this standard is most\n\nconsistent with the broad interpretation for protected activity\n\nunder § 3730(h) urged by the legislative history, and we apply it\n\nhere.\n\n          Karvelas argues that his complaint includes numerous\n\n\"allegations to show that [he] witnessed and reported problems that\n\ncould reasonably lead to False Claim Act cases.\"           For example, he\n\nargues that he alleged engagement in protected activity when he\n\nclaimed that:\n\n     While still an employee of the Hospital, [he] pointed out\n     to his superiors all the way up to the president, the\n     inadequate staffing, inconsistent administration of\n     treatment orders, the absence of blood gas quality\n     control,   and   inappropriate   documentation   in   the\n     administration of care and treatment of patients\n     throughout the Hospital, as well as the failure to meet\n     regulatory standards which are required for reimbursement\n     by Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWe do not agree with Karvelas that such activities constitute\n\nprotected activity.        It is true that Karvelas need not have known\n\nthat his actions could lead to a qui tam suit under the FCA, or\n\neven that a False Claims Act existed, in order to demonstrate that\n\nhe engaged in protected conduct.            See Yesudian, 153 F.3d at 741\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\f(holding       that      \"even     an   investigation            conducted           without\n\ncontemplation – or knowledge of the legal possibility of – a False\n\nClaims Act suit can end up being 'in furtherance' of such an\n\naction\").      However, conduct protected by the FCA is limited to\n\nactivities that \"reasonably could lead\" to an FCA action; in other\n\nwords, investigations, inquiries, testimonies or other activities\n\nthat    concern     the    employer's       knowing      submission       of    false       or\n\nfraudulent claims for payment to the government.                        See id. at 740.\n\nKarvelas's statement that he reported his supervisors' destruction\n\nof incident reports of medical errors suggests a cover-up of\n\nregulatory failures but does not allege investigation or reporting\n\nof     false   or     fraudulent     claims       knowingly       submitted      to        the\n\ngovernment.       Although \"[c]orrecting regulatory problems may be a\n\nlaudable goal,\" it is \"not actionable under the FCA in the absence\n\nof   actual    fraudulent        conduct.\"    Hopper,      91    F.3d    at    1269;       see\n\nMcKenzie, 219 F.3d at 516 (noting that while internal reporting may\n\nbe protected activity under the FCA, \"the internal reports must\n\nallege fraud        on    the   government\").           Similarly,      nearly       all    of\n\nKarvelas's     statements        concerning       his    alleged     activities,           the\n\ndefendants'       alleged       knowledge    of    those    activities,          and       the\n\ndefendants'       alleged       retaliation       against       Karvelas       for     those\n\nactivities suggest that Karvelas witnessed and reported problems\n\nconcerning the hospital's alleged failure to comply with patient\n\n\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fcare standards.     Such conduct, without more, does not constitute\n\nprotected conduct under the FCA.22\n\n     At two points in his complaint, however, Karvelas does suggest\n\nthat he investigated and reported to his employer problems with\n\nimproper billing.    First, he states:\n\n          112. The Relator John C. Karvelas also complained\n     about directives from his immediate supervisor to\n     complete patient evaluations even if the patients had\n     been discharged or had died.      These evaluations were\n     billed at $150.00 each, which included inpatient and\n     outpatient, and which were not reimbursable items, but\n     yet were billed to Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. Karvelas'\n     supervisor in the Respiratory Therapy department, Anthony\n     Dichiara,   threatened    Respiratory   Therapists   with\n     retaliation if they failed to participate in this illegal\n     activity.\n\n\nHe later claims that:\n\n          174. Medicare requires accurate reporting of\n     financial information on cost reports and credit\n     balances. 42 C.F.R. § 413.20. And under 42 U.S.C. §\n     1320a-7a(a)(1)(A) the defendants knowingly filed improper\n     claims in that they presented claims for medical items or\n     service that they knew were not provided as claimed.\n     Under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a(a)(1)(A) the defendant\n     Hospital filed claims that were based on codes that the\n     defendant knew would result in greater payments than what\n     an appropriate code would have provided.\n          175. The Hospital acknowledged that it knew of the\n     problem when Relator John C. Karvelas reported it\n\n\n\n     22\n      Where an employee has not engaged in conduct protected under\nthe FCA, he cannot meet the second and third elements of an FCA\nretaliation claim, as those depend upon the first.      See, e.g.,\nYesudian, 153 F.3d at 743     (explaining that \"grumbling to the\nemployer about job dissatisfaction or regulatory violations\" does\nnot demonstrate that the plaintiff's employer was aware of the\nprotected activity, \"just as it does not constitute protected\nactivity in the first place\").\n\n                                -35-\n\f      internally, but still         the   Hospital   failed    to   take\n      corrective action.\n\n\nAlthough too vague to meet the Rule 9(b) pleading standards for a\n\nqui   tam   action,23   these   paragraphs    allege    that   Karvelas    was\n\ninvestigating    and    reporting   the    hospital's   fraudulent    billing\n\npractices rather than merely its noncompliance with state or\n\nfederal regulations.24      The district court, however, found that\n\nthese particular allegations failed to state an FCA retaliation\n\nclaim because \"the fact that [Karvelas] reported these problems\n\ndoes not mean that he gave notice to his employer that he was\n\nconducting an investigation of the hospital's billing practices as\n\na precursor to a False Claims Act proceeding.\"            We disagree with\n\nthis analysis.25\n\n\n      23\n         A retaliation claim under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h) does not\nrequire a showing of fraud and therefore need not meet the\nheightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). See, e.g., United\nStates ex rel. Barrett v. Columbia/HCA Health Care Corp., 251 F.\nSupp. 2d 28, 38 (D.D.C. 2003) (\"While [plaintiffs'] complaint\ninartfully and inadequately pleads the FCA causes of action . . .,\nthat does not dictate a 12(b)(6) dismissal of the retaliation\ndischarge based on the well-pleaded facts underlying those causes\nof action.\").\n      24\n       As we are required to make all reasonable inferences in\nfavor of the plaintiff in considering a 12(b)(6) motion, we\nconstrue paragraph 112 to allege that Karvelas complained about the\nfraudulent billing of unnecessary patient evaluations as well as\nabout the evaluations themselves.\n      25\n       We do not read the language of the district court to suggest\nthat Karvelas was required to notify the Hospital that his\ninvestigation was in fact a \"precursor to\" an FCA case. For the\nreasons we explain, such a holding would be incorrect as a matter\nof law. As the district court itself recognized, a \"defendant need\n\n                                    -36-\n\f       To meet the knowledge element of an FCA retaliation claim,\n\n\"the   whistleblower     must   show    the   employer    had   knowledge     the\n\nemployee engaged in 'protected activity.'\"               S. Rep. No. 99-345,\n\nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5300.                 In other words, the\n\nemployer must be on notice that the employee is engaged in conduct\n\nthat \"reasonably could lead to a False Claims Act case.\" Yesudian,\n\n153 F.3d at 742.    However, just as the plaintiff is not required to\n\nknow that his investigation reasonably could lead specifically to\n\na False Claims Act action, the employer need not know that the\n\nemployee has filed or plans to file a qui tam action, nor even\n\nnecessarily be aware of the existence of the FCA. See Yesudian, 153\n\nF.3d at 742.    Instead, \"the kind of knowledge the defendant must\n\nhave mirrors the kind of activity in which the plaintiff must be\n\nengaged.\" Id. (explaining that \"[a] plaintiff who need not even\n\nhave heard of the FCA can hardly be required to inform his\n\nsupervisor   that   he   'intend[s]      to   utilize    his    allegations    in\n\nfurtherance of' an action under that Act.\").               What the employer\n\nmust know is that the plaintiff is engaged in protected conduct,\n\nthat is, investigation or other activity concerning false of\n\n\n\n\nnot know, or be advised, that [the false or fraudulent claims\ninvestigated by the employee] would violate the False Claims Act\nitself.\" Yesudian, 153 F.3d at 742.\n\n                                       -37-\n\ffraudulent claims that the employer knowingly presented to the\n\nfederal government.    See, e.g., id. 742; Hopper, 91 F.3d at 1269.26\n\n      Thus, to satisfy the knowledge element of § 3730(h), Karvelas\n\nmust show that the defendants knew that he was investigating the\n\nHospital's knowing presentation of false or fraudulent claims for\n\npayment to the government.        Karvelas alleged, in paragraph 112 of\n\nhis   complaint,   that      he    reported   the    hospital's     knowing\n\nfalsification of evaluations of dead or discharged patients and its\n\nillegal billing to Medicare and Medicaid for those evaluations. In\n\nparagraph 174, he stated that he reported internally that hospital\n\nofficials \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented\n\nclaims for medical treatments they knew were not provided as\n\nclaimed.\"     Taking these allegations as true, it appears that\n\nKarvelas    notified   his   employers     about    the   results   of   his\n\n\n      26\n      Some courts have held that employees who investigate\ngovernment billings or payments as part of their job duties must\n\"make it clear that the employee's actions go beyond the assigned\ntask\" in order to demonstrate that they were engaged in protected\nconduct and their employers were on notice of that conduct. United\nStates ex rel. Eberhardt v. Integ. Design & Constr., Inc., 167 F.3d\n861, 868 (4th Cir. 1999); Brandon v. Anesthesia & Pain Mgmt.\nAssoc., 277 F.3d 936, 945 (7th Cir. 2002) (stating that where\nplaintiff's job responsibilities included ensuring that hospital\nbilling practices complied with Medicare regulations, \"the fact\nthat Brandon was alerting his supervisors to the possibility of\ntheir non-compliance with the rules would not necessarily put them\non notice that he was planning to take a far more aggressive step\nand bring a qui tam action against them or report their conduct to\nthe government\"). Because Karvelas's job duties did not involve\ninvestigating government payments or billings, he need not meet the\nheightened requirements for employees whose job descriptions do\ninclude such responsibilities in order to establish a § 3730(h)\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                    -38-\n\finvestigation concerning false claims for payment that the hospital\n\nknowingly submitted to the government. These representations did\n\nnot simply report noncompliance with federal regulations, see\n\nHopper, 91 F.3d at 1269, or complain of improper billing in\n\naccordance with Karvelas's job responsibilities, see Eberhardt, 167\n\nF.3d at 867-68.27     By notifying his employers about fraudulent\n\nclaims for payment that the Hospital knowingly submitted to the\n\ngovernment, Karvelas provided notice of protected conduct under the\n\nFCA. Therefore, we find that Karvelas has alleged facts sufficient\n\nto support an inference that he engaged in protected conduct under\n\nthe FCA and that the defendants were put on notice of that conduct.\n\nSee Carroll, 294 F.3d at 241 (explaining that a complaint will\n\nwithstand   a   12(b)(6)   motion   to   dismiss   if   it   \"alleges   facts\n\nsufficient to make out a cognizable claim\").\n\n     However, in order to state a claim for retaliation, Karvelas\n\nmust also allege that he was terminated because of his protected\n\nconduct.    See S. Rep.      No. 99-345, at 35, reprinted in 1986\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 5300 (stating that the employee must show that \"the\n\nretaliation was motivated, at least in part, by the employee's\n\nengaging in protected activity\").          At the end of his complaint,\n\n\n     27\n       Moreover, Karvelas alleges that he told his employers about\nthe submission of claims that were in fact fraudulent, in contrast\nto the claims reported by the employee in Luckey v. Baxter, 183\nF.3d 730, 732 (7th Cir. 1999)(noting that \"only in Humpty Dumpty's\nworld of word games would anyone apply the label 'fraud' to the\nkind of representations Baxter made\"). Therefore, we disagree with\nthe district court that Luckey is controlling here.\n\n                                    -39-\n\fKarvelas states generally the appropriate elements of a retaliation\n\ncause of action, claiming that the defendants retaliated against\n\nhim because of his investigation of the hospital's FCA violations.28\n\nHowever, his complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support\n\nthis third element of his retaliation claim.\n\n       As we have observed, under the \"notice\" pleading standard of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a complaint should include \"a\n\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n\nentitled to relief,\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), and therefore need not\n\ninclude detailed pleading of the facts. However, while a complaint\n\n\"need not include evidentiary detail,\" it must nonetheless \"allege\n\na     factual     predicate       concrete       enough   to     warrant    further\n\nproceedings.\"         DM Research, Inc. v. College of Am. Pathologists,\n\n170    F.3d     53,   55   (1st    Cir.    1999)(noting        that   \"[c]onclusory\n\nallegations in a complaint, if they stand alone, are a danger sign\n\nthat the plaintiff is engaged in a fishing expedition\").                      Thus,\n\neven under the liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8(a), a\n\n\n\n       28\n      The complaint states that \"Defendant Melrose-Wakefield\ndischarged John Karvelas in retaliation for his investigation of\nthe defendants' violations of its Government contracts under\nMedicaid and Medicare and its False Claims Act violations.\"\nApplying the language of § 3730(h), it further claims that \"Relator\nJohn Karvelas was discriminated against in his termination by\nDefendant Melrose-Wakefield Hospital by and through its officers,\nagents, and employees, because of lawful acts done by him in the\nfurtherance of an action under the False Claims Act, including his\nparticipation in the investigation of an action under the False\nClaims Act and his reporting to the United States Government the\nfraudulent actions of the defendants.\"\n\n                                          -40-\n\fplaintiff must \"set forth factual allegations, either direct or\n\ninferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain\n\nrecovery under some actionable legal theory.\"              Gooley v. Mobil Oil\n\nCorp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).              Simply parroting the\n\nlanguage of a statutory cause of action, without providing some\n\nfactual support, is not sufficient to state a claim.                 See Arruda,\n\n310 F.3d at 18 (affirming that we do not credit claims made in a\n\ncomplaint     if   they   are    \"bald      assertions\"    or   \"unsupportable\n\nconclusions.\").\n\n       In his complaint, Karvelas alleges that his supervisor\n\nretaliated against him by falsely accusing him of improper conduct\n\nbecause he had told her boss about unsafe conditions and the lack\n\nof a back-up support system in the Respiratory Therapy Department.\n\nHe further states that he was fired after returning from a meeting\n\nwith senior management of the hospital, at which he reported\n\n\"defective ABG testing run on a fetus\" by another respiratory\n\ntherapist.    Karvelas \"told his manager, Ms. Hyland-Miller, what he\n\nhad done\" and informed her about \"the data he had collected, his\n\nvisits with Drs. Sen and Lilly, and the failure of the Hospital to\n\nmeet patient-care standards.\" He was fired on the spot. According\n\nto the complaint, Karvelas was subsequently informed by letter that\n\nhe   had   been    discharged    because     of   \"inappropriate     behavior,\"\n\nincluding reporting \"alleged unsafe conditions at the Hospital\" to\n\na    member   of   a   state    senator's    staff.       However,    as   noted,\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\finvestigations of allegedly unsafe conditions or noncompliance with\n\npatient care standards do not constitute protected conduct under\n\nthe FCA.     Nowhere in his complaint does Karvelas allege a factual\n\npredicate concrete enough to support his conclusory statement that\n\nhe was retaliated against because of conduct protected under the\n\nFCA.     Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly\n\ndismissed Count IV of Karvelas's complaint for failure to state a\n\nclaim of retaliation under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(h).\n\nE.     Dismissal with Prejudice and Without Leave to Amend\n\n        Karvelas argues that even if his complaint failed to meet the\n\npleading obligations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the\n\ndistrict court nonetheless erred when it dismissed his case with\n\nprejudice and without affording him an opportunity to amend his\n\ncomplaint.     We disagree.\n\n        First, we reject Karvelas's argument that \"a ruling on a\n\n12(b)(6) motion is not a ruling on the merits; [but rather] only a\n\nnon-merits ruling on the propriety of the pleadings.\"        It is well\n\nsettled in this circuit that dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is a final decision on the\n\nmerits.     Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22 F.3d 384, 388 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    As we have explained, \"the dismissal of the complaint\n\nfits comfortably under the Supreme Court's definition of a 'final\n\ndecision' . . . as one that 'ends the litigation on the merits and\n\nleaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.'\" Id.\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\f(quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 373-\n\n74 (1981)).    Moreover, in the absence of a clear statement to the\n\ncontrary, a dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is\n\npresumed to be with prejudice. See Andrews-Clarke v. Lucent Tech.,\n\nInc., 157 F. Supp. 2d 93, 99 (D. Mass 2001)(\"A dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim is a dismissal on the merits . . . . This\n\ntype of dismissal, presumed to be with prejudice unless the order\n\nexplicitly states otherwise, has a claim preclusive effect.\"); c.f.\n\nMirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 628 (1st Cir. 2000)(\"In\n\nthis circuit, the phrase 'without prejudice,' when attached to a\n\ndismissal order, is . . . to be read . . . as a signification that\n\nthe judgment does not preclude a subsequent lawsuit on the same\n\ncause of action either in the rendering court or in some other\n\nforum.\").    Thus, in dismissing with prejudice Karvelas's complaint\n\nunder Rule    12(b)(6),   the   district   court   did   not   depart   from\n\nestablished precedent but simply stated explicitly what in any\n\nevent would have been presumed.\n\n     Similarly, the district court did not err by failing to invite\n\nKarvelas to amend his complaint prior to dismissing the case with\n\nprejudice.    Although the denial of a motion to amend is reviewed\n\nonly for abuse of discretion, \"district courts do not customarily\n\naim to defeat valid claims.\"       Eastern Food Servs. v. Pontifical\n\nCatholic Univ. Servs. Assoc., Inc., No. 02-2391, at 14-15 (1st Cir.\n\nJan. 20, 2004).     Some courts have, in their discretion, allowed\n\n\n                                  -43-\n\frelators to amend FCA complaints to cure a lack of particularity.\n\nSee, e.g., United States ex rel. McCoy v. Calif. Med. Rev., Inc.,\n\n723 F. Supp. 1363, 1366 (N.D. Cal. 1989).\n\n     In this case, however, Karvelas never filed a motion to amend\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), which provides for amendments as\n\nof right in the absence of a responsive pleading.29   Therefore, the\n\nonly issue before us is whether the district court erred in failing\n\nsua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend before\n\ndismissing his complaint with prejudice.30      Absent exceptional\n\n\n     29\n       A motion to dismiss is not considered a responsive pleading.\nSee Leonard v. Parry, 219 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2000).\n     30\n      The defendants argue that because Karvelas never moved for\nleave to amend, the issue of whether the district court erred by\ndenying such a request is not before this court. We agree. See\nDartmouth Rev. v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 23 (1st Cir.\n1989)(holding that \"the question of whether it might have been\nerror for the court to have denied leave to amend is not before us,\nbecause plaintiffs never requested it\")(quotation marks omitted).\nHowever, Karvelas does not argue that the district court erred in\ndenying a request to amend, but rather that it erred by failing sua\nsponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend, or notice that\nhis pleadings were deficient, before dismissing the case with\nprejudice. This question is properly before us. Moreover, we do\nnot agree with the defendants that Karvelas waived this argument\nbecause he did not seek amendment after the dismissal by moving for\nreconsideration or relief from the judgment.      A dismissal with\nprejudice is a final judgment that \"slam[s] the door shut on the\npossibility of future amendments to the complaint\" unless the\njudgment is set aside or vacated pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60.\nMirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 629 (1st Cir. 2000).\nMotions for post-judgment relief and direct appeal thus provide two\nseparate avenues through which a plaintiff may challenge the\ndismissal of a complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend.\nSee Acevedo-Villalobos, 22 F.3d at 389 (\"Where, as here, a\ncomplaint is dismissed without leave to amend, the plaintiff can\nappeal the judgment or, alternatively, seek leave to amend under\nRule 15(a) after having the judgment reopened under either Rule 59\n\n                               -44-\n\fcircumstances, a district court has no obligation to invite a\n\nplaintiff to amend his or her complaint when the plaintiff has not\n\nsought such amendment.        See Emerito Estrada Rivera-Isuzu de P.R.\n\nInc. v. Consumers Union, 233 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding\n\nthat district court did not commit error by \"failing to invite\n\nEmerito    to   replead\"    where    \"despite   its    awareness     that    [the\n\ndefendant] had called for dismissal [for failure to state a claim\n\nbased on deficient pleadings], Emerito never amended its complaint\n\nas of right . . . nor did it formally ask the district court after\n\njudgment to permit such an amendment\")(emphasis in the original);\n\nsee also    Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541,\n\n542 (11th Cir. 2002)(\"A district court is not required to grant a\n\nplaintiff   leave   to     amend    his   complaint   sua   sponte    when   the\n\nplaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to\n\namend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\").\n\nIn this case, Karvelas chose not to file a motion to amend his\n\ncomplaint at any stage of the litigation.             Instead, he stood upon\n\nhis 93-page complaint, even after the defendants filed a 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss that focused on deficiencies in the pleadings.31\n\nIndeed, the district court had already afforded Karvelas a generous\n\nopportunity to sharpen his pleadings when it did not dismiss with\n\n\nor 60.\").\n     31\n      As the defendants point out, the government's decision not\nto intervene in the action also suggested that Karvelas's pleadings\nof fraud were potentially inadequate.\n\n                                      -45-\n\fprejudice the plaintiff's first FCA retaliation complaint against\n\nthe defendants.      Under these circumstances, the district court did\n\nnot err by failing sua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to\n\namend his complaint before dismissing the case with prejudice.32\n\n                                    III.\n\n     Karvelas filed in the district court a 93-page complaint\n\nalleging that the defendants violated the False Claims Act and\n\ndescribing sixteen fraudulent \"schemes\" in which they allegedly\n\nparticipated.    The complaint includes some detail about the nature\n\nof these schemes and about the defendants' alleged failure to\n\ncomply with patient care standards.            However, in the 93 pages of\n\nthis lengthy document, we find no allegation, pled with adequate\n\nspecificity,    of   a   false   claim   for   payment   that   was   actually\n\npresented to the government.             See Clausen, 290 F.3d at 1312\n\n(upholding dismissal of FCA qui tam complaint where \"nowhere in the\n\nblur of facts and documents assembled by [the relator] regarding\n\nsix alleged testing schemes [could] one find any allegation, stated\n\n\n     32\n       We conclude that the district court did not err in failing\nsua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend without\nreferring to a specific standard of review. We do that because,\nfrankly, our cases seem inconsistent in their choice of the\nstandard of review applicable to such cases, reviewing for abuse of\ndiscretion, see Romani, 929 F.2d at 878; plain error, see Emerito,\n233 F.3d at 30; and the interest of justice, see Dartmouth Rev.\n889 F.2d at 23. We need not resolve this issue here. Under any\nstandard of review, the district court did not err in dismissing\nKarvelas's complaint with prejudice and without granting leave to\namend.\n\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\fwith particularity, of a false claim actually being submitted to\n\nthe Government\").     The law is clear that the False Claims Act\n\nattaches liability to the submission of false claims for payment,\n\nnot to the underlying fraudulent activity or other wrongful conduct\n\non which those claims were based.    See Rivera, 55 F.3d at 709.       The\n\ndistrict   court   correctly   recognized   this   difference   when    it\n\ndismissed Karvelas's complaint.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\f",

On appeal, Karvelas complains that the court wrongly applied the particularity pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) for averments in fraud to this FCA case. He further argues that the court wrongfully dismissed his claim of retaliation by the defendants for conduct protected by the FCA. After examining the issues raised by this appeal, some of which have not been addressed before in this circuit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John C. Karvelas was employed as a respiratory therapist at the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital in Melrose, Massachusetts, from 1982 until January 1997. He claims that from 1994 until the termination of his employment at the hospital in 1997, the defendants knowingly submitted false claims to the United States government in order to obtain Medicare and Medicaid payments, in violation of the False Claims Act.

Karvelas claims that a complaint stating a violation of the False Claims Act need not comply with Rule 9(b). He argues in the alternative that Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirements should be relaxed in his case. Finally, Karvelas claims that even if we do not relax these requirements, his complaint alleges fraud with sufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b). After first describing generally the requirements of Rule 9(b), we address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the general pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a federal civil complaint need only state \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). However, the federal rules recognize limited exceptions to Rule 8(a)'s simplified pleading standard. For example, claims of fraud are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which provides: \"In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind may be averred generally.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said that Rule 9(b) requires that a plaintiff's averments of fraud specify the time, place, and content of the alleged false or fraudulent representations. <i>Arruda,</i> 310 F.3d at 18-19. The purpose of this requirement is to \"give notice to defendants of the plaintiffs' claim, to protect defendants whose reputation may be harmed by meritless claims of fraud, to discourage `strike suits,' and to prevent the filing of suits that simply hope to uncover relevant information during discovery.\" <i>Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 103 F.3d 186, 194 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that, under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff may make allegations of fraud on the basis of personal knowledge or on \"information and belief.\" <i>New England Data Services, Inc. v. Becher,</i> 829 F.2d 286, 288 (1st Cir.1987). Hence, such \"information and belief\" allegations remain subject to the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). Moreover, allegations of fraud made on information and belief are also subject to the additional requirement that \"the complaint set[] forth the facts on which the belief is founded.\" <i>Id.; see also In re. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"this circuit imposed a strict requirement [on security fraud allegations based on information and belief] under 9(b) before enactment of the PSLRA [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]\")(citing <i>Romani v.

Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), which held that employment discrimination claims are not subject to a heightened pleading standard. Karvelas's reliance on <i>Swierkiewicz</i> is misplaced. It is true that the Court held in <i>Swierkiewicz</i> that \"Rule 8(a)'s simplified pleading standard applies to all civil actions, with limited exceptions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 513, 122 S.Ct. 992. However, it expressly noted that one such exception is Rule 9(b), which \"provides for greater particularity in all averments of <i>fraud</i> or mistake.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Unit,</i> 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993) (noting that Rule 9(b) imposes a particularity requirement on the pleading of fraud or mistake).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree with Karvelas that \"the False Claims Act is not a `fraud' statute\" and therefore does not fall within the scope of Rule 9(b). Section 3729(a)(1) of the FCA imposes civil penalties when a person knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the government \"a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\" 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3729(a)(1). Section 3729(a)(3) prohibits any conspiracy \"to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3729(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the 1986 FCA Amendments and the Supreme Court's interpretations of the statute further support the conclusion that FCA claims involve \"averments of fraud\" that must be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b). <i>See, e.g., Vt. Agency of Natural Res.,</i> 529 U.S. at 781 n. 10, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (noting \"the unobjectional proposition ... that the FCA was intended to cover all types of <i>fraud</i>\") (emphasis in the original); <i>United States v. Neifert-White Co.,</i> 390 U.S. 228, 233, 88 S.Ct. 959, 19 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1968)(\"[The FCA] protect[s] the funds and property of the Government from fraudulent claims\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>United States v. Bornstein,</i> 423 U.S. 303, 309, 96 S.Ct. 523, 46 L.Ed.2d 514 (1976) (explaining that the FCA was originally enacted to stop \"the massive frauds perpetrated by large contractors during the Civil War\"); S.Rep. No. 99-345, at 6, <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5271 (describing the FCA as \"a civil remedy designed to make the Government whole for fraud losses\"). In short, \"[i]t is self-evident that the FCA is an anti-fraud statute.\" <i>Gold v. Morrison-Knudsen Co.,</i> 68 F.3d 1475, 1476 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we reject Karvelas's argument that the False Claims Act is not a \"fraud\" statute because, under the statute, \"liability depends on the defendant's knowledge, not on his fraud,\" and therefore only the second clause of Rule 9(b), which allows knowledge of fraud to be averred generally, applies. Under the FCA, liability depends upon the defendant's act (presentation of a false or fraudulent claim to the United States government) <i>and</i> mental state (knowledge, or deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information presented). That Rule 9(b) allows \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person [to be] averred generally\" does not mean that particularity requirements do not apply to FCA claims. Rather, it simply means that a qui tam relator need not plead with particularity allegations concerning defendants' knowledge, reckless disregard, or deliberate ignorance of the submission of false claims. The characterization of a state of mind, after all, does not lend itself to detailed pleading. On the other hand, the details of the actual presentation of false or fraudulent claims to the government can and must be pled with particularity in order to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, every circuit court that has addressed this issue has concluded that the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) apply to claims brought under the FCA. <i>See Yuhasz v.

The applicability of Rule 9(b) to qui tam actions is by now beyond dispute.\"). For the reasons discussed above, we now join this consensus and hold that Rule 9(b) applies to claims under the FCA. Thus, the district court did not err in requiring Karvelas to plead with particularity the defendants' alleged violations of the FCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Relaxation of Rule 9(b)'s Particularity Requirements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that even if Rule 9(b) applies to FCA claims, its requirements should be relaxed in his case because the information necessary to plead with particularity is within the possession and control of the defendants. There is some confusion about the meaning of a \"relaxed rule of pleading\" under Rule 9(b). At times, Karvelas seems to equate a relaxed rule of pleading with pleading on information and belief. The district court, citing the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Thompson,</i> 125 F.3d at 903, stated that the effect of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard is that \"fraud may be pled on information and belief.\" Other courts have adopted this understanding of what it means to relax 9(b)'s pleading requirements. <i>See, e.g., Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1314; <i>United States ex rel. Russell v. Epic Healthcare,</i> 193 F.3d 304, 308 (5th Cir.1999). However, as we have already explained, see Part II. c. 1 <i>supra,</i> we subject \"information and belief\" pleading under Rule 9(b) to particularity requirements. There is, in other words, no relaxation of the particularity requirement for \"information and belief\" pleading. Instead, when we refer to the relaxation of Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirements, we refer to an opportunity for the plaintiff to plead generally at the outset and then later amend the complaint, filling in the blanks through discovery. That is the meaning of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard that we apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, we have said that Rule 9(b) pleading standards may be relaxed, in an appropriate case, \"when the opposing party is the only practical source for discovering the specific facts supporting a pleader's conclusion.\" <i>Boston &amp; Maine Corp. v. Hampton,</i> 987 F.2d 855, 866 (1st Cir.1993). In such cases, \"even for a plaintiff's allegations of fraud, if the facts would be peculiarly within the defendants' control, a court may allow some discovery before requiring that plaintiff plead individual acts of fraud with particularity.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether discovery is warranted to correct general pleadings that do not initially meet the requirements of Rule 9(b) may turn on the nature of the statute under which the plaintiff's cause of action arises. For example, we have relaxed Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements pending further discovery for allegations of mail and wire fraud pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \"because of the apparent difficulties in specifically pleading mail and wire fraud as predicate acts.\" <i>New England Data Servs.,</i> 829 F.2d at 290-91.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See North Bridge Assoc., Inc. v. Boldt,</i> 274 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir.2001)(noting that in the RICO context, where \"the specific information [concerning the defendants' use of interstate mail or telecommunications facilities] is likely in the exclusive control of the defendant, the court should make a <i>second</i> determination as to whether the claim as presented warrants the allowance of discovery and if so, thereafter provide an opportunity to amend the defective complaint\")(quoting <i>Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 942 F.2d 34, 43 (1st Cir.1991)). We have not, however, had occasion to consider whether this relaxation of Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements should be extended to cases arising under the False Claims Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although some courts have recognized in theory that the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b) may be relaxed in an FCA qui tam action where the information relevant to the fraud is \"`peculiarly within the perpetrator's knowledge,'\" <i>United States ex rel. Doe v. Dow Chem. Co.,</i> 343 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Russell,</i> 193 F.3d at 308), few courts have actually applied a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard to an FCA qui tam action. <i>See Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions,</i> &#167; 5.04[D] (noting that \"[r]arely some courts will grant <i>qui tam</i> relators `additional leeway' under Rule 9(b) when information is exclusively in the hands of the defendant\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The district court, quoting the Fifth Circuit's opinion in <i>Russell,</i> 193 F.3d at 308, refused to apply any version of a relaxed standard in this case because \"documents containing the requisite information [were] possessed by other entities, such as the Healthcare Financing Administration.\" This reasoning apparently assumes that where the required information is in the hands of the government, a relator can gain access to those documents and fill in the blanks on that basis. <i>See Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1314 n. 25 (refusing to apply a more lenient pleading standard to relator's allegations of fraud because the government had access to the relevant information and the relator was \"not without avenues for obtaining [that] information\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as Karvelas correctly notes, every FCA qui tam action involves allegations of false or fraudulent claims submitted to the government. In many of these cases, the information needed to fill the gaps of an inadequately pleaded complaint will be in the government's hands. In addition, if the relator seeks to obtain the requisite information from the government, for example by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), he or she may encounter Section 3730(e)(4) of the FCA, which prohibits qui tam actions based upon publicly disclosed allegations unless the relator is an \"original source\" of that information. 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4)(B); <i>see, e.g. United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Housing Auth.,</i> 186 F.3d 376, 383 (3d Cir.1999)(agency report prepared in response to a FOIA request is based upon publicly disclosed information for FCA purposes), <i>cert. denied,</i> 529 U.S. 1018, 120 S.Ct. 1418, 146 L.Ed.2d 310 (2000); <i>United States v. A.D. Roe Co.,</i> 186 F.3d 717, 723-24 (6th Cir.1999) (information received pursuant to a FOIA request is publicly disclosed); <i>United States ex rel. Lamers v.

The FCA defines \"original source\" as someone \"who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based,\" 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4)(B). This language excludes individuals who must rely upon information already in the possession of the government to adequately state their claim. Thus, Karvelas's argument for a relaxed pleading standard because the information he needs to plead with particularity is in the possession and control of the defendants cannot be answered by the court's suggestion that he could have obtained that information from the government prior to filing his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we do not agree with Karvelas that \"it is inherently inconsistent with the goals of the False Claims Act\" to require a qui tam relator to specify \"the time, dates, places, and identities\" of the individuals involved in the fraud or \"the specifics in the documents prepared and submitted by the defendant to obtain the funding\" at the time that the complaint is filed and prior to any additional discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The False Claims Act requires a qui tam relator to serve on the government \"[a] copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses.\" 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(b)(2). The complaint is filed in camera and remains under seal for 60 days during which time the government considers whether to intervene. <i>Id.</i> As a leading commentator has suggested, allowing a qui tam relator to amend his or her complaint after conducting further discovery would mean that \"the government will have been compelled to decide whether or not to intervene absent complete information about the relator's cause of action.\" Boese, <i>Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions</i> &#167; 4.04[C].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Thus, allowing a relator to plead generally at the outset and amend the complaint at the 12(b)(6) stage after discovery would be at odds with the FCA's procedures for filing a qui tam action and its protections for the government (which is, of course, the real party in interest in a qui tam action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have repeatedly refused to allow qui tam relators to rely on later discovery to comply with Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements. <i>See, e.g., Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1313 n. 24.

The reluctance of courts to permit qui tam relators to use discovery to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b) reflects, in part, a concern that a qui tam plaintiff, who has suffered no injury in fact, may be particularly likely to file suit as \"a pretext to uncover unknown wrongs.\" <i>United States ex rel.

Therefore, the defendant's presentation of false or fraudulent claims to the government is a central element of every False Claims Act case. A health care provider's violation of government regulations or engagement in private fraudulent schemes does not impose liability under the FCA unless the provider submits false or fraudulent claims to the government for payment based on these wrongful activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1311 (\"Without the <i>presentment</i> of [a false or fraudulent] claim, while the practices of an entity that provides services to the Government may be unwise or improper, there is simply no actionable damage to the public fisc as required under the False Claims Act.\")(emphasis in the original); <i>United States ex rel.

Underlying schemes and other wrongful activities that result in the submission of fraudulent claims are included in the \"circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\" that must be pled with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b). However, such pleadings invariably are inadequate unless they are linked to allegations, stated with particularity, of the actual false claims submitted to the government that constitute the essential element of an FCA qui tam action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As applied to the FCA, Rule 9(b)'s requirement that averments of fraud be stated with particularity &#8212; specifying the \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged false or fraudulent representations, means that a relator must provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In a case such as this, details concerning the dates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted, their identification numbers, the amount of money charged to the government, the particular goods or services for which the government was billed, the individuals involved in the billing, and the length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the submission of claims based on those practices are the types of information that may help a relator to state his or her claims with particularity. These details do not constitute a checklist of mandatory requirements that must be satisfied by each allegation included in a complaint. However, like the Eleventh Circuit, we believe that \"some of this information for at least some of the claims must be pleaded in order to satisfy Rule 9(b).\" <i>Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1312 n. 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In describing at considerable length the defendants' sixteen schemes to defraud the government, the complaint alleges that the defendants submitted false claims to the federal government, including cost reports that were falsely certified as complete, true, and correct. It states that the defendants wrongfully billed Medicare and Medicaid, and refers generally to false confirming orders and progress notes. However, the complaint never specifies the dates or content of any particular false or fraudulent claim allegedly submitted for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid. It provides no identification numbers or amounts charged in individual claims for specific tests, supplies, or services. It does not identify or describe the individuals involved in the improper billing or allege with particularity any certification of compliance with federal regulations in order to obtain payments. As Karvelas himself concedes in his brief to this court, his complaint \"did not set forth the specifics... of any one single cost report, or bill, or piece of paper that was sent to the Government to obtain funding.\" Nor does the complaint provide the source of information and factual basis for his conclusory allegations that the defendants submitted actual false or fraudulent claims to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in describing Scheme A, Karvelas alleges that the defendants \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented claims for medical items or service that they knew were not provided as claimed\" and \"filed claims that were based on codes that the defendants knew would result in greater payments than what an appropriate code would have provided.\" Karvelas further claims that \"staffing numbers in the Medicaid and Medicare filings were make believe throughout the entire hospital.\" However, the complaint does not specify the individuals who filed these claims, the dates on which any such claims were filed, the nature and content of any documents submitted, or the amount claimed from the government based on the particular medical items and services that were allegedly improperly provided or on the \"make believe\" staffing levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges in Scheme A that \"from 1994 to 1997 the Hospital was certifying 12 respiratory therapists when in reality the hospital had only 7 full time respiratory therapists,\" yet it provides no details concerning the particular dates and content of the alleged certification, nor, assuming that the allegation was based on information and belief, does it set forth the source of that information or the facts on which the belief was founded. Karvelas also alludes to various documents, referring to false \"Respiratory Therapist time schedules for 1994 into 1997\" and \"documents signed under the penalty of perjury and false statement submitted to the United States Government [that] certified that there were 11.8 Respiratory Therapists during this period of time.\" However, he provides no particular details about the nature of these documents or the circumstances of their submission to the United States government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With somewhat more specificity, Karvelas alleges in his discussion of Scheme B that the blood gas laboratory \"performed approximately 21,000 arterial blood gas tests (ABG's) in the three year period beginning in June, 1994 through April, 1997 at $50.00 per test.\" However, while he states that the Hospital \"billed Medicare and Medicaid for the costs of the testing on a large percentage of these patients with each bill certified to Medicare or Medicaid that the ABG laboratory had in fact complied with the CAP and CLIA standards,\" Karvelas does not specify which of the 21,000 tests were billed to the government, supply any details about the particular bills and certifications submitted, or provide a factual basis for his allegation that the defendants falsely certified compliance with federal standards in order to secure Medicare or Medicaid benefits. This lack of particularity characterizes all of Karvelas's allegations concerning the submission of false claims to the federal government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Karvelas alleges serious violations by the defendants of federal standards governing the provision of patient care. However, alleged violations of federal regulations are insufficient to support a claim under the FCA. <i>See United States ex rel. Hopper v. Anton,</i> 91 F.3d 1261, 1266 (9th Cir.1996) (\"Violations of laws, rules, or regulations alone do not create a cause of action under the FCA.\"); <i>Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1311 (\"[I]f Rule 9(b) is to be adhered to, some indicia of reliability must be given in the complaint to support the allegation of <i>an actual false claim</i> for payment being made to the Government.\") (emphasis in the original). While Karvelas does describe the procedures allegedly used by the hospital to submit false claims to the United States, the alleged existence of such procedures does not permit us to speculate that false claims were in fact submitted. <i>See, e.g. United States ex rel. Walsh v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d 141, 147-48 (D.Mass. 2000) (dismissing complaint under Rule 9(b) where relator set out a methodology by which the defendants might have produced false claims without citing an actual false claim). As the district court correctly concluded, Karvelas's failure to identify with particularity any actual false claims that the defendants submitted to the government is, ultimately, fatal to his complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Retaliation Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that the district court improperly dismissed Count IV of his complaint for failure to state a claim of retaliation under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3720(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Congress added 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h) to the False Claims Act in 1986 to protect employees who pursue, investigate, or contribute to an action exposing fraud against the government. This section provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h). To prevail on a False Claims Act retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that 1) the employee's conduct was protected under the FCA; 2) the employer knew that the employee was engaged in such conduct; and 3) the employer discharged or discriminated against the employee because of his or her protected conduct. <i>See, e.g, McKenzie v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc.,</i> 219 F.3d 508, 514 (6th Cir.2000); <i>United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard Univ.,</i> 153 F.3d 731, 736 (D.C.Cir.1998). Once the employee has established a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the employee would have been terminated or subjected to other adverse action even if he or she had not engaged in the protected conduct. <i>Hutchins v. Wilentz, Goldman &amp; Spitzer,</i> 253 F.3d 176, 186 (3d Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 906, 122 S.Ct. 2360, 153 L.Ed.2d 182 (2002); <i>Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 736 n. 4 (quoting S.Rep. No. 99-345, at 34, <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5300).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the district court determined that Karvelas's complaint did not allege facts sufficient to support the second element of his FCA retaliation claim (the employer's knowledge that he was engaging in protected conduct). On appeal, Karvelas argues that the district court erred in dismissing his retaliation claim because his complaint is \"replete with allegations that at every stage Karvelas witnessed activities that could lead to False Claims Act allegations, that he reported these activities, and that he was threatened and finally terminated for doing so.\" For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court, although on somewhat different grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to satisfy the first element of a cause of action under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h), a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she engaged in activity protected under the FCA. This element of a retaliation claim does not require the plaintiff to have filed an FCA lawsuit or to have developed a winning claim at the time of the alleged retaliation. <i>See Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 741. Rather, an employee's conduct is protected where it involves \"acts done ... in furtherance of\" an FCA action. 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h). The statute's legislative history states that \"protection should extend not only to actual qui tam litigants, but those who assist or testify for the litigant, as well as those who assist the Government in bringing a false claims action. Protected activity should therefore be interpreted broadly.\" S.Rep. No. 99-345, at 34, <i>reprinted in</i> U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5299.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have adopted various standards for determining whether conduct is \"in furtherance\" of an action under the FCA. Some have said that a \"plaintiff must be investigating matters which are calculated, or reasonably could lead, to a viable FCA action.\" <i>Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269; <i>see Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 740. Some have found that activity is protected under &#167; 3730(h) where litigation was \"a distinct possibility\" at the time that the employee made his or her disclosures to the employer. <i>See, e.g., Childree v. UAP/GA AG CHEM., Inc.,</i> 92 F.3d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.1996); <i>Neal v. Honeywell, Inc.,</i> 33 F.3d 860, 864 (7th Cir.1994). Two circuits have drawn on Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, requiring the fact finder to determine that the plaintiff had a good faith and objectively reasonable belief that the defendant was committing fraud against the government. <i>Wilkins v. St. Louis Hous. Auth.,</i> 314 F.3d 927, 933 (8th Cir.2002); <i>Moore v. Cal. Inst. of Tech. Jet Propulsion Lab.,</i> 275 F.3d 838, 845 (9th Cir.2002). Although there is no particular magic in the word choice, we follow the approach of the Fifth Circuit and interpret \"conduct in furtherance of an action under the FCA\" as conduct that reasonably could lead to a viable FCA action. We think this standard is most consistent with the broad interpretation for protected activity under &#167; 3730(h) urged by the legislative history, and we apply it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that his complaint includes numerous \"allegations to show that [he] witnessed and reported problems that could reasonably lead to False Claim Act cases.\" For example, he argues that he alleged engagement in protected activity when he claimed that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While still an employee of the Hospital, [he] pointed out to his superiors all the way up to the president, the inadequate staffing, inconsistent administration of treatment orders, the absence of blood gas quality control, and inappropriate documentation in the administration of care and treatment of patients throughout the Hospital, as well as the failure to meet regulatory standards which are required for reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree with Karvelas that such activities constitute protected activity. It is true that Karvelas need not have <i>known</i> that his actions could lead to a qui tam suit under the FCA, or even that a False Claims Act existed, in order to demonstrate that he engaged in protected conduct. <i>See Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 741 (holding that \"even an investigation conducted without contemplation &#8212; or knowledge of the legal possibility of &#8212; a False Claims Act suit can end up being `in furtherance' of such an action\"). However, conduct protected by the FCA is limited to activities that \"reasonably could lead\" to an FCA action; in other words, investigations, inquiries, testimonies or other activities that concern the employer's knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. <i>See id.</i> at 740. Karvelas's statement that he reported his supervisors' destruction of incident reports of medical errors suggests a cover-up of regulatory failures but does not allege investigation or reporting of false or fraudulent claims knowingly submitted to the government. Although \"[c]orrecting regulatory problems may be a laudable goal,\" it is \"not actionable under the FCA in the absence of actual fraudulent conduct.\" <i>Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269; <i>see McKenzie,</i> 219 F.3d at 516 (noting that while internal reporting may be protected activity under the FCA, \"the internal reports must allege fraud on the government\"). Similarly, nearly all of Karvelas's statements concerning his alleged activities, the defendants' alleged knowledge of those activities, and the defendants' alleged retaliation against Karvelas for those activities suggest that Karvelas witnessed and reported problems concerning the hospital's alleged failure to comply with patient care standards. Such conduct, without more, does not constitute protected conduct under the FCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At two points in his complaint, however, Karvelas does suggest that he investigated and reported to his employer problems with improper billing. First, he states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">112. The Relator John C. Karvelas also complained about directives from his immediate supervisor to complete patient evaluations even if the patients had been discharged or had died. These evaluations were billed at $150.00 each, which included inpatient and outpatient, and which were not reimbursable items, but yet were billed to Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. Karvelas' supervisor in the Respiratory Therapy department, Anthony Dichiara, threatened Respiratory Therapists with retaliation if they failed to participate in this illegal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">He later claims that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">174.

And under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7a(a)(1)(A) the defendants knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented claims for medical items or service that they knew were not provided as claimed. Under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7a(a)(1)(A) the defendant Hospital filed claims that were based on codes that the defendant knew would result in greater payments than what an appropriate code would have provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">175.

In other words, the employer must be on notice that the employee is engaged in conduct that \"reasonably could lead to a False Claims Act case.\" <i>Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 742. However, just as the plaintiff is not required to know that his investigation reasonably could lead specifically to a False Claims Act action, the employer need not know that the employee has filed or plans to file a qui tam action, nor even necessarily be aware of the existence of the FCA. <i>See Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 742. Instead, \"the kind of knowledge the defendant must have mirrors the kind of activity in which the plaintiff must be engaged.\" <i>Id.</i> (explaining that \"[a] plaintiff who need not even have heard of the FCA can hardly be required to inform his supervisor that he `intend[s] to utilize his allegations in furtherance of' an action under that Act.\"). What the employer must know is that the plaintiff is engaged in protected conduct, that is, investigation or other activity concerning false of fraudulent claims that the employer knowingly presented to the federal government. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 742; <i>Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to satisfy the knowledge element of &#167; 3730(h), Karvelas must show that the defendants knew that he was investigating the Hospital's knowing presentation of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Karvelas alleged, in paragraph 112 of his complaint, that he reported the hospital's knowing falsification of evaluations of dead or discharged patients and its illegal billing to Medicare and Medicaid for those evaluations. In paragraph 174, he stated that he reported internally that hospital officials \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented claims for medical treatments they knew were not provided as claimed.\" Taking these allegations as true, it appears that Karvelas notified his employers about the results of his investigation concerning false claims for payment that the hospital knowingly submitted to the government. These representations did not simply report noncompliance with federal regulations, <i>see Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269, or complain of improper billing in accordance with Karvelas's job responsibilities, <i>see Eberhardt,</i> 167 F.3d at 867-68.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> By notifying his employers about fraudulent claims for payment that the Hospital knowingly submitted to the government, Karvelas provided notice of protected conduct under the FCA. Therefore, we find that Karvelas has alleged facts sufficient to support an inference that he engaged in protected conduct under the FCA and that the defendants were put on notice of that conduct. <i>See Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 241 (explaining that a complaint will withstand a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if it \"alleges facts sufficient to make out a cognizable claim\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in order to state a claim for retaliation, Karvelas must also allege that he was terminated <i>because</i> of his protected conduct. <i>See</i> S.Rep.

At the end of his complaint, Karvelas states generally the appropriate elements of a retaliation cause of action, claiming that the defendants retaliated against him because of his investigation of the hospital's FCA violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> However, his complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support this third element of his retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have observed, under the \"notice\" pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a complaint should include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), and therefore need not include detailed pleading of the facts. However, while a complaint \"need not include evidentiary detail,\" it must nonetheless \"allege a factual predicate concrete enough to warrant further proceedings.\" <i>DM Research, Inc. v. College of Am. Pathologists,</i> 170 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.1999)(noting that \"[c]onclusory allegations in a complaint, if they stand alone, are a danger sign that the plaintiff is engaged in a fishing expedition\"). Thus, even under the liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8(a), a plaintiff must \"set forth factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.\" <i>Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st Cir.1988). Simply parroting the language of a statutory cause of action, without providing some factual support, is not sufficient to state a claim. <i>See Arruda,</i> 310 F.3d at 18 (affirming that we do not credit claims made in a complaint if they are \"bald assertions\" or \"unsupportable conclusions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Karvelas alleges that his supervisor retaliated against him by falsely accusing him of improper conduct because he had told her boss about unsafe conditions and the lack of a back-up support system in the Respiratory Therapy Department. He further states that he was fired after returning from a meeting with senior management of the hospital, at which he reported \"defective ABG testing run on a fetus\" by another respiratory therapist. Karvelas \"told his manager, Ms. Hyland-Miller, what he had done\" and informed her about \"the data he had collected, his visits with Drs. Sen and Lilly, and the failure of the Hospital to meet patient-care standards.\" He was fired on the spot. According to the complaint, Karvelas was subsequently informed by letter that he had been discharged because of \"inappropriate behavior,\" including reporting \"alleged unsafe conditions at the Hospital\" to a member of a state senator's staff. However, as noted, investigations of allegedly unsafe conditions or noncompliance with patient care standards do not constitute protected conduct under the FCA. Nowhere in his complaint does Karvelas allege a factual predicate concrete enough to support his conclusory statement that he was retaliated against because of conduct protected under the FCA. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Count IV of Karvelas's complaint for failure to state a claim of retaliation under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Dismissal with Prejudice and Without Leave to Amend</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that even if his complaint failed to meet the pleading obligations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court nonetheless erred when it dismissed his case with prejudice and without affording him an opportunity to amend his complaint. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we reject Karvelas's argument that \"a ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion is not a ruling on the merits; [but rather] only a non-merits ruling on the propriety of the pleadings.\" It is well settled in this circuit that dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is a final decision on the merits. <i>Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez,</i> 22 F.3d 384, 388 (1st Cir.1994). As we have explained, \"the dismissal of the complaint fits comfortably under the Supreme Court's definition of a `final decision' ... as one that `ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord,</i> 449 U.S. 368, 373-74, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981)). Moreover, in the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, a dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is presumed to be with prejudice. <i>See Andrews-Clarke v. Lucent Tech., Inc.,</i> 157 F.Supp.2d 93, 99 (D.Mass.2001)(\"A dismissal for failure to state a claim is a dismissal on the merits.... This type of dismissal, presumed to be with prejudice unless the order explicitly states otherwise, has a claim preclusive effect.\"); <i>c.f. Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 624, 628 (1st Cir.2000)(\"In this circuit, the phrase `without prejudice,' when attached to a dismissal order, is ... to be read ... as a signification that the judgment does not preclude a subsequent lawsuit on the same cause of action either in the rendering court or in some other forum.\"). Thus, in dismissing with prejudice Karvelas's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the district court did not depart from established precedent but simply stated explicitly what in any event would have been presumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the district court did not err by failing to invite Karvelas to amend his complaint prior to dismissing the case with prejudice. Although the denial of a motion to amend is reviewed only for abuse of discretion, \"district courts do not customarily aim to defeat valid claims.\" <i>Eastern Food Servs. v. Pontifical Catholic Univ. Servs. Assoc., Inc.,</i> 357 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004). Some courts have, in their discretion, allowed relators to amend FCA complaints to cure a lack of particularity. <i>See, e.g., United States ex rel. McCoy v. Calif. Med. Rev., Inc.,</i> 723 F.Supp. 1363, 1366 (N.D.Cal.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, Karvelas never filed a motion to amend pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which provides for amendments as of right in the absence of a responsive pleading.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> Therefore, the only issue before us is whether the district court erred in failing sua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend before dismissing his complaint with prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Absent exceptional circumstances, a district court has no obligation to invite a plaintiff to amend his or her complaint when the plaintiff has not sought such amendment. <i>See Emerito Estrada Rivera-Isuzu de P.R. Inc. v. Consumers Union,</i> 233 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that district court did not commit error by \"failing to <i>invite</i> Emerito to replead\" where \"despite its awareness that [the defendant] had called for dismissal [for failure to state a claim based on deficient pleadings], Emerito never amended its complaint as of right ... nor did it formally ask the district court after judgment to permit such an amendment\") (emphasis in the original); <i>see also Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp.,</i> 314 F.3d 541, 542 (11th Cir.2002) (\"A district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint sua sponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court.\"). In this case, Karvelas chose not to file a motion to amend his complaint at any stage of the litigation. Instead, he stood upon his 93-page complaint, even after the defendants filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss that focused on deficiencies in the pleadings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> Indeed, the district court had already afforded Karvelas a generous opportunity to sharpen his pleadings when it did not dismiss with prejudice the plaintiff's first FCA retaliation complaint against the defendants. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err by failing sua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissing the case with prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas filed in the district court a 93-page complaint alleging that the defendants violated the False Claims Act and describing sixteen fraudulent \"schemes\" in which they allegedly participated. The complaint includes some detail about the nature of these schemes and about the defendants' alleged failure to comply with patient care standards. However, in the 93 pages of this lengthy document, we find no allegation, pled with adequate specificity, of a false claim for payment that was actually presented to the government. <i>See Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1312 (upholding dismissal of FCA qui tam complaint where \"nowhere in the blur of facts and documents assembled by [the relator] regarding six alleged testing schemes [could] one find any allegation, stated with particularity, of a false claim actually being submitted to the Government\"). The law is clear that the False Claims Act attaches liability to the submission of false claims for payment, not to the underlying fraudulent activity or other wrongful conduct on which those claims were based. <i>See Rivera,</i> 55 F.3d at 709.

While we have not adopted such an exception to Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements, a few courts have found that a relaxed standard may apply to FCA qui tam complaints where the alleged conduct took place over a long period of time or involved numerous occurrences<i>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Butler v. Magellan Health Servs., Inc.,</i> 74 F.Supp.2d 1201, 1215 (M.D.Fla.1999); <i>United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare,</i> 20 F.Supp.2d 1017, 1039 (S.D.Tex.1998). Although we do not preclude the possibility of such an exception in a future case, we do not think that three years presents an exceptionally long period of time. Nor do we find any basis in the history or requirements of the FCA, or in most of the precedents, for relieving Karvelas of his burden of pleading fraud with particularity because he chose to allege sixteen complex schemes. <i>See Yuhasz,</i> 341 F.3d at 564 (\"[A] plaintiff should not be able to avoid the specificity requirements of Rule 9(b) by relying upon the complexity of the edifice which he created\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> A number of courts have also found FCA violations where a defendant falsely certifies compliance with certain conditions required as a prerequisite for a government benefit or payment in order to induce that benefit<i>See, e.g., Thompson,</i> 125 F.3d at 902.

By contrast, as we discuss below, Karvelas's complaint does not allege the particulars of any of his allegations concerning the presentation of false claims to the government, and therefore, considered as a whole, the complaint does not meet the particularity requirements of 9(b). <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 204 (finding that the absence of any of a number of enumerated \"basic details\" describing alleged PSLRA violations was \"indicative of the excessive generality of these allegations\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Indeed, with one exception, Karvelas's complaint does not specify which of the particular violations of patient care standards that Karvelas witnessed involved Medicare or Medicaid patients.

However, Karvelas does not argue that the district court erred in denying a <i>request</i> to amend, but rather that it erred by failing <i>sua sponte</i> to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend, or notice that his pleadings were deficient, before dismissing the case with prejudice. This question is properly before us. Moreover, we do not agree with the defendants that Karvelas waived this argument because he did not seek amendment after the dismissal by moving for reconsideration or relief from the judgment. A dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment that \"slam[s] the door shut on the possibility of future amendments to the complaint\" unless the judgment is set aside or vacated pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60. <i>Mirpuri v.

Motions for post-judgment relief and direct appeal thus provide two separate avenues through which a plaintiff may challenge the dismissal of a complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend. <i>See Acevedo-Villalobos,</i> 22 F.3d at 389 (\"Where, as here, a complaint is dismissed without leave to amend, the plaintiff can appeal the judgment or, alternatively, seek leave to amend under Rule 15(a) after having the judgment reopened under either Rule 59 or 60.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> As the defendants point out, the government's decision not to intervene in the action also suggested that Karvelas's pleadings of fraud were potentially inadequate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> We conclude that the district court did not err in failing sua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend without referring to a specific standard of review.

On appeal, Karvelas complains that the court wrongly applied the particularity pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) for averments in fraud to this FCA case. He further argues that the court wrongfully dismissed his claim of retaliation by the defendants for conduct protected by the FCA.

He claims that from 1994 until the termination of his employment at the hospital in 1997, the defendants knowingly submitted false claims to the United States government in order to obtain Medicare and Medicaid payments, in violation of the False Claims Act. In essence, Karvelas alleges that Melrose-Wakefield Hospital and its parent corporations failed to comply with federal standards for patient care as required by the Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. He claims that the defendants falsely certified that they were in compliance with these standards and \"wrongfully billed Medicare and/or Medicaid,\" presumably on the basis of services that were being provided improperly or not at all.

Under the FCA, liability depends upon the defendant's act (presentation of a false or fraudulent claim to the United States government) <i>and</i> mental state (knowledge, or deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information presented). That Rule 9(b) allows \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person [to be] averred generally\" does not mean that particularity requirements do not apply to FCA claims. Rather, it simply means that a qui tam relator need not plead with particularity allegations concerning defendants' knowledge, reckless disregard, or deliberate ignorance of the submission of false claims. The characterization of a state of mind, after all, does not lend itself to detailed pleading.

There is some confusion about the meaning of a \"relaxed rule of pleading\" under Rule 9(b). At times, Karvelas seems to equate a relaxed rule of pleading with pleading on information and belief. The district court, citing the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Thompson,</i> 125 F.3d at 903, stated that the effect of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard is that \"fraud may be pled on information and belief.\" Other courts have adopted this understanding of what it means to relax 9(b)'s pleading requirements. <i>See, e.g., Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1314; <i>United States ex rel.

However, as we have already explained, see Part II. c. 1 <i>supra,</i> we subject \"information and belief\" pleading under Rule 9(b) to particularity requirements. There is, in other words, no relaxation of the particularity requirement for \"information and belief\" pleading. Instead, when we refer to the relaxation of Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirements, we refer to an opportunity for the plaintiff to plead generally at the outset and then later amend the complaint, filling in the blanks through discovery. That is the meaning of a relaxed Rule 9(b) standard that we apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, we have said that Rule 9(b) pleading standards may be relaxed, in an appropriate case, \"when the opposing party is the only practical source for discovering the specific facts supporting a pleader's conclusion.\" <i>Boston &amp; Maine Corp. v.

In addition, if the relator seeks to obtain the requisite information from the government, for example by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), he or she may encounter Section 3730(e)(4) of the FCA, which prohibits qui tam actions based upon publicly disclosed allegations unless the relator is an \"original source\" of that information. 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4)(B); <i>see, e.g. United States ex rel.

The FCA defines \"original source\" as someone \"who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based,\" 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4)(B). This language excludes individuals who must rely upon information already in the possession of the government to adequately state their claim.

Therefore, the defendant's presentation of false or fraudulent claims to the government is a central element of every False Claims Act case. A health care provider's violation of government regulations or engagement in private fraudulent schemes does not impose liability under the FCA unless the provider submits false or fraudulent claims to the government for payment based on these wrongful activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1311 (\"Without the <i>presentment</i> of [a false or fraudulent] claim, while the practices of an entity that provides services to the Government may be unwise or improper, there is simply no actionable damage to the public fisc as required under the False Claims Act.\")(emphasis in the original); <i>United States ex rel.

Underlying schemes and other wrongful activities that result in the submission of fraudulent claims are included in the \"circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\" that must be pled with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b). However, such pleadings invariably are inadequate unless they are linked to allegations, stated with particularity, of the actual false claims submitted to the government that constitute the essential element of an FCA qui tam action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As applied to the FCA, Rule 9(b)'s requirement that averments of fraud be stated with particularity &#8212; specifying the \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged false or fraudulent representations, means that a relator must provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In a case such as this, details concerning the dates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted, their identification numbers, the amount of money charged to the government, the particular goods or services for which the government was billed, the individuals involved in the billing, and the length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the submission of claims based on those practices are the types of information that may help a relator to state his or her claims with particularity. These details do not constitute a checklist of mandatory requirements that must be satisfied by each allegation included in a complaint. However, like the Eleventh Circuit, we believe that \"some of this information for at least some of the claims must be pleaded in order to satisfy Rule 9(b).\" <i>Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1312 n. 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In describing at considerable length the defendants' sixteen schemes to defraud the government, the complaint alleges that the defendants submitted false claims to the federal government, including cost reports that were falsely certified as complete, true, and correct. It states that the defendants wrongfully billed Medicare and Medicaid, and refers generally to false confirming orders and progress notes. However, the complaint never specifies the dates or content of any particular false or fraudulent claim allegedly submitted for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid. It provides no identification numbers or amounts charged in individual claims for specific tests, supplies, or services. It does not identify or describe the individuals involved in the improper billing or allege with particularity any certification of compliance with federal regulations in order to obtain payments. As Karvelas himself concedes in his brief to this court, his complaint \"did not set forth the specifics... of any one single cost report, or bill, or piece of paper that was sent to the Government to obtain funding.\" Nor does the complaint provide the source of information and factual basis for his conclusory allegations that the defendants submitted actual false or fraudulent claims to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in describing Scheme A, Karvelas alleges that the defendants \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented claims for medical items or service that they knew were not provided as claimed\" and \"filed claims that were based on codes that the defendants knew would result in greater payments than what an appropriate code would have provided.\" Karvelas further claims that \"staffing numbers in the Medicaid and Medicare filings were make believe throughout the entire hospital.\" However, the complaint does not specify the individuals who filed these claims, the dates on which any such claims were filed, the nature and content of any documents submitted, or the amount claimed from the government based on the particular medical items and services that were allegedly improperly provided or on the \"make believe\" staffing levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges in Scheme A that \"from 1994 to 1997 the Hospital was certifying 12 respiratory therapists when in reality the hospital had only 7 full time respiratory therapists,\" yet it provides no details concerning the particular dates and content of the alleged certification, nor, assuming that the allegation was based on information and belief, does it set forth the source of that information or the facts on which the belief was founded. Karvelas also alludes to various documents, referring to false \"Respiratory Therapist time schedules for 1994 into 1997\" and \"documents signed under the penalty of perjury and false statement submitted to the United States Government [that] certified that there were 11.8 Respiratory Therapists during this period of time.\" However, he provides no particular details about the nature of these documents or the circumstances of their submission to the United States government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With somewhat more specificity, Karvelas alleges in his discussion of Scheme B that the blood gas laboratory \"performed approximately 21,000 arterial blood gas tests (ABG's) in the three year period beginning in June, 1994 through April, 1997 at $50.00 per test.\" However, while he states that the Hospital \"billed Medicare and Medicaid for the costs of the testing on a large percentage of these patients with each bill certified to Medicare or Medicaid that the ABG laboratory had in fact complied with the CAP and CLIA standards,\" Karvelas does not specify which of the 21,000 tests were billed to the government, supply any details about the particular bills and certifications submitted, or provide a factual basis for his allegation that the defendants falsely certified compliance with federal standards in order to secure Medicare or Medicaid benefits. This lack of particularity characterizes all of Karvelas's allegations concerning the submission of false claims to the federal government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Karvelas alleges serious violations by the defendants of federal standards governing the provision of patient care. However, alleged violations of federal regulations are insufficient to support a claim under the FCA. <i>See United States ex rel. Hopper v.

While Karvelas does describe the procedures allegedly used by the hospital to submit false claims to the United States, the alleged existence of such procedures does not permit us to speculate that false claims were in fact submitted. <i>See, e.g. United States ex rel.

This element of a retaliation claim does not require the plaintiff to have filed an FCA lawsuit or to have developed a winning claim at the time of the alleged retaliation. <i>See Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 741. Rather, an employee's conduct is protected where it involves \"acts done ... in furtherance of\" an FCA action. 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h). The statute's legislative history states that \"protection should extend not only to actual qui tam litigants, but those who assist or testify for the litigant, as well as those who assist the Government in bringing a false claims action.

Although there is no particular magic in the word choice, we follow the approach of the Fifth Circuit and interpret \"conduct in furtherance of an action under the FCA\" as conduct that reasonably could lead to a viable FCA action. We think this standard is most consistent with the broad interpretation for protected activity under &#167; 3730(h) urged by the legislative history, and we apply it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that his complaint includes numerous \"allegations to show that [he] witnessed and reported problems that could reasonably lead to False Claim Act cases.\" For example, he argues that he alleged engagement in protected activity when he claimed that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While still an employee of the Hospital, [he] pointed out to his superiors all the way up to the president, the inadequate staffing, inconsistent administration of treatment orders, the absence of blood gas quality control, and inappropriate documentation in the administration of care and treatment of patients throughout the Hospital, as well as the failure to meet regulatory standards which are required for reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree with Karvelas that such activities constitute protected activity. It is true that Karvelas need not have <i>known</i> that his actions could lead to a qui tam suit under the FCA, or even that a False Claims Act existed, in order to demonstrate that he engaged in protected conduct. <i>See Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 741 (holding that \"even an investigation conducted without contemplation &#8212; or knowledge of the legal possibility of &#8212; a False Claims Act suit can end up being `in furtherance' of such an action\"). However, conduct protected by the FCA is limited to activities that \"reasonably could lead\" to an FCA action; in other words, investigations, inquiries, testimonies or other activities that concern the employer's knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. <i>See id.</i> at 740. Karvelas's statement that he reported his supervisors' destruction of incident reports of medical errors suggests a cover-up of regulatory failures but does not allege investigation or reporting of false or fraudulent claims knowingly submitted to the government. Although \"[c]orrecting regulatory problems may be a laudable goal,\" it is \"not actionable under the FCA in the absence of actual fraudulent conduct.\" <i>Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269; <i>see McKenzie,</i> 219 F.3d at 516 (noting that while internal reporting may be protected activity under the FCA, \"the internal reports must allege fraud on the government\"). Similarly, nearly all of Karvelas's statements concerning his alleged activities, the defendants' alleged knowledge of those activities, and the defendants' alleged retaliation against Karvelas for those activities suggest that Karvelas witnessed and reported problems concerning the hospital's alleged failure to comply with patient care standards. Such conduct, without more, does not constitute protected conduct under the FCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At two points in his complaint, however, Karvelas does suggest that he investigated and reported to his employer problems with improper billing.

What the employer must know is that the plaintiff is engaged in protected conduct, that is, investigation or other activity concerning false of fraudulent claims that the employer knowingly presented to the federal government. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 742; <i>Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to satisfy the knowledge element of &#167; 3730(h), Karvelas must show that the defendants knew that he was investigating the Hospital's knowing presentation of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Karvelas alleged, in paragraph 112 of his complaint, that he reported the hospital's knowing falsification of evaluations of dead or discharged patients and its illegal billing to Medicare and Medicaid for those evaluations. In paragraph 174, he stated that he reported internally that hospital officials \"knowingly filed improper claims in that they presented claims for medical treatments they knew were not provided as claimed.\" Taking these allegations as true, it appears that Karvelas notified his employers about the results of his investigation concerning false claims for payment that the hospital knowingly submitted to the government. These representations did not simply report noncompliance with federal regulations, <i>see Hopper,</i> 91 F.3d at 1269, or complain of improper billing in accordance with Karvelas's job responsibilities, <i>see Eberhardt,</i> 167 F.3d at 867-68.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> By notifying his employers about fraudulent claims for payment that the Hospital knowingly submitted to the government, Karvelas provided notice of protected conduct under the FCA. Therefore, we find that Karvelas has alleged facts sufficient to support an inference that he engaged in protected conduct under the FCA and that the defendants were put on notice of that conduct. <i>See Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 241 (explaining that a complaint will withstand a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if it \"alleges facts sufficient to make out a cognizable claim\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in order to state a claim for retaliation, Karvelas must also allege that he was terminated <i>because</i> of his protected conduct. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 99-345, at 35, <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5300 (stating that the employee must show that \"the retaliation was motivated, at least in part, by the employee's engaging in protected activity\"). At the end of his complaint, Karvelas states generally the appropriate elements of a retaliation cause of action, claiming that the defendants retaliated against him because of his investigation of the hospital's FCA violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> However, his complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support this third element of his retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have observed, under the \"notice\" pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a complaint should include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), and therefore need not include detailed pleading of the facts.

Simply parroting the language of a statutory cause of action, without providing some factual support, is not sufficient to state a claim. <i>See Arruda,</i> 310 F.3d at 18 (affirming that we do not credit claims made in a complaint if they are \"bald assertions\" or \"unsupportable conclusions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint, Karvelas alleges that his supervisor retaliated against him by falsely accusing him of improper conduct because he had told her boss about unsafe conditions and the lack of a back-up support system in the Respiratory Therapy Department. He further states that he was fired after returning from a meeting with senior management of the hospital, at which he reported \"defective ABG testing run on a fetus\" by another respiratory therapist. Karvelas \"told his manager, Ms. Hyland-Miller, what he had done\" and informed her about \"the data he had collected, his visits with Drs. Sen and Lilly, and the failure of the Hospital to meet patient-care standards.\" He was fired on the spot. According to the complaint, Karvelas was subsequently informed by letter that he had been discharged because of \"inappropriate behavior,\" including reporting \"alleged unsafe conditions at the Hospital\" to a member of a state senator's staff. However, as noted, investigations of allegedly unsafe conditions or noncompliance with patient care standards do not constitute protected conduct under the FCA. Nowhere in his complaint does Karvelas allege a factual predicate concrete enough to support his conclusory statement that he was retaliated against because of conduct protected under the FCA. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Count IV of Karvelas's complaint for failure to state a claim of retaliation under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Dismissal with Prejudice and Without Leave to Amend</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karvelas argues that even if his complaint failed to meet the pleading obligations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court nonetheless erred when it dismissed his case with prejudice and without affording him an opportunity to amend his complaint.

In this case, Karvelas chose not to file a motion to amend his complaint at any stage of the litigation.

The complaint includes some detail about the nature of these schemes and about the defendants' alleged failure to comply with patient care standards. However, in the 93 pages of this lengthy document, we find no allegation, pled with adequate specificity, of a false claim for payment that was actually presented to the government. <i>See Clausen,</i> 290 F.3d at 1312 (upholding dismissal of FCA qui tam complaint where \"nowhere in the blur of facts and documents assembled by [the relator] regarding six alleged testing schemes [could] one find any allegation, stated with particularity, of a false claim actually being submitted to the Government\"). The law is clear that the False Claims Act attaches liability to the submission of false claims for payment, not to the underlying fraudulent activity or other wrongful conduct on which those claims were based. <i>See Rivera,</i> 55 F.3d at 709.

Nor do we find any basis in the history or requirements of the FCA, or in most of the precedents, for relieving Karvelas of his burden of pleading fraud with particularity because he chose to allege sixteen complex schemes. <i>See Yuhasz,</i> 341 F.3d at 564 (\"[A] plaintiff should not be able to avoid the specificity requirements of Rule 9(b) by relying upon the complexity of the edifice which he created\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> A number of courts have also found FCA violations where a defendant falsely certifies compliance with certain conditions required as a prerequisite for a government benefit or payment in order to induce that benefit<i>See, e.g., Thompson,</i> 125 F.3d at 902. In such cases, false certification for the purpose of receiving a payment or benefit becomes the practical equivalent of a statutory false claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> In the FCA context, the concept of \"place\" holds less relevance for allegations about fraudulent bills or other claims allegedly submitted to the government.

We found that Cabletron's complaint satisfied the PSLRA's particularity requirements because \"the fraud allegations advanced in [the] complaint, with their consistent details provided from at least half a dozen different sources across various alleged schemes, reinforce each other and suggest reliability of the information reported.\" <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 33. By contrast, as we discuss below, Karvelas's complaint does not allege the particulars of any of his allegations concerning the presentation of false claims to the government, and therefore, considered as a whole, the complaint does not meet the particularity requirements of 9(b). <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 204 (finding that the absence of any of a number of enumerated \"basic details\" describing alleged PSLRA violations was \"indicative of the excessive generality of these allegations\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Indeed, with one exception, Karvelas's complaint does not specify which of the particular violations of patient care standards that Karvelas witnessed involved Medicare or Medicaid patients. That exception involves the allegation that hospital administrators instructed him and others to falsify test results so that a trustee/patient of the hospital would qualify for Medicare payment for home oxygen. He further states that on January 26, 1997, the trustee/patient admitted to him that the results of the test were falsified. However, while this allegation provides specific details about the purported fraudulent activity, it does not identify or describe the false claims that were allegedly submitted to Medicare in connection with the trustee's treatment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Because we conclude that Karvelas has not stated with specificity allegations of actual false claims submitted to the government, we need not consider the adequacy of his pleadings concerning the defendants' alleged \"schemes\" or failure to comply with patient care standards</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The defendants urged the district court to reject Karvelas's retaliation claim on res judicata grounds because the court had previously dismissed a similar claim filed by Karvelas against the defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted<i>See Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital,</i> Civ. No. 00-10991 (D.Mass. May 5, 2000). Although it acknowledged that there is circuit authority for the proposition that a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal has res judicata effect, the court declined to dismiss the case on that ground because its order of dismissal in the earlier case, entered without prejudice, had \"noted that plaintiff's False Claims Act litigation was in its early states.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In his complaint, Karvelas states that \"throughout [his] employment at Melrose-Wakefield, he complained to management about deficiencies in the care and about the activities hereinbefore related within his department and throughout the Hospital.\" He explains in his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss that the phrase, \"hereinbefore related,\" includes every allegation pled in the prior paragraphs of his complaint. We agree with the district court that \"it is not sufficient to plead in this paragraph that `[Karvelas] complained to management about' each activity pled in the previous 458 paragraphs\" and, like the district court, we consider only those allegations that concern Karvelas's interactions and communications with his employers and activities that were the subject of those communications</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Where an employee has not engaged in conduct protected under the FCA, he cannot meet the second and third elements of an FCA retaliation claim, as those depend upon the first<i>See, e.g., Yesudian,</i> 153 F.3d at 743 (explaining that \"grumbling to the employer about job dissatisfaction or regulatory violations\" does not demonstrate that the plaintiff's employer was aware of the protected activity, \"just as it does not constitute protected activity in the first place\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> A retaliation claim under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(h) does not require a showing of fraud and therefore need not meet the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b)<i>See, e.g., United States ex rel.

We agree<i>See Dartmouth Rev. v. Dartmouth College,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that \"the question of whether it might have been error for the court to have denied leave to amend is not before us, because plaintiffs never requested it\") (quotation marks omitted). However, Karvelas does not argue that the district court erred in denying a <i>request</i> to amend, but rather that it erred by failing <i>sua sponte</i> to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend, or notice that his pleadings were deficient, before dismissing the case with prejudice. This question is properly before us. Moreover, we do not agree with the defendants that Karvelas waived this argument because he did not seek amendment after the dismissal by moving for reconsideration or relief from the judgment. A dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment that \"slam[s] the door shut on the possibility of future amendments to the complaint\" unless the judgment is set aside or vacated pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60. <i>Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198919\"><a href=\"/opinion/198919/mirpuri-v-act-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 629 (1st Cir.2000). Motions for post-judgment relief and direct appeal thus provide two separate avenues through which a plaintiff may challenge the dismissal of a complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend. <i>See Acevedo-Villalobos,</i> 22 F.3d at 389 (\"Where, as here, a complaint is dismissed without leave to amend, the plaintiff can appeal the judgment or, alternatively, seek leave to amend under Rule 15(a) after having the judgment reopened under either Rule 59 or 60.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> As the defendants point out, the government's decision not to intervene in the action also suggested that Karvelas's pleadings of fraud were potentially inadequate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> We conclude that the district court did not err in failing sua sponte to provide Karvelas an opportunity to amend without referring to a specific standard of review. We do that because, frankly, our cases seem inconsistent in their choice of the standard of review applicable to such cases, reviewing for abuse of discretion,<i>see Romani,</i> 929 F.2d at 878; plain error, <i>see Emerito,</i> 233 F.3d at 30; and the interest of justice, <i>see Dartmouth Rev.</i> 889 F.2d at 23. We need not resolve this issue here. Under any standard of review, the district court did not err in dismissing Karvelas's complaint with prejudice and without granting leave to amend.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
