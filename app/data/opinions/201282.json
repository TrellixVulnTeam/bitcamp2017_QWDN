Appellants   Anthony   Meo   and   Ronald\n\nBourdeau, inmates at the Adult Correctional Institution in\n\nRhode Island, appeal from the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of Ashbel T. Wall, Director of the Rhode\n\nIsland Department of Corrections.      By order dated October 8,\n\n2003, the district court accepted the September 11, 2003 Report\n\nand Recommendation of a magistrate judge, recommending the\n\ngrant of summary judgment.    We affirm, agreeing substantially\n\nwith the reasoning in the Report that the undisputed facts\n\nshowed no deliberate indifference to appellants' health and\n\nwelfare on Wall's part.      Some months after appellants filed\n\ntheir complaint asserting that they were being injured by\n\nenvironmental tobacco smoke at the prison, Wall announced a new\n\npolicy that would totally ban the use of tobacco products at\n\nthe prison as of February 2003.        Moreover, as long ago as\n\nOctober 1999, he had authorized an investigation into the\n\npossibility of totally banning such products.\n\n          In the following, we briefly address the appellants'\n\narguments directed to this issue.      Our appellate standard is\n\nwell-known. Rosen Construction Ventures, Inc. v. Mintz, Levin,\n\nCohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., 364 F.3d 399, 404 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (court reviews grant of summary judgment de novo and\n\nsummary judgment is proper where the record discloses \"no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fis entitled to judgment as matter of law\") (citing Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c)).\n\n             1.    Appellants dispute certain facts, which were\n\nincluded   in     Wall's   statement    of   undisputed     facts    to   the\n\ndistrict court. They also claim that Wall's failure to respond\n\nto certain grievances they filed in the fall of 2001 regarding\n\nthe   environmental    tobacco    smoke      in   their   unit   shows    his\n\ndeliberate indifference to their health and welfare.                But they\n\nfail to elaborate adequately on either argument, and we have\n\nfound nothing in the record that would suggest that Wall was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to their medical or health needs.\n\n             2.    Appellants    contend     that   the   district    court\n\nerroneously admitted evidence that Wall had promulgated a total\n\nban on the use of tobacco products at the prison, effective\n\nFebruary 3, 2003.      But the rule of evidence they cite is not\n\napplicable since Wall offered that evidence to show that he was\n\nnot culpable as alleged.         See Fed. R. Evid. 407, 1972 Adv.\n\nComm. Notes (\"Exclusion is called for only when the evidence of\n\nsubsequent remedial measures is offered as proof of negligence\n\nor culpable conduct.\")\n\n             3.   Appellants assert that Wall knowingly violated\n\nstate law declaring smoking to be a public nuisance.                See R.I.\n\nGen. Laws ยง 23-20.6-1 and .6-2.         But his total ban on the use\n\nof tobacco at the prison was consistent with that law, as was\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe earlier more limited restriction on smoking which became\n\neffective   in   1995   while   he    was   Assistant   Director   for\n\nAdministration.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
