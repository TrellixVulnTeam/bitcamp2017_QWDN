This case asks us to determine\n\nwhen a school system may be liable under Title IX of the Education\n\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1681 et seq., for student-on-\n\nstudent sexual harassment.         In Davis v. Monroe County Board of\n\nEducation, the Supreme Court stated that a school system may not be\n\nheld liable for student-on-student sexual harassment unless the\n\nsystem has been \"deliberately indifferent,\" which, in the Title IX\n\ncontext, requires that the school system's response to harassment\n\nbe \"clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances.\"         526 U.S.\n\n629, 648 (1999).      Ann Marie Porto and Nicholas Porto sued the Town\n\nof Tewksbury (\"Tewksbury\") in their individual capacities and on\n\nbehalf of a minor child, SC, alleging that the school system had\n\nbeen deliberately indifferent to the sexual harassment of SC by a\n\npeer.    The case proceeded to trial, and the jury found in favor of\n\nthe Portos, awarding compensatory damages of $250,000 and punitive\n\ndamages of $1.    The district court also awarded attorneys' fees to\n\nthe Portos.      Tewksbury now appeals the jury verdict, various\n\nevidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, the damages award, and\n\nthe     amount   of   attorneys'     fees   awarded.    After    careful\n\nconsideration, we find that the evidence presented at trial is\n\ninsufficient to sustain the jury's conclusion that Tewksbury was\n\ndeliberately     indifferent    to    the   student-on-student    sexual\n\nharassment, and as such, we vacate the judgment in favor of the\n\nPortos and direct that judgment be granted in favor of Tewksbury.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                          I. Background\n\n          SC was born in March 1987.   Shortly after his birth, SC\n\nwas placed in foster care.   In 1989, SC's aunt, Ann Marie Porto,\n\nand her husband, Nicholas Porto, took in SC as a foster child.\n\nAfter SC came to live with the Portos, they noticed that SC was\n\nexperiencing developmental problems, and they took him to various\n\nhospitals, where he was diagnosed as suffering from fetal alcohol\n\nsyndrome and \"generalized developmental delays.\"\n\n          SC entered the Tewksbury public schools when he was eight\n\nyears old.   Although the Massachusetts Department of Education\n\nidentified SC as being developmentally and mentally disabled, and\n\nthus eligible for special education services, he initially was\n\nplaced in a standard first grade class.   But after a month, SC's\n\nteacher thought he needed more specialized attention, and he was\n\nplaced in special education classes, where he stayed for the\n\nremainder of his tenure in the Tewksbury schools.\n\n          SC met another boy, RC, in his first grade special\n\neducation class. Between first and fifth grade, SC reported to Ann\n\nMarie Porto various sexually-charged incidents with RC.1     Porto\n\n\n\n1\n   The district court ruled that for the purposes of the Porto's\nTitle IX claim, the jury could only consider harassment that\noccurred between October 2000 and January 2001.      Neither party\nappeals this ruling, and we do not disturb it on appeal. However,\nthe court ruled that the Portos could present evidence of\nharassment prior to October 2000 for the purpose of proving that\nTewksbury had knowledge that harassment was likely to occur between\nRC and SC.\n\n                               -4-\n\ftestified that she reported these incidents to Tewksbury teachers\n\nand administrators.   In 1999, when SC was in the fifth grade, the\n\nPortos took him to see a psychologist, Dr. Bradford Smith, for\n\ncounseling related to inappropriate sexual behavior at home. After\n\nhis consultation with SC, Dr. Smith informed the Portos that SC had\n\ntold him that he and RC had been engaging in oral sex on the school\n\nbus since October 1998.    The Portos reported this to Tewksbury\n\npublic school administrators and to the Massachusetts Department of\n\nSocial Services.      In response, the school put SC and RC on\n\ndifferent buses and instructed teachers and school aides to keep SC\n\nand RC separated and to monitor their interaction.\n\n          During the sixth grade, there was only one additional\n\nreported incident involving SC and RC, in which RC allegedly\n\ntouched SC on the buttocks and SC elbowed him in response.      The\n\nschool separated SC and RC and gave SC detention.    Apart from this\n\nincident, Ann Marie Porto testified that she perceived that SC\n\nenjoyed school during his sixth grade year.\n\n          In the fall of 2000, SC entered the seventh grade at Wynn\n\nMiddle School.   SC spent a large part of the day in a life skills\n\nclass with six other children, one of whom was RC.   The life skills\n\nclass was team taught, with one teacher covering language arts and\n\nmath in the morning, and a different teacher covering social\n\nstudies and science in the afternoon.   Although there were three\n\ndifferent classroom aides who at various times helped with the\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fclass, all three were not typically assigned to the class at a\n\ngiven time, and one often accompanied a child              who was in a\n\nwheelchair.\n\n           According to school officials, there were three incidents\n\nin October 2000 that involved inappropriate touching between RC and\n\nSC.   Two of the incidents occurred in the life skills class room.\n\nBoth incidents involved RC touching SC's leg while they were\n\nsitting next to each other.      In one instance, an aide ordered SC\n\nand RC to separate, and they complied.           In another, an aide sat\n\ndown between SC and RC to keep them apart.         There was also a third\n\nincident, during gym class, when SC and RC were touching each other\n\nwhile sitting in the bleachers.            Eleanor Edelstein, RC and SC's\n\nlanguage arts and math teacher, testified that she heard a verbal\n\ndescription   of   one    of   the     classroom     incidents   involving\n\ninappropriate touching under a workstation table.\n\n           After the third incident, the boys were sent to the\n\nschool guidance counselor, William Traveis. Traveis instructed the\n\nboys that this type of behavior was inappropriate.           According to\n\nTraveis, the boys apologized and told him that they would not do it\n\nagain.   Traveis testified that he thought the boys understood the\n\ndiscussion, and that he told teachers and aides to monitor them and\n\nkeep them separated.     No additional incidents were reported to the\n\nschool until January.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f              On the morning of January 11, 2001, RC asked Edelstein\n\nfor permission to go to the bathroom, and Edelstein excused him.\n\nA short time later, SC asked Edelstein if he could get a book from\n\nhis locker.     No aide was present at the time to accompany either RC\n\nor SC.    There is no evidence that either boy had previously misled\n\nEdelstein with respect to similar requests.             Edelstein allowed SC\n\nto leave the classroom.           After two or three minutes, Edelstein\n\nnoticed that neither of the boys had returned.                  She stepped out\n\ninto the hall to look for them, but did not see them.              While in the\n\nhall,    Edelstein     spotted   Robert   Ware,   the   Behavior     Management\n\nFacilitator at Wynn Middle School, and asked him to go into the\n\nbathroom to investigate.         Ware entered the bathroom and discovered\n\nSC and RC in a stall, pulling their pants up.                    Ware took the\n\nstudents to his office and asked them what they had been doing.                SC\n\ntold Ware that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with RC, and\n\nthat he and RC had been touching each other on a weekly basis for\n\nsome time.          Ware informed James McGuire, the principal of Wynn\n\nMiddle School, about the incident.             McGuire called SC's parents,\n\ntold them what had happened, and asked them to pick up SC from\n\nschool.\n\n              SC did not return to school after the incident with RC.\n\nBetween January and October 2001, SC remained at home, receiving\n\nten   hours    of    tutoring    per   week.     In   October    2001,   SC   was\n\nhospitalized for a month for behavioral problems, during which time\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fSC attempted to commit suicide.    From November 2001 until February\n\n2002, SC participated in a daytime academic and counseling program\n\nat the Bournewood Hospital. Finally, in February 2002, SC was sent\n\nto a residential treatment program outside of the Tewksbury school\n\ndistrict.\n\n            The Portos filed suit against Tewksbury on January 5,\n\n2004, alleging that, because it was deliberately indifferent to\n\nRC's sexual harassment of SC, Tewksbury had violated Title IX of\n\nthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1681 et seq.2     The\n\ncase proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted from October 3 until\n\nOctober 21, 2005.    After the Portos presented their case to the\n\njury, Tewksbury moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50(a), arguing that the Portos had failed to prove any\n\nelement of their case.   The court denied Tewksbury's motion, and\n\nafter one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of the Portos, awarding $250,000 in compensatory damages and\n\n$1 in punitive damages. Tewksbury then filed a motion for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b),\n\n\n\n2\n   The Portos also alleged that Tewksbury discriminated against SC\non the basis of his disability in violation of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12131 et seq.      The jury found in\nfavor of Tewksbury on this claim, and the Portos do not appeal that\naspect of the verdict. In addition, the Portos brought various\nMassachusetts law claims against Tewksbury, which were later\ndismissed, and the Portos do not appeal this decision. Finally,\nthe Portos initially brought claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against\nvarious individuals who worked for the Tewksbury public school\nsystem, but later voluntarily dismissed them.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fagain arguing that the Portos had failed to satisfy their burden on\n\nany element of the case.3   The court denied the motion by written\n\norder on April 28, 2006.    Tewksbury now appeals.\n\n                  II. Motion for Directed Judgment\n\n           We review the denial of a Rule 50 motion de novo.    Walton\n\nv. Nalco Chem. Co., 272 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).         \"We must\n\naffirm unless the evidence was 'so strongly and overwhelmingly'\n\ninconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have\n\nreturned them.\"   Id. (quoting Negrรณn v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc.,\n\n212 F.3d 666, 668 (1st Cir. 2000)).    Thus, to reverse, we must find\n\nthat there was \"a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff's\n\ncase.\"   Mayo v. Schooner Capital Corp., 825 F.2d 566, 568 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (quoting Fact Concerts, Inc. v. City of Newport, 626 F.2d\n\n1060, 1064 (1st Cir. 1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We\n\ndraw \"all reasonable inferences\" from the evidence presented at\n\ntrial in favor of the prevailing party.     Negrรณn, 212 F.3d at 668.\n\n           Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a\n\nrecipient of funding from the United States Department of Education\n\nmay be liable for damages if \"its deliberate indifference [to\n\npeer-on-peer   sexual   harassment]    'subjects'   its   students   to\n\n\n\n3\n   Tewksbury also filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the\ncourt improperly admitted certain testimony and misinstructed the\njury.   Because we find that Tewksbury's motion for a directed\nverdict should have been granted based on the evidence that was\ndeemed admissible by the district court, we need not decide the\ncorrectness of the evidentiary rulings or instructions.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fharassment.\"     Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629,\n\n644 (1999).     A funding recipient is deliberately indifferent to\n\nstudent-on-student harassment when \"the recipient's response to the\n\nharassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the\n\nknown circumstances.\"     Id. at 648.     \"[T]he deliberate indifference\n\nmust, at a minimum, 'cause [students] to undergo' harassment or\n\n'make them liable or vulnerable' to it.\"       Id. at 645 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n\n1415 (1966)).    In addition, the acts of sexual harassment must be\n\n\"known\" to the funding recipient.           Id. at 647.         Finally, the\n\nharassment must be \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\n\nthat it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the\n\neducational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.\" Id.\n\nat 650.\n\n             Thus, a funding recipient is not liable under Title IX\n\nfor all student-on-student sexual harassment. First, the plaintiff\n\nmust show (1) that he or she was subject to \"severe, pervasive, and\n\nobjectively offensive\" sexual harassment by a school peer, and (2)\n\nthat   the   harassment   caused   the    plaintiff   to   be   deprived   of\n\neducational opportunities or benefits.        Even then, Davis restricts\n\na funding recipient's liability under Title IX for student-on-\n\nstudent sexual harassment to situations where (3) it knew of the\n\nharassment, (4) in its programs or activities and (5) it was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to the harassment such that its response\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f(or lack thereof) is clearly unreasonable in light of the known\n\ncircumstances.\n\n          For the purposes of this appeal, we assume (without\n\ndeciding) that SC was subject to severe, pervasive, and objectively\n\noffensive harassment by RC, that Tewksbury is a funding recipient\n\nand had actual knowledge in 2001 of at least some prior incidents\n\nof inappropriate sexual behavior, and that the harassment deprived\n\nSC of educational opportunities or benefits.4     Even making these\n\nassumptions, we do not think that the Portos presented sufficient\n\nevidence such that a rational jury could have concluded that\n\nTewksbury was deliberately indifferent to the harassment of SC.\n\nThe Portos argue that Tewksbury was told on multiple occasions that\n\nRC was harassing SC, but that the school did nothing more than\n\ntemporarily separate the boys.    The Portos also note that in spite\n\nof Tewksbury's knowledge of the prior sexual harassment, RC and SC\n\nwere allowed to have unsupervised access to each other at times.\n\nThe Portos contend that, given the history of sexual harassment\n\nbetween RC and SC that culminated in the school-bus incident in\n\nfifth grade, Tewksbury should have not allowed SC to go to his\n\nlocker alone while RC was in the bathroom.      The Portos point to\n\nevidence of a prior directive from Tewksbury to teachers and aides\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Thus, we explicitly do not decide whether a minor student's\n\"consent\" to sexual conduct is a factor in determining whether that\nstudent was subject to sexual harassment.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthat RC and SC not be allowed to travel alone together in or\n\noutside the school building.\n\n          The problem with the Portos' argument is that it suggests\n\nonly that Tewksbury perhaps should have done more to prevent RC\n\nfrom sexually harassing SC.          However, a claim that the school\n\nsystem could or should have done more is insufficient to establish\n\ndeliberate    indifference;     in   the    Title    IX     context,    \"funding\n\nrecipients are deemed deliberately indifferent to acts of student-\n\non-student harassment only where the recipient's response to the\n\nharassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the\n\nknown circumstances.\"      Davis, 526 U.S. at 648.          The Supreme Court\n\nhas described deliberate indifference as \"a stringent standard of\n\nfault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known\n\nor obvious consequence of his action\" or inaction.                 Bd. of the\n\nCounty Comm'rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997) (emphasis added).\n\nThus, before holding a municipality liable for a police officer's\n\nexcessive force, we have required plaintiffs to prove that the\n\nmunicipality knew that the excessive force would be a \"plainly\n\nobvious consequence\" of hiring the officer.                 Crete v. City of\n\nLowell, 418 F.3d 54, 66 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Young v. City of\n\nProvidence,   404   F.3d   4,   28   (1st   Cir.    2005)    (holding    that   a\n\nreasonable jury could find deliberate indifference where excessive\n\nforce was a \"highly predictable consequence\" of the municipality's\n\nfailure to train its police officers (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f409). Likewise, in Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayagรผez, we found that\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to support a finding of deliberate\n\nindifference by a supervisor where a municipal employee turned city\n\nhall into the campaign headquarters for a candidate, with the\n\nobvious consequence that employees who were supporters of the rival\n\ncandidate would feel that they had been discriminated against in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment rights.              467 F.3d 16, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    In the educational setting, we have suggested that a\n\nschool might be deliberately indifferent to a teacher's sexual\n\nharassment    of   a   student   where     it   had   notice   of   the   sexual\n\nharassment, and either did nothing or failed to take additional\n\nreasonable measures after it learned that its initial remedies were\n\nineffective.       Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            The Portos do not claim that Tewksbury did nothing to\n\naddress RC's sexual harassment of SC.                 They acknowledge that\n\nTewksbury    separated    SC   and    RC   after   each   episode    of   sexual\n\nharassment and later had the school guidance counselor intervene.\n\nCompare with Doe ex rel. A.N. v. E. Haven Bd. of Educ., 200 F.\n\nApp'x 46, 49 (2d Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (finding deliberate\n\nindifference where \"alleged victim of a rape complained of verbal\n\nharassment based on her sex and related to the rape for five weeks\n\nbefore authorities took concrete action to get the perpetrators of\n\nthe harassment to stop\").            Rather, the Portos claim that these\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fmeasures were ineffective.        There is no doubt that the bathroom\n\nincident is evidence that RC's inappropriate sexual behavior was\n\nnot abated.      However, the fact that measures designed to stop\n\nharassment prove later to be ineffective does not establish that\n\nthe   steps    taken   were   clearly    unreasonable   in   light   of   the\n\ncircumstances known by Tewksbury at the time. The test for whether\n\na school should be liable under Title IX for student-on-student\n\nharassment is not one of effectiveness by hindsight.\n\n              The Portos' proof is inadequate on several different\n\nlevels. First, there was no evidence presented at trial to suggest\n\nthat Tewksbury knew or even suspected that when SC asked to go to\n\nhis locker, he was really going to go to the bathroom to meet RC.\n\nThe Portos suggest that because SC was mentally disabled, it would\n\nhave been prudent to have had a teacher's aide accompany him to his\n\nlocker.   However, this suggests only that Tewksbury may have been\n\nnegligent; to prove deliberate indifference, the Portos had to show\n\nat least that Tewksbury knew that the failure to accompany SC to\n\nhis locker would lead to SC following RC to the bathroom and that\n\nthere was a high degree of risk that SC would be subject there to\n\ninappropriate      sexual     behavior   by   RC.       Edelstein    offered\n\nuncontradicted testimony that the boys had never given a \"reason\n\nfor [her] to ever question that they couldn't be trusted going to\n\nthe bathroom or going to a locker,\" and that she \"trusted that they\n\nwould follow the rules.\"        Thus, there was no evidence that anyone\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fhad a reason to suspect that SC intended to deceive Edelstein when\n\nhe asked for permission to visit his locker.\n\n            Furthermore, there was no evidence that the school knew\n\nor that it was obvious that RC would continue to sexually harass SC\n\nafter October 2000.        To put the Portos' claim in context, it is\n\nimportant to note that between March 1999 and October 2000, there\n\nwas only one alleged minor incident of sexual harassment.                       Apart\n\nfrom this, according to Ann Marie Porto, SC was generally happy at\n\nschool   and   had    no   problems,   and    there    was      no   evidence    that\n\nTewksbury was aware of any additional problems during this time.\n\nIt was not until October 2000 that RC's inappropriate touching\n\nresumed.    The first two times this occurred, the school separated\n\nthe boys.      After the third instance of inappropriate touching,\n\nschool officials sent the boys to talk to Traveis, the school\n\ncounselor.     RC and SC spoke with Traveis, who testified that it was\n\nhis understanding that the boys knew that what they were doing was\n\nwrong,   and   that   they   promised    not   to     do   it    again.     It   was\n\nreasonable for Tewksbury to conclude that this intervention worked:\n\nthere was no evidence presented that Tewksbury was aware of any\n\nfurther sexual harassment by RC between Traveis's intervention in\n\nOctober 2000 and the January 11, 2001 incident.5                 Even the Portos'\n\n\n5\n   Nor were the Portos aware of any sexual harassment during this\nperiod.   In fact, Ann Marie Porto met with school officials in\nNovember 2000, but did not report any additional instances of\nsexual harassment between SC and RC. There was, however, evidence\nthat the harassment did continue unbeknownst to Tewksbury.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fexpert, Dr. Dragan, testified only that Tewksbury could have done\n\nmore.   Thus, there was no evidence from which it could be inferred\n\nthat Tewksbury had reason to believe that RC was continuing to\n\nsexually harass SC.        In other words, further sexual harassment,\n\nmuch    less    sexual   intercourse,   was   not   a   \"known   or   obvious\n\nconsequence\" of Tewksbury's failure to accompany SC to his locker\n\non January 11, 2001.6\n\n               Therefore, this is not a case, as the Portos contend,\n\nwhere a school \"continued to use the same ineffective methods to no\n\nacknowledged avail.\"       Vance v. Spencer County Pub. Sch. Dist., 231\n\nF.3d 253, 262 (6th Cir. 2000).          By all indications, Tewksbury's\n\nmethods were working: until January 11, 2001, Tewksbury was not\n\naware that RC had been engaging in any further sexual harassment\n\nafter October 2000.        Nor is this case analogous to Williams v.\n\nBoard of Regents, 477 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2007), where the\n\nEleventh Circuit found that the plaintiff had adequately alleged\n\nthat University of Georgia was deliberately indifferent when it\n\nfailed to properly instruct or supervise a student athlete who had\n\nrecently been accused of sexual harassment while attending another\n\ninstitution.       In Williams, prior to attending the University of\n\n\n\n6\n    Likewise, the fact that Tewksbury did not have a sexual\nharassment policy that complied with Department of Education\nregulations is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference;\nthe Portos have not offered any evidence that would permit the\ninference that RC's harassment was a known consequence of such\nnoncompliance.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fGeorgia, a student athlete had been disciplined by two colleges for\n\nsexual assault and sexual harassment.                Id. at 1290.      Thus, recent\n\nhistory suggested that the interventions by the student's former\n\nschools -- dismissal of the student from one school and dismissal\n\nfrom the other's basketball team -- had not been successful in\n\ncurbing the student's inappropriate sexual behavior.                   Based on her\n\nclaims that the defendants failed to properly instruct or supervise\n\nthe student to make sure that he did not sexually assault persons\n\naffiliated with the university, the plaintiff adequately alleged\n\nthat the defendants exhibited \"deliberate indifference\" to an\n\nobvious    consequence       of     their   inaction,      i.e.,   another   sexual\n\nassault.    Id. at 1296.          In the present case, the evidence clearly\n\nshows   that    after    Traveis's      intervention,       Tewksbury    reasonably\n\nbelieved that it had been successful in stopping RC's inappropriate\n\nbehavior.      Because continued sexual harassment was not a \"known or\n\nobvious consequence\" of the school's inaction as in Vance and\n\nWilliams, Tewksbury cannot have been deliberately indifferent to\n\nSC's plight.\n\n            More analogous to the situation in this case is Gabrielle\n\nM. v. Park Forest-Chicago Heights, Illinois School District 163,\n\n315 F.3d 817 (7th Cir. 2003).               In Gabrielle M., school officials\n\ninitially suspended a boy who had been sexually harassing female\n\nclassmates.     Id.     at   819.     After    the   boy    returned    to   school,\n\nadministrators eventually allowed the boy to return to lunchtime\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fand recess with the classmates, but asked aides to keep an eye on\n\nhim.   Id. at 819-20.   The Seventh Circuit held that this was not an\n\nunreasonable response to the known risk that the boy might harass\n\nhis classmates again:\n\n            Davis [v. Monroe County Board of Education,\n            526 U.S. 629 (1999)] does not require funding\n            recipients to remedy peer harassment. Davis\n            disapproved of a standard that would force\n            funding recipients to suspend or expel every\n            student accused of misconduct. All that Davis\n            requires is that the school not act clearly\n            unreasonably in response to known instances of\n            harassment. Here, in light of each of the\n            immediate disciplinary and preventative steps\n            the school district had already taken in\n            response to Jason's conduct, including most\n            prominently the decisions to move him to\n            another class entirely and eventually to grant\n            Gabrielle's request for a school transfer, it\n            was not clearly unreasonable as a matter of\n            law initially to assign an instructor to\n            oversee a communal recess and lunch period\n            instead of immediately rescheduling the lunch\n            and recess period for a whole kindergarten\n            class.\n\nId. at 825 (internal citations omitted). Likewise, Tewksbury acted\n\nreasonably    in   responding   to    RC's    inappropriate      touching    by\n\nseparating RC and SC and sending them to the guidance counselor.\n\nThus, drawing all inferences favorable to the Portos, the evidence\n\nin   this   case   overwhelmingly    fails,    as   a   matter   of   law,   to\n\ndemonstrate that Tewksbury acted with deliberate indifference in\n\nfailing to address RC's sexual harassment of SC.             Therefore, the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fPortos cannot prevail on their claim, and the district judge should\n\nhave granted Tewksbury's motion for a directed verdict.7\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court, and remand with instructions to the district court\n\nto enter judgment in favor of Tewksbury.   No costs to either party.\n\n          Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    Because we find that the evidence presented at trial was\ninsufficient, we see no reason to reach Tewksbury's claims as to\ndamages.    Likewise, as we noted before, we need not address\nTewksbury's   claims   regarding  evidentiary   rulings  or   jury\ninstructions.    Finally, because we have vacated the judgment\nagainst Tewksbury, we also vacate the judgment awarding attorneys'\nfees to the Portos. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) (authorizing, in the\ndiscretion of the district judge, the award of attorneys' fees to\nthe prevailing party).\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

In <i>Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education,</i> the Supreme Court stated that a school system may not be held liable for student-on-student sexual harassment unless the system has been \"deliberately indifferent,\" which, in the Title IX context, requires that the school system's response to harassment be \"clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances.\" 526 U.S. 629, 648, 119 S.Ct. 1661, 143 L.Ed.2d 839 (1999). Ann Marie Porto and Nicholas Porto sued the Town of Tewksbury (\"Tewksbury\") in their individual capacities and on behalf of a minor child, SC, alleging that the school system had been deliberately indifferent to the sexual harassment of SC by a peer. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury found in favor of the Portos, awarding compensatory damages of $250,000 and punitive damages of $1. The district court also awarded attorneys' fees to the Portos. Tewksbury now appeals the jury verdict, various evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, the damages award, and the amount of attorneys' fees awarded. After careful consideration, we find that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to sustain the jury's conclusion that Tewksbury was deliberately indifferent to the student-on-student sexual harassment, and as such, we vacate the judgment in favor of the Portos and direct that judgment be granted in favor of Tewksbury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC was born in March 1987. Shortly after his birth, SC was placed in foster care. In 1989, SC's aunt, Ann Marie Porto, and her husband, Nicholas Porto, took in SC as a foster child. After SC came to live with the Portos, they noticed that SC was experiencing developmental problems, and they took him to various hospitals, where he was diagnosed as suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome and \"generalized developmental delays.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC entered the Tewksbury public schools when he was eight years old. Although the Massachusetts Department of Education identified SC as being developmentally and mentally disabled, and thus eligible for special education services, he initially was placed in a standard first grade class. But after a month, SC's teacher thought he needed more specialized attention, and he was placed in special education classes, where he stayed for the remainder of his tenure in the Tewksbury schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC met another boy, RC, in his first grade special education class. Between first and fifth grade, SC reported to Ann Marie Porto various sexually-charged incidents with RC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Porto testified that she reported these incidents to Tewksbury teachers and administrators. In 1999, when SC was in the fifth grade, the Portos took him to see a psychologist, Dr. Bradford Smith, for counseling related to inappropriate sexual behavior at home. After his consultation with SC, Dr. Smith informed the Portos that SC had told him that he and RC had been engaging in oral sex on the school bus since October 1998. The Portos reported this to Tewksbury public school administrators and to the Massachusetts Department of Social Services. In response, the school put SC and RC on different buses and instructed teachers and school aides to keep SC and RC separated and to monitor their interaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the sixth grade, there was only one additional reported incident involving SC and RC, in which RC allegedly touched SC on the buttocks and SC elbowed him in response. The school separated SC and RC and gave SC detention. Apart from this incident, Ann Marie Porto testified that she perceived that SC enjoyed school during his sixth grade year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2000, SC entered the seventh grade at Wynn Middle School. SC spent a large part of the day in a life skills class with six other children, one of whom was RC. The life skills class was team taught, with one teacher covering language arts and math in the morning, and a different teacher covering social studies and science in the afternoon. Although there were three different classroom aides who at various times helped with the class, all three were not typically assigned to the class at a given time, and one often accompanied a child who was in a wheelchair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to school officials, there were three incidents in October 2000 that involved inappropriate touching between RC and SC. Two of the incidents occurred in the life skills class room. Both incidents involved RC touching SC's leg while they were sitting next to each other. In one instance, an aide ordered SC and RC to separate, and they complied. In another, an aide sat down between SC and RC to keep them apart. There was also a third incident, during gym class, when SC and RC were touching each other while sitting in the bleachers. Eleanor Edelstein, RC and SC's language arts and math teacher, testified that she heard a verbal description of one of the classroom incidents involving inappropriate touching under a workstation table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the third incident, the boys were sent to the school guidance counselor, William Traveis. Traveis instructed the boys that this type of behavior was inappropriate. According to Traveis, the boys apologized and told him that they would not do it again. Traveis testified that he thought the boys understood the discussion, and that he told teachers and aides to monitor them and keep them separated. No additional incidents were reported to the school until January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 11, 2001, RC asked Edelstein for permission to go to the bathroom, and Edelstein excused him. A short time later, SC asked Edelstein if he could get a book from his locker. No aide was present at the time to accompany either RC or SC. There is no evidence that either boy had previously misled Edelstein with respect to similar requests. Edelstein allowed SC to leave the classroom. After two or three minutes, Edelstein noticed that neither of the boys had returned. She stepped out into the hall to look for them, but did not see them. While in the hall, Edelstein spotted Robert Ware, the Behavior Management Facilitator at Wynn Middle School, and asked him to go into the bathroom to investigate. Ware entered the bathroom and discovered SC and RC in a stall, pulling their pants up. Ware took the students to his office and asked them what they had been doing. SC told Ware that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with RC, and that he and RC had been touching each other on a weekly basis for some time. Ware informed James McGuire, the principal of Wynn Middle School, about the incident. McGuire called SC's parents, told them what had happened, and asked them to pick up SC from school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC did not return to school after the incident with RC. Between January and October 2001, SC remained at home, receiving ten hours of tutoring per week. In October 2001, SC was hospitalized for a month for behavioral problems, during which time SC attempted to commit suicide. From November 2001 until February 2002, SC participated in a daytime academic and counseling program at the Bournewood Hospital. Finally, in February 2002, SC was sent to a residential treatment program outside of the Tewksbury school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos filed suit against Tewksbury on January 5, 2004, alleging that, because it was deliberately indifferent to RC's sexual harassment of SC, Tewksbury had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1681 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The case proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted from October 3 until October 21, 2005. After the Portos presented their case to the jury, Tewksbury moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), arguing that the Portos had failed to prove any element of their case. The court denied Tewksbury's motion, and after one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Portos, awarding $250,000 in compensatory damages and $1 in punitive damages. Tewksbury then filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), again arguing that the Portos had failed to satisfy their burden on any element of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court denied the motion by written order on April 28, 2006. Tewksbury now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Motion for Directed Judgment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a Rule 50 motion <i>de novo. Walton v. Nalco Chem.

Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 666, 668 (1st Cir. 2000)). Thus, to reverse, we must find that there was \"a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff's case.\" <i>Mayo v. Schooner Capital Corp.,</i> 825 F.2d 566, 568 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting <i>Fact Concerts, Inc. v. City of Newport,</i> 626 F.2d 1060, 1064 (1st Cir. 1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We draw \"all reasonable inferences\" from the evidence presented at trial in favor of the prevailing party. <i>Negr&#243;n,</i> 212 F.3d at 668.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a recipient of funding from the United States Department of Education may be liable for damages if \"its deliberate indifference [to peer-on-peer sexual harassment] `subjects' its students to harassment.\" <i>Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 526 U.S. 629, 644, 119 S.Ct. 1661, 143 L.Ed.2d 839 (1999). A funding recipient is deliberately indifferent to student-on-student harassment when \"the recipient's response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 648, 119 S.Ct. 1661. \"[T]he deliberate indifference must, at a minimum, `cause [students] to undergo' harassment or `make them liable or vulnerable' to it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 645, 119 S.Ct. 1661 (alteration in original) (quoting Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1415 (1966)). In addition, the acts of sexual harassment must be \"known\" to the funding recipient. <i>Id.</i> at 647, 119 S.Ct. 1661. Finally, the harassment must be \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.\" <i>Id.</i> at 650, 119 S.Ct. 1661.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, a funding recipient is not liable under Title IX for all student-on-student sexual harassment. First, the plaintiff must show (1) that he or she was subject to \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" sexual harassment by a school peer, and (2) that the harassment caused the plaintiff to be deprived of educational opportunities or benefits. Even then, <i>Davis</i> restricts a funding recipient's liability under Title IX for student-on-student sexual harassment to situations where (3) it knew of the harassment, (4) in its programs or activities and (5) it was deliberately indifferent to the harassment such that its response (or lack thereof) is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume (without deciding) that SC was subject to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment by RC, that Tewksbury is a funding recipient and had actual knowledge in 2001 of at least some prior incidents of inappropriate sexual behavior, and that the harassment deprived SC of educational opportunities or benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Even making these assumptions, we do not think that the Portos presented sufficient evidence such that a rational jury could have concluded that Tewksbury was <i>deliberately indifferent</i> to the harassment of SC. The Portos argue that Tewksbury was told on multiple occasions that RC was harassing SC, but that the school did nothing more than temporarily separate the boys. The Portos also note that in spite of Tewksbury's knowledge of the prior sexual harassment, RC and SC were allowed to have unsupervised access to each other at times. The Portos contend that, given the history of sexual harassment between RC and SC that culminated in the school-bus incident in fifth grade, Tewksbury should have not allowed SC to go to his locker alone while RC was in the bathroom. The Portos point to evidence of a prior directive from Tewksbury to teachers and aides that RC and SC not be allowed to travel alone together in or outside the school building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the Portos' argument is that it suggests only that Tewksbury perhaps should have done more to prevent RC from sexually harassing SC. However, a claim that the school system could or should have done more is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference; in the Title IX context, \"funding recipients are deemed deliberately indifferent to acts of student-on-student harassment only where the recipient's response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" <i>Davis,</i> 526 U.S. at 648, 119 S.Ct. 1661. The Supreme Court has described deliberate indifference as \"a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a <i>known or obvious</i> consequence of his action\" or inaction. <i>Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown,</i> 520 U.S. 397, 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997) (emphasis added). Thus, before holding a municipality liable for a police officer's excessive force, we have required plaintiffs to prove that the municipality knew that the excessive force would be a \"plainly obvious consequence\" of hiring the officer. <i>Crete v. City of Lowell,</i> 418 F.3d 54, 66 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>see also Young v. City of Providence,</i> 404 F.3d 4, 28 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that a reasonable jury could find deliberate indifference where excessive force was a \"highly predictable consequence\" of the municipality's failure to train its police officers) (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 520 U.S. at 409, 117 S.Ct. 1382). Likewise, in <i>Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayag&#252;ez,</i> we found that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of deliberate indifference by a supervisor where a municipal employee turned city hall into the campaign headquarters for a candidate, with the obvious consequence that employees who were supporters of the rival candidate would feel that they had been discriminated against in violation of their First Amendment rights. 467 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). In the educational setting, we have suggested that a school might be deliberately indifferent to a teacher's sexual harassment of a student where it had notice of the sexual harassment, and either did nothing or failed to take additional reasonable measures after it learned that its initial remedies were ineffective. <i>Wills v. Brown Univ.,</i> 184 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos do not claim that Tewksbury did nothing to address RC's sexual harassment of SC. They acknowledge that Tewksbury separated SC and RC after each episode of sexual harassment and later had the school guidance counselor intervene. <i>Compare with Doe ex rel. A.N. v. E. Haven Bd. of Educ.,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 46, 49 (2d Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (finding deliberate indifference where \"alleged victim of a rape complained of verbal harassment based on her sex and related to the rape for five weeks before authorities took concrete action to get the perpetrators of the harassment to stop\"). Rather, the Portos claim that these measures were ineffective. There is no doubt that the bathroom incident is evidence that RC's inappropriate sexual behavior was not abated. However, the fact that measures designed to stop harassment prove later to be ineffective does not establish that the steps taken were clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances known by Tewksbury at the time. The test for whether a school should be liable under Title IX for student-on-student harassment is not one of effectiveness by hindsight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos' proof is inadequate on several different levels. First, there was no evidence presented at trial to suggest that Tewksbury knew or even suspected that when SC asked to go to his locker, he was really going to go to the bathroom to meet RC. The Portos suggest that because SC was mentally disabled, it would have been prudent to have had a teacher's aide accompany him to his locker. However, this suggests only that Tewksbury may have been negligent; to prove deliberate indifference, the Portos had to show at least that Tewksbury <i>knew</i> that the failure to accompany SC to his locker would lead to SC following RC to the bathroom and that there was a high degree of risk that SC would be subject there to inappropriate sexual behavior by RC. Edelstein offered uncontradicted testimony that the boys had never given a \"reason for [her] to ever question that they couldn't be trusted going to the bathroom or going to a locker,\" and that she \"trusted that they would follow the rules.\" Thus, there was no evidence that anyone had a reason to suspect that SC intended to deceive Edelstein when he asked for permission to visit his locker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, there was no evidence that the school knew or that it was obvious that RC would continue to sexually harass SC after October 2000. To put the Portos' claim in context, it is important to note that between March 1999 and October 2000, there was only one alleged minor incident of sexual harassment. Apart from this, according to Ann Marie Porto, SC was generally happy at school and had no problems, and there was no evidence that Tewksbury was aware of any additional problems during this time. It was not until October 2000 that RC's inappropriate touching resumed. The first two times this occurred, the school separated the boys. After the third instance of inappropriate touching, school officials sent the boys to talk to Traveis, the school counselor. RC and SC spoke with Traveis, who testified that it was his understanding that the boys knew that what they were doing was wrong, and that they promised not to do it again. It was reasonable for Tewksbury to conclude that this intervention worked: there was no evidence presented that Tewksbury was aware of any further sexual harassment by RC between Traveis's intervention in October 2000 and the January 11, 2001 incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even the Portos' expert, Dr. Dragan, testified only that Tewksbury could have done more. Thus, there was no evidence from which it could be inferred that Tewksbury had reason to believe that RC was continuing to sexually harass SC. In other words, further sexual harassment, much less sexual intercourse, was not a \"known or obvious consequence\" of Tewksbury's failure to accompany SC to his locker on January 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, this is not a case, as the Portos contend, where a school \"continued to use the same ineffective methods to no acknowledged avail.\" <i>Vance v. Spencer County Pub. Sch. Dist.,</i> 231 F.3d 253, 262 (6th Cir. 2000). By all indications, Tewksbury's methods were working: until January 11, 2001, Tewksbury was not aware that RC had been engaging in any further sexual harassment after October 2000. Nor is this case analogous to <i>Williams v. Board of Regents,</i> 477 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2007), where the Eleventh Circuit found that the plaintiff had adequately alleged that University of Georgia was deliberately indifferent when it failed to properly instruct or supervise a student athlete who had recently been accused of sexual harassment while attending another institution. In <i>Williams,</i> prior to attending the University of Georgia, a student athlete had been disciplined by two colleges for sexual assault and sexual harassment. <i>Id.</i> at 1290. Thus, recent history suggested that the interventions by the student's former schools&#8212;dismissal of the student from one school and dismissal from the other's basketball team&#8212;had not been successful in curbing the student's inappropriate sexual behavior. Based on her claims that the defendants failed to properly instruct or supervise the student to make sure that he did not sexually assault persons affiliated with the university, the plaintiff adequately alleged that the defendants exhibited \"deliberate indifference\" to an obvious consequence of their inaction, <i>i.e.,</i> another sexual assault. <i>Id.</i> at 1296. In the present case, the evidence clearly shows that after Traveis's intervention, Tewksbury reasonably believed that it had been successful in stopping RC's inappropriate behavior. Because continued sexual harassment was not a \"known or obvious consequence\" of the school's inaction as in <i>Vance</i> and <i>Williams,</i> Tewksbury cannot have been deliberately indifferent to SC's plight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More analogous to the situation in this case is <i>Gabrielle M. v. Park Forest-Chicago Heights, Illinois School District 163,</i> 315 F.3d 817 (7th Cir. 2003). In <i>Gabrielle M.,</i> school officials initially suspended a boy who had been sexually harassing female classmates. <i>Id.</i> at 819. After the boy returned to school, administrators eventually allowed the boy to return to lunchtime and recess with the classmates, but asked aides to keep an eye on him. <i>Id.</i> at 819-20. The Seventh Circuit held that this was not an unreasonable response to the known risk that the boy might harass his classmates again: <i>Davis</i> [<i>v. Monroe County Board of Education,</i> 526 U.S. 629, 119 S.Ct. 1661, 143 L.Ed.2d 839 (1999)] does not require funding recipients to remedy peer harassment. <i>Davis</i> disapproved of a standard that would force funding recipients to suspend or expel every student accused of misconduct. All that <i>Davis</i> requires is that the school not act <i>clearly unreasonably</i> in response to known instances of harassment. Here, in light of each of the immediate disciplinary and preventative steps the school district had already taken in response to Jason's conduct, including most prominently the decisions to move him to another class entirely and eventually to grant Gabrielle's request for a school transfer, it was not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law initially to assign an instructor to oversee a communal recess and lunch period instead of immediately rescheduling the lunch and recess period for a whole kindergarten class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 825 (internal citations omitted). Likewise, Tewksbury acted reasonably in responding to RC's inappropriate touching by separating RC and SC and sending them to the guidance counselor. Thus, drawing all inferences favorable to the Portos, the evidence in this case overwhelmingly fails, as a matter of law, to demonstrate that Tewksbury acted with deliberate indifference in failing to address RC's sexual harassment of SC. Therefore, the Portos cannot prevail on their claim, and the district judge should have granted Tewksbury's motion for a directed verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand with instructions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of Tewksbury.

In addition, the Portos brought various Massachusetts law claims against Tewksbury, which were later dismissed, and the Portos do not appeal this decision.

In <i>Davis v.

Ann Marie Porto and Nicholas Porto sued the Town of Tewksbury (\"Tewksbury\") in their individual capacities and on behalf of a minor child, SC, alleging that the school system had been deliberately indifferent to the sexual harassment of SC by a peer. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury found in favor of the Portos, awarding compensatory damages of $250,000 and punitive damages of $1. The district court also awarded attorneys' fees to the Portos. Tewksbury now appeals the jury verdict, various evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, the damages award, and the amount of attorneys' fees awarded. After careful consideration, we find that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to sustain the jury's conclusion that Tewksbury was deliberately indifferent to the student-on-student sexual harassment, and as such, we vacate the judgment in favor of the Portos and direct that judgment be granted in favor of Tewksbury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC was born in March 1987. Shortly after his birth, SC was placed in foster care. In 1989, SC's aunt, Ann Marie Porto, and her husband, Nicholas Porto, took in SC as a foster child. After SC came to live with the Portos, they noticed that SC was experiencing developmental problems, and they took him to various hospitals, where he was diagnosed as suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome and \"generalized developmental delays.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC entered the Tewksbury public schools when he was eight years old. Although the Massachusetts Department of Education identified SC as being developmentally and mentally disabled, and thus eligible for special education services, he initially was placed in a standard first grade class. But after a month, SC's teacher thought he needed more specialized attention, and he was placed in special education classes, where he stayed for the remainder of his tenure in the Tewksbury schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC met another boy, RC, in his first grade special education class. Between first and fifth grade, SC reported to Ann Marie Porto various sexually-charged incidents with RC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Porto testified that she reported these incidents to Tewksbury teachers and administrators. In 1999, when SC was in the fifth grade, the Portos took him to see a psychologist, Dr. Bradford Smith, for counseling related to inappropriate sexual behavior at home. After his consultation with SC, Dr. Smith informed the Portos that SC had told him that he and RC had been engaging in oral sex on the school bus since October 1998. The Portos reported this to Tewksbury public school administrators and to the Massachusetts Department of Social Services. In response, the school put SC and RC on different buses and instructed teachers and school aides to keep SC and RC separated and to monitor their interaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the sixth grade, there was only one additional reported incident involving SC and RC, in which RC allegedly touched SC on the buttocks and SC elbowed him in response. The school separated SC and RC and gave SC detention. Apart from this incident, Ann Marie Porto testified that she perceived that SC enjoyed school during his sixth grade year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2000, SC entered the seventh grade at Wynn Middle School. SC spent a large part of the day in a life skills class with six other children, one of whom was RC. The life skills class was team taught, with one teacher covering language arts and math in the morning, and a different teacher covering social studies and science in the afternoon. Although there were three different classroom aides who at various times helped with the class, all three were not typically assigned to the class at a given time, and one often accompanied a child who was in a wheelchair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to school officials, there were three incidents in October 2000 that involved inappropriate touching between RC and SC. Two of the incidents occurred in the life skills class room. Both incidents involved RC touching SC's leg while they were sitting next to each other. In one instance, an aide ordered SC and RC to separate, and they complied. In another, an aide sat down between SC and RC to keep them apart. There was also a third incident, during gym class, when SC and RC were touching each other while sitting in the bleachers. Eleanor Edelstein, RC and SC's language arts and math teacher, testified that she heard a verbal description of one of the classroom incidents involving inappropriate touching under a workstation table.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the third incident, the boys were sent to the school guidance counselor, William Traveis. Traveis instructed the boys that this type of behavior was inappropriate. According to Traveis, the boys apologized and told him that they would not do it again. Traveis testified that he thought the boys understood the discussion, and that he told teachers and aides to monitor them and keep them separated. No additional incidents were reported to the school until January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 11, 2001, RC asked Edelstein for permission to go to the bathroom, and Edelstein excused him. A short time later, SC asked Edelstein if he could get a book from his locker. No aide was present at the time to accompany either RC or SC. There is no evidence that either boy had previously misled Edelstein with respect to similar requests. Edelstein allowed SC to leave the classroom. After two or three minutes, Edelstein noticed that neither of the boys had returned. She stepped out into the hall to look for them, but did not see them. While in the hall, Edelstein spotted Robert Ware, the Behavior Management Facilitator at Wynn Middle School, and asked him to go into the bathroom to investigate. Ware entered the bathroom and discovered SC and RC in a stall, pulling their pants up. Ware took the students to his office and asked them what they had been doing. SC told Ware that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with RC, and that he and RC had been touching each other on a weekly basis for some time. Ware informed James McGuire, the principal of Wynn Middle School, about the incident. McGuire called SC's parents, told them what had happened, and asked them to pick up SC from school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SC did not return to school after the incident with RC. Between January and October 2001, SC remained at home, receiving ten hours of tutoring per week. In October 2001, SC was hospitalized for a month for behavioral problems, during which time SC attempted to commit suicide. From November 2001 until February 2002, SC participated in a daytime academic and counseling program at the Bournewood Hospital. Finally, in February 2002, SC was sent to a residential treatment program outside of the Tewksbury school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos filed suit against Tewksbury on January 5, 2004, alleging that, because it was deliberately indifferent to RC's sexual harassment of SC, Tewksbury had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1681 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The case proceeded to a jury trial, which lasted from October 3 until October 21, 2005.

The court denied Tewksbury's motion, and after one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Portos, awarding $250,000 in compensatory damages and $1 in punitive damages. Tewksbury then filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), again arguing that the Portos had failed to satisfy their burden on any element of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court denied the motion by written order on April 28, 2006.

Finally, the harassment must be \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.\" <i>Id.</i> at 650, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, the plaintiff must show (1) that he or she was subject to \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" sexual harassment by a school peer, and (2) that the harassment caused the plaintiff to be deprived of educational opportunities or benefits. Even then, <i>Davis</i> restricts a funding recipient's liability under Title IX for student-on-student sexual harassment to situations where (3) it knew of the harassment, (4) in its programs or activities and (5) it was deliberately indifferent to the harassment such that its response (or lack thereof) is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume (without deciding) that SC was subject to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment by RC, that Tewksbury is a funding recipient and had actual knowledge in 2001 of at least some prior incidents of inappropriate sexual behavior, and that the harassment deprived SC of educational opportunities or benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Even making these assumptions, we do not think that the Portos presented sufficient evidence such that a rational jury could have concluded that Tewksbury was <i>deliberately indifferent</i> to the harassment of SC. The Portos argue that Tewksbury was told on multiple occasions that RC was harassing SC, but that the school did nothing more than temporarily separate the boys. The Portos also note that in spite of Tewksbury's knowledge of the prior sexual harassment, RC and SC were allowed to have unsupervised access to each other at times. The Portos contend that, given the history of sexual harassment between RC and SC that culminated in the school-bus incident in fifth grade, Tewksbury should have not allowed SC to go to his locker alone while RC was in the bathroom. The Portos point to evidence of a prior directive from Tewksbury to teachers and aides that RC and SC not be allowed to travel alone together in or outside the school building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the Portos' argument is that it suggests only that Tewksbury perhaps should have done more to prevent RC from sexually harassing SC. However, a claim that the school system could or should have done more is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference; in the Title IX context, \"funding recipients are deemed deliberately indifferent to acts of student-on-student harassment only where the recipient's response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" <i>Davis,</i> 526 U.S. at 648, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1661</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court has described deliberate indifference as \"a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a <i>known or obvious</i> consequence of his action\" or inaction. <i>Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 410, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1997) (emphasis added). Thus, before holding a municipality liable for a police officer's excessive force, we have required plaintiffs to prove that the municipality knew that the excessive force would be a \"plainly obvious consequence\" of hiring the officer. <i>Crete v. City of Lowell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201758\"><a href=\"/opinion/201758/crete-v-city-of-lowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>see also Young v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1382</span></a></span>). Likewise, in <i>Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayag&#252;ez,</i> we found that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of deliberate indifference by a supervisor where a municipal employee turned city hall into the campaign headquarters for a candidate, with the obvious consequence that employees who were supporters of the rival candidate would feel that they had been discriminated against in violation of their First Amendment rights. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). In the educational setting, we have suggested that a school might be deliberately indifferent to a teacher's sexual harassment of a student where it had notice of the sexual harassment, and either did nothing or failed to take additional reasonable measures after it learned that its initial remedies were ineffective. <i>Wills v. Brown Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765225\"><a href=\"/opinion/765225/marketa-wills-v-brown-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos do not claim that Tewksbury did nothing to address RC's sexual harassment of SC. They acknowledge that Tewksbury separated SC and RC after each episode of sexual harassment and later had the school guidance counselor intervene. <i>Compare with Doe ex rel. A.N. v. E. Haven Bd. of Educ.,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 46, 49 (2d Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (finding deliberate indifference where \"alleged victim of a rape complained of verbal harassment based on her sex and related to the rape for five weeks before authorities took concrete action to get the perpetrators of the harassment to stop\"). Rather, the Portos claim that these measures were ineffective. There is no doubt that the bathroom incident is evidence that RC's inappropriate sexual behavior was not abated. However, the fact that measures designed to stop harassment prove later to be ineffective does not establish that the steps taken were clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances known by Tewksbury at the time. The test for whether a school should be liable under Title IX for student-on-student harassment is not one of effectiveness by hindsight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Portos' proof is inadequate on several different levels. First, there was no evidence presented at trial to suggest that Tewksbury knew or even suspected that when SC asked to go to his locker, he was really going to go to the bathroom to meet RC. The Portos suggest that because SC was mentally disabled, it would have been prudent to have had a teacher's aide accompany him to his locker. However, this suggests only that Tewksbury may have been negligent; to prove deliberate indifference, the Portos had to show at least that Tewksbury <i>knew</i> that the failure to accompany SC to his locker would lead to SC following RC to the bathroom and that there was a high degree of risk that SC would be subject there to inappropriate sexual behavior by RC. Edelstein offered uncontradicted testimony that the boys had never given a \"reason for [her] to ever question that they couldn't be trusted going to the bathroom or going to a locker,\" and that she \"trusted that they would follow the rules.\" Thus, there was no evidence that anyone had a reason to suspect that SC intended to deceive Edelstein when he asked for permission to visit his locker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, there was no evidence that the school knew or that it was obvious that RC would continue to sexually harass SC after October 2000. To put the Portos' claim in context, it is important to note that between March 1999 and October 2000, there was only one alleged minor incident of sexual harassment. Apart from this, according to Ann Marie Porto, SC was generally happy at school and had no problems, and there was no evidence that Tewksbury was aware of any additional problems during this time. It was not until October 2000 that RC's inappropriate touching resumed. The first two times this occurred, the school separated the boys. After the third instance of inappropriate touching, school officials sent the boys to talk to Traveis, the school counselor. RC and SC spoke with Traveis, who testified that it was his understanding that the boys knew that what they were doing was wrong, and that they promised not to do it again. It was reasonable for Tewksbury to conclude that this intervention worked: there was no evidence presented that Tewksbury was aware of any further sexual harassment by RC between Traveis's intervention in October 2000 and the January 11, 2001 incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even the Portos' expert, Dr. Dragan, testified only that Tewksbury could have done more. Thus, there was no evidence from which it could be inferred that Tewksbury had reason to believe that RC was continuing to sexually harass SC. In other words, further sexual harassment, much less sexual intercourse, was not a \"known or obvious consequence\" of Tewksbury's failure to accompany SC to his locker on January 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, this is not a case, as the Portos contend, where a school \"continued to use the same ineffective methods to no acknowledged avail.\" <i>Vance v. Spencer County Pub. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770974\"><a href=\"/opinion/770974/steven-vance-minor-by-and-through-his-mother-deborah-vance-alma-mcgowen/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 262 (6th Cir. 2000). By all indications, Tewksbury's methods were working: until January 11, 2001, Tewksbury was not aware that RC had been engaging in any further sexual harassment after October 2000. Nor is this case analogous to <i>Williams v. Board of Regents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77594\"><a href=\"/opinion/77594/tiffany-williams-v-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span> (11th Cir. 2007), where the Eleventh Circuit found that the plaintiff had adequately alleged that University of Georgia was deliberately indifferent when it failed to properly instruct or supervise a student athlete who had recently been accused of sexual harassment while attending another institution. In <i>Williams,</i> prior to attending the University of Georgia, a student athlete had been disciplined by two colleges for sexual assault and sexual harassment. <i>Id.</i> at 1290. Thus, recent history suggested that the interventions by the student's former schools&#8212;dismissal of the student from one school and dismissal from the other's basketball team&#8212;had not been successful in curbing the student's inappropriate sexual behavior. Based on her claims that the defendants failed to properly instruct or supervise the student to make sure that he did not sexually assault persons affiliated with the university, the plaintiff adequately alleged that the defendants exhibited \"deliberate indifference\" to an obvious consequence of their inaction, <i>i.e.,</i> another sexual assault. <i>Id.</i> at 1296. In the present case, the evidence clearly shows that after Traveis's intervention, Tewksbury reasonably believed that it had been successful in stopping RC's inappropriate behavior. Because continued sexual harassment was not a \"known or obvious consequence\" of the school's inaction as in <i>Vance</i> and <i>Williams,</i> Tewksbury cannot have been deliberately indifferent to SC's plight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More analogous to the situation in this case is <i>Gabrielle M. v. Park Forest-Chicago Heights, Illinois School District 163,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780412\"><a href=\"/opinion/780412/gabrielle-m-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-and-next-friend-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 2003). In <i>Gabrielle M.,</i> school officials initially suspended a boy who had been sexually harassing female classmates. <i>Id.</i> at 819. After the boy returned to school, administrators eventually allowed the boy to return to lunchtime and recess with the classmates, but asked aides to keep an eye on him. <i>Id.</i> at 819-20. The Seventh Circuit held that this was not an unreasonable response to the known risk that the boy might harass his classmates again: <i>Davis</i> [<i>v. Monroe County Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118290\"><a href=\"/opinion/118290/davis-v-monroe-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span> (1999)] does not require funding recipients to remedy peer harassment. <i>Davis</i> disapproved of a standard that would force funding recipients to suspend or expel every student accused of misconduct. All that <i>Davis</i> requires is that the school not act <i>clearly unreasonably</i> in response to known instances of harassment. Here, in light of each of the immediate disciplinary and preventative steps the school district had already taken in response to Jason's conduct, including most prominently the decisions to move him to another class entirely and eventually to grant Gabrielle's request for a school transfer, it was not clearly unreasonable as a matter of law initially to assign an instructor to oversee a communal recess and lunch period instead of immediately rescheduling the lunch and recess period for a whole kindergarten class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 825 (internal citations omitted). Likewise, Tewksbury acted reasonably in responding to RC's inappropriate touching by separating RC and SC and sending them to the guidance counselor. Thus, drawing all inferences favorable to the Portos, the evidence in this case overwhelmingly fails, as a matter of law, to demonstrate that Tewksbury acted with deliberate indifference in failing to address RC's sexual harassment of SC. Therefore, the Portos cannot prevail on their claim, and the district judge should have granted Tewksbury's motion for a directed verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand with instructions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of Tewksbury.

In addition, the Portos brought various Massachusetts law claims against Tewksbury, which were later dismissed, and the Portos do not appeal this decision.
