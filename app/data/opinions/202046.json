Jose Antonio Fusté, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     José J. Sánchez Vélez and Rafael A. Robles Díaz, Commonwealth\nof Puerto Rico, Department of Justice, Civil Rights Legal Task\nForce, with whom Yldefonso López Morales and O'Neill & Borges Law\nFirm were on brief, for appellants.\n     Claudio Aliff-Ortiz, with whom Pablo Landrau Pirazzi and\nAldarondo & López Bras were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                          February 6, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This is the latest in a series of\n\ncases    which     involve     the   tension    between    a    newly   elected\n\nadministration's ability to reorganize government, on the one hand,\n\nand, on the other hand, two constitutional limitations -- the First\n\nAmendment's prohibitions against discriminating against government\n\nemployees based on their political affiliation and the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth       Amendments'     prohibitions    against       depriving     such\n\nemployees of property interests in their employment without due\n\nprocess of law.\n\n           This court has had to address these tensions in cases,\n\nusually from Puerto Rico, in which the newly elected officials\n\nrepresent a particular party and the reorganization results in the\n\ntermination of employment of workers of another political party.\n\nSee, e.g., Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Angulo-Alvarez v. Aponte de la Torre, 170 F.3d 246 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   The mere fact that the impact falls mainly on members of\n\nthe party which has lost power is not, of course, sufficient to\n\nwarrant federal court interference with the policy choices of a new\n\nadministration which reflects the voters' choice that changes are\n\ndesirable.   Sanchez-Lopez, 375 F.3d at 140.          By the same token, a\n\nnew administration cannot cloak political discrimination merely by\n\nlabeling the change a legitimate reorganization.               Id. at 132.    Nor\n\nmay it deliberately effectuate a legitimate reorganization in a\n\npolitically discriminatory manner.           Id. at 140.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Here,   the   reorganization   involved    a   new   Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (PDP) administration in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico,\n\nheaded by defendant Mayor José R. Román-Abreu (Mayor Román).        The\n\nnew administration chose to \"privatize\" the sanitation division,\n\nwith the result that thirty-six career employees, almost all New\n\nProgressive Party (NPP) members, were laid off.       A jury found that\n\nthese career employees, as well as one non-career employee from a\n\ndifferent   department,   were   unconstitutionally   terminated   from\n\nemployment.    As to the career employees, the jury awarded a total\n\nof $887,097 compensatory damages against defendants Mayor Román and\n\nJuan A. Norat-Flores (\"Norat\"), the director of the Municipality's\n\nDepartment of Public Works; it also awarded $108,000 in punitive\n\ndamages against Mayor Román.      As to the one non-career employee,\n\nthe jury awarded $28,400 compensatory damages and $3,000 punitive\n\ndamages against Mayor Román.      The court, post-verdict, denied the\n\ndefendants qualified immunity, denied motions for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law and adjustment of damages, and ordered the career\n\nemployees reinstated.     We affirm the district court's judgment in\n\nfull.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            Mayor Román and Norat appeal on five grounds. They argue\n\nthat (1) there was insufficient evidence as to causation to support\n\na finding of political discrimination, (2) both defendants were\n\nentitled to qualified immunity, (3) the district court abused its\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdiscretion in ordering the career employees reinstated, (4) the\n\ncompensatory damages were excessive, and (5) the punitive damages\n\nagainst Mayor Román were unwarranted.          We recount the facts in\n\nfavor of the verdict as a reasonable jury could have found them.\n\nWhitfield v. Melendez-Rivera, 431 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nA.         The Career Employees\n\n           Román was elected mayor of the Municipality of San\n\nLorenzo on November 7, 2000, and took office on January 9, 2001.\n\nHe defeated incumbent NPP Mayor Víctor Figueroa Orozco.             He then\n\nappointed Norat, previously a Public Works employee in another\n\ncity, to head San Lorenzo's Department of Public Works.                  The\n\nDepartment had several divisions, including sanitation, which was\n\nresponsible for garbage collection and other cleaning tasks.\n\n           Soon after taking office, Mayor Román and other municipal\n\nofficials,    including     Norat,     began   planning      the   possible\n\nprivatization of the sanitation division.          The officials testified\n\nthat they did so because of lackluster garbage collection, and that\n\nthey   conducted    a   cost-benefit    analysis    and   determined   that\n\nprivatization would save San Lorenzo hundreds of thousands of\n\ndollars a year. However, two PDP-affiliated witnesses -- plaintiff\n\nSamuel Borges Colón (\"Borges\"), a former sanitation supervisor, and\n\nSandra   González   Díaz   (\"González\"),   defendant      Iraida   Hornedo's\n\npredecessor as municipal human resources director -- testified that\n\nMayor Román had said in their presence that the privatization plan\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas a device to force NPP workers out of government employment.\n\nFurther, González testified that in privatizing the sanitation\n\ndivision, the Municipality did not follow its 1997 Layoff Plan,\n\nwhich required that transitory workers be fired first in the event\n\nof layoffs.    She testified that Mayor Román and \"other fellow\n\nofficers . . . [and] ranking employees\" had said that \"with this\n\nprivatization process, they were going to be able to get rid of\n\nemployees that were not belonging to the political party of the\n\npeople in power.\" She also testified, based on her experience as\n\nmunicipal human resources director, that the criteria used to\n\nappoint personnel in San Lorenzo after Mayor Román took office were\n\nas follows: \"[t]o be affiliated with the PDP, to be acquaintances\n\nof the mayor or relatives of the mayor, to be friends with some\n\nhigh-ranking functionary.\"\n\n           Borges testified that soon after the mayoral election he\n\nmet with Mayor Román, who told him \"that he needed me there at\n\npublic works, to help him, because the first thing he wanted to do\n\nwas to take the NPP's out of the municipality.\"   Asked about Mayor\n\nRomán's attitude toward public works employees, Borges testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n           A: Well, his attitude was that, since they\n           were NPP's, he didn't want them there.\n\n           Q: And how did you know that?\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f          A: Because they would tell me, the engineer\n          would tell me,[1] Mr. Martin Davila would tell\n          me, that they wanted to get rid of the NPP\n          employees in order to place Popular Democratic\n          Party followers.\n\n          Q: When, if at any time, did the mayor tell\n          you that those were his intentions after he\n          became mayor of San Lorenzo, you know?\n\n          A: On numerous occasions at Public Works, when\n          we would meet with Mr. Norat.\n\n          Q: Do you recall what were his words?\n\n          A: That he had to get rid of the NPP employees\n          because he had to place his people.\n\n          In the summer of 2001, Norat took the privatization\n\nproposal and the favorable cost-benefit analysis to the Municipal\n\nAssembly for approval.   On August 30, 2001, the Assembly approved\n\nMunicipal Ordinance No. 7 (\"the ordinance\"), authorizing Mayor\n\nRomán to negotiate the privatization of the sanitation division.\n\nMayor Román signed the ordinance the next day.\n\n          In the ordinance, the Municipal Assembly set conditions\n\non the privatization process.    It stated that the company with\n\nwhich the Municipality contracted for privatization had to agree,\n\nwhen hiring, \"to consider all of the municipal employees who\n\nqualify within their standards of selection of employees pursuant\n\nto its Human Resources regulations.\"      It also added a second\n\nrequirement:\n\n\n\n1\n    Norat is an engineer.      Throughout the trial transcript,\nwitnesses refer to him as \"Engineer Norat\" and \"the engineer.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\f           The remaining employees belonging to the\n           sanitation area will be retained in their\n           positions or will be relocated to other\n           dependencies of the municipality pursuant to\n           the needs of the service. . . .\n\n           The Municipality of San Lorenzo agrees to\n           protect and guarantee the vested rights of the\n           regular employees who are working in the\n           Department of Sanitation.\n\n           The city began soliciting privatization proposals.                 Five\n\ncompanies submitted proposals; the municipal bids board selected a\n\nfirm   called     ARB   and   arranged     for      ARB   to    take   over    the\n\nMunicipality's sanitation service.\n\n           On January 23, 2002, Mayor Román wrote a letter to\n\nthirty-six      sanitation    employees      (the     \"career     plaintiffs\"),\n\ninforming them that their jobs were terminated effective February\n\n25.    Though the events leading up to privatization had taken\n\nmonths, this was the career plaintiffs' first official notice of\n\npotential privatization or its possible effect on their jobs.                  Of\n\nthe thirty-six career plaintiffs, thirty-five were affiliated with\n\nthe NPP,2 while the last, Borges, was a PDP member who had had a\n\nfalling-out with Mayor Román over Borges' sympathy for NPP co-\n\nworkers.   Most of the career plaintiffs testified that Mayor Román\n\nknew   their    political     affiliation,    either      because      they   were\n\n\n\n2\n   Thirty-five of the career plaintiffs, as well as transitory\nemployee plaintiff Sheidi N. Hernández Morales, testified about\ntheir political affiliation and activities. One career plaintiff\nhad died by the time of trial; his daughter testified on his behalf\nthat he had been an NPP member.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fneighbors or because Mayor Román had seen them participating in NPP\n\nelectioneering activities.\n\n           The January 23 letter, signed by Mayor Román, stated:\n\n           As a result of the privatization . . . the\n           sanitation program of the Municipal Department\n           of Public Works is eliminated, which entails\n           the lay-off and elimination of all the\n           positions assigned to said program.\n\n           Pursuant to the above, you are laid off from\n           your position effective February 25, 2002.\n           You have 30 days as of the date of this\n           communication to appeal this decision before\n           the Board of Appeals of the Personnel System\n           of the Government.\n\nThe   letter   also   stated,    however,     that   the   ordinance     and   the\n\ncontract between San Lorenzo and ARB \"provide[] for the recruitment\n\nand job security of the personnel affected by this negotiation.\"\n\nIt added that \"[t]he Municipality will coordinate this process and\n\nwill notify the day and time of the job interviews.\"\n\n           All of the affected workers were \"career employees.\"\n\nUnder   Puerto   Rico   law,    as   career   employees,    they   had    vested\n\nproperty rights in their jobs and, in general terms, could only be\n\nremoved for cause and were entitled to procedural due process\n\nprotections.3    In this case, the 1997 Layoff Plan, which required\n\n\n3\n   Some government employees in Puerto Rico are classified as\n\"career\" or \"permanent,\" which is \"the equivalent of having job\ntenure with attendant vested property rights.\" Vázquez-Valentín v.\nSantiago-Díaz, 385 F.3d 23, 27 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\nGonzález-De-Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377 F.3d 81, 86 (1st Cir.\n2004). An alternative classification, \"contract\" or \"transitory,\"\nmeans employment is under a short-term contract and does not carry\nproperty rights. See Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547, 553\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthat transitory workers be fired before such career workers in the\n\nevent layoffs were necessary, was not followed.4\n\n             The January 23 letter was delivered to most of the career\n\nplaintiffs at a meeting on January 25, 2002, at the Priscilla\n\nFlores Theater.     San Lorenzo's new director of human resources,\n\nHornedo,5 spoke to the workers, telling them that the Municipality\n\nhad set up a process to help them get jobs with ARB.     Hornedo also\n\ntold the career plaintiffs that if any of them had questions or\n\nconcerns, they could come to her office to talk with her and review\n\ntheir personnel files.       The career plaintiffs were given ARB\n\napplications during this meeting, and some filled them out and\n\nsubmitted them on the spot.      Unemployment officials attended the\n\nmeeting, bringing along unemployment benefits forms for them to\n\nfill out.6\n\n\n\n(1st Cir. 2003). We do not delve into the complexities of Puerto\nRico law on layoff of career employees.\n4\n   As of January 9, 2001, San Lorenzo had seventy-one transitory\nemployees. Plaintiffs' counsel stated during opening argument that\nthe Román administration had hired at least 214 more since taking\noffice in January 2001. Testimony confirmed the existence of well\nover one hundred such transitory hires.\n5\n    González had left the job in December 2001.\n6\n   Even though the career plaintiffs' jobs were not technically\nterminated until February 25, 2002, they had already worked their\nlast shift. Norat told them that, instead of reporting to work,\nthey should stay home and they would be paid anyway as compensatory\ntime.   During the weeks prior to February 25, ARB provided San\nLorenzo with sanitation service, even though the career plaintiffs\nwere still on the payroll.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          During the months that followed, a few of the career\n\nplaintiffs   obtained   jobs    with   ARB.7    Most,    however,   found\n\nthemselves without jobs either at ARB or within the Municipality.\n\nSome testified that they approached Hornedo and asked her to find\n\nthem other jobs in the Municipality; she told them no jobs were\n\navailable.    One career plaintiff, Raul Galarza Santana, said\n\nHornedo told him she had spoken to Mayor Román, and the Mayor \"had\n\nsaid there was no chance for me being rehired.\"           Another career\n\nplaintiff, Ivan Rosa-Rivera, said Hornedo told him: \"I am deeply\n\nsorry.   This decision has already been taken.          These are orders\n\ncoming from above, and you are dismissed from your work.\"           Mayor\n\nRomán was in charge of all personnel decisions in the Municipality.\n\n          Many of the career plaintiffs also testified that they\n\nfilled out applications with ARB but were never offered jobs or\n\ncontacted for interviews.      Others testified that they were offered\n\njobs at ARB, but under conditions that made the jobs difficult or\n\nimpossible to accept.    The offered jobs were in Cataño and other\n\ntowns some distance from San Lorenzo.      Some had no way to get there\n\nfor work; others said ARB offered to pick them up in San Lorenzo\n\n\n\n7\n  Six career plaintiffs testified that they worked for ARB at some\npoint. Of those, one testified that he quit after one day because\nof the working conditions, while two others worked for ARB for\nseveral months. Three of the career plaintiffs held jobs with ARB\nat the time of trial; however, there was testimony that one of\nthose three was fired for missing work to testify at the trial,\nwhile a second had been told he would be fired for the same reason.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fand drive them back and forth, but that that would mean getting up\n\nat 2 or 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m. -- a twenty-hour day.\n\nOne of the career plaintiffs, David de Jesus-Santa, testified that\n\nhe took the Cataño job, managed to get ARB to transfer him to San\n\nLorenzo for two months, but was then told he would be assigned to\n\nCataño again; he quit because he had no way to get there.   Another,\n\nRafael Martinez-Santana, testified that when he approached Juan\n\nReyes Burgos, the president of ARB, to ask for work, Burgos told\n\nhim that \"he would give me work, but not in San Lorenzo; that the\n\nmayor [Román] had told him to give me work, but not in San Lorenzo.\n\nHe did not want me in San Lorenzo.\"\n\n           Other evidence also established a political motivation\n\nfor the elimination of the career plaintiffs' positions.     Borges\n\ntestified that at least four of the five former sanitation workers\n\nwho kept their jobs with the Municipality after the privatization\n\nwere PDP-affiliated.8    Well over one hundred of the transitory\n\nmunicipal workers hired by the Román administration were PDP-\n\naffiliated.   One witness testified he could not identify any NPP\n\nhires among a list of all the new transitory employees.     Various\n\ncareer plaintiffs testified that the Municipality made no attempt\n\nto offer them these transitory jobs, even when they were qualified\n\nfor the positions.\n\n\n\n\n8\n    He did not identify the party affiliation of the fifth worker.\n\n                               -11-\n\f           Further, some of the plaintiffs testified that, while\n\ntheir job descriptions were technically eliminated, PDP loyalists\n\nwere hired and took over their job duties under different titles.\n\nFor example, career plaintiff Benito Claudio-Figueroa testified\n\nthat he was a heavy vehicle and equipment supervisor, and that a\n\nman whom he knew to be a PDP member was performing his old job for\n\nthe Municipality, under the new title \"Deputy Director of Public\n\nWorks.\" Finally, a number of career plaintiffs testified that they\n\nhad been employed elsewhere in the Department of Public Works prior\n\nto the Román administration, but had been asked by Norat to switch\n\nto   sanitation   in   2001,      after   Mayor   Román's     election.         These\n\nplaintiffs all testified that they were not offered their old\n\npositions back, and most testified that those positions were filled\n\nby workers they knew to be PDP loyalists.\n\n           The only non-NPP member among the thirty-six terminated\n\ncareer   plaintiffs,        Borges,   testified        that   despite     his     PDP\n\naffiliation, he opposed political firings and said as much to\n\nNorat,   the   head    of   the   Department      of   Public   Works.      Borges\n\ntestified that on August 17, 2001, Norat told Borges that the Mayor\n\nwas unhappy with Borges because Borges supposedly had met with a\n\ngroup of NPP employees who were suing the Municipality in a\n\nseparate action.       Borges was placed on twenty days' compensatory\n\nleave.   He was placed on another leave later in the year, and in\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fDecember, he testified, he returned from an illness to find that\n\nhis supervisory duties had been reassigned to a PDP loyalist.\n\n             Borges was among the employees terminated via the January\n\n23, 2002 letter.       After the meeting at the Flores Theater, he\n\napproached ARB official Burgos and told him he was available to\n\nwork for ARB.      He testified that Burgos told him \"that he was\n\nsorry, that he could not give me work about the municipality of San\n\nLorenzo because the Honorable Mayor had told him that . . . he\n\ncould not offer work to any of the people who had been dismissed;\n\nthat he could give me work, but in the municipality of Cataño.\"\n\nWhen Burgos told him the arrangement -- that he would be picked up\n\nat 3 a.m., driven to Cataño, and then driven back to San Lorenzo at\n\nnight -- Borges \"told [Burgos] that schedule would be impossible\n\nfor me because that would mean being away from my home almost all\n\nday and night.\"     Borges also approached Hornedo and asked her to\n\nreevaluate his case.     He testified that Hornedo told him that \"she\n\nhad orders from the mayor that there was no more work for me.\"\n\nB.           The Non-Career Employee\n\n             The other plaintiff in this appeal, Sheidi N. Hernández\n\nMorales (\"Hernández\"), was differently situated.           She was first\n\nhired by the Municipality of San Lorenzo under a transitory, or\n\ncontract, appointment effective July 1, 1993.         Thereafter, she was\n\nappointed to various transitory positions in San Lorenzo over the\n\nnext   six    years,   though   the    appointments    were   not   always\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fconsecutive.   In July 1999, she was hired for a six-month position\n\nas a Social Worker in the Municipality's Childcare Network; she\n\nreceived an excellent evaluation.   Her contract as a Social Worker\n\nwas renewed in January 2000 and again in July 2000 and January\n\n2001.   The last of these contracts was due to expire on September\n\n30, 2001.   On September 17, 2001, Hernández received a letter from\n\nMayor Román telling her to make arrangements with her supervisor to\n\nuse her accumulated leave time during the rest of the month.\n\nThereafter, her contract was not renewed.\n\n            While Hernández was not a career employee and had no\n\nproperty interest in her job protectable under the Due Process\n\nClause, she did produce evidence that her position continued to\n\nexist and was filled by a PDP member, and this resulted from\n\ndiscrimination against her based on party affiliation.   González,\n\nthe former human resources director, testified that Mayor Román\n\nknew that Hernández was affiliated with the NPP.         Asked why\n\nHernández' appointment was not renewed, González replied: \"Every\n\nday, [Hernández' supervisor] Ms. Carmen Contrerras . . . was\n\npublicly stating, both in meetings and out of meetings, asking when\n\nshe was going to be able to get rid of the two NPP affiliates who\n\nwere in her office.\"   Mayor Román made all personnel decisions in\n\nthe Municipality while González worked in his administration, a\n\nperiod lasting from January to December 2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f            Plaintiff     Hernández     testified    that      after    the   PDP\n\nelectoral victory, the work atmosphere in her division of municipal\n\ngovernment became uncomfortable and hostile.                   Contrerras, her\n\nsupervisor at the Childcare Network, harassed the NPP employees in\n\nthe     office,    telling   them     that    they   were      from    the    past\n\nadministration and that the new administration was \"going to make\n\na big change.\"       Contrerras told Hernández her contract was not\n\nbeing renewed because of lack of funds.              But there was evidence\n\nthat was not true: a co-worker in accounting told Hernandez that\n\n\"there was going to be more funds, and, in fact, the salaries might\n\neven be raised.\"      Eventually, PDP-affiliated employees were hired\n\nto replace Hernández and three other NPP-affiliated transitory\n\nemployees who had not received new contracts.\n\nC.          Testimony of Defendants\n\n            The defendants, Mayor Román, Norat, and Hornedo, gave a\n\nmarkedly different version of events.             They testified that soon\n\nafter    Mayor    Román   took   office,     conditions   in   the     sanitation\n\ndivision began to deteriorate noticeably: the number of citizen\n\ncomplaints about trash service skyrocketed, and garbage trucks\n\nbegan breaking down with more frequency.9                 This crisis, they\n\ntestified, was what spurred the decision to transfer workers from\n\n\n9\n   This deterioration coincided, however, with the Municipality's\ndecision to let the contracts of at least fifteen transitory\nsanitation workers expire; according to at least one witness, that\ncaused a labor shortage that led to the decline in the quality of\nservice.\n\n                                      -15-\n\felsewhere in Public Works into sanitation, as well as the eventual\n\ndecision to privatize sanitation.           The defense also pointed to the\n\nordinance adopted by the Municipal Assembly, which cited a desire\n\nto offer \"a better quality of service\" as one reason to privatize.\n\n            Mayor      Román    and    Norat        testified       that   political\n\naffiliation had nothing to do with the privatization decision or\n\nits execution.      Indeed, Mayor Román testified that he did not know\n\nplaintiff     Hernández,    and   as   to     the    career     plaintiffs,    Norat\n\ntestified that city leaders pondering privatization considered it\n\n\"nonnegotiable\" that whoever won the contract had to hire all of\n\nthe displaced workers.         Hornedo testified that the administration\n\nfully intended to coordinate the displaced career plaintiffs'\n\nhiring with ARB, and to rehire those who did not find ARB jobs; she\n\ntestified that most of the career plaintiffs never approached them\n\nseeking jobs and never completed the ARB hiring process.                   However,\n\nMayor Román admitted on cross-examination that the January 23, 2002\n\ntermination letter did not tell the employees about the process\n\nthey would have to use to seek ARB employment and did not tell them\n\nthat   they    could    seek    reemployment         with     the    Municipality.10\n\nFurthermore, while Hornedo testified that several of the career\n\nplaintiffs returned to ask the Municipality for jobs and were\n\n\n10\n    This testimony dovetailed with that of many of the career\nplaintiffs, who expressed bewilderment when asked on cross-\nexamination whether they had approached the Municipality and asked\nto be rehired. Said one: \"I mean, no. They fired me. If they\nfired me, how can they give me a job?\"\n\n                                       -16-\n\foffered   positions,        she    admitted     that    those    positions      were\n\ntransitory     --    much   less   desirable     than   the     career   jobs    the\n\nplaintiffs had previously held.11\n\n          Mayor Román offered the defense that he relied on legal\n\nadvice.   He testified that he sought the advice of González and a\n\nmunicipal attorney in deciding how to proceed with privatization;\n\nhe said they advised him that he should not follow the 1997 Layoff\n\nPlan, but instead should follow the new municipal ordinance and\n\nmake sure the displaced workers were guaranteed employment with\n\nARB.   González contradicted this testimony.               She testified that\n\nearly in Mayor Román's term, he called her into his office and\n\nasked her to bring a list of Public Works employees.                 He told her\n\nto read the list and cross off the names he indicated; he explained\n\nthat \"he was going to get rid of some public works employees at the\n\ntime of the privatization.\"            González testified that she \"told\n\n[Román]   to    be     careful     with   the    new    lawsuit     [a   separate\n\ndiscrimination complaint concerning other employees], and that we\n\nhad to follow the processes established by law.\"                    She said he\n\nreplied, \"I'm . . . the mayor and I make the decisions.\"                 González\n\nalso testified that she thought the 1997 Layoff Plan should have\n\nbeen followed, that she was not consulted as to details of the\n\n\n\n11\n   Hornedo testified that one fired worker, a Mr. Ventura Gomez,\naccepted a transitory position with the Municipality.    Ventura\nGomez was not among the career plaintiffs, and his political\naffiliation is not clear from the record.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fprivatization, and that the reason the Layoff Plan was not followed\n\nwas that \"the mayor didn't want to use it.\"             The attorney upon\n\nwhose advice Mayor Román said he relied did not testify.\n\n           Mayor Román also denied saying anything to Borges about\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliations.        In fact, the Mayor testified,\n\nit was Borges who first suggested privatization to him.               Borges\n\ntestified to the contrary.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           On May 24, 2002, the thirty-six career plaintiffs, along\n\nwith Hernández and two other former municipal employees,12 filed\n\nsuit against Mayor Román, Norat, Hornedo, and the Municipality.\n\nTheir   complaint,   filed   under    42   U.S.C.   §   1983   and   related\n\nprovisions of Puerto Rico law, alleged as to every plaintiff that\n\n(1) the three defendants had terminated them in violation of their\n\ndue process rights, and (2) the terminations of their employment\n\nwere based on political affiliation and were therefore also in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment rights.\n\n           Jury trial commenced on October 1, 2003, and ended on\n\nNovember 10, 2003.     At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the\n\ndefense moved for Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 judgment as a matter of law on\n\nall issues. The district court granted the motion as to Hernández'\n\npolitical discrimination claims against Norat and Hornedo, but\n\n\n\n12\n   The jury found for the defense as to these two plaintiffs, and\nthey do not appeal. We do not discuss them further.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fallowed her political discrimination claim to go forward against\n\nthe Mayor.     The court otherwise denied the motion, leaving the\n\ncareer plaintiffs' due process and political discrimination claims\n\nintact.\n\n          On    November   7,   2003,    at   the   close   of   testimony,\n\ndefendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law on\n\nthe remaining issues -- Hernández' political discrimination claim\n\nagainst Mayor Román and the career plaintiffs' due process and\n\npolitical discrimination claims against all the defendants.           They\n\nargued that Hernández had not proved that the Mayor even knew her\n\npolitical affiliation, and that her position was not filled for\n\nmonths after the non-renewal of her contract; thus, they argued,\n\nthere was a failure of evidence as to political discrimination. As\n\nto the career plaintiffs, the defense argued that (1) Norat could\n\nnot be held liable because there had been no evidence establishing\n\nthat he had a say in the decision to terminate the sanitation\n\nworkers, and (2) all defendants could not be held liable because\n\nthe privatization decision stemmed from public health concerns, not\n\npolitical discrimination, and because the Mayor relied on legal\n\nadvice in deciding what shape privatization should take.                The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion in full.\n\n          On November 10, 2003, the jury returned its verdicts. As\n\nto Hernández, the jury found Román liable and assessed compensatory\n\ndamages of $28,400 and punitive damages of $3,000.               As to the\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fthirty-six career plaintiffs, the jury found both Román and Norat\n\n(but not Hornedo) liable. It assessed compensatory damages against\n\nRomán and Norat in amounts ranging from $18,537 to $33,200 per\n\ncareer   plaintiff;      the    total   was    $887,097.     It    also   assessed\n\npunitive damages against Román only, in the amount of $3,000 per\n\ncareer plaintiff, for a total of $108,000.                 The verdict form the\n\njury was given did not ask it to indicate whether it was finding\n\nfor plaintiffs on due process grounds, First Amendment grounds, or\n\nboth.\n\n            On November 14, 2003, the district court entered judgment\n\nagainst Mayor Román and Norat in the amounts the jury had awarded.13\n\nIt   also   ordered     the    career   plaintiffs     reinstated      to    career\n\npositions at the Municipality, with the \"same salaries, benefits,\n\nseniority, and equivalent functions as they had before their\n\nillegal dismissal from employment.\"             The defendants renewed their\n\nRule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, submitted a Rule 59\n\nmotion requesting that the compensatory and punitive damages be\n\nremitted,     and    asked     the   district     court     to    reconsider    its\n\nreinstatement order.          These motions were denied.\n\n            On      appeal,    Mayor    Román    and   Norat      bring     several\n\nchallenges.      First, as to the thirty-six career plaintiffs, they\n\n\n\n13\n   While the Municipality itself was initially a defendant in this\ncase, it was not listed as such on the verdict form, the jury made\nno finding against the Municipality per se, and the district court\nentered judgment only against the Mayor and Norat.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fargue that (1) plaintiffs never demonstrated on the evidence a\n\nprima facie causal connection between their political affiliation\n\nand the termination of their employment; (2) the defense evidence\n\ncompelled a finding that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the privatization; and (3) even if some political animus\n\nhad been present, defendants still should prevail because the\n\nevidence showed that such animus was not the but-for cause of the\n\nprivatization. They also argue that both Mayor Román and Norat are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity. As to remedy, they argue that even\n\nif there were liability here, the district court's reinstatement\n\norder   was    inappropriate;   that   compensatory   damages   should   be\n\nremitted because of plaintiffs' failure to mitigate; and that\n\npunitive damages were unavailable on these facts as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n              As to Hernández, Mayor Román argues that she cannot\n\nsustain a First Amendment claim because there was no evidence of\n\npolitical animus as a cause of the non-renewal of her contract, and\n\nbecause Hernández' contract would not have been renewed in any\n\nevent since she was not qualified for her Social Worker position.\n\nHe also argues that Hernández' damages should have been remitted.\n\n              Plaintiffs argue first that defendants have waived most\n\nof their challenge because they failed to argue on appeal the issue\n\nof due process violation of the career plaintiffs' rights.           They\n\nargue that since the jury issued an undifferentiated verdict that\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fcould have rested on due process grounds, plaintiffs' silence\n\neffectively concedes due process liability and ends the case.\n\nAlternatively, they argue that all of defendants' assignments of\n\nerror as to qualified immunity, the finding of liability, the\n\namount of damages, and the reinstatement order are meritless.\n\n            Given the nature of the evidence and the remedies, we\n\nprefer to rest our holdings on First Amendment grounds and do not\n\nreach the due process question.\n\n                                   III.\n\nA.          Legal Standards\n\n            We review de novo the district court's denial of judgment\n\nas a matter of law.      The verdict must be upheld \"unless the facts\n\nand inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\n'point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that\n\na    reasonable   jury   could   not   have   [returned   the    verdict].'\"\n\nAcevedo-Diaz v.

Republican Party\n\nof Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 64, 75, 79 (1990) (political discrimination\n\nclaims may extend to hiring, promotions, transfers, and recalls\n\nafter layoffs); Branti v.

Plaintiffs who\n\nbring political discrimination claims bear the burden of \"producing\n\nsufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury\n\nreasonably may infer that plaintiffs' constitutionally protected\n\nconduct . . . was a 'substantial' or 'motivating' factor behind\n\ntheir dismissal.\"    Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d at 66.    \"Defendants then\n\ncarry the burden to establish . . . a nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nthe challenged action . . . .\"    Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,\n\n415 F.3d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Vázquez-Valentín, 385\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fF.3d at 30 (\"The defendant, of course, may offer rebuttal evidence\n\nto   attempt   to   disprove   that    political   affiliation   played   a\n\nsubstantial role in the adverse employment action.\").\n\n           There is a separate but related defense under the Mt.\n\nHealthy doctrine, Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977):\n\n           [E]ven if a plaintiff can demonstrate that her\n           political affiliation was a substantial factor\n           in the adverse employment action taken against\n           her, there is no constitutional violation if\n           the defendant can show both (i) that it would\n           have taken the same action in any event, and\n           (ii) that it would have taken that action for\n           reasons that are not unconstitutional.\n\nSanchez-Lopez, 375 F.3d at 124 (citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n\n286-87).   This affirmative defense ensures that a constitutional\n\nviolation will only be found where \"political discrimination was\n\nthe ultimate 'but for' cause of an adverse employment action.\" Id.\n\nat 125.    This is appropriate because, \"[a]s the Supreme Court\n\nnoted, to adopt a view of causation that focuses solely on whether\n\nprotected conduct played a part in an employment decision . . .\n\nwould put an 'employee in a better position as a result of the\n\nexercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have\n\noccupied [otherwise].'\" Id. at 131 (second alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 285).\n\n           The Mt. Healthy defense, then, is particularly important\n\nin these cases where a new administration reorganizes government in\n\nways which particularly disadvantage incumbent employees who belong\n\n                                      -24-\n\fto the party formerly in power.          These incumbent employees have no\n\nright to thwart the will of the voters that a new regime make\n\nchanges, if the new regime would have made those changes even in\n\nthe absence of any prohibited discrimination.\n\nB.            Political Discrimination and the Career Plaintiffs\n\n              The defendants argue that no reasonable juror could have\n\nfound political discrimination on these facts.                They point to the\n\ntestimony of Román and Norat that the sanitation division was\n\nprivatized      because    of   public    health   and    quality-of-service\n\nconcerns, and that political affiliation played no role in their\n\ndecisions. This, they argue, constitutes (1) evidence showing lack\n\nof discriminatory animus, (2) evidence of a non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the privatization, and (3) evidence sufficient to show,\n\nunder Mt. Healthy, that political discrimination was not the \"but-\n\nfor\" cause of the decision to eliminate career plaintiffs' jobs.\n\n              Defendants make two additional arguments.              First, they\n\npoint to the testimony that a system was in place to ensure that\n\nthe   fired    employees    were   rehired,   either     by    ARB   or   by   the\n\nMunicipality; they suggest this compels a conclusion that no\n\ndiscrimination was intended. Second, they argue that the municipal\n\nordinance authorizing privatization, and Román's testimony that he\n\nfollowed the advice of his human resources director and an attorney\n\nin devising the privatization process, show that both the decision\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fto privatize, and the decision to privatize in a way that cost the\n\ncareer plaintiffs their jobs, were free of discriminatory intent.\n\n          In our view, the case does not turn on the legitimacy of\n\na decision by a Municipality to privatize its sanitation division.\n\nTo be sure, the evidence presented some reasons to doubt such\n\nlegitimacy: the Mayor had expressed a desire to rid the Department\n\nof Public Works of NPP members, and to fill the jobs with PDP\n\nmembers, and he could not do so within the current structure, given\n\nthat the sanitation workers were protected as career employees\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.    Further, there is some evidence that the\n\nnew regime deliberately made matters worse in order to provoke a\n\nsanitation crisis which would justify a decision to privatize.\n\nStill, this might well be too fragile an underpinning to justify\n\nfederal intervention in a decision to privatize.\n\n          1.       Mayor Román\n\n          The verdict against Mayor Román, however, is easily\n\nsupported by the manner in which his administration implemented the\n\ndecision to privatize.     A jury could readily conclude that the\n\nRomán administration implemented privatization in a manner designed\n\nto discriminate.    The administration did so, or so a jury could\n\nfind, in violation of multiple separate requirements of local law:\n\n(1) two provisions of the municipal privatization ordinance, (2)\n\nthe previously adopted Layoff Plan, and (3) the procedural rights\n\nof career employees.     The municipal ordinance did not authorize\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fRomán to terminate the career plaintiffs' employment.            Instead, it\n\nrequired that the private sanitation firm consider the municipal\n\nsanitation workers for jobs, and that sanitation workers who did\n\nnot take jobs with the private firm be \"retained in their positions\n\nor . . . relocated to other dependencies of the municipality.\"           The\n\nordinance also stated that the Municipality agreed \"to protect and\n\nguarantee   the   vested   rights\"    of    the   career   plaintiffs.   The\n\nprivatization system Román and Norat actually implemented did\n\nneither of these things.       As to the 1997 Layoff Plan, González\n\ntestified that it applied to privatizations and that she advised\n\nthe Mayor to follow the law, and Mayor Román himself conceded that\n\nif the Layoff Plan applied, transitory workers had to be laid off\n\nbefore any career employee.      The jury could easily conclude that\n\npolitical motivation was a substantial reason and, indeed, the but-\n\nfor reason for the decisions not to follow these laws.\n\n            In addition, there were explicit statements by Mayor\n\nRomán of an intent to discriminate.           González testified that the\n\nMayor said that \"with this privatization process, they were going\n\nto be able to get rid of employees that were not belonging to the\n\npolitical party of the people in power.\"           She also testified that\n\nRomán said the Layoff Plan was ignored because it would have been\n\nan obstacle to firing NPP workers. Others testified that the Mayor\n\nwent so far as to instruct ARB officials not to offer the fired\n\nworkers jobs in San Lorenzo.\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f            Further, the Mayor took the stand, and on important\n\nquestions where his testimony was flatly contradicted by other\n\nwitnesses, the jury could easily have concluded his testimony was\n\nnot credible.     Mayor Román testified that discrimination played no\n\nrole in the privatization decision.              But the jury also heard\n\ntestimony that Román believed (correctly) that the sanitation\n\ndivision    was     a    nest   of     NPP-affiliated   workers,     and    that\n\ndiscrimination did play a role in the decision to privatize.\n\n            Mayor       Román   also     testified   that   he     shaped    the\n\nprivatization plan in reliance on advice from his human resources\n\ndirector and attorney. Here, too, a reasonable jury could conclude\n\nthat Mayor Román's testimony was deliberately untrue: his human\n\nresources director, González, testified both that she did not in\n\nfact give Mayor Román such advice and that Mayor Román structured\n\nthe privatization plan the way he did specifically so he could fire\n\nNPP-affiliated workers.         The defendants also failed to call as a\n\nwitness the attorney on whose legal advice the Mayor purportedly\n\nrelied.\n\n            The defendants also testified that they intended to\n\nensure the career plaintiffs jobs at ARB and rehire them at the\n\nMunicipality if necessary. However, a reasonable jury easily could\n\nhave concluded that this too was a lie, and that no such system was\n\nin place.   Most of the career plaintiffs never acquired jobs at ARB\n\nor the Municipality, even when they sought them out.                 Some were\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fexplicitly told that Román had ordered that they not be rehired.\n\nAnd those who did receive employment offers were confronted with\n\njobs vastly inferior, either in terms of benefits (transitory\n\nemployment) or working conditions (private-sector positions with\n\nlong commutes and questionable job security), to those they had\n\npreviously held.\n\n          Furthermore,       the   jury    heard   specific    and    detailed\n\ntestimony that most, if not all, of the municipal workers hired\n\nsince the privatization were PDP-affiliated, and that some of those\n\nnew PDP workers performed jobs that the fired sanitation workers\n\nhad done, just under the guise of different job titles.               This, in\n\ncombination    with    the   evidence     described   above,   is    more   than\n\nsufficient.    See Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547, 565-66\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          2.          Engineer Norat\n\n          On the evidence, the jury could well have concluded that\n\nNorat was not liable because he did not agree with or intend to\n\nparticipate in the discrimination effectuated by the Mayor, but did\n\nso only under compulsion.          However, the jury did not exonerate\n\nNorat, and evidence supports its conclusion.\n\n          Borges testified that Norat was present when Mayor Román\n\nspoke of his desire to fire the NPP employees in the Public Works\n\nDepartment.    Norat was deeply involved with the privatization; he\n\ntook it to the Municipal Assembly and he told the career plaintiffs\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fto   stay    home   and    take    compensatory        time     after    January      25.\n\nDefendants characterize the privatization decision as one made by\n\nboth   men   together:     \"Mayor    Román      and    Norat     made    a     difficult\n\nadministrative decision, after a thorough analysis, to privatize\n\nthe sanitation services.\"            Importantly, there is evidence that\n\nNorat was not just carrying out Mayor Román's decision, but in fact\n\nharbored political animus himself.                  Asked how he knew that the\n\nMayor's desire to fire public works employees was politically\n\nmotivated,    Borges      replied:    \"Because        they     would    tell    me,   the\n\nengineer would tell me, Mr. Martin Davila would tell me, that they\n\nwanted to get rid of the NPP employees in order to place Popular\n\nDemocratic Party followers.\"             The engineer was obviously Norat, or\n\nso a jury could find.            Further, it was Norat who encouraged NPP\n\nmembers elsewhere in the department to transfer to sanitation\n\nbefore there was any public discussion of privatizing the division;\n\nthese NPP members subsequently lost their jobs upon privatization.\n\n             On this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded\n\nthat Norat helped Mayor Román devise the plan to privatize the\n\nsanitation     division     in    such    a   way    as   to    remove    the     career\n\nplaintiffs from their jobs, and would not have done so but for\n\nplaintiffs' NPP affiliations.\n\nC.           Political Discrimination and Plaintiff Hernández\n\n             \"[T]he fact that a transitory employee does not have a\n\nreasonable expectation of renewal in his or her employment . . .\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fdoes    not   defeat     a     First    Amendment      claim.\"           Gomez    v.

Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir. 1997)).\n\n              Our recitation of the evidence quickly disposes of the\n\nMayor's arguments that Hernández \"failed to demonstrate that Mayor\n\nRomán   knew     her,    knew    her     political      affiliation         or    used      that\n\ninformation as a factor in not renewing her transitory contract.\"\n\nMayor    Román     argues       that      the    evidence          established         a    non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for the termination of Hernández -- that the\n\ndepartment lacked funds for her position.                     But there was testimony\n\nthis was not true, and her PDP replacement was hired only five\n\nmonths later.        And the Mayor's argument that Hernández was not\n\nqualified for her Social Worker position could easily have been\n\nunderstood by the jury to be a pretext.                  She had been continually\n\nrehired and had received excellent ratings.\n\n              Mayor Román's final argument on this issue is that\n\nHernández failed to timely reapply after receiving her dismissal\n\nletter. The evidence on this point actually works to Mayor Román's\n\ndisadvantage:        Hernández         testified      that    the        Municipality        was\n\nsupposed to summon her to compete for her old job before it was\n\nagain filled, and that it did not do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -31-\n\f                                           IV.\n\n               We   review   the    district      court's      denial    of   qualified\n\nimmunity de novo, Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 6, construing the evidence\n\n\"in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at\n\ntrial,\"       and   according      deference      to   \"the     jury's    discernible\n\nresolution of disputed factual issues,\" id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Jarrett v. Town of Yarmouth, 331 F.3d 140,\n\n147 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n               Qualified immunity \"provides a safe harbor for public\n\nofficials acting under the color of state law who would otherwise\n\nbe liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for infringing the constitutional\n\nrights of private parties.\"            Id.; cf. Anderson v. Creighton, 483\n\nU.S. 635, 638 (1987).         Public officials are \"entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity unless the facts establish that their conduct violated a\n\nconstitutional right that was 'clearly established' at the time of\n\nthe violation such that a reasonable officer would have known that\n\nthe conduct at issue was unlawful.\"                    Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 6\n\n(emphasis in original) (quoting Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n               This circuit usually evaluates qualified immunity claims\n\nunder     a     three-part         test.    See,       e.g.,     Torres-Rivera       v.\n\nCalderón-Serra, 412 F.3d 205, 214 (1st Cir. 2005); Riverdale Mills\n\nCorp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2004).                         First, we\n\nask whether, \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party\n\n\n                                           -32-\n\fasserting the injury, . . . the facts . . . show the officer's\n\nconduct violated a constitutional right.\"                  Riverdale Mills, 392\n\nF.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)).                If so, the second question is\n\n\"whether that constitutional right was clearly established at the\n\ntime of the . . . violation.\"        Whitfield, 431 F.3d at 7.          The third\n\nquestion is \"whether a reasonable officer, similarly situated,\n\nwould understand that the challenged conduct violated the clearly\n\nestablished right at issue.\"              Riverdale Mills, 392 F.3d at 61\n\n(internal    quotation      marks   omitted)       (quoting    Suboh    v.   Dist.\n\nAttorney's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002)).                  The Supreme\n\nCourt has instructed us, generally, to analyze the first prong\n\nfirst, even if the outcome of one of the other prongs might end the\n\ninquiry.    Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\n\n            The    district    court's      denial    of   immunity    is    easily\n\naffirmed.      A jury could readily find a violation of plaintiffs'\n\nrights.     Defendants' second argument, that there was no clearly\n\nestablished right in the career plaintiffs not to have their\n\nemployment     terminated     due   to    their    political   affiliation,      is\n\nfrivolous.14      Acevedo-Garcia, 351 F.3d at 564; Angulo-Alvarez, 170\n\nF.3d at 249-50.       As to the third prong of the test, defendants\n\n\n14\n    Mayor Román offers no developed argument as to qualified\nimmunity with regard to contract plaintiff Hernández, and in fact\nthe doctrine is not even mentioned in the portion of defendants'\nbrief devoted to Hernández. Any such challenge is waived. See\nAcevedo-Garcia, 351 F.3d at 560-61.\n\n                                         -33-\n\fargue that the Mayor relied on advice from counsel and from\n\nGonzález, the human resources director.                 But a jury easily could\n\nhave   found   that   this   was    not    so,    and    that   Mayor   Román   was\n\nexplicitly warned he should not engage in this scheme in violation\n\nof the rights of these employees.                The evidence shows that the\n\nMayor and Norat intended exactly to terminate these employees based\n\non their political affiliation and did their best to cover their\n\ntracks.\n\n                                      V.\n\n           Defendants    next      challenge,      on    several    grounds,    the\n\ndistrict court's order reinstating the career employees.                        Our\n\nreview is for abuse of discretion.            Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte, 925\n\nF.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1991); Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889\n\nF.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).                   We accord the order\n\nconsiderable deference, as the district court \"has had first-hand\n\nexposure to the litigants and the evidence . . . [and] is in a\n\nconsiderably better position to bring the scales into balance than\n\nan appellate tribunal.\"       Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 323.\n\n           Two initial arguments are meritless.                 First, defendants\n\nargue that because the career plaintiffs declined to take their\n\ncomplaint to the Board of Appeals of the Personnel Administration\n\nSystem (known as JASAP) within thirty days, the municipal personnel\n\ndecision became unappealable.             This is clearly incorrect: state\n\nemployees asserting claims such as these are not required to\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fexhaust administrative remedies before bringing a § 1983 action in\n\nfederal court.    Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio, 140 F.3d 24,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496,\n\n515 (1982)).     Second, defendants argue that because of the career\n\nplaintiffs' failure to go through JASAP, \"the doctrine of issue\n\npreclusion bars the District Court from ordering reinstatement.\"\n\nThis argument makes no sense.    Where there has been no hearing, and\n\ntherefore no findings, there can be no issue preclusion.\n\n          Defendants' final argument is that the factors this court\n\nhas deemed relevant to the reinstatement question cut against\n\nreinstating the career plaintiffs, and so the district court abused\n\nits discretion.     They admit that the career plaintiffs \"in great\n\npart did not find gainful employment after the layoff.\"     However,\n\nthey argue that reinstatement was still inappropriate because,\n\ninter alia, (1) most of the career plaintiffs' old jobs were\n\neliminated in the privatization, (2) the antagonism between the\n\nparties would create a poor work environment, (3) the career\n\nplaintiffs \"were compensated more than adequately\" for the loss of\n\ntheir jobs, and (4) the career plaintiffs did not have \"clean\n\nhands\" because many did not complete the process of applying to\n\nwork for ARB or reapplying for work at the Municipality.\n\n          In the political discrimination context, a violation of\n\nFirst Amendment rights does not lead a fortiori to reinstatement.\n\nVelazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez, 996 F.2d 425, 428 (1st Cir. 1993). On\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fthe other hand,\"[w]henever an ex-employee sues alleging wrongful\n\ndismissal by a government agency, job restoration may be a material\n\naspect of meaningful relief.\"            Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 322.\n\n\"[R]outinely incidental burdens\" of reinstatement -- for example,\n\ntension in the workplace, or displacement of employees who had\n\ntaken on duties previously handled by the fired workers -- \"are\n\nforeseeable    sequelae   of    defendant's       wrongdoing,   and   usually\n\ninsufficient, without more, to tip the scales against reinstatement\n\nwhen first amendment rights are at stake in a section 1983 action.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). Among the factors relevant\n\nto the reinstatement analysis are the following: \"(1) the strength\n\nof the evidence proving the first amendment violation; (2) whether\n\nthe discharged employee has found comparable work; [and] (3) the\n\nabsence of a property right in the position because the employee\n\nwas hired in violation of local law.\"            Velazquez, 996 F.2d at 429.\n\n            There   was    no     abuse     of    discretion    in    ordering\n\nreinstatement here.       Plaintiffs presented strong evidence of a\n\nFirst Amendment violation, and many of the career plaintiffs have\n\nnot found work in the aftermath.            The possibility of workplace\n\nantagonism, and the upheaval that will be caused by finding jobs\n\nfor   the   fired   workers,      are     the    \"foreseeable   sequelae   of\n\ndefendant[s'] wrongdoing,\" Rosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 322. Nor do\n\nthe   damage   awards   obviate    the    need    for   reinstatement.     See\n\nHiraldo-Cancel, 925 F.2d at 13 (noting that often, \"[w]hen a person\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\floses his job, it is at best disingenuous to say that money damages\n\ncan   suffice    to   make    that    person      whole,\"   because    \"[t]he\n\npsychological benefits of work . . . are real and cannot be\n\nignored\") (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (quoting Allen v. Autauga County Bd. of Educ., 685 F.2d\n\n1302, 1306 (11th Cir. 1982)).        Defendants' last argument, that the\n\ncareer plaintiffs do not have \"clean hands,\" is without merit.              On\n\nthe evidence at trial, those plaintiffs who did not apply for jobs\n\nhad good reason for their decisions both as to ARB, where working\n\nconditions were poor, and as to the Municipality, where they had\n\nevery reason to believe they were unwelcome.\n\n                                     VI.\n\n           Finally, the defendants appeal from the district court's\n\nrefusal to remit the various damage awards.           We take the two types\n\nof damages in turn.\n\nA.         Compensatory Damages\n\n           \"Where defendants properly preserve a challenge to the\n\namount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury, 'our inquiry is\n\nlimited   to    determining   whether       the   trial   court   abused   its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive,'\"\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 351 F.3d at 566 (quoting Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline\n\nServs., Inc., 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir. 1994)), and \"the evidence\n\nis viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,\"\n\nVelazquez, 996 F.2d at 428.     These deferential standards recognize\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fthat \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money damages -- especially\n\nin cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic\n\nloss   --   is    a    matter    peculiarly     within    a   jury's      ken.\"    Id.\n\n(alteration       in    original)    (internal     quotation        marks    omitted)\n\n(quoting Wagenmann v.

Gonzalez-Caraballo, 929 F.2d 31,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n            Defendants argue that the compensatory damages should be\n\nreduced because the career plaintiffs failed to mitigate their\n\nlosses: they say the career plaintiffs were guaranteed jobs with\n\nARB or the Municipality but many frittered away that guarantee by\n\nfailing     to    apply    for    jobs    and,    in     cases     where    municipal\n\nreemployment was sought and offered, turning it down.\n\n            The       compensatory    damages     awarded     by    the     jury   were\n\nrationally related to the career plaintiffs' economic loss as well\n\nas to their impairment of reputation, their mental anguish, and\n\ntheir suffering, all standard components of compensatory damages in\n\n§ 1983 actions.         Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S.\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f299, 307 (1986).      As to economic loss, many of the plaintiffs were\n\nwithout their jobs and associated benefits for a substantial period\n\nof time -- from at least February 2002 through November 2003, when\n\nthe district court ordered them reinstated -- and while their\n\nsalaries varied, most earned between $800 and $1,000 per month. As\n\nto    other   damages,   the     career   plaintiffs        testified       they   were\n\nhumiliated and stunned by the loss of their \"career\" jobs.\n\n              As for defendants' mitigation argument: When there was\n\nevidence the Mayor instructed ARB and municipal officials not to\n\nhire the laid-off employees in San Lorenzo, he is ill-situated to\n\nargue that the employees should have, despite the demonstrated\n\nfutility of requesting jobs, made the requests anyway.\n\n              As to Hernández, she was awarded $28,400.                       Had her\n\ncontract been renewed, she likely would have earned about $1,120\n\nper month, her previous salary.                She went without that salary\n\nduring some periods after her dismissal when she was unemployed,\n\nand    though   she   was    working    in     a   transitory      job   in   another\n\nmunicipality at the time of trial, she testified that she was\n\nineligible      for   medical     benefits     and   that    her     benefits      were\n\notherwise     inferior      to   what   she    had   enjoyed    at    San     Lorenzo.\n\nFurther, she testified that the non-renewal of her contract caused\n\nher emotional suffering.\n\n              Defendants argue that Hernández failed to mitigate her\n\ndamages when she did not pursue municipal reemployment.                     But there\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fwas evidence that defendants did not contact her to reapply for her\n\njob when it was filled, as they were supposed to.   They cannot now\n\ncomplain about her failure to reapply.\n\nB.        Punitive Damages\n\n          The review of a preserved challenge to a punitive damages\n\naward is de novo, and the \"award will stand unless we find it\n\n'certain' that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to\n\npunish and deter the alleged misconduct.\"   Románo v.

The Supreme Court has\n\nsaid a jury may award punitive damages where the defendant's\n\nbehavior is \"shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or\n\nwhen it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally\n\nprotected rights of others.\"     Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56\n\n(1983).   In the context of intentional discrimination, the Court\n\nhas explained that a defendant must act \"in the face of a perceived\n\nrisk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in\n\npunitive damages.\"   Kolstad v.

Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>Angulo-Alvarez v. Aponte de la Torre,</i> 170 F.3d 246 (1st Cir.1999). The mere fact that the impact falls mainly on members of the party which has lost power is not, of course, sufficient to warrant federal court interference with the policy choices of a new administration which reflects the voters' choice that changes are desirable. <i>Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140. By the same token, a new administration cannot cloak political discrimination merely by labeling the change a legitimate reorganization. <i>Id.</i> at 132. Nor may it deliberately effectuate a legitimate reorganization in a politically discriminatory manner. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the reorganization involved a new Popular Democratic Party (PDP) administration in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, headed by defendant Mayor Jos&#233; R. Rom&#225;n-Abreu (Mayor Rom&#225;n). The new administration chose to \"privatize\" the sanitation division, with the result that thirty-six career employees, almost all New Progressive Party (NPP) members, were laid off. A jury found that these career employees, as well as one non-career employee from a different department, were unconstitutionally terminated from employment. As to the career employees, the jury awarded a total of $887,097 compensatory damages against defendants Mayor Rom&#225;n and Juan A. Norat-Flores (\"Norat\"), the director of the Municipality's Department of Public Works; it also awarded $108,000 in punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n. As to the one non-career employee, the jury awarded $28,400 compensatory damages and $3,000 punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n. The court, post-verdict, denied the defendants qualified immunity, denied motions for judgment as a matter of law and adjustment of damages, and ordered the career employees reinstated. We affirm the district court's judgment in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat appeal on five grounds. They argue that (1) there was insufficient evidence as to causation to support a finding of political discrimination, (2) both defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, (3) the district court abused its discretion in ordering the career employees reinstated, (4) the compensatory damages were excessive, and (5) the punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n were unwarranted. We recount the facts in favor of the verdict as a reasonable jury could have found them. <i>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Career Employees</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rom&#225;n was elected mayor of the Municipality of San Lorenzo on November 7, 2000, and took office on January 9, 2001. He defeated incumbent NPP Mayor V&#237;ctor Figueroa Orozco. He then appointed Norat, previously a Public Works employee in another city, to head San Lorenzo's Department of Public Works. The Department had several divisions, including sanitation, which was responsible for garbage collection and other cleaning tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after taking office, Mayor Rom&#225;n and other municipal officials, including Norat, began planning the possible privatization of the sanitation division. The officials testified that they did so because of lackluster garbage collection, and that they conducted a cost-benefit analysis and determined that privatization would save San Lorenzo hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. However, two PDP-affiliated witnesses &#8212; plaintiff Samuel Borges Col&#243;n (\"Borges\"), a former sanitation supervisor, and Sandra Gonz&#225;lez D&#237;az (\"Gonz&#225;lez\"), defendant Iraida Hornedo's predecessor as municipal human resources director &#8212; testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n had said in their presence that the privatization plan was a device to force NPP workers out of government employment. Further, Gonz&#225;lez testified that in privatizing the sanitation division, the Municipality did not follow its 1997 Layoff Plan, which required that transitory workers be fired first in the event of layoffs. She testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n and \"other fellow officers . . . [and] ranking employees\" had said that \"with this privatization process, they were going to be able to get rid of employees that were not belonging to the political party of the people in power.\" She also testified, based on her experience as municipal human resources director, that the criteria used to appoint personnel in San Lorenzo after Mayor Rom&#225;n took office were as follows: \"[t]o be affiliated with the PDP, to be acquaintances of the mayor or relatives of the mayor, to be friends with some high-ranking functionary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges testified that soon after the mayoral election he met with Mayor Rom&#225;n, who told him \"that he needed me there at public works, to help him, because the first thing he wanted to do was to take the NPP's out of the municipality.\" Asked about Mayor Rom&#225;n's attitude toward public works employees, Borges testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, his attitude was that, since they were NPP's, he didn't want them there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And how did you know that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Because they would tell me, the engineer would tell me,<sup>[1]</sup> Mr. Martin Davila would tell me, that they wanted to get rid of the NPP employees in order to place Popular Democratic Party followers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: When, if at any time, did the mayor tell you that those were his intentions after he became mayor of San Lorenzo, you know?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: On numerous occasions at Public Works, when we would meet with Mr. Norat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you recall what were his words?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: That he had to get rid of the NPP employees because he had to place his people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2001, Norat took the privatization proposal and the favorable cost-benefit analysis to the Municipal Assembly for approval. On August 30, 2001, the Assembly approved Municipal Ordinance No. 7 (\"the ordinance\"), authorizing Mayor Rom&#225;n to negotiate the privatization of the sanitation division. Mayor Rom&#225;n signed the ordinance the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinance, the Municipal Assembly set conditions on the privatization process. It stated that the company with which the Municipality contracted for privatization had to agree, when hiring, \"to consider all of the municipal employees who qualify within their standards of selection of employees pursuant to its Human Resources regulations.\" It also added a second requirement: The remaining employees belonging to the sanitation area will be retained in their positions or will be relocated to other dependencies of the municipality pursuant to the needs of the service. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality of San Lorenzo agrees to protect and guarantee the vested rights of the regular employees who are working in the Department of Sanitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The city began soliciting privatization proposals. Five companies submitted proposals; the municipal bids board selected a firm called ARB and arranged for ARB to take over the Municipality's sanitation service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2002, Mayor Rom&#225;n wrote a letter to thirty-six sanitation employees (the \"career plaintiffs\"), informing them that their jobs were terminated effective February 25. Though the events leading up to privatization had taken months, this was the career plaintiffs' first official notice of potential privatization or its possible effect on their jobs. Of the thirty-six career plaintiffs, thirty-five were affiliated with the NPP,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> while the last, Borges, was a PDP member who had had a falling-out with Mayor Rom&#225;n over Borges' sympathy for NPP co-workers. Most of the career plaintiffs testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n knew their political affiliation, either because they were neighbors or because Mayor Rom&#225;n had seen them participating in NPP electioneering activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 23 letter, signed by Mayor Rom&#225;n, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the privatization . . . the sanitation program of the Municipal Department of Public Works is eliminated, which entails the lay-off and elimination of all the positions assigned to said program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the above, you are laid off from your position effective February 25, 2002. You have 30 days as of the date of this communication to appeal this decision before the Board of Appeals of the Personnel System of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter also stated, however, that the ordinance and the contract between San Lorenzo and ARB \"provide[] for the recruitment and job security of the personnel affected by this negotiation.\" It added that \"[t]he Municipality will coordinate this process and will notify the day and time of the job interviews.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the affected workers were \"career employees.\" Under Puerto Rico law, as career employees, they had vested property rights in their jobs and, in general terms, could only be removed for cause and were entitled to procedural due process protections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In this case, the 1997 Layoff Plan, which required that transitory workers be fired before such career workers in the event layoffs were necessary, was not followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 23 letter was delivered to most of the career plaintiffs at a meeting on January 25, 2002, at the Priscilla Flores Theater. San Lorenzo's new director of human resources, Hornedo,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> spoke to the workers, telling them that the Municipality had set up a process to help them get jobs with ARB. Hornedo also told the career plaintiffs that if any of them had questions or concerns, they could come to her office to talk with her and review their personnel files. The career plaintiffs were given ARB applications during this meeting, and some filled them out and submitted them on the spot. Unemployment officials attended the meeting, bringing along unemployment benefits forms for them to fill out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the months that followed, a few of the career plaintiffs obtained jobs with ARB.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Most, however, found themselves without jobs either at ARB or within the Municipality. Some testified that they approached Hornedo and asked her to find them other jobs in the Municipality; she told them no jobs were available. One career plaintiff, Raul Galarza Santana, said Hornedo told him she had spoken to Mayor Rom&#225;n, and the Mayor \"had said there was no chance for me being rehired.\" Another career plaintiff, Ivan Rosa-Rivera, said Hornedo told him: \"I am deeply sorry. This decision has already been taken. These are orders coming from above, and you are dismissed from your work.\" Mayor Rom&#225;n was in charge of all personnel decisions in the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the career plaintiffs also testified that they filled out applications with ARB but were never offered jobs or contacted for interviews. Others testified that they <i>were</i> offered jobs at ARB, but under conditions that made the jobs difficult or impossible to accept. The offered jobs were in Cata&#241;o and other towns some distance from San Lorenzo. Some had no way to get there for work; others said ARB offered to pick them up in San Lorenzo and drive them back and forth, but that that would mean getting up at 2 or 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m. &#8212; a twenty-hour day. One of the career plaintiffs, David de Jesus-Santa, testified that he took the Cata&#241;o job, managed to get ARB to transfer him to San Lorenzo for two months, but was then told he would be assigned to Cata&#241;o again; he quit because he had no way to get there. Another, Rafael Martinez-Santana, testified that when he approached Juan Reyes Burgos, the president of ARB, to ask for work, Burgos told him that \"he would give me work, but not in San Lorenzo; that the mayor [Rom&#225;n] had told him to give me work, but not in San Lorenzo. He did not want me in San Lorenzo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other evidence also established a political motivation for the elimination of the career plaintiffs' positions. Borges testified that at least four of the five former sanitation workers who kept their jobs with the Municipality after the privatization were PDP-affiliated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Well over one hundred of the transitory municipal workers hired by the Rom&#225;n administration were PDP-affiliated. One witness testified he could not identify any NPP hires among a list of all the new transitory employees. Various career plaintiffs testified that the Municipality made no attempt to offer them these transitory jobs, even when they were qualified for the positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some of the plaintiffs testified that, while their job descriptions were technically eliminated, PDP loyalists were hired and took over their job duties under different titles. For example, career plaintiff Benito Claudio-Figueroa testified that he was a heavy vehicle and equipment supervisor, and that a man whom he knew to be a PDP member was performing his old job for the Municipality, under the new title \"Deputy Director of Public Works.\" Finally, a number of career plaintiffs testified that they had been employed elsewhere in the Department of Public Works prior to the Rom&#225;n administration, but had been asked by Norat to switch to sanitation in 2001, after Mayor Rom&#225;n's election. These plaintiffs all testified that they were not offered their old positions back, and most testified that those positions were filled by workers they knew to be PDP loyalists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only non-NPP member among the thirty-six terminated career plaintiffs, Borges, testified that despite his PDP affiliation, he opposed political firings and said as much to Norat, the head of the Department of Public Works. Borges testified that on August 17, 2001, Norat told Borges that the Mayor was unhappy with Borges because Borges supposedly had met with a group of NPP employees who were suing the Municipality in a separate action. Borges was placed on twenty days' compensatory leave. He was placed on another leave later in the year, and in December, he testified, he returned from an illness to find that his supervisory duties had been reassigned to a PDP loyalist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges was among the employees terminated via the January 23, 2002 letter. After the meeting at the Flores Theater, he approached ARB official Burgos and told him he was available to work for ARB. He testified that Burgos told him \"that he was sorry, that he could not give me work about the municipality of San Lorenzo because the Honorable Mayor had told him that . . . he could not offer work to any of the people who had been dismissed; that he could give me work, but in the municipality of Cata&#241;o.\" When Burgos told him the arrangement &#8212; that he would be picked up at 3 a.m., driven to Cata&#241;o, and then driven back to San Lorenzo at night &#8212; Borges \"told [Burgos] that schedule would be impossible for me because that would mean being away from my home almost all day and night.\" Borges also approached Hornedo and asked her to reevaluate his case. He testified that Hornedo told him that \"she had orders from the mayor that there was no more work for me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Non-Career Employee</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other plaintiff in this appeal, Sheidi N. Hern&#225;ndez Morales (\"Hern&#225;ndez\"), was differently situated. She was first hired by the Municipality of San Lorenzo under a transitory, or contract, appointment effective July 1, 1993. Thereafter, she was appointed to various transitory positions in San Lorenzo over the next six years, though the appointments were not always consecutive. In July 1999, she was hired for a six-month position as a Social Worker in the Municipality's Childcare Network; she received an excellent evaluation. Her contract as a Social Worker was renewed in January 2000 and again in July 2000 and January 2001. The last of these contracts was due to expire on September 30, 2001. On September 17, 2001, Hern&#225;ndez received a letter from Mayor Rom&#225;n telling her to make arrangements with her supervisor to use her accumulated leave time during the rest of the month. Thereafter, her contract was not renewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hern&#225;ndez was not a career employee and had no property interest in her job protectable under the Due Process Clause, she did produce evidence that her position continued to exist and was filled by a PDP member, and this resulted from discrimination against her based on party affiliation. Gonz&#225;lez, the former human resources director, testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n knew that Hern&#225;ndez was affiliated with the NPP. Asked why Hern&#225;ndez' appointment was not renewed, Gonz&#225;lez replied: \"Every day, [Hern&#225;ndez' supervisor] Ms. Carmen Contrerras . . . was publicly stating, both in meetings and out of meetings, asking when she was going to be able to get rid of the two NPP affiliates who were in her office.\" Mayor Rom&#225;n made all personnel decisions in the Municipality while Gonz&#225;lez worked in his administration, a period lasting from January to December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez testified that after the PDP electoral victory, the work atmosphere in her division of municipal government became uncomfortable and hostile. Contrerras, her supervisor at the Childcare Network, harassed the NPP employees in the office, telling them that they were from the past administration and that the new administration was \"going to make a big change.\" Contrerras told Hern&#225;ndez her contract was not being renewed because of lack of funds. But there was evidence that was not true: a co-worker in accounting told Hernandez that \"there was going to be more funds, and, in fact, the salaries might even be raised.\" Eventually, PDP-affiliated employees were hired to replace Hern&#225;ndez and three other NPP-affiliated transitory employees who had not received new contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Testimony of Defendants</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, Mayor Rom&#225;n, Norat, and Hornedo, gave a markedly different version of events. They testified that soon after Mayor Rom&#225;n took office, conditions in the sanitation division began to deteriorate noticeably: the number of citizen complaints about trash service skyrocketed, and garbage trucks began breaking down with more frequency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This crisis, they testified, was what spurred the decision to transfer workers from elsewhere in Public Works into sanitation, as well as the eventual decision to privatize sanitation. The defense also pointed to the ordinance adopted by the Municipal Assembly, which cited a desire to offer \"a better quality of service\" as one reason to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat testified that political affiliation had nothing to do with the privatization decision or its execution. Indeed, Mayor Rom&#225;n testified that he did not know plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez, and as to the career plaintiffs, Norat testified that city leaders pondering privatization considered it \"nonnegotiable\" that whoever won the contract had to hire all of the displaced workers. Hornedo testified that the administration fully intended to coordinate the displaced career plaintiffs' hiring with ARB, and to rehire those who did not find ARB jobs; she testified that most of the career plaintiffs never approached them seeking jobs and never completed the ARB hiring process. However, Mayor Rom&#225;n admitted on cross-examination that the January 23, 2002 termination letter did not tell the employees about the process they would have to use to seek ARB employment and did not tell them that they could seek reemployment with the Municipality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Furthermore, while Hornedo testified that several of the career plaintiffs returned to ask the Municipality for jobs and were offered positions, she admitted that those positions were transitory &#8212; much less desirable than the career jobs the plaintiffs had previously held.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n offered the defense that he relied on legal advice. He testified that he sought the advice of Gonz&#225;lez and a municipal attorney in deciding how to proceed with privatization; he said they advised him that he should not follow the 1997 Layoff Plan, but instead should follow the new municipal ordinance and make sure the displaced workers were guaranteed employment with ARB. Gonz&#225;lez contradicted this testimony. She testified that early in Mayor Rom&#225;n's term, he called her into his office and asked her to bring a list of Public Works employees. He told her to read the list and cross off the names he indicated; he explained that \"he was going to get rid of some public works employees at the time of the privatization.\" Gonz&#225;lez testified that she \"told [Rom&#225;n] to be careful with the new lawsuit [a separate discrimination complaint concerning other employees], and that we had to follow the processes established by law.\" She said he replied, \"I'm . . . the mayor and I make the decisions.\" Gonz&#225;lez also testified that she thought the 1997 Layoff Plan should have been followed, that she was not consulted as to details of the privatization, and that the reason the Layoff Plan was not followed was that \"the mayor didn't want to use it.\" The attorney upon whose advice Mayor Rom&#225;n said he relied did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n also denied saying anything to Borges about plaintiffs' political affiliations. In fact, the Mayor testified, it was Borges who first suggested privatization to him.

Their complaint, filed under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and related provisions of Puerto Rico law, alleged as to every plaintiff that (1) the three defendants had terminated them in violation of their due process rights, and (2) the terminations of their employment were based on political affiliation and were therefore also in violation of their First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury trial commenced on October 1, 2003, and ended on November 10, 2003. At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the defense moved for Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 judgment as a matter of law on all issues. The district court granted the motion as to Hern&#225;ndez' political discrimination claims against Norat and Hornedo, but allowed her political discrimination claim to go forward against the Mayor. The court otherwise denied the motion, leaving the career plaintiffs' due process and political discrimination claims intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2003, at the close of testimony, defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the remaining issues &#8212; Hern&#225;ndez' political discrimination claim against Mayor Rom&#225;n and the career plaintiffs' due process and political discrimination claims against all the defendants. They argued that Hern&#225;ndez had not proved that the Mayor even knew her political affiliation, and that her position was not filled for months after the non-renewal of her contract; thus, they argued, there was a failure of evidence as to political discrimination. As to the career plaintiffs, the defense argued that (1) Norat could not be held liable because there had been no evidence establishing that he had a say in the decision to terminate the sanitation workers, and (2) all defendants could not be held liable because the privatization decision stemmed from public health concerns, not political discrimination, and because the Mayor relied on legal advice in deciding what shape privatization should take. The district court denied the motion in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 2003, the jury returned its verdicts. As to Hern&#225;ndez, the jury found Rom&#225;n liable and assessed compensatory damages of $28,400 and punitive damages of $3,000. As to the thirty-six career plaintiffs, the jury found both Rom&#225;n and Norat (but not Hornedo) liable. It assessed compensatory damages against Rom&#225;n and Norat in amounts ranging from $18,537 to $33,200 per career plaintiff; the total was $887,097. It also assessed punitive damages against Rom&#225;n only, in the amount of $3,000 per career plaintiff, for a total of $108,000. The verdict form the jury was given did not ask it to indicate whether it was finding for plaintiffs on due process grounds, First Amendment grounds, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2003, the district court entered judgment against Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat in the amounts the jury had awarded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> It also ordered the career plaintiffs reinstated to career positions at the Municipality, with the \"same salaries, benefits, seniority, and equivalent functions as they had before their illegal dismissal from employment.\" The defendants renewed their Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, submitted a Rule 59 motion requesting that the compensatory and punitive damages be remitted, and asked the district court to reconsider its reinstatement order. These motions were denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat bring several challenges. First, as to the thirty-six career plaintiffs, they argue that (1) plaintiffs never demonstrated on the evidence a prima facie causal connection between their political affiliation and the termination of their employment; (2) the defense evidence compelled a finding that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the privatization; and (3) even if some political animus had been present, defendants still should prevail because the evidence showed that such animus was not the but-for cause of the privatization. They also argue that both Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat are entitled to qualified immunity. As to remedy, they argue that even if there were liability here, the district court's reinstatement order was inappropriate; that compensatory damages should be remitted because of plaintiffs' failure to mitigate; and that punitive damages were unavailable on these facts as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Hern&#225;ndez, Mayor Rom&#225;n argues that she cannot sustain a First Amendment claim because there was no evidence of political animus as a cause of the non-renewal of her contract, and because Hern&#225;ndez' contract would not have been renewed in any event since she was not qualified for her Social Worker position. He also argues that Hern&#225;ndez' damages should have been remitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue first that defendants have waived most of their challenge because they failed to argue on appeal the issue of due process violation of the career plaintiffs' rights. They argue that since the jury issued an undifferentiated verdict that could have rested on due process grounds, plaintiffs' silence effectively concedes due process liability and ends the case. Alternatively, they argue that all of defendants' assignments of error as to qualified immunity, the finding of liability, the amount of damages, and the reinstatement order are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the nature of the evidence and the remedies, we prefer to rest our holdings on First Amendment grounds and do not reach the due process question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Legal Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law.

This affirmative defense ensures that a constitutional violation will only be found where \"political discrimination was the ultimate `but for' cause of an adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 125. This is appropriate because, \"[a]s the Supreme Court noted, to adopt a view of causation that focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part in an employment decision . . . would put an `employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied [otherwise].'\" <i>Id.</i> at 131 (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>Mt.

These incumbent employees have no right to thwart the will of the voters that a new regime make changes, if the new regime would have made those changes even in the absence of any prohibited discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Political Discrimination and the Career Plaintiffs</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that no reasonable juror could have found political discrimination on these facts. They point to the testimony of Rom&#225;n and Norat that the sanitation division was privatized because of public health and quality-of-service concerns, and that political affiliation played no role in their decisions. This, they argue, constitutes (1) evidence showing lack of discriminatory animus, (2) evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the privatization, and (3) evidence sufficient to show, under <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> that political discrimination was not the \"but-for\" cause of the decision to eliminate career plaintiffs' jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants make two additional arguments. First, they point to the testimony that a system was in place to ensure that the fired employees were rehired, either by ARB or by the Municipality; they suggest this compels a conclusion that no discrimination was intended. Second, they argue that the municipal ordinance authorizing privatization, and Rom&#225;n's testimony that he followed the advice of his human resources director and an attorney in devising the privatization process, show that both the decision to privatize, and the decision to privatize in a way that cost the career plaintiffs their jobs, were free of discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the case does not turn on the legitimacy of a decision by a Municipality to privatize its sanitation division. To be sure, the evidence presented some reasons to doubt such legitimacy: the Mayor had expressed a desire to rid the Department of Public Works of NPP members, and to fill the jobs with PDP members, and he could not do so within the current structure, given that the sanitation workers were protected as career employees under Puerto Rico law. Further, there is some evidence that the new regime deliberately made matters worse in order to provoke a sanitation crisis which would justify a decision to privatize. Still, this might well be too fragile an underpinning to justify federal intervention in a decision to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Mayor Rom&#225;n</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict against Mayor Rom&#225;n, however, is easily supported by the manner in which his administration implemented the decision to privatize. A jury could readily conclude that the Rom&#225;n administration implemented privatization in a manner designed to discriminate. The administration did so, or so a jury could find, in violation of multiple separate requirements of local law: (1) two provisions of the municipal privatization ordinance, (2) the previously adopted Layoff Plan, and (3) the procedural rights of career employees. The municipal ordinance did not authorize Rom&#225;n to terminate the career plaintiffs' employment. Instead, it required that the private sanitation firm consider the municipal sanitation workers for jobs, and that sanitation workers who did not take jobs with the private firm be \"<i>retained in their positions or . . . relocated to other dependencies of the municipality.</i>\" The ordinance also stated that the Municipality agreed \"to protect and guarantee the vested rights\" of the career plaintiffs. The privatization system Rom&#225;n and Norat actually implemented did neither of these things. As to the 1997 Layoff Plan, Gonz&#225;lez testified that it applied to privatizations and that she advised the Mayor to follow the law, and Mayor Rom&#225;n himself conceded that if the Layoff Plan applied, transitory workers had to be laid off before any career employee. The jury could easily conclude that political motivation was a substantial reason and, indeed, the but-for reason for the decisions not to follow these laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there were explicit statements by Mayor Rom&#225;n of an intent to discriminate. Gonz&#225;lez testified that the Mayor said that \"with this privatization process, they were going to be able to get rid of employees that were not belonging to the political party of the people in power.\" She also testified that Rom&#225;n said the Layoff Plan was ignored because it would have been an obstacle to firing NPP workers. Others testified that the Mayor went so far as to instruct ARB officials not to offer the fired workers jobs in San Lorenzo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Mayor took the stand, and on important questions where his testimony was flatly contradicted by other witnesses, the jury could easily have concluded his testimony was not credible. Mayor Rom&#225;n testified that discrimination played no role in the privatization decision. But the jury also heard testimony that Rom&#225;n believed (correctly) that the sanitation division was a nest of NPP-affiliated workers, and that discrimination did play a role in the decision to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n also testified that he shaped the privatization plan in reliance on advice from his human resources director and attorney. Here, too, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mayor Rom&#225;n's testimony was deliberately untrue: his human resources director, Gonz&#225;lez, testified both that she did not in fact give Mayor Rom&#225;n such advice and that Mayor Rom&#225;n structured the privatization plan the way he did specifically so he could fire NPP-affiliated workers. The defendants also failed to call as a witness the attorney on whose legal advice the Mayor purportedly relied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also testified that they intended to ensure the career plaintiffs jobs at ARB and rehire them at the Municipality if necessary. However, a reasonable jury easily could have concluded that this too was a lie, and that no such system was in place. Most of the career plaintiffs never acquired jobs at ARB or the Municipality, even when they sought them out. Some were explicitly told that Rom&#225;n had ordered that they not be rehired. And those who <i>did</i> receive employment offers were confronted with jobs vastly inferior, either in terms of benefits (transitory employment) or working conditions (private-sector positions with long commutes and questionable job security), to those they had previously held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the jury heard specific and detailed testimony that most, if not all, of the municipal workers hired since the privatization were PDP-affiliated, and that some of those new PDP workers performed jobs that the fired sanitation workers had done, just under the guise of different job titles. This, in combination with the evidence described above, is more than sufficient. <i>See Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> 351 F.3d 547, 565-66 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Engineer Norat</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evidence, the jury could well have concluded that Norat was not liable because he did not agree with or intend to participate in the discrimination effectuated by the Mayor, but did so only under compulsion. However, the jury did not exonerate Norat, and evidence supports its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges testified that Norat was present when Mayor Rom&#225;n spoke of his desire to fire the NPP employees in the Public Works Department. Norat was deeply involved with the privatization; he took it to the Municipal Assembly and he told the career plaintiffs to stay home and take compensatory time after January 25. Defendants characterize the privatization decision as one made by both men together: \"<i>Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat</i> made a difficult administrative decision, after a thorough analysis, to privatize the sanitation services.\" Importantly, there is evidence that Norat was not just carrying out Mayor Rom&#225;n's decision, but in fact harbored political animus himself. Asked how he knew that the Mayor's desire to fire public works employees was politically motivated, Borges replied: \"Because they would tell me, <i>the engineer would tell me,</i> Mr. Martin Davila would tell me, that <i>they</i> wanted to get rid of the NPP employees in order to place Popular Democratic Party followers.\" The engineer was obviously Norat, or so a jury could find. Further, it was Norat who encouraged NPP members elsewhere in the department to transfer to sanitation before there was any public discussion of privatizing the division; these NPP members subsequently lost their jobs upon privatization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Norat helped Mayor Rom&#225;n devise the plan to privatize the sanitation division in such a way as to remove the career plaintiffs from their jobs, and would not have done so but for plaintiffs' NPP affiliations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Political Discrimination and Plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he fact that a transitory employee does not have a reasonable expectation of renewal in his or her employment. . . does not defeat a First Amendment claim.\" <i>Gomez v.

But there was testimony this was not true, and her PDP replacement was hired only five months later. And the Mayor's argument that Hern&#225;ndez was not qualified for her Social Worker position could easily have been understood by the jury to be a pretext.

The evidence on this point actually works to Mayor Rom&#225;n's disadvantage: Hern&#225;ndez testified that the Municipality was supposed to summon her to compete for her old job before it was again filled, and that it did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of qualified immunity de novo, <i>Whitfield,</i> 431 F.3d at 6, construing the evidence \"in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial,\" and according deference to \"the jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues,\" <i>id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Jarrett v.

Calder&#243;n Serra,</i> 412 F.3d 205, 214 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir.2004). First, we ask whether, \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,. . . the facts . . . show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right.\" <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). If so, the second question is \"whether that constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the . . . violation.\" <i>Whitfield,</i> 431 F.3d at 7. The third question is \"whether a reasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated the clearly established right at issue.\" <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002)). The Supreme Court has instructed us, generally, to analyze the first prong first, even if the outcome of one of the other prongs might end the inquiry. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of immunity is easily affirmed. A jury could readily find a violation of plaintiffs' rights. Defendants' second argument, that there was no clearly established right in the career plaintiffs not to have their employment terminated due to their political affiliation, is frivolous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 351 F.3d at 564; <i>Angulo-Alvarez,</i> 170 F.3d at 249-50. As to the third prong of the test, defendants argue that the Mayor relied on advice from counsel and from Gonz&#225;lez, the human resources director. But a jury easily could have found that this was not so, and that Mayor Rom&#225;n was explicitly warned he should not engage in this scheme in violation of the rights of these employees. The evidence shows that the Mayor and Norat intended exactly to terminate these employees based on their political affiliation and did their best to cover their tracks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next challenge, on several grounds, the district court's order reinstating the career employees. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>Hiraldo-Cancel v. Aponte,</i> 925 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc). We accord the order considerable deference, as the district court \"has had first-hand exposure to the litigants and the evidence . . . [and] is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal.\" <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two initial arguments are meritless. First, defendants argue that because the career plaintiffs declined to take their complaint to the Board of Appeals of the Personnel Administration System (known as JASAP) within thirty days, the municipal personnel decision became unappealable. This is clearly incorrect: state employees asserting claims such as these are not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a &#167; 1983 action in federal court. <i>Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio,</i> 140 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing <i>Patsy v. Board of Regents,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 515, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982)). Second, defendants argue that because of the career plaintiffs' failure to go through JASAP, \"the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the District Court from ordering reinstatement.\" This argument makes no sense. Where there has been no hearing, and therefore no findings, there can be no issue preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' final argument is that the factors this court has deemed relevant to the reinstatement question cut against reinstating the career plaintiffs, and so the district court abused its discretion. They admit that the career plaintiffs \"in great part did not find gainful employment after the layoff.\" However, they argue that reinstatement was still inappropriate because, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) most of the career plaintiffs' old jobs were eliminated in the privatization, (2) the antagonism between the parties would create a poor work environment, (3) the career plaintiffs \"were compensated more than adequately\" for the loss of their jobs, and (4) the career plaintiffs did not have \"clean hands\" because many did not complete the process of applying to work for ARB or reapplying for work at the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the political discrimination context, a violation of First Amendment rights does not lead <i>a fortiori</i> to reinstatement. <i>Velazquez v. Figueroa-Gomez,</i> 996 F.2d 425, 428 (1st Cir.1993). On the other hand, \"[w]henever an ex-employee sues alleging wrongful dismissal by a government agency, job restoration may be a material aspect of meaningful relief.\" <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 322. \"[R]outinely incidental burdens\" of reinstatement &#8212; for example, tension in the workplace, or displacement of employees who had taken on duties previously handled by the fired workers &#8212; \"are foreseeable sequelae of defendant's wrongdoing, and usually insufficient, without more, to tip the scales against reinstatement when first amendment rights are at stake in a section 1983 action.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Among the factors relevant to the reinstatement analysis are the following: \"(1) the strength of the evidence proving the first amendment violation; (2) whether the discharged employee has found comparable work; [and] (3) the absence of a property right in the position because the employee was hired in violation of local law.\" <i>Velazquez,</i> 996 F.2d at 429.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in ordering reinstatement here. Plaintiffs presented strong evidence of a First Amendment violation, and many of the career plaintiffs have not found work in the aftermath. The possibility of workplace antagonism, and the upheaval that will be caused by finding jobs for the fired workers, are the \"foreseeable sequelae of defendant[s'] wrongdoing,\" <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 322. Nor do the damage awards obviate the need for reinstatement. <i>See Hiraldo-Cancel,</i> 925 F.2d at 13 (noting that often, \"[w]hen a person loses his job, it is at best disingenuous to say that money damages can suffice to make that person whole,\" because \"[t]he psychological benefits of work . . . are real and cannot be ignored\") (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Allen v. Autauga County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 685 F.2d 1302, 1306 (11th Cir.1982)). Defendants' last argument, that the career plaintiffs do not have \"clean hands,\" is without merit. On the evidence at trial, those plaintiffs who did not apply for jobs had good reason for their decisions both as to ARB, where working conditions were poor, and as to the Municipality, where they had every reason to believe they were unwelcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants appeal from the district court's refusal to remit the various damage awards. We take the two types of damages in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Compensatory Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Where defendants properly preserve a challenge to the amount of compensatory damages awarded by the jury, `our inquiry is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the verdict as excessive,'\" <i>Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 351 F.3d at 566 (quoting <i>Anthony v. G.M.D. Airline Servs., Inc.,</i> 17 F.3d 490, 493 (1st Cir. 1994)), and \"the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,\" <i>Velazquez,</i> 996 F.2d at 428. These deferential standards recognize that \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money damages &#8212; especially in cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic loss &#8212; is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken.\" <i>Id.</i> (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.1987)). \"Therefore, unless we can say that the award is grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand, we will not overrule a trial judge's considered refusal to tamper with the damages assessed by a jury.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc.,</i> 746 F.2d 78, 80-81 (1st Cir.1984); <i>Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Caraballo,</i> 929 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the compensatory damages should be reduced because the career plaintiffs failed to mitigate their losses: they say the career plaintiffs were guaranteed jobs with ARB or the Municipality but many frittered away that guarantee by failing to apply for jobs and, in cases where municipal reemployment was sought and offered, turning it down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The compensatory damages awarded by the jury were rationally related to the career plaintiffs' economic loss as well as to their impairment of reputation, their mental anguish, and their suffering, all standard components of compensatory damages in &#167; 1983 actions. <i>Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura,</i> 477 U.S. 299, 307, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986). As to economic loss, many of the plaintiffs were without their jobs and associated benefits for a substantial period of time &#8212; from at least February 2002 through November 2003, when the district court ordered them reinstated &#8212; and while their salaries varied, most earned between $800 and $1,000 per month. As to other damages, the career plaintiffs testified they were humiliated and stunned by the loss of their \"career\" jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for defendants' mitigation argument: When there was evidence the Mayor instructed ARB and municipal officials not to hire the laid-off employees in San Lorenzo, he is ill-situated to argue that the employees should have, despite the demonstrated futility of requesting jobs, made the requests anyway.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Hern&#225;ndez, she was awarded $28,400. Had her contract been renewed, she likely would have earned about $1,120 per month, her previous salary. She went without that salary during some periods after her dismissal when she was unemployed, and though she was working in a transitory job in another municipality at the time of trial, she testified that she was ineligible for medical benefits and that her benefits were otherwise inferior to what she had enjoyed at San Lorenzo. Further, she testified that the non-renewal of her contract caused her emotional suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that Hern&#225;ndez failed to mitigate her damages when she did not pursue municipal reemployment. But there was evidence that defendants did not contact her to reapply for her job when it was filled, as they were supposed to. They cannot now complain about her failure to reapply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Punitive Damages</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The review of a preserved challenge to a punitive damages award is de novo, and the \"award will stand unless we find it `certain' that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.\" <i>Rom&#225;no v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 672 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co.,</i> 172 F.3d 1, 14 n. 11 (1st Cir.1999)). In a &#167; 1983 action, there is also a legal threshold. The Supreme Court has said a jury may award punitive damages where the defendant's behavior is \"shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" <i>Smith v. Wade,</i> 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983). In the context of intentional discrimination, the Court has explained that a defendant must act \"in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.\" <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>see also Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 26 (1st Cir.1999) (describing <i>Kolstad</i> and <i>Smith</i> as requiring knowing violation or \"conscious indifference\" to the risk of violating a plaintiff's federally protected rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not need extended discussion. On the basis of the testimony already described, a jury was warranted in finding that Mayor Rom&#225;n acted with intent to violate federal law, or at the very least in the face of a perceived risk that his actions were in violation of federal law. Finally, we cannot say it is \"certain\" that an award of $3,000 per plaintiff \"exceeds [the amount] necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.\" <i>Rom&#225;no,</i> 233 F.3d at 672.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury verdict is affirmed in all respects, as are the district court's denial of qualified immunity and order of reinstatement.

Fuentes-Pujols,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201133\"><a href=\"/opinion/201133/sanchez-lopez-v-fuentes-pujos/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2004); <i>Angulo-Alvarez v.

The mere fact that the impact falls mainly on members of the party which has lost power is not, of course, sufficient to warrant federal court interference with the policy choices of a new administration which reflects the voters' choice that changes are desirable. <i>Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140. By the same token, a new administration cannot cloak political discrimination merely by labeling the change a legitimate reorganization. <i>Id.</i> at 132. Nor may it deliberately effectuate a legitimate reorganization in a politically discriminatory manner. <i>Id.</i> at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the reorganization involved a new Popular Democratic Party (PDP) administration in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, headed by defendant Mayor Jos&#233; R. Rom&#225;n-Abreu (Mayor Rom&#225;n). The new administration chose to \"privatize\" the sanitation division, with the result that thirty-six career employees, almost all New Progressive Party (NPP) members, were laid off. A jury found that these career employees, as well as one non-career employee from a different department, were unconstitutionally terminated from employment. As to the career employees, the jury awarded a total of $887,097 compensatory damages against defendants Mayor Rom&#225;n and Juan A. Norat-Flores (\"Norat\"), the director of the Municipality's Department of Public Works; it also awarded $108,000 in punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n. As to the one non-career employee, the jury awarded $28,400 compensatory damages and $3,000 punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n. The court, post-verdict, denied the defendants qualified immunity, denied motions for judgment as a matter of law and adjustment of damages, and ordered the career employees reinstated.

They argue that (1) there was insufficient evidence as to causation to support a finding of political discrimination, (2) both defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, (3) the district court abused its discretion in ordering the career employees reinstated, (4) the compensatory damages were excessive, and (5) the punitive damages against Mayor Rom&#225;n were unwarranted.

Melendez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201947\"><a href=\"/opinion/201947/whitfield-v-melendez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Career Employees</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rom&#225;n was elected mayor of the Municipality of San Lorenzo on November 7, 2000, and took office on January 9, 2001. He defeated incumbent NPP Mayor V&#237;ctor Figueroa Orozco. He then appointed Norat, previously a Public Works employee in another city, to head San Lorenzo's Department of Public Works. The Department had several divisions, including sanitation, which was responsible for garbage collection and other cleaning tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after taking office, Mayor Rom&#225;n and other municipal officials, including Norat, began planning the possible privatization of the sanitation division. The officials testified that they did so because of lackluster garbage collection, and that they conducted a cost-benefit analysis and determined that privatization would save San Lorenzo hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. However, two PDP-affiliated witnesses &#8212; plaintiff Samuel Borges Col&#243;n (\"Borges\"), a former sanitation supervisor, and Sandra Gonz&#225;lez D&#237;az (\"Gonz&#225;lez\"), defendant Iraida Hornedo's predecessor as municipal human resources director &#8212; testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n had said in their presence that the privatization plan was a device to force NPP workers out of government employment. Further, Gonz&#225;lez testified that in privatizing the sanitation division, the Municipality did not follow its 1997 Layoff Plan, which required that transitory workers be fired first in the event of layoffs. She testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n and \"other fellow officers . . . [and] ranking employees\" had said that \"with this privatization process, they were going to be able to get rid of employees that were not belonging to the political party of the people in power.\" She also testified, based on her experience as municipal human resources director, that the criteria used to appoint personnel in San Lorenzo after Mayor Rom&#225;n took office were as follows: \"[t]o be affiliated with the PDP, to be acquaintances of the mayor or relatives of the mayor, to be friends with some high-ranking functionary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges testified that soon after the mayoral election he met with Mayor Rom&#225;n, who told him \"that he needed me there at public works, to help him, because the first thing he wanted to do was to take the NPP's out of the municipality.\" Asked about Mayor Rom&#225;n's attitude toward public works employees, Borges testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, his attitude was that, since they were NPP's, he didn't want them there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And how did you know that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Because they would tell me, the engineer would tell me,<sup>[1]</sup> Mr. Martin Davila would tell me, that they wanted to get rid of the NPP employees in order to place Popular Democratic Party followers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: When, if at any time, did the mayor tell you that those were his intentions after he became mayor of San Lorenzo, you know?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: On numerous occasions at Public Works, when we would meet with Mr. Norat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you recall what were his words?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: That he had to get rid of the NPP employees because he had to place his people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2001, Norat took the privatization proposal and the favorable cost-benefit analysis to the Municipal Assembly for approval. On August 30, 2001, the Assembly approved Municipal Ordinance No. 7 (\"the ordinance\"), authorizing Mayor Rom&#225;n to negotiate the privatization of the sanitation division. Mayor Rom&#225;n signed the ordinance the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinance, the Municipal Assembly set conditions on the privatization process. It stated that the company with which the Municipality contracted for privatization had to agree, when hiring, \"to consider all of the municipal employees who qualify within their standards of selection of employees pursuant to its Human Resources regulations.\" It also added a second requirement: The remaining employees belonging to the sanitation area will be retained in their positions or will be relocated to other dependencies of the municipality pursuant to the needs of the service. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality of San Lorenzo agrees to protect and guarantee the vested rights of the regular employees who are working in the Department of Sanitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The city began soliciting privatization proposals. Five companies submitted proposals; the municipal bids board selected a firm called ARB and arranged for ARB to take over the Municipality's sanitation service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2002, Mayor Rom&#225;n wrote a letter to thirty-six sanitation employees (the \"career plaintiffs\"), informing them that their jobs were terminated effective February 25. Though the events leading up to privatization had taken months, this was the career plaintiffs' first official notice of potential privatization or its possible effect on their jobs. Of the thirty-six career plaintiffs, thirty-five were affiliated with the NPP,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> while the last, Borges, was a PDP member who had had a falling-out with Mayor Rom&#225;n over Borges' sympathy for NPP co-workers. Most of the career plaintiffs testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n knew their political affiliation, either because they were neighbors or because Mayor Rom&#225;n had seen them participating in NPP electioneering activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 23 letter, signed by Mayor Rom&#225;n, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the privatization . . . the sanitation program of the Municipal Department of Public Works is eliminated, which entails the lay-off and elimination of all the positions assigned to said program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the above, you are laid off from your position effective February 25, 2002. You have 30 days as of the date of this communication to appeal this decision before the Board of Appeals of the Personnel System of the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter also stated, however, that the ordinance and the contract between San Lorenzo and ARB \"provide[] for the recruitment and job security of the personnel affected by this negotiation.\" It added that \"[t]he Municipality will coordinate this process and will notify the day and time of the job interviews.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the affected workers were \"career employees.\" Under Puerto Rico law, as career employees, they had vested property rights in their jobs and, in general terms, could only be removed for cause and were entitled to procedural due process protections.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In this case, the 1997 Layoff Plan, which required that transitory workers be fired before such career workers in the event layoffs were necessary, was not followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 23 letter was delivered to most of the career plaintiffs at a meeting on January 25, 2002, at the Priscilla Flores Theater. San Lorenzo's new director of human resources, Hornedo,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> spoke to the workers, telling them that the Municipality had set up a process to help them get jobs with ARB. Hornedo also told the career plaintiffs that if any of them had questions or concerns, they could come to her office to talk with her and review their personnel files. The career plaintiffs were given ARB applications during this meeting, and some filled them out and submitted them on the spot. Unemployment officials attended the meeting, bringing along unemployment benefits forms for them to fill out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the months that followed, a few of the career plaintiffs obtained jobs with ARB.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Most, however, found themselves without jobs either at ARB or within the Municipality. Some testified that they approached Hornedo and asked her to find them other jobs in the Municipality; she told them no jobs were available. One career plaintiff, Raul Galarza Santana, said Hornedo told him she had spoken to Mayor Rom&#225;n, and the Mayor \"had said there was no chance for me being rehired.\" Another career plaintiff, Ivan Rosa-Rivera, said Hornedo told him: \"I am deeply sorry. This decision has already been taken. These are orders coming from above, and you are dismissed from your work.\" Mayor Rom&#225;n was in charge of all personnel decisions in the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of the career plaintiffs also testified that they filled out applications with ARB but were never offered jobs or contacted for interviews. Others testified that they <i>were</i> offered jobs at ARB, but under conditions that made the jobs difficult or impossible to accept. The offered jobs were in Cata&#241;o and other towns some distance from San Lorenzo. Some had no way to get there for work; others said ARB offered to pick them up in San Lorenzo and drive them back and forth, but that that would mean getting up at 2 or 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m. &#8212; a twenty-hour day. One of the career plaintiffs, David de Jesus-Santa, testified that he took the Cata&#241;o job, managed to get ARB to transfer him to San Lorenzo for two months, but was then told he would be assigned to Cata&#241;o again; he quit because he had no way to get there. Another, Rafael Martinez-Santana, testified that when he approached Juan Reyes Burgos, the president of ARB, to ask for work, Burgos told him that \"he would give me work, but not in San Lorenzo; that the mayor [Rom&#225;n] had told him to give me work, but not in San Lorenzo. He did not want me in San Lorenzo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other evidence also established a political motivation for the elimination of the career plaintiffs' positions. Borges testified that at least four of the five former sanitation workers who kept their jobs with the Municipality after the privatization were PDP-affiliated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Well over one hundred of the transitory municipal workers hired by the Rom&#225;n administration were PDP-affiliated. One witness testified he could not identify any NPP hires among a list of all the new transitory employees. Various career plaintiffs testified that the Municipality made no attempt to offer them these transitory jobs, even when they were qualified for the positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some of the plaintiffs testified that, while their job descriptions were technically eliminated, PDP loyalists were hired and took over their job duties under different titles. For example, career plaintiff Benito Claudio-Figueroa testified that he was a heavy vehicle and equipment supervisor, and that a man whom he knew to be a PDP member was performing his old job for the Municipality, under the new title \"Deputy Director of Public Works.\" Finally, a number of career plaintiffs testified that they had been employed elsewhere in the Department of Public Works prior to the Rom&#225;n administration, but had been asked by Norat to switch to sanitation in 2001, after Mayor Rom&#225;n's election. These plaintiffs all testified that they were not offered their old positions back, and most testified that those positions were filled by workers they knew to be PDP loyalists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only non-NPP member among the thirty-six terminated career plaintiffs, Borges, testified that despite his PDP affiliation, he opposed political firings and said as much to Norat, the head of the Department of Public Works. Borges testified that on August 17, 2001, Norat told Borges that the Mayor was unhappy with Borges because Borges supposedly had met with a group of NPP employees who were suing the Municipality in a separate action. Borges was placed on twenty days' compensatory leave. He was placed on another leave later in the year, and in December, he testified, he returned from an illness to find that his supervisory duties had been reassigned to a PDP loyalist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges was among the employees terminated via the January 23, 2002 letter. After the meeting at the Flores Theater, he approached ARB official Burgos and told him he was available to work for ARB. He testified that Burgos told him \"that he was sorry, that he could not give me work about the municipality of San Lorenzo because the Honorable Mayor had told him that . . . he could not offer work to any of the people who had been dismissed; that he could give me work, but in the municipality of Cata&#241;o.\" When Burgos told him the arrangement &#8212; that he would be picked up at 3 a.m., driven to Cata&#241;o, and then driven back to San Lorenzo at night &#8212; Borges \"told [Burgos] that schedule would be impossible for me because that would mean being away from my home almost all day and night.\" Borges also approached Hornedo and asked her to reevaluate his case. He testified that Hornedo told him that \"she had orders from the mayor that there was no more work for me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Non-Career Employee</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other plaintiff in this appeal, Sheidi N. Hern&#225;ndez Morales (\"Hern&#225;ndez\"), was differently situated. She was first hired by the Municipality of San Lorenzo under a transitory, or contract, appointment effective July 1, 1993. Thereafter, she was appointed to various transitory positions in San Lorenzo over the next six years, though the appointments were not always consecutive. In July 1999, she was hired for a six-month position as a Social Worker in the Municipality's Childcare Network; she received an excellent evaluation. Her contract as a Social Worker was renewed in January 2000 and again in July 2000 and January 2001. The last of these contracts was due to expire on September 30, 2001. On September 17, 2001, Hern&#225;ndez received a letter from Mayor Rom&#225;n telling her to make arrangements with her supervisor to use her accumulated leave time during the rest of the month. Thereafter, her contract was not renewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hern&#225;ndez was not a career employee and had no property interest in her job protectable under the Due Process Clause, she did produce evidence that her position continued to exist and was filled by a PDP member, and this resulted from discrimination against her based on party affiliation. Gonz&#225;lez, the former human resources director, testified that Mayor Rom&#225;n knew that Hern&#225;ndez was affiliated with the NPP. Asked why Hern&#225;ndez' appointment was not renewed, Gonz&#225;lez replied: \"Every day, [Hern&#225;ndez' supervisor] Ms. Carmen Contrerras . . . was publicly stating, both in meetings and out of meetings, asking when she was going to be able to get rid of the two NPP affiliates who were in her office.\" Mayor Rom&#225;n made all personnel decisions in the Municipality while Gonz&#225;lez worked in his administration, a period lasting from January to December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez testified that after the PDP electoral victory, the work atmosphere in her division of municipal government became uncomfortable and hostile. Contrerras, her supervisor at the Childcare Network, harassed the NPP employees in the office, telling them that they were from the past administration and that the new administration was \"going to make a big change.\" Contrerras told Hern&#225;ndez her contract was not being renewed because of lack of funds. But there was evidence that was not true: a co-worker in accounting told Hernandez that \"there was going to be more funds, and, in fact, the salaries might even be raised.\" Eventually, PDP-affiliated employees were hired to replace Hern&#225;ndez and three other NPP-affiliated transitory employees who had not received new contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Testimony of Defendants</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, Mayor Rom&#225;n, Norat, and Hornedo, gave a markedly different version of events. They testified that soon after Mayor Rom&#225;n took office, conditions in the sanitation division began to deteriorate noticeably: the number of citizen complaints about trash service skyrocketed, and garbage trucks began breaking down with more frequency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This crisis, they testified, was what spurred the decision to transfer workers from elsewhere in Public Works into sanitation, as well as the eventual decision to privatize sanitation. The defense also pointed to the ordinance adopted by the Municipal Assembly, which cited a desire to offer \"a better quality of service\" as one reason to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat testified that political affiliation had nothing to do with the privatization decision or its execution. Indeed, Mayor Rom&#225;n testified that he did not know plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez, and as to the career plaintiffs, Norat testified that city leaders pondering privatization considered it \"nonnegotiable\" that whoever won the contract had to hire all of the displaced workers. Hornedo testified that the administration fully intended to coordinate the displaced career plaintiffs' hiring with ARB, and to rehire those who did not find ARB jobs; she testified that most of the career plaintiffs never approached them seeking jobs and never completed the ARB hiring process. However, Mayor Rom&#225;n admitted on cross-examination that the January 23, 2002 termination letter did not tell the employees about the process they would have to use to seek ARB employment and did not tell them that they could seek reemployment with the Municipality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Furthermore, while Hornedo testified that several of the career plaintiffs returned to ask the Municipality for jobs and were offered positions, she admitted that those positions were transitory &#8212; much less desirable than the career jobs the plaintiffs had previously held.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n offered the defense that he relied on legal advice. He testified that he sought the advice of Gonz&#225;lez and a municipal attorney in deciding how to proceed with privatization; he said they advised him that he should not follow the 1997 Layoff Plan, but instead should follow the new municipal ordinance and make sure the displaced workers were guaranteed employment with ARB. Gonz&#225;lez contradicted this testimony. She testified that early in Mayor Rom&#225;n's term, he called her into his office and asked her to bring a list of Public Works employees. He told her to read the list and cross off the names he indicated; he explained that \"he was going to get rid of some public works employees at the time of the privatization.\" Gonz&#225;lez testified that she \"told [Rom&#225;n] to be careful with the new lawsuit [a separate discrimination complaint concerning other employees], and that we had to follow the processes established by law.\" She said he replied, \"I'm . . . the mayor and I make the decisions.\" Gonz&#225;lez also testified that she thought the 1997 Layoff Plan should have been followed, that she was not consulted as to details of the privatization, and that the reason the Layoff Plan was not followed was that \"the mayor didn't want to use it.\" The attorney upon whose advice Mayor Rom&#225;n said he relied did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n also denied saying anything to Borges about plaintiffs' political affiliations. In fact, the Mayor testified, it was Borges who first suggested privatization to him. Borges testified to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 24, 2002, the thirty-six career plaintiffs, along with Hern&#225;ndez and two other former municipal employees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> filed suit against Mayor Rom&#225;n, Norat, Hornedo, and the Municipality. Their complaint, filed under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and related provisions of Puerto Rico law, alleged as to every plaintiff that (1) the three defendants had terminated them in violation of their due process rights, and (2) the terminations of their employment were based on political affiliation and were therefore also in violation of their First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury trial commenced on October 1, 2003, and ended on November 10, 2003. At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the defense moved for Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 judgment as a matter of law on all issues. The district court granted the motion as to Hern&#225;ndez' political discrimination claims against Norat and Hornedo, but allowed her political discrimination claim to go forward against the Mayor. The court otherwise denied the motion, leaving the career plaintiffs' due process and political discrimination claims intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2003, at the close of testimony, defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the remaining issues &#8212; Hern&#225;ndez' political discrimination claim against Mayor Rom&#225;n and the career plaintiffs' due process and political discrimination claims against all the defendants. They argued that Hern&#225;ndez had not proved that the Mayor even knew her political affiliation, and that her position was not filled for months after the non-renewal of her contract; thus, they argued, there was a failure of evidence as to political discrimination. As to the career plaintiffs, the defense argued that (1) Norat could not be held liable because there had been no evidence establishing that he had a say in the decision to terminate the sanitation workers, and (2) all defendants could not be held liable because the privatization decision stemmed from public health concerns, not political discrimination, and because the Mayor relied on legal advice in deciding what shape privatization should take. The district court denied the motion in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, 2003, the jury returned its verdicts. As to Hern&#225;ndez, the jury found Rom&#225;n liable and assessed compensatory damages of $28,400 and punitive damages of $3,000. As to the thirty-six career plaintiffs, the jury found both Rom&#225;n and Norat (but not Hornedo) liable. It assessed compensatory damages against Rom&#225;n and Norat in amounts ranging from $18,537 to $33,200 per career plaintiff; the total was $887,097. It also assessed punitive damages against Rom&#225;n only, in the amount of $3,000 per career plaintiff, for a total of $108,000. The verdict form the jury was given did not ask it to indicate whether it was finding for plaintiffs on due process grounds, First Amendment grounds, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2003, the district court entered judgment against Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat in the amounts the jury had awarded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> It also ordered the career plaintiffs reinstated to career positions at the Municipality, with the \"same salaries, benefits, seniority, and equivalent functions as they had before their illegal dismissal from employment.\" The defendants renewed their Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, submitted a Rule 59 motion requesting that the compensatory and punitive damages be remitted, and asked the district court to reconsider its reinstatement order. These motions were denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat bring several challenges. First, as to the thirty-six career plaintiffs, they argue that (1) plaintiffs never demonstrated on the evidence a prima facie causal connection between their political affiliation and the termination of their employment; (2) the defense evidence compelled a finding that there was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the privatization; and (3) even if some political animus had been present, defendants still should prevail because the evidence showed that such animus was not the but-for cause of the privatization. They also argue that both Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat are entitled to qualified immunity. As to remedy, they argue that even if there were liability here, the district court's reinstatement order was inappropriate; that compensatory damages should be remitted because of plaintiffs' failure to mitigate; and that punitive damages were unavailable on these facts as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Hern&#225;ndez, Mayor Rom&#225;n argues that she cannot sustain a First Amendment claim because there was no evidence of political animus as a cause of the non-renewal of her contract, and because Hern&#225;ndez' contract would not have been renewed in any event since she was not qualified for her Social Worker position.

These incumbent employees have no right to thwart the will of the voters that a new regime make changes, if the new regime would have made those changes even in the absence of any prohibited discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Political Discrimination and the Career Plaintiffs</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that no reasonable juror could have found political discrimination on these facts. They point to the testimony of Rom&#225;n and Norat that the sanitation division was privatized because of public health and quality-of-service concerns, and that political affiliation played no role in their decisions. This, they argue, constitutes (1) evidence showing lack of discriminatory animus, (2) evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the privatization, and (3) evidence sufficient to show, under <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> that political discrimination was not the \"but-for\" cause of the decision to eliminate career plaintiffs' jobs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants make two additional arguments. First, they point to the testimony that a system was in place to ensure that the fired employees were rehired, either by ARB or by the Municipality; they suggest this compels a conclusion that no discrimination was intended. Second, they argue that the municipal ordinance authorizing privatization, and Rom&#225;n's testimony that he followed the advice of his human resources director and an attorney in devising the privatization process, show that both the decision to privatize, and the decision to privatize in a way that cost the career plaintiffs their jobs, were free of discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the case does not turn on the legitimacy of a decision by a Municipality to privatize its sanitation division. To be sure, the evidence presented some reasons to doubt such legitimacy: the Mayor had expressed a desire to rid the Department of Public Works of NPP members, and to fill the jobs with PDP members, and he could not do so within the current structure, given that the sanitation workers were protected as career employees under Puerto Rico law. Further, there is some evidence that the new regime deliberately made matters worse in order to provoke a sanitation crisis which would justify a decision to privatize. Still, this might well be too fragile an underpinning to justify federal intervention in a decision to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Mayor Rom&#225;n</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict against Mayor Rom&#225;n, however, is easily supported by the manner in which his administration implemented the decision to privatize. A jury could readily conclude that the Rom&#225;n administration implemented privatization in a manner designed to discriminate. The administration did so, or so a jury could find, in violation of multiple separate requirements of local law: (1) two provisions of the municipal privatization ordinance, (2) the previously adopted Layoff Plan, and (3) the procedural rights of career employees. The municipal ordinance did not authorize Rom&#225;n to terminate the career plaintiffs' employment. Instead, it required that the private sanitation firm consider the municipal sanitation workers for jobs, and that sanitation workers who did not take jobs with the private firm be \"<i>retained in their positions or . . . relocated to other dependencies of the municipality.</i>\" The ordinance also stated that the Municipality agreed \"to protect and guarantee the vested rights\" of the career plaintiffs. The privatization system Rom&#225;n and Norat actually implemented did neither of these things. As to the 1997 Layoff Plan, Gonz&#225;lez testified that it applied to privatizations and that she advised the Mayor to follow the law, and Mayor Rom&#225;n himself conceded that if the Layoff Plan applied, transitory workers had to be laid off before any career employee. The jury could easily conclude that political motivation was a substantial reason and, indeed, the but-for reason for the decisions not to follow these laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there were explicit statements by Mayor Rom&#225;n of an intent to discriminate. Gonz&#225;lez testified that the Mayor said that \"with this privatization process, they were going to be able to get rid of employees that were not belonging to the political party of the people in power.\" She also testified that Rom&#225;n said the Layoff Plan was ignored because it would have been an obstacle to firing NPP workers. Others testified that the Mayor went so far as to instruct ARB officials not to offer the fired workers jobs in San Lorenzo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Mayor took the stand, and on important questions where his testimony was flatly contradicted by other witnesses, the jury could easily have concluded his testimony was not credible. Mayor Rom&#225;n testified that discrimination played no role in the privatization decision. But the jury also heard testimony that Rom&#225;n believed (correctly) that the sanitation division was a nest of NPP-affiliated workers, and that discrimination did play a role in the decision to privatize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n also testified that he shaped the privatization plan in reliance on advice from his human resources director and attorney. Here, too, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mayor Rom&#225;n's testimony was deliberately untrue: his human resources director, Gonz&#225;lez, testified both that she did not in fact give Mayor Rom&#225;n such advice and that Mayor Rom&#225;n structured the privatization plan the way he did specifically so he could fire NPP-affiliated workers. The defendants also failed to call as a witness the attorney on whose legal advice the Mayor purportedly relied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also testified that they intended to ensure the career plaintiffs jobs at ARB and rehire them at the Municipality if necessary. However, a reasonable jury easily could have concluded that this too was a lie, and that no such system was in place. Most of the career plaintiffs never acquired jobs at ARB or the Municipality, even when they sought them out. Some were explicitly told that Rom&#225;n had ordered that they not be rehired. And those who <i>did</i> receive employment offers were confronted with jobs vastly inferior, either in terms of benefits (transitory employment) or working conditions (private-sector positions with long commutes and questionable job security), to those they had previously held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the jury heard specific and detailed testimony that most, if not all, of the municipal workers hired since the privatization were PDP-affiliated, and that some of those new PDP workers performed jobs that the fired sanitation workers had done, just under the guise of different job titles. This, in combination with the evidence described above, is more than sufficient. <i>See Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, 565-66 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Engineer Norat</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evidence, the jury could well have concluded that Norat was not liable because he did not agree with or intend to participate in the discrimination effectuated by the Mayor, but did so only under compulsion. However, the jury did not exonerate Norat, and evidence supports its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borges testified that Norat was present when Mayor Rom&#225;n spoke of his desire to fire the NPP employees in the Public Works Department. Norat was deeply involved with the privatization; he took it to the Municipal Assembly and he told the career plaintiffs to stay home and take compensatory time after January 25. Defendants characterize the privatization decision as one made by both men together: \"<i>Mayor Rom&#225;n and Norat</i> made a difficult administrative decision, after a thorough analysis, to privatize the sanitation services.\" Importantly, there is evidence that Norat was not just carrying out Mayor Rom&#225;n's decision, but in fact harbored political animus himself. Asked how he knew that the Mayor's desire to fire public works employees was politically motivated, Borges replied: \"Because they would tell me, <i>the engineer would tell me,</i> Mr. Martin Davila would tell me, that <i>they</i> wanted to get rid of the NPP employees in order to place Popular Democratic Party followers.\" The engineer was obviously Norat, or so a jury could find. Further, it was Norat who encouraged NPP members elsewhere in the department to transfer to sanitation before there was any public discussion of privatizing the division; these NPP members subsequently lost their jobs upon privatization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, a reasonable jury could have concluded that Norat helped Mayor Rom&#225;n devise the plan to privatize the sanitation division in such a way as to remove the career plaintiffs from their jobs, and would not have done so but for plaintiffs' NPP affiliations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Political Discrimination and Plaintiff Hern&#225;ndez</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he fact that a transitory employee does not have a reasonable expectation of renewal in his or her employment. . . does not defeat a First Amendment claim.\" <i>Gomez v.

As to the third prong of the test, defendants argue that the Mayor relied on advice from counsel and from Gonz&#225;lez, the human resources director. But a jury easily could have found that this was not so, and that Mayor Rom&#225;n was explicitly warned he should not engage in this scheme in violation of the rights of these employees.

First, defendants argue that because the career plaintiffs declined to take their complaint to the Board of Appeals of the Personnel Administration System (known as JASAP) within thirty days, the municipal personnel decision became unappealable. This is clearly incorrect: state employees asserting claims such as these are not required to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a &#167; 1983 action in federal court. <i>Baez-Cruz v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span> (1982)). Second, defendants argue that because of the career plaintiffs' failure to go through JASAP, \"the doctrine of issue preclusion bars the District Court from ordering reinstatement.\" This argument makes no sense. Where there has been no hearing, and therefore no findings, there can be no issue preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' final argument is that the factors this court has deemed relevant to the reinstatement question cut against reinstating the career plaintiffs, and so the district court abused its discretion. They admit that the career plaintiffs \"in great part did not find gainful employment after the layoff.\" However, they argue that reinstatement was still inappropriate because, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) most of the career plaintiffs' old jobs were eliminated in the privatization, (2) the antagonism between the parties would create a poor work environment, (3) the career plaintiffs \"were compensated more than adequately\" for the loss of their jobs, and (4) the career plaintiffs did not have \"clean hands\" because many did not complete the process of applying to work for ARB or reapplying for work at the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the political discrimination context, a violation of First Amendment rights does not lead <i>a fortiori</i> to reinstatement. <i>Velazquez v.

On the other hand, \"[w]henever an ex-employee sues alleging wrongful dismissal by a government agency, job restoration may be a material aspect of meaningful relief.\" <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 322. \"[R]outinely incidental burdens\" of reinstatement &#8212; for example, tension in the workplace, or displacement of employees who had taken on duties previously handled by the fired workers &#8212; \"are foreseeable sequelae of defendant's wrongdoing, and usually insufficient, without more, to tip the scales against reinstatement when first amendment rights are at stake in a section 1983 action.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Among the factors relevant to the reinstatement analysis are the following: \"(1) the strength of the evidence proving the first amendment violation; (2) whether the discharged employee has found comparable work; [and] (3) the absence of a property right in the position because the employee was hired in violation of local law.\" <i>Velazquez,</i> 996 F.2d at 429.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in ordering reinstatement here. Plaintiffs presented strong evidence of a First Amendment violation, and many of the career plaintiffs have not found work in the aftermath. The possibility of workplace antagonism, and the upheaval that will be caused by finding jobs for the fired workers, are the \"foreseeable sequelae of defendant[s'] wrongdoing,\" <i>Rosario-Torres,</i> 889 F.2d at 322. Nor do the damage awards obviate the need for reinstatement. <i>See Hiraldo-Cancel,</i> 925 F.2d at 13 (noting that often, \"[w]hen a person loses his job, it is at best disingenuous to say that money damages can suffice to make that person whole,\" because \"[t]he psychological benefits of work . . . are real and cannot be ignored\") (first alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Allen v.

Defendants' last argument, that the career plaintiffs do not have \"clean hands,\" is without merit. On the evidence at trial, those plaintiffs who did not apply for jobs had good reason for their decisions both as to ARB, where working conditions were poor, and as to the Municipality, where they had every reason to believe they were unwelcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants appeal from the district court's refusal to remit the various damage awards.

As to economic loss, many of the plaintiffs were without their jobs and associated benefits for a substantial period of time &#8212; from at least February 2002 through November 2003, when the district court ordered them reinstated &#8212; and while their salaries varied, most earned between $800 and $1,000 per month.

Three of the career plaintiffs held jobs with ARB at the time of trial; however, there was testimony that one of those three was fired for missing work to testify at the trial, while a second had been told he would be fired for the same reason</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> He did not identify the party affiliation of the fifth worker</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> This deterioration coincided, however, with the Municipality's decision to let the contracts of at least fifteen transitory sanitation workers expire; according to at least one witness, that caused a labor shortage that led to the decline in the quality of service</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> This testimony dovetailed with that of many of the career plaintiffs, who expressed bewilderment when asked on cross-examination whether they had approached the Municipality and asked to be rehired. Said one: \"I mean, no. They fired me. If they fired me, how can they give me a job?\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Hornedo testified that one fired worker, a Mr. Ventura Gomez, accepted a transitory position with the Municipality.
