Wishart, with whom McKenzie & Associates, P.C., was\non brief, for appellant.\n     Brian E. Lewis, with whom Doreen M. Zankowski, Douglas F.\nSeaver, and Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        December 28, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n      Honorable Jane A. Restani, Chief Judge of the United States\nCourt of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n\f            RESTANI, Judge.      On January 29, 2003, Joseph Maher\n\n(“Maher”), invoking federal question jurisdiction, filed suit in\n\nfederal    court   against    employer-defendant      GSI    Lumonics,    Inc.\n\n(“GSI”),    alleging   age   discrimination   in     his    termination   from\n\nemployment.    The district court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof GSI on the federal claims and “transferred” the related state-\n\nlaw claims to Massachusetts state court.           Because such a transfer\n\nis not allowed, the state court dismissed the case.\n\n            On August 27, 2004, Maher filed a new complaint in\n\nMassachusetts      state     court,     alleging      similar     employment\n\ndiscrimination claims.       GSI removed the suit to federal court and\n\nthen moved for summary judgment on res judicata grounds.                   The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion, and Maher appeals.              We affirm\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n                       I.    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            On December 27, 2002, Maher filed a complaint against GSI\n\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the\n\nEqual     Employment   Opportunity     Commission,     claiming    that    age\n\ndiscrimination motivated his termination from employment.                 After\n\nreceiving right-to-sue letters from both agencies, Maher filed a\n\ncomplaint against GSI in district court based upon federal question\n\njurisdiction.1     Maher v. GSI Lumonics, Inc., No. 03-10187 (D. Mass.\n\n\n     1\n      In this first action Maher alleged: (1) age discrimination\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §621 et\nseq., (2) violation of the Older Workers’ Benefit Protection Act\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJan. 29, 2003) [hereinafter Maher I].             He did not plead diversity\n\njurisdiction although it was available – Maher is domiciled in\n\nMassachusetts while GSI is a Canadian corporation. At the close of\n\ndiscovery, GSI moved for summary judgment.                 The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of GSI on the federal claims but\n\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law\n\nclaims.    The district court instead “transferred [the state-law\n\nclaims] to state court.”        Maher I, slip op. at 5 (D. Mass. April 9,\n\n2004).    The state court then dismissed the case without prejudice\n\nbecause   a     case   that    originates   in    federal    court   cannot     be\n\n“transferred” to state court.2\n\n              On August 27, 2004, Maher filed a new complaint in state\n\ncourt, alleging the two state-law claims he had alleged previously\n\nin Maher I.      Maher v. GSI Lumonics, Inc., DSCV 2004-0160B (Essex\n\nSuper. Ct. Aug. 27, 2004) [hereinafter Maher II]. Maher also added\n\none new state-law claim and a new defendant, Charles Winston.3                 GSI\n\nremoved   the    action   to    federal   court    based    upon   diversity    of\n\n\n\n\n(“OWBPA”), 29 U.S.C. § 626 (f), (3) unlawful “retaliation” under\nOWBPA, (4) age discrimination under the Massachusetts Fair\nEmployment Practices Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, and (5) breach\nof the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n     2\n      28 U.S.C. § 1631 provides for transfer from one federal court\nto another to cure want of jurisdiction.\n     3\n      Winston is the President and CEO of GSI. He was voluntarily\ndismissed from the case by Maher on March 24, 2005.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcitizenship.4     Once   in   federal      court,   GSI   moved   for   summary\n\njudgment, alleging that res judicata precluded Maher’s second suit,\n\nand the district court granted GSI’s motion. This appeal followed.\n\n                              II.   DISCUSSION\n\n           We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment based upon res judicata.           AVX Corp. v. Cabot Corp., 424\n\nF.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 2005).        Here, because the judgment in Maher\n\nI was rendered by a federal court exercising federal question\n\njurisdiction, the applicability of res judicata is a matter of\n\nfederal law.    See AVX Corp., 424 F.3d at 30; Kale v. Combined Ins.\n\nCo. of Am., 924 F.2d 1161, 1164 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Cemer v.\n\nMarathon Oil Co., 583 F.2d 830, 832 (6th Cir. 1978)).\n\n           “Under the federal law of res judicata, a final judgment\n\non the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating\n\nclaims that were raised or could have been raised in that action.”\n\nPorn v. Nat’l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(citing Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980)).                Res judicata\n\npromotes judicial efficiency and prevents “claim-splitting” by\n\nrequiring litigants to assert all of their factual allegations and\n\nlegal theories, including jurisdictional allegations, pertaining to\n\ntheir claim the first time they come to court.            See Kale, 924 F.2d\n\nat 1165.   Notably, in   Kale, we held that a litigant’s second suit\n\n\n\n     4\n      The addition of Winston, a resident of California, did not\ndestroy diversity.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas precluded because he did not pursue all of his state-law claims\n\nby asserting diversity jurisdiction in his first suit in federal\n\ncourt when he could have done so.          Id.\n\nA.   Application of Kale v. Combined Insurance Co. of America\n\n              The present case involves essentially the same procedural\n\nmissteps made in Kale.      In Kale, the plaintiff-appellant Carl Kale\n\nfiled suit against his former employers in federal court, pleading\n\nfederal question jurisdiction, but not diversity jurisdiction. Id.\n\nat 1163.      The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendant on Kale’s federal claims and dismissed without\n\nprejudice the related state-law claims.          Id.    Kale did not seek to\n\namend   his     complaint   in   district    court     to   allege   diversity\n\njurisdiction but instead filed suit in Massachusetts state court,\n\nalleging injuries stemming from the same cause of action.              Id. at\n\n1163–64.      The defendant removed the state case to federal court\n\nbased upon diversity jurisdiction and then moved for summary\n\njudgment on res judicata grounds.       Id. at 1164.        The district court\n\ngranted the motion and we affirmed on appeal.                Id. at 1169.   We\n\nheld that Kale’s second suit was precluded because he could have\n\npursued his state-law claims in his first suit if he had alleged\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.          Id. at 1166.        We also noted that a\n\n“cursory reference” to diversity jurisdiction in a string cite did\n\nnot adequately raise the issue before the district court.              Id. at\n\n1164 n.1.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          In the present case, Maher also could have had his state-\n\nlaw claims heard in his first suit if he had asserted diversity\n\njurisdiction.     Like   Kale,    Maher   did   not   plead   diversity\n\njurisdiction in his original complaint, nor did he later attempt to\n\namend his complaint to do so.    Maher argues, however, that his case\n\nis distinguishable from Kale because diversity jurisdiction is\n\napparent on the face of the complaint through the statement of the\n\nparties’ domiciles.   Like Kale’s “cursory reference” to diversity\n\njurisdiction, Maher’s reliance on sua sponte action by the district\n\ncourt to assert diversity jurisdiction for him is unavailing. “The\n\nburden of proving the existence of . . . diversity jurisdiction .\n\n. . lies with the pleader.”     Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 736\n\nF. Supp. 1183, 1184 n.3 (D. Mass. 1990) (citing Thomson v. Gaskill,\n\n315 U.S. 442, 446 (1942)).       It is Maher’s duty to assert the\n\njurisdictional basis of his claim.5\n\nB.   The Elements of Res Judicata Are Established\n\n          Before res judicata will apply, three factors must be\n\npresent: “(1) a final judgment on the merits in the earlier action;\n\n\n     5\n      Maher argues that this court should not follow Kale but\nshould follow Epperson v. Entertainment Express, Inc., 242 F.3d 100\n(2d Cir. 2001), which held that plaintiffs were not prohibited from\n“pursuing some of their claims on a narrower jurisdictional basis\nafter their attempt to allege a jurisdictional basis that would\nresolve all of their claims in one proceeding was rejected.”\nEpperson is not contrary to Kale, as the Second Circuit itself\nremarked. See id. at 109. The Second Circuit distinguished Kale\nbecause unlike the plaintiff in Epperson, Kale did not allege\ndiversity jurisdiction, which would have allowed him to resolve all\nof his claims in one proceeding. Id.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f(2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and\n\nlater suits; and (3) an identity of parties or privies in the two\n\nsuits.”   Kale, 924 F.2d at 1165.   There is no dispute that elements\n\ntwo and three of res judicata are established.    The only remaining\n\nissue is whether there was a final judgment on the merits.\n\n           A final judgment for res judicata purposes “end[s] the\n\nlitigation on the merits and [leaves] nothing for the court to do\n\nbut execute the judgment.”     AVX Corp., 424 F.3d at 32 (quoting\n\nAcevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22 F.3d 384, 388 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(citation omitted)).    When deciding whether a ruling by a judge\n\nended the litigation, “we [are] bound to defer to a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the judgment’s meaning and effect elucidated by\n\nthe judicial officer who authored it.”      Witty v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d\n\n517, 520 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Here, Maher argues that there was no final judgment\n\nbecause his state-law claims were not dismissed without prejudice\n\nbut were “transferred” to state court by the district court.     The\n\n“transfer” of his state-law claims does not, however, negate the\n\nfact that there was a summary judgment on his federal claims which\n\nprovides the “traditional basis for the operation of res judicata.”\n\nAVX Corp., 424 F.3d at 34 (distinguishing Kale, 924 F.2d at 1165).\n\nMoreover, because the district court “transferred” the state-law\n\nclaims only after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,\n\nthe district judge likely meant for the “transfer” to operate as a\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fdismissal.6   Thus, the district court rendered a final judgment on\n\nthe merits.     Accordingly, all three elements of the test are\n\nestablished and res judicata applies in this case.7\n\nC.   Equitable Exceptions to Res Judicata Do Not Apply\n\n          Maher also argues that an equitable exception to res\n\njudicata should be made in this case.      Although an “occasional\n\nexception” can be made if there is an “unusual hardship,” this is\n\nnot such a case.   See Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168 (no “unusual hardship”\n\nwhen plaintiff did not plead diversity jurisdiction although it was\n\navailable) (citation omitted).    Here, Maher had a full and fair\n\nopportunity to assert diversity jurisdiction and litigate all his\n\nclaims in one proceeding, but he chose not to do so.   It is Maher’s\n\nown actions that now result in the preclusion of his suit.    Thus,\n\n\n     6\n      When the district judge later addressed Maher’s argument that\na transfer differs from a dismissal, he stated that in order to\naddress the argument, he would have to “assum[e] there [was] a\ndistinction between [these] two procedural mechanisms.” Maher II,\nslip op. at 2 (D. Mass. Feb. 28, 2005). The fact that the district\njudge needed to “assume” there was a difference between the two\nprocedures demonstrates that he likely did not see a difference\nbetween the effect of the two procedures when he “transferred” the\ncase.\n     7\n      Maher also argues that the state court reserved his right to\nmaintain a second suit when it dismissed his case without\nprejudice. The exception applies, however, when “the court in the\nfirst action has expressly reserved the plaintiff’s right to\nmaintain the second action.” See Kale, 924 F.2d at 1167 (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1)(b) (1982)) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, because a federal court rendered the first ruling,\nwe examine the effect of the federal court’s ruling. In federal\ncourt, a dismissal of pendent claims on jurisdictional grounds is\nnot considered an express reservation of the right to maintain a\nsecond action. See id.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fan equitable exception to the application of res judicata does not\n\napply.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of GSI based upon res judicata.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Thus, because a federal court rendered the first ruling, we examine the effect of the federal court's ruling.

The Second Circuit distinguished <i>Kale</i> because unlike the plaintiff in <i>Epperson,</i> Kale did not allege diversity jurisdiction, which would have allowed him to resolve all of his claims in one proceeding. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> When the district judge later addressed Maher's argument that a transfer differs from a dismissal, he stated that in order to address the argument, he would have to \"assum[e] there [was] a distinction between [these] two procedural mechanisms.\"<i>Maher II,</i> slip op. at 2 (D.Mass. Feb. 28, 2005). The fact that the district judge needed to \"assume\" there was a difference between the two procedures demonstrates that he likely did not see a difference between the effect of the two procedures when he \"transferred\" the case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Maher also argues that the state court reserved his right to maintain a second suit when it dismissed his case without prejudice. The exception applies, however, when \"the court in the<i>first action</i> has expressly reserved the plaintiff's right to maintain the second action.\" <i>See Kale,</i> 924 F.2d at 1167 (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) of Judgments</i> &#167; 26(1)(b) (1982)) (emphasis added). Thus, because a federal court rendered the first ruling, we examine the effect of the federal court's ruling. In federal court, a dismissal of pendent claims on jurisdictional grounds is not considered an express reservation of the right to maintain a second action. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
