Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                          Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                     Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                        and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Fernando L. Gallardo and Antonio Borrés-Otero, with whom Woods\n& Woods LLP was on brief, for appellants.\n     Luis Sánchez-Betances, with whom Gerardo De Jesús Annoni and\nSánchez-Betances & Sifre, P.S.C. were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                              June 14, 2005\n\n\n\n\n      *\n          Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.     The basic question posed by this\n\naction is whether political association rights under the First\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States act as a check\n\non a legislature enacting a statute reorganizing an administrative\n\nagency and a check on the executive who signed and then implemented\n\nthe law.      Here, the legislature of Puerto Rico reorganized the\n\nIndustrial Commission by reducing the number of Commissioners who\n\nhear workers' compensation claims from twenty-five to five, and the\n\ngovernor signed the bill and then implemented it.             There is no\n\nclaim that the governor, in implementing the new legislation, did\n\nnot apply the same interpretation of the statute regardless of\n\npolitical affiliation of the former Commissioners.             Under that\n\nuniform      interpretation,   she   concluded   that   the   new    statute\n\neliminated all of their positions.          Some of the Commissioners,\n\nterminated from employment, sued in federal court under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.      The district court dismissed the action.         See Torres-\n\nRivera v. Calderón-Serra, 328 F. Supp. 2d 237 (D.P.R. 2004).              We\n\naffirm the judgment of dismissal against the plaintiffs on all\n\nclaims.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             Within the past decade, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nhas   used    three   different   organizational   structures       for   the\n\nIndustrial Commission, the administrative agency which handles\n\nworkers' compensation claims.        In the years before 1996 (indeed,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fsince 1935) the Commonwealth had long structured the Industrial\n\nCommission as having a maximum of five Commissioners.            To assist\n\nthe Commissioners, there was also a system, put in place since\n\n1969, of hearing examiners who would make recommendations to the\n\nfive Commissioners, who would then make a final adjudication of the\n\nclaims by majority vote.\n\n            However, on July 1, 1996, Governor Pedro Rossello, whose\n\nNew Progressive Party (NPP) had recently gained the governorship,\n\nsigned Law 63, codified at 11 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8.        Law 63 increased\n\nthe number of Commissioners from five to twenty-five and provided\n\neach Commissioner with a definite term of ten years in office.\n\nEach Commissioner was appointed by the Governor with the advice and\n\nconsent of the Senate.      Each Commissioner was given authority to\n\nmake   a   final   adjudication   of   the   claims   before   him    or   her\n\nindependently.      Law 63 also stated that Commissioners appointed\n\nprior to its effective date would remain in office until their\n\noriginal terms expired. Law 63 did not explicitly state what would\n\nhappen to the hearing examiners.\n\n            There was another change in control of the executive\n\nbranch of the Commonwealth in November 2000, when the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (PDP) took over the governor's office.              On March\n\n25, 2003, Governor Sila María Calderón-Serra (\"Governor Calderón\")\n\nsigned Law 94, which amended 11 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8 by establishing\n\na new structure for the Industrial Commission. The preamble to Law\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f94 cited problems of great inefficiency with the functioning of the\n\nIndustrial Commission and recounted a large number of complaints\n\nfrom the citizenry about long delays in the handling of cases in\n\nthat office.    By contrast with Law 63, Law 94 returned the number\n\nof Commissioners to five, to be appointed by the Governor with the\n\nadvice and consent of the Senate for fixed terms of six years\n\n(except   the   Chairman1   of   the    Commission,   whose   term   ends   on\n\nDecember 31 of the year in which general elections are held).               The\n\nlaw specified that of the five Commissioners, three should be\n\nlawyers, one should be a doctor with \"acclaimed knowledge and\n\ninterest in the field of occupational medicine\" and one should be\n\n\"a person of known sympathy for and identification with Puerto\n\nRico's organized workers' movement.\"\n\n           Despite requests from the minority parties, and unlike\n\nits predecessor statute, Law 63, the legislature put no provisions\n\nin Law 94 as to the fate of the positions of the twenty-five\n\nprevious Commissioners who had been appointed before its enactment.\n\nSee Torres-Rivera, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 240.            Law 94 simply did not\n\naddress the status of the incumbent Commissioners.            Still, Law 94\n\nemploys prospective language to describe the structure of the\n\nIndustrial Commission. For example, it states that \"[a] commission\n\n\n\n     1\n          This position is alternately referred to as \"President\"\nand \"Chairman\" in the translation of Law 94 and the parties' briefs\nand pleadings.     For consistency, this opinion uses the term\n\"Chairman.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\fto be called 'Industrial Commission of Puerto Rico' is created,\n\nwhich will have five (5) Commissioners\" (emphasis added).               The\n\nstatute also created career positions for a group of hearing\n\nexaminers, designated by the Industrial Commission's Chairman.2\n\nThose hearing examiners make recommendations to the Commissioners\n\nrather than make final determinations on their own.          On April 11,\n\n2003, the Senate approved the Governor's nomination of Gilberto M.\n\nCharriez-Rosario    (\"Charriez\")     as   Chairman    of   the   Industrial\n\nCommission. Three other new Commissioners assumed office that day.\n\nThe fifth Commissioner was not appointed at the time when the\n\nplaintiffs filed this suit.\n\n          Charriez    lost      little    time   in   carrying    out   the\n\nlegislature's reforms.       He sent written notices to all of the\n\nformer Commissioners informing them that he was the new Chairman of\n\nthe Industrial Commission.         There was some scuffling with the\n\nformer   Chairman    of   the     Commission,    Basilio     Torres-Rivera\n\n(\"Torres\"), who took the position that he was the legal Chairman\n\nuntil his term expired on June 30, 2006.              The details of this\n\ndispute are not pertinent to our present discussion.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          While the text of the statute does not specify the number\nof hearing examiners, all parties assert in their appellate briefs\nthat the number of hearing examiners is twenty-five.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            On   April   14,   2003,   the    Secretary    of   State   for   the\n\nCommonwealth at the time, Ferdinand Mercado,3 sent letters to all\n\npersons who had occupied the twenty-five Commissioners' positions,\n\nterminating their positions at the Industrial Commission effective\n\nthat day.\n\n            As frequently happens with such disputes in Puerto Rico,\n\nthe matter was brought to federal court.4             Fourteen of the former\n\nCommissioners, including Torres as lead plaintiff, sued.5 The\n\ncomplaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Puerto Rico law\n\nasserted a variety of claims in furtherance of their argument that\n\nthey could not be removed from their jobs as Commissioners, despite\n\nthe restructuring of the Industrial Commission.                 The first count\n\nalleged that Law 94 was unconstitutional both on its face and as\n\napplied to the plaintiffs because it was void for vagueness and\n\nbecause     it   permitted     interference    with    a   fundamental    First\n\n\n\n     3\n          Ferdinand Mercado is not a party to this case.     The\ncomplaint describes him as \"Interim Governor,\" perhaps acting in\nthe absence of other officials.\n     4\n          \"With each change in administration -- at both the\ncommonwealth and municipal levels -- the federal district courts in\nPuerto Rico are flooded with hundreds of political discrimination\ncases, many of which are appealed.\"      Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-\nPujols, 375 F. 3d 121, 126 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     5\n          The other plaintiffs were a group of employees of the\nIndustrial Commission who had occupied trust positions and who had\nalso been terminated, and the spouses of the Commissioners and the\ntrust employees and their conjugal partnerships. The claims of\nthese other plaintiffs are wholly derivative of the claims of the\nformer Commissioners, and we do not discuss them further.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fAmendment   right       of    the   plaintiffs     by   allowing       for   political\n\ndiscrimination.         The count also alleged that the acts of the\n\nGovernor in designating the new Commissioners were illegal in that\n\nthey deprived the old Commissioners of their rights of free speech\n\nand freedom of association.\n\n            The second count purported to sound in federal law but\n\nactually was based on Puerto Rico law.                   It argued that Law 94,\n\nproperly interpreted, did not provide for the discharge of the\n\nplaintiffs.       The third claim for relief was a federal procedural\n\ndue process claim.           It was also based on interpretation of Puerto\n\nRico law, particularly that Law 94 did not revoke those provisions\n\nof Law 63 which provided the plaintiff former Commissioners with\n\nfixed    terms.      The      fourth   count     was    one   for   deprivation     of\n\nsubstantive due process; it also denied that there was a legitimate\n\nefficiency problem with the operation of the Industrial Commission\n\nwhich had justified a change in its structure.                  The fifth claim for\n\nrelief purported to be based on the plaintiffs' \"protected liberty\n\ninterests\" and seemed to assert that the plaintiffs' reputations\n\nhad been damaged by this action.                The sixth cause of action was a\n\nPuerto    Rico    law    claim      for   damages,      under    the    supplemental\n\njurisdiction of the federal court, based on Article 1802 of the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f           The plaintiffs sought a declaration that Law 94 was\n\nunconstitutional, compensatory damages for lost pay and emotional\n\ndistress, punitive damages, and reinstatement to their positions.\n\n           The defendants named were Governor Calderón, Cesar R.\n\nMiranda-Rodriguez,    Governor       Calderón's     Chief     of   Staff,   and\n\nCharriez, the new Chairman of the Industrial Commission.                    The\n\ndefendants promptly moved to dismiss on grounds of legislative and\n\nqualified immunity and argued that certain claims failed to state\n\na claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\n           The   district    court    allowed     the   motion     and   entered\n\njudgment dismissing the federal claims with prejudice and the state\n\nclaims without prejudice on August 5, 2004. See Torres-Rivera, 328\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 244-45.      The plaintiffs timely appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           Our review of the judgment on the motion to dismiss is de\n\nnovo.   Arroyo-Melecio v. P.R. Am. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 56, 65 (1st\n\nCir. 2005). The plaintiffs have abandoned all arguments on appeal,\n\nsave three:   (1) that the statute is unconstitutional and that the\n\ndistrict   court's   (2)    legislative    immunity     and    (3)   qualified\n\nimmunity findings were in error.\n\nA.   Constitutionality of the Statute\n\n           We address first the plaintiffs' appeal from the denial\n\nof declaratory relief that Law 94 is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f             The plaintiffs bring Due Process and First Amendment\n\nclaims against the statute.            They argue that the statute is void\n\nfor vagueness because it does not clearly address what is to happen\n\nto   their     jobs;     as   well,    they    argue    that    it    embodied     the\n\nlegislature's      intention      to   engage    in    and    permitted     political\n\ndiscrimination against the former Commissioners based on their\n\npolitical     affiliation       with   the    NPP,    the    party   of    the   former\n\ngovernor.\n\n             We reject these arguments.                There are no actionable\n\nclaims that the enactment of this statute, Law 94, violates either\n\nthe plaintiffs' First Amendment or Due Process rights.\n\n              We begin with the First Amendment claim. This statute is\n\nneutral      on   its    face    and   says    nothing       about   the    political\n\naffiliations of the persons to be appointed to positions in the\n\nreorganized agency.             This statute does not require that only\n\nmembers of one political party be named Commissioners or be allowed\n\nto work for the Industrial Commission.                      That would be a very\n\ndifferent case.         The statute simply reorganizes the agency, a task\n\ncommitted to the legislature.6 See Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig,\n\n\n     6\n          This court has often rejected attempts by plaintiffs to\nchallenge on First Amendment grounds loss of employment due to\nreorganizations    of    governmental    agencies,   whether    the\nreorganization is effectuated by the legislature, by the governing\nboard of the agency, or by the administrative head of the agency.\nSee, e.g., Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n2000) (municipal ordinance repealing prior ordinance granting\ncareer status to employees); Angulo-Alvarez v. Aponte de la Torre,\n170 F.3d 246 (1st Cir. 1999) (mayor and municipal assembly adopting\n\n                                         -9-\n\f204 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Employment decisions generally are\n\nadministrative     except     when    they    are    accomplished    through\n\ntraditional     legislative    functions      such   as   policymaking    and\n\nbudgetary restructuring that strike at the heart of the legislative\n\nprocess.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n             The plaintiffs' argument assumes there is an absolute\n\nright under the First Amendment to be protected against political\n\naffiliation discrimination. But \"[t]he prohibition on encroachment\n\nof First Amendment protections is not an absolute.\"                 Elrod v.\n\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 360 (1976).       The reason it is not absolute is\n\nthat there \"is the need for political loyalty of employees . . . to\n\nthe end that representative government not be undercut by tactics\n\nobstructing     the   implementation         of   policies   of     the   new\n\nadministration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\"\n\nId. at 367.       The First Amendment political affiliation right\n\ndescribed in the line of cases from Elrod to Branti v. Finkel, 445\n\nU.S. 507 (1980), and Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62\n\n(1990), is cabined by an exception designed to give room to elected\n\nrepresentatives to make policy choices reflective of their party\n\nplatforms.    See Branti, 445 U.S. at 517-18; Rutan, 497 U.S. at 74.\n\n\n\n\nplan to privatize department of maintenance and transportation);\nVazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28 (1st Cir. 1998) (governing\nboard of commonwealth agency establishing reorganization plan which\neliminated position of employee of government contractor).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fLaw   94   is    an   expression     of    policy      choices   made   by    elected\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n            In the face of this statutory neutrality, the plaintiffs\n\nattempt to       fashion   a   claim      that   the    reorganization       was   both\n\nintended    to    and   had    the     effect     of    accomplishing    political\n\naffiliation discrimination.            Even assuming dubitante such a claim\n\ncould be made here, it does not advance the plaintiffs' case.\n\n            As to effect, there is no statutory invalidity from the\n\nfact that the statute may, in the end, lead to a situation in which\n\nthe impact of the reorganization will be to disproportionally\n\nterminate the employment of members of one political party.                          We\n\nhave rejected the application of a disparate impact theory in First\n\nAmendment political affiliation cases.                    \"If uniformly applied\n\npersonnel practices, predicated on legitimate reasons, result in\n\nterminations, those terminations are not unconstitutional because\n\nthose affiliated with one political party are disproportionately\n\nimpacted.\" Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).7\n\n\n\n\n      7\n           Even in the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection area,\na showing of disproportionate impact alone is not enough to\nestablish a constitutional violation. See Washington v. Davis, 426\nU.S. 229, 239 (1976); Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1067 (1st Cir.\n1997).    Although evidence of adverse effect may be pertinent to\nclaims of gender- or race-based discrimination under the Equal\nProtection Clause, a plaintiff must still show purposeful\ndiscrimination. See Personnel Adm'r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274\n(1979).\n\n                                          -11-\n\f             As to intent, here the legislature explicitly stated its\n\nintent behind Law 94:        it found the expanded Commission system\n\nunder Law 63 did not function effectively, leading to delays and\n\ncomplaints from the citizenry.               We will not look behind that\n\nexpress statement of intent as to a law neutral on its face.                 Cf.\n\nHill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 719-20 (2000) (content-neutrality\n\ninquiry in First Amendment context ends if stated legislative\n\nreason is content-neutral and the statute is facially neutral);\n\nMcGuire v. Reilly, 386 F.3d 45, 57 (1st Cir. 2004) (same); McGuire\n\nv. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n            The plaintiffs' void-for-vagueness argument is equally\n\nhopeless.     The vagueness claim fails even if untethered from its\n\ndependence    on    its   faulty    First    Amendment   assumptions.        The\n\nvagueness that the plaintiffs point to is a vagueness about the\n\nfate of the old Commissioners in office at the time of the\n\nenactment of the statute.          Law 94 does not regulate speech and so\n\nraises no chilling effect concerns that people will steer too far\n\nclear of prohibited speech.         That is one area where the void-for-\n\nvagueness doctrine is used. Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 390\n\nF.3d 65, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2004).               Nor does the statute impose\n\npenalties on the plaintiffs for any conduct, but fail to give them\n\nfair warning that any such conduct would be impermissible, another\n\narea where the doctrine is used.              Id.   Further, the source of\n\nvagueness    that   the   plaintiffs     purport    to   identify   raises    no\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fconcerns about       excessive    discretion    that   could   be   used     in   a\n\ndiscriminatory manner.       See id. at 94.\n\n            The plaintiffs' void-for-vagueness claims are not made\n\nany more meritorious by the fact that when plaintiff Torres refused\n\nto vacate his office on Charriez' request, Charriez had Torres\n\nindicted for a claimed misdemeanor charge of usurping the position\n\nof Chairman (he was acquitted) and a felony charge of illegally\n\nretaining      government   property   and     documents   (the     charge    was\n\npromptly dismissed).        Torres was not arrested under Law 94 but\n\nunder Puerto Rico's criminal laws.\n\nB.   Claims Against Individual Defendants for Damages\n\n            By contrast with the claim for injunctive or declaratory\n\nrelief as to the constitutionality of the statute, the claims\n\nagainst the individual defendants for damages are subject to the\n\ndoctrines of legislative and qualified immunity.\n\n1.   Signing of Law 94 By Governor\n\n            A state legislature (and for these purposes Puerto Rico\n\nis   treated    as   a   state)   enjoys    common   law   immunity    for    its\n\nlegislative acts, an immunity similar to that accorded members of\n\nCongress under the Speech or Debate Clause.                Supreme Court v.\n\nConsumers Union of the United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 732\n\n(1980).   The question we are faced with here is extension of this\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdoctrine to the executive who signs legislation, thus making it\n\nlaw.8\n\n            Although no legislators are named as defendants, the\n\nplaintiffs bring a claim against Governor Calderón for having\n\nsigned Law 94.   The Supreme Court has held that \"officials outside\n\nthe legislative branch are entitled to legislative immunity when\n\nthey perform legislative functions.\"     Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523\n\nU.S. 44, 55 (1998).     The Supreme Court of a state is entitled to\n\nlegislative immunity when its members act in a legislative capacity\n\nto promulgate a State Bar Code.    Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 734.\n\nAs well, the President acts legislatively when he approves or\n\nvetoes bills passed by Congress.     See Bogan, 523 U.S. at 55; cf.\n\nEdwards v. United States, 286 U.S. 482, 490 (1932) (noting \"the\n\nlegislative character of the President's function in approving or\n\ndisapproving bills\").    Likewise, a governor who signs into law or\n\nvetoes legislation passed by the legislature is also entitled to\n\nabsolute immunity for that act. Women's Emergency Network v. Bush,\n\n\n\n        8\n          The district court held that \"Law 94 being classified as\n[a] legislative act by its nature, [the Governor's] signing it into\nlaw is protected by absolute legislative immunity and all claims\nagainst her stemming from this act must be dismissed.\" Torres-\nRivera, 328 F. Supp. 2d at 243. We understand the court to have\nheld only that the signing of Law 94 was protected by legislative\nimmunity. The court later held that any actions by the defendants\nwere protected by qualified immunity \"insofar as they were carried\nout in accordance with or for the implementation of Law 94.\" Id.\nat 244. The plaintiffs misapprehend the ruling when they argue\nthat the district court held that the Governor's implementation of\nthe law was covered by legislative immunity.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f323 F.3d 937, 950 (11th Cir. 2003) (\"Under the doctrine of absolute\n\nlegislative immunity, a governor cannot be sued for signing a bill\n\ninto law.\"); cf. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 372-73 (1932)\n\n(recognizing a governor's signing or vetoing of a bill is a part of\n\nthe legislative process).\n\n           The plaintiffs argue that this legislative immunity may\n\nbe abrogated if the enactment of the legislation was motivated by\n\nimpermissible intent.       That argument was expressly rejected by the\n\nSupreme   Court    in   Bogan,    which   extended   absolute    legislative\n\nimmunity from suit under § 1983 to local legislators for their\n\nlegislative activities.          Bogan, 523 U.S. at 54.    The Court held\n\nthat even where a jury found that constitutionally sheltered speech\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor behind an ordinance which\n\neliminated a city department with only one employee, the mayor and\n\nhead of the city council were absolutely immune from suit for\n\ndamages under legislative immunity.            Id.   The Court held that\n\nbefore one asked about the defendants' subjective intent there was\n\nthe   \"logically    prior    question     of   whether   their   acts   were\n\nlegislative.\"     Id.\n\n           In the logically separate and prior inquiry as to whether\n\nthe acts are legislative, the only inquiry relevant in this case,\n\nintent is not part of the analysis.9             The Court instructed in\n\n\n      9\n          Of course, not everything a legislator does, even if done\nregularly, is a legislative act, Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 313\n(1973), and not all conduct relating to the legislative process is\n\n                                     -15-\n\fBogan:    \"Whether an act is legislative turns on the nature of the\n\nact, rather than on the motive or intent of the official performing\n\nit.\"     Id.    The Court had little difficulty in concluding that the\n\nordinance       at   issue   had   all   the   hallmarks   of    traditional\n\nlegislation:\n\n               The ordinance reflected a discretionary,\n               policymaking    decision    implicating    the\n               budgetary priorities of the city and the\n               services    the   city    provides   to    its\n               constituents.    Moreover, it involved the\n               termination of a position, which, unlike the\n               hiring or firing of a particular employee, may\n               have prospective implications that reach well\n               beyond the particular occupant of the office.\n               And the city council, in eliminating [the\n               department in which the plaintiff was the sole\n               employee], certainly governed \"in a field\n               where legislators traditionally have power to\n               act.\"\n\nId. at 55-56 (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 379\n\n(1951)); see also Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 7-8\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (distinguishing the legislative activities in Bogan\n\nfrom non-immunized       administrative     decisions   made    by   officials\n\nimplementing a layoff plan: the plan's procedures and criteria were\n\nnot observed; terminated employees were from one political party\n\nand were replaced by employees from the other political party; and\n\n\n\n\na legislative act, see Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 620\n(1972) (Legislative immunity did not extend to \"privilege illegal\nor unconstitutional conduct beyond that essential to foreclose\nexecutive control of legislative speech or debate and associated\nmatters such as voting and committee reports and proceedings.\");\nPowell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 503 (1969).\n\n                                     -16-\n\fthere was evidence of political harassment).                Law 94 also has all\n\nthe hallmarks of traditional legislation.\n\n               Tenney is even more explicit that there can be no inquiry\n\ninto legislative motive no matter how corrupt, for purposes of\n\n§ 1983 damages liability, so long as the state legislature is\n\nacting in traditional legislative areas.              Tenney, 341 U.S. at 377\n\n(\"The claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege\n\n[of legislative immunity]. . . . [I]t [is] not consonant with our\n\nscheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of\n\nlegislators . . . .\").           The same is true of the act of a governor\n\nin   signing     legislation.        The   remedies   are    in   the   political\n\nprocesses.\n\n2.   Claims Based on Actions By Executive to Implement Law 94\n\n               The plaintiffs also seek damages for the actions taken by\n\nGovernor Calderón, Miranda-Rodriguez (Governor Calderón's Chief of\n\nStaff), and Charriez to implement the new legislation:                  the naming\n\nof   a   new    Chairman   and    new   Commissioners,      the   notice   to   the\n\nplaintiffs that their positions had been eliminated, and the\n\nconsequent termination of their employment.\n\n               The actions by the executive officials (including the\n\ngovernor) taken to implement legislation are not shielded by\n\nlegislative immunity. Under Scheur v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974),\n\nthese implementation actions (as opposed to the governor's signing\n\nthe law) should be evaluated under the qualified immunity doctrine,\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\frather than under legislative immunity.                      Id. at 247-48.          The\n\ndistrict court properly did so.\n\n           This circuit usually evaluates qualified immunity claims\n\nunder a three-part test.             See, e.g., Riverdale Mills Corp. v.\n\nPimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2004).                  The first part of the\n\ntest   asks:    \"Taken   in    the    light    most    favorable       to   the   party\n\nasserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's\n\nconduct violated a constitutional right?\"                     Id. at 61 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).            In the second stage, the question is\n\n\"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the\n\nalleged violation such that a reasonable officer would be on notice\n\nthat his conduct was unlawful.\"           Id. (internal quotation marks and\n\nalteration omitted).          And in the last stage, we ask \"whether a\n\nreasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the\n\nchallenged     conduct   violated       the    clearly       established     right    at\n\nissue.\"    Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           As    we   ordinarily      must     do,    we    start   first    with    the\n\nquestion   of    whether      the    plaintiffs      have     stated   a    claim    for\n\nviolation of the First Amendment at all.                   See Saucier v. Katz, 533\n\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001).         We conclude they have not.\n\n           Under the plain language of Law 94, the Governor was\n\nentitled to appoint a Chairman of the Commission.                           The First\n\nAmendment did not require the Governor to make her choice from the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fexisting twenty-five Commissioners.        The same is true of the\n\nappointment of the other three Commissioners.\n\n          The   claim   concerning   termination   of   the   plaintiffs'\n\nemployment, on different facts, could come out differently. If the\n\nplaintiffs had argued that the defendants had selectively replaced\n\nsome of the previous Commissioners, but not others, using political\n\naffiliation as the criteria, the plaintiffs may have stated a\n\nclaim.   See Acevedo-Garcia, 204 F.3d at 10-11; Rutan, 497 U.S. at\n\n65-66.   But the plaintiffs have made no such claim; instead, the\n\npleadings show that all Commissioners were terminated on the same\n\nneutral principle:      that Law 94 eliminated the positions of all\n\ntwenty-five previous Commissioners.\n\n           Whether the articulated neutral principle -- that the\n\nstatute eliminated the positions -- is correct or not may raise a\n\nquestion of Puerto Rico law, but it does not state a First\n\nAmendment claim.     There is no claim based on the First Amendment\n\nfor disparate impact based on the political affiliation doctrine\n\nbecause \"[i]t is in the nature of a change in administration that\n\njob actions by the new party in power will have a disparate impact\n\non members of the outgoing party.\"         Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-\n\nPujols, 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir. 2004).     To put it differently,\n\neven if under Puerto Rico law the plaintiffs turn out to have some\n\nsort of tenure, they still have no First Amendment claim.            All\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fCommissioners' positions were eliminated on the basis that there\n\nwas no such tenure; therefore, there was no discrimination.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.   Appellees are\n\nawarded their costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f",

Here, the legislature of Puerto Rico reorganized the Industrial Commission by reducing the number of Commissioners who hear workers' compensation claims from twenty-five to five, and the governor signed the bill and then implemented it. There is no claim that the governor, in implementing the new legislation, did not apply the same interpretation of the statute regardless of political affiliation of the former Commissioners. Under that uniform interpretation, she concluded that the new statute eliminated all of their positions. Some of the Commissioners, terminated from employment, sued in federal court under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. The district court dismissed the action. <i>See Torres-Rivera v. Calderon-Serra,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 237 (D.P.R.2004). We affirm the judgment of dismissal against the plaintiffs on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the past decade, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has used three different organizational structures for the Industrial Commission, the administrative agency which handles workers' compensation claims. In the years before 1996 (indeed, since 1935) the Commonwealth had long structured the Industrial Commission as having a maximum of five Commissioners. To assist the Commissioners, there was also a system, put in place since 1969, of hearing examiners who would make recommendations to the five Commissioners, who would then make a final adjudication of the claims by majority vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, on July 1, 1996, Governor Pedro Rossello, whose New Progressive Party (NPP) had recently gained the governorship, signed Law 63, codified at 11 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8. Law 63 increased the number of Commissioners from five to twenty-five and provided each Commissioner with a definite term of ten years in office. Each Commissioner was appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Each Commissioner was given authority to make a final adjudication of the claims before him or her independently. Law 63 also stated that Commissioners appointed prior to its effective date would remain in office until their original terms expired. Law 63 did not explicitly state what would happen to the hearing examiners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another change in control of the executive branch of the Commonwealth in November 2000, when the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) took over the governor's office. On March 25, 2003, Governor Sila Maria Calderon-Serra (\"Governor Calderon\") signed Law 94, which amended 11 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8 by establishing a new structure for the Industrial Commission. The preamble to Law 94 cited problems of great inefficiency with the functioning of the Industrial Commission and recounted a large number of complaints from the citizenry about long delays in the handling of cases in that office. By contrast with Law 63, Law 94 returned the number of Commissioners to five, to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate for fixed terms of six years (except the Chairman<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the Commission, whose term ends on December 31 of the year in which general elections are held). The law specified that of the five Commissioners, three should be lawyers, one should be a doctor with \"acclaimed knowledge and interest in the field of occupational medicine\" and one should be \"a person of known sympathy for and identification with Puerto Rico's organized workers' movement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite requests from the minority parties, and unlike its predecessor statute, Law 63, the legislature put no provisions in Law 94 as to the fate of the positions of the twenty-five previous Commissioners who had been appointed before its enactment. <i>See Torres-Rivera,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 240. Law 94 simply did not address the status of the incumbent Commissioners. Still, Law 94 employs prospective language to describe the structure of the Industrial Commission. For example, it states that \"[a] commission <i>to be called</i> `Industrial Commission of Puerto Rico' is created, which <i>will</i> have five (5) Commissioners\" (emphasis added). The statute also created career positions for a group of hearing examiners, designated by the Industrial Commission's Chairman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Those hearing examiners make recommendations to the Commissioners rather than make final determinations on their own. On April 11, 2003, the Senate approved the Governor's nomination of Gilberto M. Charriez-Rosario (\"Charriez\") as Chairman of the Industrial Commission. Three other new Commissioners assumed office that day. The fifth Commissioner was not appointed at the time when the plaintiffs filed this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charriez lost little time in carrying out the legislature's reforms. He sent written notices to all of the former Commissioners informing them that he was the new Chairman of the Industrial Commission. There was some scuffling with the former Chairman of the Commission, Basilio Torres-Rivera (\"Torres\"), who took the position that he was the legal Chairman until his term expired on June 30, 2006. The details of this dispute are not pertinent to our present discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 2003, the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth at the time, Ferdinand Mercado,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> sent letters to all persons who had occupied the twenty-five Commissioners' positions, terminating their positions at the Industrial Commission effective that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As frequently happens with such disputes in Puerto Rico, the matter was brought to federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fourteen of the former Commissioners, including Torres as lead plaintiff, sued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Puerto Rico law asserted a variety of claims in furtherance of their argument that they could not be removed from their jobs as Commissioners, despite the restructuring of the Industrial Commission. The first count alleged that Law 94 was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the plaintiffs because it was void for vagueness and because it permitted interference with a fundamental First Amendment right of the plaintiffs by allowing for political discrimination. The count also alleged that the acts of the Governor in designating the new Commissioners were illegal in that they deprived the old Commissioners of their rights of free speech and freedom of association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second count purported to sound in federal law but actually was based on Puerto Rico law. It argued that Law 94, properly interpreted, did not provide for the discharge of the plaintiffs. The third claim for relief was a federal procedural due process claim. It was also based on interpretation of Puerto Rico law, particularly that Law 94 did not revoke those provisions of Law 63 which provided the plaintiff former Commissioners with fixed terms. The fourth count was one for deprivation of substantive due process; it also denied that there was a legitimate efficiency problem with the operation of the Industrial Commission which had justified a change in its structure. The fifth claim for relief purported to be based on the plaintiffs'\"protected liberty interests\" and seemed to assert that the plaintiffs' reputations had been damaged by this action. The sixth cause of action was a Puerto Rico law claim for damages, under the supplemental jurisdiction of the federal court, based on Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs sought a declaration that Law 94 was unconstitutional, compensatory damages for lost pay and emotional distress, punitive damages, and reinstatement to their positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants named were Governor Calderon, Cesar R. Miranda-Rodriguez, Governor Calderon's Chief of Staff, and Charriez, the new Chairman of the Industrial Commission. The defendants promptly moved to dismiss on grounds of legislative and qualified immunity and argued that certain claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court allowed the motion and entered judgment dismissing the federal claims with prejudice and the state claims without prejudice on August 5, 2004. <i>See Torres-Rivera,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 244-45. The plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the judgment on the motion to dismiss is <i>de novo. Arroyo-Melecio v. P.R. Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 398 F.3d 56, 65 (1st Cir.2005). The plaintiffs have abandoned all arguments on appeal, save three: (1) that the statute is unconstitutional and that the district court's (2) legislative immunity and (3) qualified immunity findings were in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Constitutionality of the Statute</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first the plaintiffs' appeal from the denial of declaratory relief that Law 94 is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs bring Due Process and First Amendment claims against the statute. They argue that the statute is void for vagueness because it does not clearly address what is to happen to their jobs; as well, they argue that it embodied the legislature's intention to engage in and permitted political discrimination against the former Commissioners based on their political affiliation with the NPP, the party of the former governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject these arguments. There are no actionable claims that the enactment of this statute, Law 94, violates either the plaintiffs' First Amendment or Due Process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the First Amendment claim. This statute is neutral on its face and says nothing about the political affiliations of the persons to be appointed to positions in the reorganized agency. This statute does not require that only members of one political party be named Commissioners or be allowed to work for the Industrial Commission. That would be a very different case. The statute simply reorganizes the agency, a task committed to the legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Acevedo-Garcia v.</i> <i>Vera-Monroig,</i> 204 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Employment decisions generally are administrative except when they are accomplished through traditional legislative functions such as policymaking and budgetary restructuring that strike at the heart of the legislative process.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' argument assumes there is an absolute right under the First Amendment to be protected against political affiliation discrimination.

The reason it is not absolute is that there \"is the need for political loyalty of employees. . . to the end that representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration, policies \"presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 367. The First Amendment political affiliation right described in the line of cases from <i>Elrod</i> to <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), and <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990), is cabined by an exception designed to give room to elected representatives to make policy choices reflective of their party platforms. <i>See Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 517-18, 100 S.Ct. 1287; <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. 2729.

Even assuming <i>dubitante</i> such a claim could be made here, it does not advance the plaintiffs' case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to effect, there is no statutory invalidity from the fact that the statute may, in the end, lead to a situation in which the impact of the reorganization will be to disproportionally terminate the employment of members of one political party. We have rejected the application of a disparate impact theory in First Amendment political affiliation cases. \"If uniformly applied personnel practices, predicated on legitimate reasons, result in terminations, those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted.\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir.2004).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to intent, here the legislature explicitly stated its intent behind Law 94: it found the expanded Commission system under Law 63 did not function effectively, leading to delays and complaints from the citizenry. We will not look behind that express statement of intent as to a law neutral on its face. <i>Cf. Hill v. Colorado,</i> 530 U.S. 703, 719-20, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (content-neutrality inquiry in First Amendment context ends if stated legislative reason is content-neutral and the statute is facially neutral); <i>McGuire v.

The vagueness claim fails even if untethered from its dependence on its faulty First Amendment assumptions. The vagueness that the plaintiffs point to is a vagueness about the fate of the old Commissioners in office at the time of the enactment of the statute. Law 94 does not regulate speech and so raises no chilling effect concerns that people will steer too far clear of prohibited speech. That is one area where the void-for-vagueness doctrine is used. <i>Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 390 F.3d 65, 93-94 (1st Cir.2004). Nor does the statute impose penalties on the plaintiffs for any conduct, but fail to give them fair warning that any such conduct would be impermissible, another area where the doctrine is used. <i>Id.</i> Further, the source of vagueness that the plaintiffs purport to identify raises no concerns about excessive discretion that could be used in a discriminatory manner. <i>See id.</i> at 94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' void-for-vagueness claims are not made any more meritorious by the fact that when plaintiff Torres refused to vacate his office on Charriez' request, Charriez had Torres indicted for a claimed misdemeanor charge of usurping the position of Chairman (he was acquitted) and a felony charge of illegally retaining government property and documents (the charge was promptly dismissed).

Consumers Union of the United States, Inc.,</i> 446 U.S. 719, 732, 100 S.Ct. 1967, 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980). The question we are faced with here is extension of this doctrine to the executive who signs legislation, thus making it law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although no legislators are named as defendants, the plaintiffs bring a claim against Governor Calderon for having signed Law 94. The Supreme Court has held that \"officials outside the legislative branch are entitled to legislative immunity when they perform legislative functions.\" <i>Bogan v. Scott-Harris,</i> 523 U.S. 44, 55, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998). The Supreme Court of a state is entitled to legislative immunity when its members act in a legislative capacity to promulgate a State Bar Code. <i>Consumers</i> <i>Union,</i> 446 U.S. at 734, 100 S.Ct. 1967. As well, the President acts legislatively when he approves or vetoes bills passed by Congress. <i>See Bogan,</i> 523 U.S. at 55, 118 S.Ct. 966; <i>cf. Edwards v. United States,</i> 286 U.S. 482, 490, 52 S.Ct. 627, 76 L.Ed. 1239 (1932) (noting \"the legislative character of the President's function in approving or disapproving bills\"). Likewise, a governor who signs into law or vetoes legislation passed by the legislature is also entitled to absolute immunity for that act. <i>Women's Emergency Network v. Bush,</i> 323 F.3d 937, 950 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Under the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity, a governor cannot be sued for signing a bill into law.\"); <i>cf. Smiley v. Holm,</i> 285 U.S. 355, 372-73, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795 (1932) (recognizing a governor's signing or vetoing of a bill is a part of the legislative process).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that this legislative immunity may be abrogated if the enactment of the legislation was motivated by impermissible intent. That argument was expressly rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Bogan,</i> which extended absolute legislative immunity from suit under &#167; 1983 to local legislators for their legislative activities. <i>Bogan,</i> 523 U.S. at 54, 118 S.Ct. 966. The Court held that even where a jury found that constitutionally sheltered speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind an ordinance which eliminated a city department with only one employee, the mayor and head of the city council were absolutely immune from suit for damages under legislative immunity. <i>Id.</i> The Court held that before one asked about the defendants' subjective intent there was the \"logically prior question of whether their acts were legislative.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the logically separate and prior inquiry as to <i>whether the acts are legislative,</i> the only inquiry relevant in this case, intent is not part of the analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Court instructed in <i>Bogan:</i> \"Whether an act is legislative turns on the nature of the act, rather than on the motive or intent of the official performing it.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court had little difficulty in concluding that the ordinance at issue had all the hallmarks of traditional legislation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance reflected a discretionary, policymaking decision implicating the budgetary priorities of the city and the services the city provides to its constituents. Moreover, it involved the termination of a position, which, unlike the hiring or firing of a particular employee, may have prospective implications that reach well beyond the particular occupant of the office.

Under <i>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</i> 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), these implementation actions (as opposed to the governor's signing the law) should be evaluated under the qualified immunity doctrine, rather than under legislative immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 247-48, 94 S.Ct. 1683. The district court properly did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit usually evaluates qualified immunity claims under a three-part test. <i>See, e.g., Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir.2004). The first part of the test asks: \"Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" <i>Id.</i> at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the second stage, the question is \"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation such that a reasonable officer would be on notice that his conduct was unlawful.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). And in the last stage, we ask \"whether a reasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated the clearly established right at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we ordinarily must do, we start first with the question of whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim for violation of the First Amendment at all. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). We conclude they have not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plain language of Law 94, the Governor was entitled to appoint a Chairman of the Commission. The First Amendment did not require the Governor to make her choice from the existing twenty-five Commissioners. The same is true of the appointment of the other three Commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim concerning termination of the plaintiffs' employment, on different facts, could come out differently. If the plaintiffs had argued that the defendants had selectively replaced some of the previous Commissioners, but not others, using political affiliation as the criteria, the plaintiffs may have stated a claim. <i>See Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 204 F.3d at 10-11; <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 65-66, 110 S.Ct. 2729. But the plaintiffs have made no such claim; instead, the pleadings show that all Commissioners were terminated on the same neutral principle: that Law 94 eliminated the positions of all twenty-five previous Commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the articulated neutral principle&#8212;that the statute eliminated the positions&#8212;is correct or not may raise a question of Puerto Rico law, but it does not state a First Amendment claim. There is no claim based on the First Amendment for disparate impact based on the political affiliation doctrine because \"[i]t is in the nature of a change in administration that job actions by the new party in power will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir. 2004). To put it differently, even if under Puerto Rico law the plaintiffs turn out to have some sort of tenure, they still have no First Amendment claim. <i>All</i> Commissioners' positions were eliminated on the basis that there was no such tenure; therefore, there was no discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal is <i>affirmed.</i> Appellees are awarded their costs on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This position is alternately referred to as \"President\" and \"Chairman\" in the translation of Law 94 and the parties' briefs and pleadings.

Here, the legislature of Puerto Rico reorganized the Industrial Commission by reducing the number of Commissioners who hear workers' compensation claims from twenty-five to five, and the governor signed the bill and then implemented it. There is no claim that the governor, in implementing the new legislation, did not apply the same interpretation of the statute regardless of political affiliation of the former Commissioners. Under that uniform interpretation, she concluded that the new statute eliminated all of their positions. Some of the Commissioners, terminated from employment, sued in federal court under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. The district court dismissed the action. <i>See Torres-Rivera v.

In the years before 1996 (indeed, since 1935) the Commonwealth had long structured the Industrial Commission as having a maximum of five Commissioners. To assist the Commissioners, there was also a system, put in place since 1969, of hearing examiners who would make recommendations to the five Commissioners, who would then make a final adjudication of the claims by majority vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, on July 1, 1996, Governor Pedro Rossello, whose New Progressive Party (NPP) had recently gained the governorship, signed Law 63, codified at 11 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8. Law 63 increased the number of Commissioners from five to twenty-five and provided each Commissioner with a definite term of ten years in office. Each Commissioner was appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Each Commissioner was given authority to make a final adjudication of the claims before him or her independently. Law 63 also stated that Commissioners appointed prior to its effective date would remain in office until their original terms expired. Law 63 did not explicitly state what would happen to the hearing examiners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another change in control of the executive branch of the Commonwealth in November 2000, when the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) took over the governor's office. On March 25, 2003, Governor Sila Maria Calderon-Serra (\"Governor Calderon\") signed Law 94, which amended 11 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8 by establishing a new structure for the Industrial Commission. The preamble to Law 94 cited problems of great inefficiency with the functioning of the Industrial Commission and recounted a large number of complaints from the citizenry about long delays in the handling of cases in that office. By contrast with Law 63, Law 94 returned the number of Commissioners to five, to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate for fixed terms of six years (except the Chairman<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the Commission, whose term ends on December 31 of the year in which general elections are held). The law specified that of the five Commissioners, three should be lawyers, one should be a doctor with \"acclaimed knowledge and interest in the field of occupational medicine\" and one should be \"a person of known sympathy for and identification with Puerto Rico's organized workers' movement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite requests from the minority parties, and unlike its predecessor statute, Law 63, the legislature put no provisions in Law 94 as to the fate of the positions of the twenty-five previous Commissioners who had been appointed before its enactment. <i>See Torres-Rivera,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 240. Law 94 simply did not address the status of the incumbent Commissioners. Still, Law 94 employs prospective language to describe the structure of the Industrial Commission. For example, it states that \"[a] commission <i>to be called</i> `Industrial Commission of Puerto Rico' is created, which <i>will</i> have five (5) Commissioners\" (emphasis added). The statute also created career positions for a group of hearing examiners, designated by the Industrial Commission's Chairman.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Those hearing examiners make recommendations to the Commissioners rather than make final determinations on their own. On April 11, 2003, the Senate approved the Governor's nomination of Gilberto M. Charriez-Rosario (\"Charriez\") as Chairman of the Industrial Commission. Three other new Commissioners assumed office that day. The fifth Commissioner was not appointed at the time when the plaintiffs filed this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charriez lost little time in carrying out the legislature's reforms. He sent written notices to all of the former Commissioners informing them that he was the new Chairman of the Industrial Commission. There was some scuffling with the former Chairman of the Commission, Basilio Torres-Rivera (\"Torres\"), who took the position that he was the legal Chairman until his term expired on June 30, 2006. The details of this dispute are not pertinent to our present discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 14, 2003, the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth at the time, Ferdinand Mercado,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> sent letters to all persons who had occupied the twenty-five Commissioners' positions, terminating their positions at the Industrial Commission effective that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As frequently happens with such disputes in Puerto Rico, the matter was brought to federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fourteen of the former Commissioners, including Torres as lead plaintiff, sued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Puerto Rico law asserted a variety of claims in furtherance of their argument that they could not be removed from their jobs as Commissioners, despite the restructuring of the Industrial Commission. The first count alleged that Law 94 was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the plaintiffs because it was void for vagueness and because it permitted interference with a fundamental First Amendment right of the plaintiffs by allowing for political discrimination. The count also alleged that the acts of the Governor in designating the new Commissioners were illegal in that they deprived the old Commissioners of their rights of free speech and freedom of association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second count purported to sound in federal law but actually was based on Puerto Rico law. It argued that Law 94, properly interpreted, did not provide for the discharge of the plaintiffs. The third claim for relief was a federal procedural due process claim. It was also based on interpretation of Puerto Rico law, particularly that Law 94 did not revoke those provisions of Law 63 which provided the plaintiff former Commissioners with fixed terms. The fourth count was one for deprivation of substantive due process; it also denied that there was a legitimate efficiency problem with the operation of the Industrial Commission which had justified a change in its structure. The fifth claim for relief purported to be based on the plaintiffs'\"protected liberty interests\" and seemed to assert that the plaintiffs' reputations had been damaged by this action. The sixth cause of action was a Puerto Rico law claim for damages, under the supplemental jurisdiction of the federal court, based on Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs sought a declaration that Law 94 was unconstitutional, compensatory damages for lost pay and emotional distress, punitive damages, and reinstatement to their positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants named were Governor Calderon, Cesar R. Miranda-Rodriguez, Governor Calderon's Chief of Staff, and Charriez, the new Chairman of the Industrial Commission. The defendants promptly moved to dismiss on grounds of legislative and qualified immunity and argued that certain claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court allowed the motion and entered judgment dismissing the federal claims with prejudice and the state claims without prejudice on August 5, 2004. <i>See Torres-Rivera,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d at 244-45.

They argue that the statute is void for vagueness because it does not clearly address what is to happen to their jobs; as well, they argue that it embodied the legislature's intention to engage in and permitted political discrimination against the former Commissioners based on their political affiliation with the NPP, the party of the former governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject these arguments.

The first part of the test asks: \"Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" <i>Id.</i> at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the second stage, the question is \"whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation such that a reasonable officer would be on notice that his conduct was unlawful.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).

We conclude they have not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plain language of Law 94, the Governor was entitled to appoint a Chairman of the Commission. The First Amendment did not require the Governor to make her choice from the existing twenty-five Commissioners. The same is true of the appointment of the other three Commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim concerning termination of the plaintiffs' employment, on different facts, could come out differently. If the plaintiffs had argued that the defendants had selectively replaced some of the previous Commissioners, but not others, using political affiliation as the criteria, the plaintiffs may have stated a claim. <i>See Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 204 F.3d at 10-11; <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 65-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2729</span></a></span>. But the plaintiffs have made no such claim; instead, the pleadings show that all Commissioners were terminated on the same neutral principle: that Law 94 eliminated the positions of all twenty-five previous Commissioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the articulated neutral principle&#8212;that the statute eliminated the positions&#8212;is correct or not may raise a question of Puerto Rico law, but it does not state a First Amendment claim. There is no claim based on the First Amendment for disparate impact based on the political affiliation doctrine because \"[i]t is in the nature of a change in administration that job actions by the new party in power will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez v.

To put it differently, even if under Puerto Rico law the plaintiffs turn out to have some sort of tenure, they still have no First Amendment claim. <i>All</i> Commissioners' positions were eliminated on the basis that there was no such tenure; therefore, there was no discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of dismissal is <i>affirmed.</i> Appellees are awarded their costs on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This position is alternately referred to as \"President\" and \"Chairman\" in the translation of Law 94 and the parties' briefs and pleadings.
