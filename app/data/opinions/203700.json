App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr., has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael Mukasey as respondent.\n     **\n          Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            SILER, Circuit Judge. Otman Ordonez-Garcia petitions for\n\nreview of a denial by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) of his\n\nmotion to reopen his removal proceeding.     He argues that the BIA\n\nabused its discretion in denying his motion because circumstances\n\nin Guatemala, his native country, changed since his previous\n\nhearing.     For the following reasons, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n                                 I.\n\n            Ordonez-Garcia illegally entered the United States in\n\n1991. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice\n\nto Appear charging that Ordonez-Garcia was subject to removal.\n\n            In 2005, Ordonez-Garcia appeared before the Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) and presented evidence in support of his application for\n\ncancellation of removal.    He testified that his children, ages 10\n\nand 13, both born in the United States, would suffer exceptional\n\nand extremely unusual hardship if they relocated to Guatemala\n\nbecause: (1) there were no special classes available in Guatemala\n\nto help one son with a learning disability (Attention Deficit\n\nDisorder); (2) his sons would have difficulty learning the Spanish\n\nlanguage; and (3) his income would be substantially reduced in\n\nGuatemala.   The IJ denied cancellation of removal because Ordonez-\n\nGarcia failed to establish the requisite degree of hardship to his\n\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f               Ordonez-Garcia appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, the BIA dismissed the appeal.                  It affirmed the\n\nhardship      determination     made   by   the    IJ   and   granted   voluntary\n\ndeparture until June 1, 2007.          Ordonez-Garcia did not seek review.\n\n              Ordonez-Garcia failed to depart the United States as\n\ndirected.      Instead, on September 25, 2007, he filed a motion to\n\nreopen   his    removal   proceedings,       claiming     that    conditions   in\n\nGuatemala had worsened. He alleged that Guatemala was dangerous to\n\nnatives, as well as to United States citizens taking up residence\n\nthere.   In support of his contention, he presented a 2006 Country\n\nReport   on    Human   Rights    Practices    in    Guatemala     (2006   Country\n\nReport), which listed various problems that children faced in\n\nGuatemala, i.e., homelessness, child labor, child abuse, and child\n\nprostitution. He sought reopening to apply for further relief from\n\nremoval, including asylum, withholding of removal, cancellation of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n              The BIA denied the motion because it was not filed within\n\nthe 90-day deadline.\n\n                                       II.\n\n              Motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of a final\n\norder of removal. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). However, a motion\n\nto reopen that is not filed within the time limit may be brought if\n\nit seeks reopening to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or\n\nCAT protection and if an alien can establish “changed country\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fconditions arising in the country of nationality” but only “if such\n\nevidence is material and was not available and would not have been\n\ndiscovered or presented at the previous hearing.”                8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).\n\n           There is no dispute between the parties that the motion\n\nwas filed outside the 90-day time limit established under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).                 Therefore, the\n\nBIA   should   have    considered    the    untimely    motion      only   if:   (1)\n\nconditions in Guatemala had changed since his hearing in November\n\n2005, and (2) evidence of such conditions was not available and\n\ncould not have been presented at that time.\n\n           The evidence presented by Ordonez-Garcia does not support\n\napplication of the exception. Although the 2006 Country Report was\n\nnot   available   at    the   2005   hearing,   it     does   not    support     the\n\ncontention that circumstances in Guatemala changed significantly\n\nsince the hearing.\n\n           Furthermore,        Ordonez-Garcia          is     ineligible         for\n\ncancellation of removal as well as other types of relief because he\n\nfailed to depart the United States by June 1, 2007, as required\n\nunder the BIA’s final order of removal.           See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).\n\n\n\n           PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
