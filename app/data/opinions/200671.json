This case arises from defendant\n\nDerek Capozzi's unlawful attempt to force a used car dealer to\n\nrefund       the    purchase      price     of        a    truck    with     which    he    was\n\ndissatisfied.           After a ten-day trial, a jury convicted Capozzi of\n\nbeing    a    felon      in    possession       of    a    firearm,    see    18     U.S.C.   ยง\n\n922(g)(1), attempted extortion affecting interstate commerce, see\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 1951(a) (the \"Hobbs Act\"), and use of a firearm during\n\nthe    attempted        extortion,        see    18       U.S.C.   ยง   924(c).        Capozzi\n\nchallenges his convictions on several grounds.                         We affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n               We set forth the facts underlying Capozzi's convictions\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict.                         See United States v.\n\nDiaz, 300 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2002).                          In January 1998, Capozzi\n\npurchased a used Chevy Blazer (\"truck\") for $4,500 from Gardner\n\nPark    Auto       Sales      (\"Gardner    Park\")         in    Peabody,     Massachusetts.\n\nCapozzi quickly came to believe that the truck was a lemon.                              On the\n\nevening of February 17, 1998, Capozzi and his friend, Jason Stone,\n\nleft the truck at Gardner Park with a note telling Michael McGrath,\n\nthe    owner       of   the    dealership,       that       Capozzi    wanted      his     money\n\nreturned.          At the time, Capozzi was living approximately three\n\nhundred yards from Gardner Park in Room #2 at the Charles Hotel\n\nwith his girlfriend, Erica Murphy.                             Stone and his companion,\n\nSantina Luca, were staying with Capozzi and his girlfriend.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f           The   next    afternoon   Capozzi   and   Stone,   both   armed,\n\nreturned to see McGrath.        Capozzi, who was a convicted felon,\n\ncarried a revolver that he had purchased from Stone several months\n\nearlier.   Stone carried a knife that appeared to be a gun because\n\nthe handle looked like the butt of a revolver.            After entering\n\nMcGrath's office, Stone waited by the door while Capozzi demanded\n\na refund of his money.      McGrath refused because Capozzi had put a\n\nlarge dent in the truck. Capozzi tried to bargain, telling McGrath\n\nthat he would accept $4,000 instead of $4,500.        When McGrath again\n\nrefused, Capozzi unzipped his coat and showed McGrath the gun that\n\nwas tucked into his pants.           McGrath still refused to return\n\nCapozzi's money.     Angered, Capozzi placed the barrel of the gun to\n\nMcGrath's head and screamed, \"I'll f---- kill you if you don't give\n\nme my money.\"\n\n           As the dispute turned violent, a business associate of\n\nMcGrath's, Carlo Fahkri, and his brother, John Fahkri, happened to\n\narrive at Gardner Park to see McGrath.          They entered McGrath's\n\noffice and tried to defuse the situation. As the Fahkris attempted\n\nto mediate, a telephone rang in another part of the building.\n\nMcGrath told Capozzi that he needed to answer the call and bolted\n\nfrom the room.   After escaping, McGrath called the police.          Stone,\n\nsuspecting that McGrath would call the police, took the gun from\n\nCapozzi and returned to the Charles Hotel, where he hid Capozzi's\n\ngun and his knife.      Shortly, the Peabody police arrived at Gardner\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fPark and arrested Capozzi.      Several minutes later, another officer\n\nlocated Stone walking from the Charles Hotel toward Gardner Park\n\nand arrested him.   Because Stone's knife appeared to be a gun, the\n\nwitnesses on the scene incorrectly told the police that both Stone\n\nand Capozzi were carrying guns.\n\n            At the time of the Gardner Park incident, authorities\n\nwere investigating whether Capozzi was involved in a bank robbery\n\nin Beverly, Massachusetts.          In due course, a federal grand jury\n\nreturned a five count indictment against Capozzi.               The first three\n\ncounts (identified in the introduction) related to the attempted\n\nextortion at Gardner Park; the other two involved the alleged bank\n\nrobbery.    The district court severed the counts relating to the\n\nattempted    extortion   and,   following        the   denial    of   Capozzi's\n\nsuppression motion (which we discuss in greater detail infra), the\n\ncase proceeded to trial.        As set forth above, a jury convicted\n\nCapozzi of all three counts.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Capozzi appeals his convictions alleging three errors.\n\nHe first challenges the district court's refusal to suppress\n\nevidence of the gun used in the attempted extortion, arguing that\n\nthe search warrant under which the police seized the gun was\n\nobtained without probable cause and in bad faith.                 Capozzi next\n\ncontends that the Hobbs Act count should have been dismissed\n\nbecause    application   of   the    Act    to   Capozzi's   conduct    exceeds\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fCongress' Commerce Clause authority.         Finally, Capozzi argues that\n\neven if the government could have proceeded with the Hobbs Act\n\nprosecution, the district court nevertheless should have dismissed\n\nthe Hobbs Act count because the government failed to establish that\n\nCapozzi's conduct interfered with interstate commerce.\n\n           A.       The Suppression Ruling.\n\n           The district court agreed with Capozzi that the search\n\nwarrant   which    led   to    the   discovery   of   the   gun   used   in   the\n\nextortion attempt was issued without probable cause.              Nonetheless,\n\nthe court declined to suppress the evidence of the gun, relying on\n\n\"the good faith exception\" established in United States v. Leon,\n\n468 U.S. 897 (1984).          Capozzi contends the district court's Leon\n\nruling was erroneous.         Applying de novo review (but accepting the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings absent a demonstration of clear\n\nerror), see United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 743 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), we disagree.\n\n           We begin our explanation with a recitation of necessary\n\nbackground.     Immediately after the Peabody police arrested Capozzi\n\nand Stone, the officers on the scene shared information with each\n\nother about the crime.          One officer told his colleagues that he\n\nrecently had responded to an emergency call from Capozzi's room at\n\nthe Charles Hotel.       Based on this information, the police obtained\n\nCapozzi's consent to search his room while he remained in custody.\n\nWith   Erica    Murphy   and    Santina   Luca   present,    several     Peabody\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fofficers searched the room for more than an hour but could not find\n\nany weapons.1\n\n          The next day, February 19, 1998, Capozzi and Stone were\n\narraigned in the Peabody District Court.     Murphy and Luca were\n\namong those present at the arraignment.     Later that day, while\n\nwalking his beat, Peabody Officer Daniel Murphy, who had been\n\ninvolved in the searches of Capozzi's hotel room, saw Erica Murphy\n\nand Santina Luca on the street near the Peabody District Court.\n\nOfficer Murphy recognized the women from the previous day and asked\n\nthem if Capozzi had made bail.     One woman replied that they had\n\njust come from the court and that Capozzi's bail had been set at\n\n$50,000; the other stated that the next court date was set for\n\nFebruary 23, 1998.\n\n          That same afternoon, Sergeant Thomas Griffin of the Salem\n\nPolice Department received a telephone call from an informant. The\n\ninformant told Griffin that she had previously provided tips to\n\nanother Salem detective and that she had new information to report.\n\nShe reported that she had been present at the Peabody District\n\nCourt that morning where she overheard two women discussing a gun\n\nand a knife hidden in a hotel room in Peabody.       The informant\n\noverheard the women say that the police had been unable to find the\n\n\n     1\n        Immediately prior to obtaining Capozzi's consent, the\nofficers conducted an initial unsuccessful search of the room with\nonly Murphy's permission. Shortly after that search began, Murphy\ntold the officers that it was not her room and therefore instructed\nthem to leave.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fweapons because they were wrapped in a sock.                                The informant\n\nspecified that the gun and knife were used in an assault on a\n\nPeabody businessman.        The informant remained anonymous.\n\n              After receiving this tip, Griffin called the Peabody\n\npolice to report the tip, but they took no immediate action.\n\nGriffin also told Salem Detective Harry Rocheville about the\n\ninformation he had received.             Rocheville, in turn, relayed the tip\n\nto   F.B.I.    Special     Agent       Gerald      Mohan,      who    was   investigating\n\nCapozzi's possible involvement in the Beverly bank robbery.\n\n              While     traveling       to      work      on      February     19,    1998,\n\nMassachusetts State Police Trooper Robert Irwin learned from the\n\nmedia that Capozzi and Stone had been arrested for the Gardner Park\n\nincident.       Capozzi     was    a    suspect      in     two      of   Irwin's    ongoing\n\ninvestigations.        Later that day, Irwin contacted Peabody Detective\n\nRichard Robillard, who had been involved in investigating the\n\nGardner Park incident, to learn more about the attempted extortion.\n\nRobillard told Irwin that Capozzi was suspected of having a gun,\n\nbut that searches of the Charles Hotel, Gardner Park, and the\n\nsurrounding area had failed to uncover it.\n\n              Irwin offered Robillard the services of the State Police\n\nDive Team for the next day to search a waterway located behind\n\nGardner Park.         The dive team's search did not locate any weapons.\n\nOfficer Murphy was among those present at the dive search; he told\n\nIrwin about his encounter the day before with Erica Murphy and\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fSantina Luca.   F.B.I. Agent Mohan was also present at the dive\n\nsearch; he told Irwin that he had learned from Rocheville about the\n\nanonymous tip in which two women at Capozzi's arraignment stated\n\nthat the gun used in the crime was hidden in a hotel room in\n\nPeabody.\n\n           After the dive search, Irwin began to prepare a search\n\nwarrant affidavit based on the information that he had collected.\n\nBefore completing the affidavit, Irwin called Rocheville at the\n\nSalem Police Department to learn more about the anonymous tip.\n\nRocheville described the substance of the informant's telephone\n\ncall.\n\n           Irwin prepared an affidavit to obtain a search warrant\n\nfor Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel.      The Irwin affidavit\n\ndescribed the crime and the unsuccessful search to which Capozzi\n\nconsented.   It also described the fruitless searches of the areas\n\nsurrounding Gardner Park.   Further, it reported the substance of\n\nthe informant's anonymous tip to the Salem Police and Officer\n\nMurphy's conversation with Erica Murphy and Santina Luca in which\n\nthey told him that they were present at the Peabody District Court\n\nfor Capozzi's hearing.      Finally, it stated that the door of\n\nCapozzi's hotel room was locked on February 20th.   As a result of\n\nthis information, Irwin offered his opinion that there was probable\n\ncause to believe that the weapons used by Capozzi and Stone in the\n\nattempted extortion were located in Room #2 at the Charles Hotel.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f            After   drafting   the   affidavit,   Irwin     contacted     Essex\n\nCounty Assistant District Attorney Robert Bender, an experienced\n\nappellate    attorney.     Irwin     asked   Bender   if,    based   on    the\n\ninformation he had gathered, there was a basis for searching the\n\nroom.   Bender told him that he had developed enough information to\n\nconduct a search and should apply for a warrant.            Irwin submitted\n\nthe affidavit and a warrant application to the Clerk Magistrate of\n\nthe Peabody District Court (the \"magistrate\").               The magistrate\n\nissued the warrant.\n\n            Irwin, along with representatives of the Peabody Police,\n\nconducted the search.     The officers first found a knife inside a\n\nKleenex box and then found a revolver that matched the description\n\nof the gun that Capozzi had used in the crime.            The gun was found\n\ninside the lining of a chair wrapped in a pair of boxer shorts.\n\n            Capozzi moved to suppress evidence of the gun, arguing\n\nthat the Irwin affidavit was insufficient to establish probable\n\ncause for a warrant because it was based primarily on information\n\nprovided by an uncorroborated, anonymous informant. He also argued\n\nthat the Leon good faith exception did not apply because Irwin\n\nintentionally or recklessly misstated material information in the\n\naffidavit, and the affidavit was so lacking in the indicia of\n\nprobable cause that an objective officer would not reasonably rely\n\non it to obtain a warrant.           After an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court denied Capozzi's motion to suppress.               The court\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fagreed that Irwin's affidavit failed to establish probable cause\n\nfor the search because the police had insufficient corroboration of\n\nthe reliability of the anonymous tip. However, the court concluded\n\nthat the good faith exception applied because \"given all the\n\ncircumstances under which he sought the warrant, Trooper Irwin's\n\naction and his reliance on the warrant's validity were objectively\n\nreasonable.\"\n\n          Because we regard the district court's Leon ruling as\n\nsound but its probable cause ruling as more controversial, we\n\nproceed directly to the district court's ruling that evidence of\n\nthe gun was admissible because Irwin obtained the warrant in good\n\nfaith.    See Leon, 468 U.S. at 925 (holding that courts have\n\ndiscretion to proceed directly to the good faith issue without\n\nfirst addressing probable cause issue); Owens, 167 F.3d at 744-45\n\n(same).   In Leon, 468 U.S. at 922, the Supreme Court adopted an\n\nexception to the usual rule that evidence seized in violation of\n\nthe Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.        The Court\n\nrecognized that the purpose of this exclusionary rule is to deter\n\npolice misconduct; therefore, it declined to apply the rule in\n\ncircumstances where an officer acts in good faith to obtain a\n\nwarrant because suppression in such instances does not \"logically\n\ncontribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\"   Id.\n\nat 921.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f           Yet,   while   Leon   restricts   the   application   of   the\n\nexclusionary rule, it does not eliminate it.       See United States v.\n\nRicciardelli, 998 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1993).        Exclusion remains\n\nthe appropriate remedy in several circumstances, including (1)\n\nwhere the magistrate is misled by information in an affidavit that\n\nthe affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for\n\na reckless disregard for the truth, or (2) where the affidavit is\n\nso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official\n\nbelief in its existence entirely unreasonable.        See United States\n\nv. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Leon, 468 U.S.\n\nat 923).   Capozzi claims that both of these situations are present\n\nhere.   We disagree.\n\n                   1.     False Information.\n\n           Capozzi identifies four pieces of information that he\n\nclaims Irwin intentionally or recklessly omitted from or misstated\n\nin the affidavit: (1) the affidavit omitted that the informant\n\nclaimed to have previously provided other tips to the Salem Police\n\nDepartment; (2) the affidavit misstated that the informant told the\n\nofficer that a gun (rather than a gun and a knife) were in the\n\nroom; (3) the affidavit misstated that the informant reported that\n\nthe gun \"is\" hidden (rather than \"was\" hidden) in the hotel room;\n\nand (4) the affidavit misstated the point in time when the police\n\nlocked Capozzi's hotel room door.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f             In its findings of fact after the evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court found that Irwin had prepared his affidavit by\n\ncollecting information from several officers under significant time\n\npressure and in an \"unfamiliar search scenario.\"                     It found no\n\nevidence that Irwin had acted intentionally or recklessly in making\n\nany misstatements or omissions.            These findings are not clearly\n\nerroneous.     At most, Irwin's omissions and misstatements reflect\n\nnegligence, mistake, or inattention to detail as he rushed to\n\nprepare an affidavit in the midst of a developing investigation.\n\nMere negligence or inattention to detail in preparing an affidavit\n\ndoes not deprive the government of the benefits of the Leon\n\nexception.     See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 20; Owens, 167 F.3d at 745.\n\n             Moreover,    the   omissions       and   mistakes   identified    by\n\nCapozzi were not material to the magistrate's decision to issue a\n\nwarrant. See Owens, 167 F.3d at 745.            Irwin's omission of the fact\n\nthat the informant stated that she had provided prior tips to the\n\npolice   was   an   immaterial,     indeed      perhaps   even   a    cautiously\n\nappropriate, omission from the affidavit. Irwin had no information\n\nto support the informant's claim of providing previous tips.                  If\n\nsuch information had been included in the affidavit, it may have\n\ninfluenced the magistrate to accord the informant unwarranted\n\ncredibility.     See United States v. Jordan, 999 F.2d 11, 14 (1st\n\nCir.   1993)(noting      that   proof    that   confidential     informant    had\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fprovided past reliable information may be sufficient by itself to\n\nestablish reliability of informant's statement).\n\n            Irwin's omission of the informant's statement that a\n\nknife would also be found in the hotel room was also immaterial.\n\nThe focus of the police's investigation had been on the search for\n\ntwo guns, and Irwin's inclusion of the fact that a knife might also\n\nbe found in the room would not have changed the magistrate's\n\nevaluation of the possibility that a gun might be present.             In any\n\nevent, while it might have been preferable for Irwin to have\n\ntranscribed the tip exactly as he received it, any error can only\n\nbe regarded as an innocent mistake made under significant time\n\npressure.    See p. 12 above.\n\n            The alleged misstatement concerning verb tense is a\n\ncriticism    of   the   form   rather   than   the   substance   of   Irwin's\n\naffidavit.    Such technical criticism of the form of the affidavit\n\nis insufficient to undermine its veracity.           See Illinois v. Gates,\n\n462 U.S. 213, 235 (1983) (\"affidavits are normally drafted by\n\nnonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation\")\n\n(internal quotations omitted). Finally, the statement referring to\n\nthe locked hotel room door was not a misstatement at all.                 The\n\naffidavit did not say, as Capozzi suggests, that the door was\n\nlocked immediately after Capozzi's arrest.              Rather, it stated\n\naccurately that the door was locked by the police on February 20,\n\n1998.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f                      2.    Probable Cause.\n\n            Capozzi's       other   assertion       is    that    the   good    faith\n\nexception does not apply because, even though the magistrate issued\n\nthe warrant, an objectively reasonable officer would have realized\n\nthat the affidavit failed to establish probable cause.                   In support\n\nof this assertion, Capozzi relies heavily on the fact that Irwin's\n\naffidavit was partially informed by a hearsay tip from an anonymous\n\nsource.\n\n            Reliance       on   anonymous   tips    is    \"commonplace\"        and    \"a\n\nnecessary part of police work.\" United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d\n\n562, 566 (1st Cir. 1996).           Even when based on hearsay, such tips\n\nare often \"the stuff of search warrant affidavits.\"                     Jordan, 999\n\nF.2d at 13-14.         Nevertheless, for such a tip to serve as the\n\npredicate     for    probable     cause,    the    officer       must   attempt      to\n\ncorroborate    the     informant's    story       under   the    totality      of    the\n\ncircumstances.       See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238.          The officer, need not,\n\nhowever, entirely eliminate \"the risk that an informant is lying or\n\nin error.\"     United States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)(quoting United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 284 (1st\n\nCir. 1997)).        Thus, to qualify for the good faith exception, Irwin\n\nmust have provided sufficient corroboration of the informant's tip\n\nthat an objectively reasonable officer would have relied on the tip\n\nto apply for a warrant.          See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 345\n\n(1986).\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          Several   kinds   of   information   can   corroborate    an\n\ninformant's anonymous tip: whether the affidavit supports the basis\n\nof knowledge of the person providing the hearsay; whether the\n\ninformant's statements were self-authenticating; whether some of\n\nthe informant's statements were corroborated; and whether a law\n\nenforcement professional included an assessment of the significance\n\nof the facts relayed by the informant to the investigation.         See\n\nBarnard, 299 F.3d at 93. \"None of these factors is indispensable\";\n\nthe ultimate issue is whether the totality of the circumstances\n\nestablishes the credibility of the informant's story.         United\n\nStates v. Zaya-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Here, Trooper Irwin presented sufficient information for\n\nan objectively reasonable officer to believe that the anonymous tip\n\nhad been adequately corroborated.       Irwin learned from Officer\n\nMurphy that the two women who were present at the initial search of\n\nCapozzi's room at the Charles Hotel were also present at the\n\nPeabody District Court for Capozzi's arraignment.       Thus, Irwin\n\nconfirmed that individuals with first-hand knowledge concerning the\n\nwhereabouts of the weapons used in the crime were present at the\n\nlocation where the informant stated that she had gathered her\n\ninformation.   In addition, the informant stated that a failed\n\npolice search had already been conducted on the hotel room.        This\n\ninformation about the prior, unsuccessful search was accurate and\n\nnot publicly available.\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f           The informant's tip was also consistent with information\n\navailable to the police from other sources.                        The police had\n\nsubstantial evidence from the initial crime scene investigation\n\nthat Stone had taken his and Capozzi's weapons and hidden them in\n\nthe hotel room.       The police also knew that neither Stone nor\n\nCapozzi could have retrieved the weapons because they were in\n\ncustody.    See    Barnard,      299    F.3d    at   95    (noting    that   police\n\ninvestigation     which     is      consistent        with     a    tip   provides\n\ncorroboration). Considering this corroboration, it was objectively\n\nreasonable for Irwin to rely on the informant's tip to apply for a\n\nwarrant to search Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel.\n\n           Irwin's other conduct also supports his good faith in\n\nseeking the warrant.        See Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 15 (court\n\nexamines \"all the attendant circumstances\" in determining whether\n\nofficer acted in objective good faith in believing that there was\n\nprobable cause).      Irwin's was not a \"bare bones affidavit\" which\n\nprovided the magistrate with only the suspicions and conclusions of\n\nthe officer and no underlying information.                 See United States v.\n\nWeaver, 99 F.3d 1372, 1378 (6th Cir. 1996).                  Irwin summarized in\n\ndetail virtually all of the information available to him, including\n\nthe   investigation    of     the      crime,   the       failed   searches,    the\n\nconversation between Officer Murphy and Erica Murphy and Santina\n\nLuca, and the substance of the anonymous tip.                See United States v.\n\nDiehl, 276 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 2002) (concluding that affidavit\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwhich was not \"bare bone\" supported good faith conclusion).            Also,\n\nbefore presenting the affidavit to the magistrate for approval,\n\nIrwin sought a legal opinion from Assistant District Attorney\n\nBender that probable cause existed to search the hotel room.             See\n\nUnited States v. Tuter, 240 F.3d 1292, 1299-1300 (8th Cir. 2001)\n\n(suggesting that contacting attorney for advice on the existence of\n\nprobable cause before seeking warrant evidences good faith).\n\n           In sum, the record shows that Irwin did not intentionally\n\nor recklessly mislead the magistrate by filing a false affidavit,\n\nand that he presented sufficient information for an objective\n\nofficer   to    believe   that   there   was   probable   cause   to   search\n\nCapozzi's hotel room.       Accordingly, the district court correctly\n\nadmitted the gun pursuant to the Leon good faith exception.\n\n           B.       The Hobbs Act and the Commerce Clause.\n\n           Capozzi's second appellate argument is a Commerce Clause\n\nchallenge to the Hobbs Act conviction.           Capozzi failed to raise\n\nthis issue before the district court. Therefore, we review it only\n\nfor plain error.    See United States v. Newton, 327 F.3d 17, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).     Under this standard, we will reverse the Hobbs Act\n\nconviction on Commerce Clause grounds only if Capozzi can show (1)\n\nan error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial\n\nrights. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\nCapozzi's claim falters on the first prong of this analysis because\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fthe Hobbs Act, as applied here, does not violate the Commerce\n\nClause.\n\n            The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion or attempted extortion\n\nwhere such crime \"in any way or degree, obstructs, delays or\n\naffects commerce.\"         18 U.S.C. ยง 1951(a).              The Hobbs Act's scope\n\nextends to the limit of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.                           See\n\nStirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215 (1960); United States\n\nv. DiGregorio, 605 F.2d 1184, 1190 (1st Cir. 1979).                        Because of the\n\nstatute's       broad   sweep,    to       prove    a   Hobbs   Act    violation,      the\n\ngovernment must show only that the extortionate conduct created \"a\n\nrealistic       probability      of    a    de     minimis   effect        on   interstate\n\ncommerce.\" United States v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); see United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 293 (1st Cir.\n\n1990); DiGregorio, 605 F.2d at 1190.\n\n                Capozzi contends that, in light of the Supreme Court's\n\nCommerce Clause decisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549\n\n(1995) and United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), the \"de\n\nminimis effect\" on interstate commerce standard for establishing a\n\nHobbs     Act    violation    is       unconstitutional.              We    reject    this\n\ncontention.\n\n            In Lopez, the Supreme Court addressed a Commerce Clause\n\nchallenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act, a law which prohibited\n\na person from possessing a gun while in a school zone. 514 U.S.\n\n552-68.     In declaring the statute unconstitutional, the Court\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\fidentified three categories of conduct which Congress may regulate\n\nunder its Commerce Clause authority: (1) the use of channels of\n\ninterstate    commerce;     (2)   the   instrumentalities   of   interstate\n\ncommerce or persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3)\n\nactivities that substantially affect interstate commerce.            Id. at\n\n558-59.     The Court held that the proper test for evaluating a\n\nstatute like the Gun Free School Zones Act, which neither regulated\n\ncommercial     activity     nor   contained   a   jurisdictional    element\n\nrequiring that the regulated activity be connected to interstate\n\ncommerce, is whether the statute \"substantially affects\" interstate\n\ncommerce.     Id. at 559.    Applying this test, the Court invalidated\n\nthe Act because the \"possession of a gun in a local school zone is\n\nin no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition\n\nelsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.\"\n\nId. at 567.\n\n            Relying on the Lopez Court's \"substantially affects\"\n\nlanguage, Capozzi contends that the \"de minimis effect\" standard\n\nfor a Hobbs Act violation is no longer valid.               In making this\n\nargument, Capozzi overlooks a crucial distinction between the\n\nstatute at issue in Lopez and the Hobbs Act.        In drafting the Hobbs\n\nAct, Congress included a jurisdictional element which it failed to\n\ninclude in the Gun Free School Zones Act.          The Hobbs Act requires\n\nthe government to prove that the extortion or robbery be connected\n\nto interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1951(a). Rather than applying\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fto all robberies or extortions, the Hobbs Act applies to only that\n\nspecific subset of robberies or extortions that affects interstate\n\ncommerce.2    See United States v. Perrotta, 313 F.3d 33, 36 (2d Cir.\n\n2002) (citing cases where robbery or extortion held not to affect\n\ninterstate commerce and thus not actionable under Hobbs Act).\n\nThus, the Hobbs Act \"ensure[s], through case-by-case-inquiry, that\n\nthe   [extortion     or    robbery]        in   question    affects    interstate\n\ncommerce.\"     Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\n             In the Hobbs Act, Congress expressed its self-conscious\n\nrecognition    of    the   limits     on    its   Commerce    Clause    power    by\n\nrestricting the statute's reach to conduct squarely within its\n\nauthority-- a recognition notably absent from Congress' enactment\n\nof the Gun Free School Zones Act.                  Congress' inclusion of a\n\njurisdictional element in the Hobbs Act addresses the Lopez Court's\n\nconstitutional      concern   that    congressional        authority   under    the\n\nCommerce Clause not become a \"general police power of the sort\n\nretained by the States.\"       Lopez 514 U.S. at 567.          Accordingly, the\n\n\n      2\n       To distinguish the constitutional infirmity present in the\nGun Free School Zones Act from statutes which contain a\njurisdictional element, the Lopez Court relied on its decision in\nUnited States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), in which it rejected a\nCommerce Clause challenge to a statute similar to the Hobbs Act.\nId. at 561-62. The statute at issue in Bass made it unlawful for\na felon to possess a firearm \"in commerce or affecting commerce.\"\nId. at 562. This statute survived Commerce Clause scrutiny because\nit contained a jurisdictional element \"which might limit its reach\nto a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an\nexplicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\" Id. at\n562. As discussed above, the Hobbs Act contains the same sort of\nlimitation.\n\n                                      -20-\n\fLopez decision does not render the Hobbs Act's \"de minimis effect\"\n\non interstate commerce standard unconstitutional.3\n\n          Our rejection of Capozzi's Commerce Clause challenge to\n\nthe Hobbs Act is consistent with the decisions of several other\n\ncircuits which have rejected similar challenges. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Williams, -- F.3d --, 2003 WL 22038949, at *3 (4th Cir.\n\nAug. 29, 2003); United States v. Clausen, 328 F.3d 708, 710-11 (3d\n\nCir. 2003); United States v. Fabian, 312 F.3d 550, 554-55 (2d Cir.\n\n2002); United States v. Lynch, 282 F.3d 1049, 1052 (9th Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Malone, 222 F.3d 1286, 1294-95 (10th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Einfeldt, 138 F.3d 373, 379 (8th Cir. 1998);\n\nUnited States v. Valenzeno, 123 F.3d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Castleberry, 116 F.3d 1384, 1386-87 (11th Cir.\n\n1997); United States v. Harrington, 108 F.3d 1460, 1465-66 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997).   Accordingly, we hold that the Hobbs Act's \"de minimis\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The same rationale distinguishes Morrison, the other case on\nwhich Capozzi relies. In Morrison, the Court invalidated the civil\ncause of action established by the Violence Against Women Act on\nCommerce Clause grounds. 529 U.S. 607-619. The Court invalidated\nthe statute because it determined that Congress did not have the\npower to regulate \"non-economic, violent criminal conduct based\nsolely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\"\nId. at 617. The Court again criticized Congress for failing to\ninclude \"a jurisdictional element establishing that the federal\ncause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power to regulate\ninterstate commerce.\" Id. at 613. Significantly, the Court also\nnoted with approval that lower courts had rejected Commerce Clause\nchallenges to other provisions of the Violence Against Women Act\nwhich contained jurisdictional elements. Id. at 613-14 n.5.\n\n\n                               -21-\n\feffect\"   on      interstate   commerce    standard       was   constitutionally\n\napplied to Capozzi's conduct.\n\n             C.       Sufficiency of Evidence to Sustain the Hobbs Act\n                      Conviction.\n\n             Finally,      Capozzi    challenges    the    sufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence underlying the Hobbs Act conviction.               He asserts that the\n\ngovernment failed to meet its burden of establishing a nexus\n\nbetween his conduct and interstate commerce.                    Specifically, he\n\nasserts that his violent demand for reimbursement from Gardner Park\n\ndid not have even a \"de minimis effect\" on interstate commerce.\n\n             We review de novo a district court's determination that\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Otero-Mendez, 273 F.3d 46, 50-51 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nIn   doing     so,    we    examine    \"all   the     evidence,     direct    and\n\ncircumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and\n\navoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational\n\njury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"   United States v. Beckett, 321 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThe evidence adduced at trial showed that Gardner Park was a\n\nbusiness that bought cars from out-of-state. Capozzi, unhappy with\n\nthe truck that he had purchased from Gardner Park, threatened\n\nviolence in an attempt to extort McGrath, the owner of Gardner\n\nPark, to reimburse him $4,000 for the truck.               On these facts, the\n\njury reasonably could have concluded that if the extortion had been\n\n                                       -22-\n\fsuccessful, Gardner Park's assets would have been depleted by\n\n$4,000, at least until it could have resold Capozzi's truck to\n\nanother customer.\n\n             One common method for the government to establish the\n\nrequired \"de minimis effect\" on interstate commerce is to show that\n\nthe defendant's activity \"minimally depletes the assets of an\n\nentity doing business in interstate commerce.\"                 United States v.\n\nNguyen, 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 2001).            To establish a Hobbs Act\n\nviolation, the government need not show an actual deprivation of\n\nassets, but only that a deprivation of the victim's assets would\n\nhave occurred had the defendant succeeded in the extortion.                     See\n\nUnited   States   v.   Kattar,   840     F.2d    118,   122   (1st    Cir.    1988)\n\n(\"Attempted extortion is also proscribed by [the Hobbs Act] so that\n\nit is not material . . . whether the property was in fact obtained\n\nby the defendant.\").\n\n            Here, if Capozzi had successfully extorted McGrath into\n\ngiving him $4,000 in exchange for the return of the truck, Gardner\n\nPark would have been at least temporarily deprived of the use of\n\nthe money that Capozzi initially paid for the truck.                         Such a\n\ntemporary   deprivation    of    the    assets    of    a   company   engaged    in\n\ninterstate commerce satisfies the \"de minimis effect\" on interstate\n\ncommerce element required for a successful Hobbs Act prosecution.\n\nSee United States v. Stillo, 57 F.3d 553, 559 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"the\n\ntemporary depletion of . . . assets until repayment and the risk of\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fnon-payment   would   be   sufficient   to   satisfy   the   de   minimis\n\ninterstate commerce requirement\"); see also United States v.

Lance, 536 F.2d 1065, 1068 (5th Cir.\n\n1976)(under the Hobbs Act the \"loss of the use of money, even\n\ntemporarily, must be considered a deprivation of property\").\n\n\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the\n\nconvictions of defendant Derek Capozzi.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f",

Diaz,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir.2002). In January 1998, Capozzi purchased a used Chevy Blazer (\"truck\") for $4,500 from Gardner Park Auto Sales (\"Gardner Park\") in Peabody, Massachusetts. Capozzi quickly came to believe that the truck was a lemon. On the evening of February 17, 1998, Capozzi and his friend, Jason Stone, left the truck at Gardner Park with a note telling Michael McGrath, the owner of the dealership, that Capozzi wanted his money returned. At the time, Capozzi was living approximately three hundred yards from Gardner Park in Room # 2 at the Charles Hotel with his girlfriend, Erica Murphy. Stone and his companion, Santina Luca, were staying with Capozzi and his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next afternoon Capozzi and Stone, both armed, returned to see McGrath. Capozzi, who was a convicted felon, carried a revolver that he had purchased from Stone several months earlier. Stone carried a knife that appeared to be a gun because the handle looked like the butt of a revolver. After entering McGrath's office, Stone waited by the door while Capozzi demanded a refund of his money. McGrath refused because Capozzi had put a large dent in the truck. Capozzi tried to bargain, telling McGrath that he would accept $4,000 instead of $4,500. When McGrath again refused, Capozzi unzipped his coat and showed McGrath the gun that was tucked into his pants. McGrath still refused to return Capozzi's money. Angered, Capozzi placed the barrel of the gun to McGrath's head and screamed, \"I'll f____ kill you if you don't give me my money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the dispute turned violent, a business associate of McGrath's, Carlo Fahkri, and his brother, John Fahkri, happened to arrive at Gardner Park to see McGrath. They entered McGrath's office and tried to defuse the situation. As the Fahkris attempted to mediate, a telephone rang in another part of the building. McGrath told Capozzi that he needed to answer the call and bolted from the room. After escaping, McGrath called the police. Stone, suspecting that McGrath would call the police, took the gun from Capozzi and returned to the Charles Hotel, where he hid Capozzi's gun and his knife. Shortly, the Peabody police arrived at Gardner Park and arrested Capozzi. Several minutes later, another officer located Stone walking from the Charles Hotel toward Gardner Park and arrested him. Because Stone's knife appeared to be a gun, the witnesses on the scene incorrectly told the police that both Stone and Capozzi were carrying guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the Gardner Park incident, authorities were investigating whether Capozzi was involved in a bank robbery in Beverly, Massachusetts. In due course, a federal grand jury returned a five count indictment against Capozzi. The first three counts (identified in the introduction) related to the attempted extortion at Gardner Park; the other two involved the alleged bank robbery. The district court severed the counts relating to the attempted extortion and, following the denial of Capozzi's suppression motion (which we discuss in greater detail <i>infra</i>), the case proceeded to trial. As set forth above, a jury convicted Capozzi of all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi appeals his convictions alleging three errors. He first challenges the district court's refusal to suppress evidence of the gun used in the attempted extortion, arguing that the search warrant under which the police seized the gun was obtained without probable cause and in bad faith. Capozzi next contends that the Hobbs Act count should have been dismissed because application of the Act to Capozzi's conduct exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause authority. Finally, Capozzi argues that even if the government could have proceeded with the Hobbs Act prosecution, the district court nevertheless should have dismissed the Hobbs Act count because the government failed to establish that Capozzi's conduct interfered with interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Suppression Ruling.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Capozzi that the search warrant which led to the discovery of the gun used in the extortion attempt was issued without probable cause. Nonetheless, the court declined to suppress the evidence of the gun, relying on \"the good faith exception\" established in <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). Capozzi contends the district court's <i>Leon</i> ruling was erroneous. Applying <i>de novo</i> review (but accepting the district court's factual findings absent a demonstration of clear error), <i>see United States v. Owens,</i> 167 F.3d 739, 743 (1st Cir.1999), we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our explanation with a recitation of necessary background. Immediately after the Peabody police arrested Capozzi and Stone, the officers on the scene shared information with each other about the crime. One officer told his colleagues that he recently had responded to an emergency call from Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel. Based on this information, the police obtained Capozzi's consent to search his room while he remained in custody. With Erica Murphy and Santina Luca present, several Peabody officers searched the room for more than an hour but could not find any weapons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, February 19, 1998, Capozzi and Stone were arraigned in the Peabody District Court. Murphy and Luca were among those present at the arraignment. Later that day, while walking his beat, Peabody Officer Daniel Murphy, who had been involved in the searches of Capozzi's hotel room, saw Erica Murphy and Santina Luca on the street near the Peabody District Court. Officer Murphy recognized the women from the previous day and asked them if Capozzi had made bail. One woman replied that they had just come from the court and that Capozzi's bail had been set at $50,000; the other stated that the next court date was set for February 23, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same afternoon, Sergeant Thomas Griffin of the Salem Police Department received a telephone call from an informant. The informant told Griffin that she had previously provided tips to another Salem detective and that she had new information to report. She reported that she had been present at the Peabody District Court that morning where she overheard two women discussing a gun and a knife hidden in a hotel room in Peabody. The informant overheard the women say that the police had been unable to find the weapons because they were wrapped in a sock. The informant specified that the gun and knife were used in an assault on a Peabody businessman. The informant remained anonymous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this tip, Griffin called the Peabody police to report the tip, but they took no immediate action. Griffin also told Salem Detective Harry Rocheville about the information he had received. Rocheville, in turn, relayed the tip to F.B.I. Special Agent Gerald Mohan, who was investigating Capozzi's possible involvement in the Beverly bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While traveling to work on February 19, 1998, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Robert Irwin learned from the media that Capozzi and Stone had been arrested for the Gardner Park incident. Capozzi was a suspect in two of Irwin's ongoing investigations. Later that day, Irwin contacted Peabody Detective Richard Robillard, who had been involved in investigating the Gardner Park incident, to learn more about the attempted extortion. Robillard told Irwin that Capozzi was suspected of having a gun, but that searches of the Charles Hotel, Gardner Park, and the surrounding area had failed to uncover it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin offered Robillard the services of the State Police Dive Team for the next day to search a waterway located behind Gardner Park. The dive team's search did not locate any weapons. Officer Murphy was among those present at the dive search; he told Irwin about his encounter the day before with Erica Murphy and Santina Luca. F.B.I. Agent Mohan was also present at the dive search; he told Irwin that he had learned from Rocheville about the anonymous tip in which two women at Capozzi's arraignment stated that the gun used in the crime was hidden in a hotel room in Peabody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the dive search, Irwin began to prepare a search warrant affidavit based on the information that he had collected. Before completing the affidavit, Irwin called Rocheville at the Salem Police Department to learn more about the anonymous tip. Rocheville described the substance of the informant's telephone call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin prepared an affidavit to obtain a search warrant for Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel. The Irwin affidavit described the crime and the unsuccessful search to which Capozzi consented. It also described the fruitless searches of the areas surrounding Gardner Park. Further, it reported the substance of the informant's anonymous tip to the Salem Police and Officer Murphy's conversation with Erica Murphy and Santina Luca in which they told him that they were present at the Peabody District Court for Capozzi's hearing. Finally, it stated that the door of Capozzi's hotel room was locked on February 20th. As a result of this information, Irwin offered his opinion that there was probable cause to believe that the weapons used by Capozzi and Stone in the attempted extortion were located in Room # 2 at the Charles Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After drafting the affidavit, Irwin contacted Essex County Assistant District Attorney Robert Bender, an experienced appellate attorney. Irwin asked Bender if, based on the information he had gathered, there was a basis for searching the room. Bender told him that he had developed enough information to conduct a search and should apply for a warrant. Irwin submitted the affidavit and a warrant application to the Clerk Magistrate of the Peabody District Court (the \"magistrate\"). The magistrate issued the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin, along with representatives of the Peabody Police, conducted the search. The officers first found a knife inside a Kleenex box and then found a revolver that matched the description of the gun that Capozzi had used in the crime. The gun was found inside the lining of a chair wrapped in a pair of boxer shorts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi moved to suppress evidence of the gun, arguing that the Irwin affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause for a warrant because it was based primarily on information provided by an uncorroborated, anonymous informant. He also argued that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception did not apply because Irwin intentionally or recklessly misstated material information in the affidavit, and the affidavit was so lacking in the indicia of probable cause that an objective officer would not reasonably rely on it to obtain a warrant. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Capozzi's motion to suppress. The court agreed that Irwin's affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search because the police had insufficient corroboration of the reliability of the anonymous tip. However, the court concluded that the good faith exception applied because \"given all the circumstances under which he sought the warrant, Trooper Irwin's action and his reliance on the warrant's validity were objectively reasonable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we regard the district court's <i>Leon</i> ruling as sound but its probable cause ruling as more controversial, we proceed directly to the district court's ruling that evidence of the gun was admissible because Irwin obtained the warrant in good faith. <i>See Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 925, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (holding that courts have discretion to proceed directly to the good faith issue without first addressing probable cause issue); <i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 744-45 (same). In <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, the Supreme Court adopted an exception to the usual rule that evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial. The Court recognized that the purpose of this exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct; therefore, it declined to apply the rule in circumstances where an officer acts in good faith to obtain a warrant because suppression in such instances does not \"logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 921, 104 S.Ct. 3405.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, while <i>Leon</i> restricts the application of the exclusionary rule, it does not eliminate it. <i>See United States v. Ricciardelli,</i> 998 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1993). Exclusion remains the appropriate remedy in several circumstances, including (1) where the magistrate is misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for a reckless disregard for the truth, or (2) where the affidavit is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable. <i>See United States v. Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405). Capozzi claims that both of these situations are present here. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. False Information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi identifies four pieces of information that he claims Irwin intentionally or recklessly omitted from or misstated in the affidavit: (1) the affidavit omitted that the informant claimed to have previously provided other tips to the Salem Police Department; (2) the affidavit misstated that the informant told the officer that a gun (rather than a gun and a knife) were in the room; (3) the affidavit misstated that the informant reported that the gun \"is\" hidden (rather than \"was\" hidden) in the hotel room; and (4) the affidavit misstated the point in time when the police locked Capozzi's hotel room door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its findings of fact after the evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Irwin had prepared his affidavit by collecting information from several officers under significant time pressure and in an \"unfamiliar search scenario.\" It found no evidence that Irwin had acted intentionally or recklessly in making any misstatements or omissions. These findings are not clearly erroneous. At most, Irwin's omissions and misstatements reflect negligence, mistake, or inattention to detail as he rushed to prepare an affidavit in the midst of a developing investigation. Mere negligence or inattention to detail in preparing an affidavit does not deprive the government of the benefits of the <i>Leon</i> exception. <i>See Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d at 20; <i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the omissions and mistakes identified by Capozzi were not material to the magistrate's decision to issue a warrant. <i>See Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745. Irwin's omission of the fact that the informant stated that she had provided prior tips to the police was an immaterial, indeed perhaps even a cautiously appropriate, omission from the affidavit. Irwin had no information to support the informant's claim of providing previous tips. If such information had been included in the affidavit, it may have influenced the magistrate to accord the informant unwarranted credibility. <i>See United States v. Jordan,</i> 999 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that proof that confidential informant had provided past reliable information may be sufficient by itself to establish reliability of informant's statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin's omission of the informant's statement that a knife would also be found in the hotel room was also immaterial. The focus of the police's investigation had been on the search for two guns, and Irwin's inclusion of the fact that a knife might also be found in the room would not have changed the magistrate's evaluation of the possibility that a gun might be present. In any event, while it might have been preferable for Irwin to have transcribed the tip exactly as he received it, any error can only be regarded as an innocent mistake made under significant time pressure. <i>See</i> p. 332 above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alleged misstatement concerning verb tense is a criticism of the form rather than the substance of Irwin's affidavit. Such technical criticism of the form of the affidavit is insufficient to undermine its veracity. <i>See Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (\"affidavits are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation\") (internal quotations omitted). Finally, the statement referring to the locked hotel room door was not a misstatement at all. The affidavit did not say, as Capozzi suggests, that the door was locked immediately after Capozzi's arrest. Rather, it stated accurately that the door was locked by the police on February 20, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Probable Cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi's other assertion is that the good faith exception does not apply because, even though the magistrate issued the warrant, an objectively reasonable officer would have realized that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause. In support of this assertion, Capozzi relies heavily on the fact that Irwin's affidavit was partially informed by a hearsay tip from an anonymous source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliance on anonymous tips is \"commonplace\" and \"a necessary part of police work.\" <i>United States v. Schaefer,</i> 87 F.3d 562, 566 (1st Cir.1996). Even when based on hearsay, such tips are often \"the stuff of search warrant affidavits.\" <i>Jordan,</i> 999 F.2d at 13-14. Nevertheless, for such a tip to serve as the predicate for probable cause, the officer must attempt to corroborate the informant's story under the totality of the circumstances. <i>See Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317. The officer, need not, however, entirely eliminate \"the risk that an informant is lying or in error.\" <i>United States v. Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 284 (1st Cir. 1997)). Thus, to qualify for the good faith exception, Irwin must have provided sufficient corroboration of the informant's tip that an objectively reasonable officer would have relied on the tip to apply for a warrant. <i>See Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 345, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several kinds of information can corroborate an informant's anonymous tip: whether the affidavit supports the basis of knowledge of the person providing the hearsay; whether the informant's statements were self-authenticating; whether some of the informant's statements were corroborated; and whether a law enforcement professional included an assessment of the significance of the facts relayed by the informant to the investigation. <i>See Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d at 93. \"None of these factors is indispensable\"; the ultimate issue is whether the totality of the circumstances establishes the credibility of the informant's story. <i>United States v. Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Trooper Irwin presented sufficient information for an objectively reasonable officer to believe that the anonymous tip had been adequately corroborated. Irwin learned from Officer Murphy that the two women who were present at the initial search of Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel were also present at the Peabody District Court for Capozzi's arraignment. Thus, Irwin confirmed that individuals with first-hand knowledge concerning the whereabouts of the weapons used in the crime were present at the location where the informant stated that she had gathered her information. In addition, the informant stated that a failed police search had already been conducted on the hotel room. This information about the prior, unsuccessful search was accurate and not publicly available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The informant's tip was also consistent with information available to the police from other sources. The police had substantial evidence from the initial crime scene investigation that Stone had taken his and Capozzi's weapons and hidden them in the hotel room. The police also knew that neither Stone nor Capozzi could have retrieved the weapons because they were in custody. <i>See Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d at 95 (noting that police investigation which is consistent with a tip provides corroboration). Considering this corroboration, it was objectively reasonable for Irwin to rely on the informant's tip to apply for a warrant to search Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin's other conduct also supports his good faith in seeking the warrant. <i>See Ricciardelli,</i> 998 F.2d at 15 (court examines \"all the attendant circumstances\" in determining whether officer acted in objective good faith in believing that there was probable cause). Irwin's was not a \"bare bones affidavit\" which provided the magistrate with only the suspicions and conclusions of the officer and no underlying information. <i>See United States v. Weaver,</i> 99 F.3d 1372, 1378 (6th Cir.1996). Irwin summarized in detail virtually all of the information available to him, including the investigation of the crime, the failed searches, the conversation between Officer Murphy and Erica Murphy and Santina Luca, and the substance of the anonymous tip. <i>See United States v. Diehl,</i> 276 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.2002) (concluding that affidavit which was not \"bare bone\" supported good faith conclusion). Also, before presenting the affidavit to the magistrate for approval, Irwin sought a legal opinion from Assistant District Attorney Bender that probable cause existed to search the hotel room. <i>See United States v. Tuter,</i> 240 F.3d 1292, 1299-1300 (8th Cir.2001) (suggesting that contacting attorney for advice on the existence of probable cause before seeking warrant evidences good faith).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record shows that Irwin did not intentionally or recklessly mislead the magistrate by filing a false affidavit, and that he presented sufficient information for an objective officer to believe that there was probable cause to search Capozzi's hotel room. Accordingly, the district court correctly admitted the gun pursuant to the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Hobbs Act and the Commerce Clause.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi's second appellate argument is a Commerce Clause challenge to the Hobbs Act conviction. Capozzi failed to raise this issue before the district court. Therefore, we review it only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Newton,</i> 327 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir.2003). Under this standard, we will reverse the Hobbs Act conviction on Commerce Clause grounds only if Capozzi can show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Capozzi's claim falters on the first prong of this analysis because the Hobbs Act, as applied here, does not violate the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act prohibits extortion or attempted extortion where such crime \"in any way or degree, obstructs, delays or affects commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). The Hobbs Act's scope extends to the limit of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. <i>See Stirone v. United States,</i> 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960); <i>United States v. DiGregorio,</i> 605 F.2d 1184, 1190 (1st Cir.1979). Because of the statute's broad sweep, to prove a Hobbs Act violation, the government must show only that the extortionate conduct created \"a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992); <i>see United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 293 (1st Cir.1990); <i>DiGregorio,</i> 605 F.2d at 1190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi contends that, in light of the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause decisions in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), the \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce standard for establishing a Hobbs Act violation is unconstitutional. We reject this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court addressed a Commerce Clause challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act, a law which prohibited a person from possessing a gun while in a school zone. 514 U.S. at 552-68, 115 S.Ct. 1624. In declaring the statute unconstitutional, the Court identified three categories of conduct which Congress may regulate under its Commerce Clause authority: (1) the use of channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Id.</i> at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624. The Court held that the proper test for evaluating a statute like the Gun Free School Zones Act, which neither regulated commercial activity nor contained a jurisdictional element requiring that the regulated activity be connected to interstate commerce, is whether the statute \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce. <i>Id.</i> at 559, 115 S.Ct. 1624. Applying this test, the Court invalidated the Act because the \"possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the <i>Lopez</i> Court's \"substantially affects\" language, Capozzi contends that the \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" standard for a Hobbs Act violation is no longer valid. In making this argument, Capozzi overlooks a crucial distinction between the statute at issue in <i>Lopez</i> and the Hobbs Act. In drafting the Hobbs Act, Congress included a jurisdictional element which it failed to include in the Gun Free School Zones Act. The Hobbs Act requires the government to prove that the extortion or robbery be connected to interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). Rather than applying to all robberies or extortions, the Hobbs Act applies to only that specific subset of robberies or extortions that affects interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Perrotta,</i> 313 F.3d 33, 36 (2d Cir.2002) (citing cases where robbery or extortion held not to affect interstate commerce and thus not actionable under Hobbs Act). Thus, the Hobbs Act \"ensure[s], through case-by-case-inquiry, that the [extortion or robbery] in question affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Hobbs Act, Congress expressed its self-conscious recognition of the limits on its Commerce Clause power by restricting the statute's reach to conduct squarely within its authority &#8212; a recognition notably absent from Congress' enactment of the Gun Free School Zones Act. Congress' inclusion of a jurisdictional element in the Hobbs Act addresses the <i>Lopez</i> Court's constitutional concern that congressional authority under the Commerce Clause not become a \"general police power of the sort retained by the States.\" <i>Lopez</i> 514 U.S. at 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624. Accordingly, the <i>Lopez</i> decision does not render the Hobbs Act's \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce standard unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our rejection of Capozzi's Commerce Clause challenge to the Hobbs Act is consistent with the decisions of several other circuits which have rejected similar challenges. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Williams,</i> 342 F.3d 350, 352 (4th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Clausen,</i> 328 F.3d 708, 710-11 (3d Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Fabian,</i> 312 F.3d 550, 554-55 (2d Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Lynch,</i> 282 F.3d 1049, 1052 (9th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Malone,</i> 222 F.3d 1286, 1294-95 (10th Cir. 2000); <i>United States v. Einfeldt,</i> 138 F.3d 373, 379 (8th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Valenzeno,</i> 123 F.3d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1997); <i>United States v. Castleberry,</i> 116 F.3d 1384, 1386-87 (11th Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Harrington,</i> 108 F.3d 1460, 1465-66 (D.C.Cir.1997). Accordingly, we hold that the Hobbs Act's \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce standard was constitutionally applied to Capozzi's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence to Sustain the Hobbs Act Conviction.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Capozzi challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the Hobbs Act conviction. He asserts that the government failed to meet its burden of establishing a nexus between his conduct and interstate commerce. Specifically, he asserts that his violent demand for reimbursement from Gardner Park did not have even a \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's determination that the evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury. <i>See United States v. Otero-Mendez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 50-51 (1st Cir.2001). In doing so, we examine \"all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Beckett,</i> 321 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir.2003). The evidence adduced at trial showed that Gardner Park was a business that bought cars from out-of-state. Capozzi, unhappy with the truck that he had purchased from Gardner Park, threatened violence in an attempt to extort McGrath, the owner of Gardner Park, to reimburse him $4,000 for the truck. On these facts, the jury reasonably could have concluded that if the extortion had been successful, Gardner Park's assets would have been depleted by $4,000, at least until it could have resold Capozzi's truck to another customer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One common method for the government to establish the required \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce is to show that the defendant's activity \"minimally depletes the assets of an entity doing business in interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.2001). To establish a Hobbs Act violation, the government need not show an actual deprivation of assets, but only that a deprivation of the victim's assets would have occurred had the defendant succeeded in the extortion. <i>See United States v. Kattar,</i> 840 F.2d 118, 122 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Attempted extortion is also proscribed by [the Hobbs Act] so that it is not material ... whether the property was in fact obtained by the defendant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, if Capozzi had successfully extorted McGrath into giving him $4,000 in exchange for the return of the truck, Gardner Park would have been at least temporarily deprived of the use of the money that Capozzi initially paid for the truck. Such a temporary deprivation of the assets of a company engaged in interstate commerce satisfies the \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce element required for a successful Hobbs Act prosecution. <i>See United States v. Stillo,</i> 57 F.3d 553, 559 (7th Cir.1995) (\"the temporary depletion of ... assets until repayment and the risk of non-payment would be sufficient to satisfy the <i>de minimis</i> interstate commerce requirement\"); <i>see also United States v. Lewis,</i> 797 F.2d 358, 365 (7th Cir.1986) (\"Even a temporary loss of the use of money constitutes a deprivation of property under [the Hobbs Act].\"); <i>United States v. Lance,</i> 536 F.2d 1065, 1068 (5th Cir.1976) (under the Hobbs Act the \"loss of the use of money, even temporarily, must be considered a deprivation of property\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we <i>affirm</i> the convictions of defendant Derek Capozzi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Immediately prior to obtaining Capozzi's consent, the officers conducted an initial unsuccessful search of the room with only Murphy's permission.

Bass,</i> 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), in which it rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to a statute similar to the Hobbs Act. <i>Id.</i> at 561-62, 92 S.Ct. 515. The statute at issue in Bass made it unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm \"in commerce or affecting commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 562, 92 S.Ct. 515. This statute survived Commerce Clause scrutiny because it contained a jurisdictional element \"which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 562, 92 S.Ct. 515. As discussed above, the Hobbs Act contains the same sort of limitation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The same rationale distinguishes<i>Morrison,</i> the other case on which Capozzi relies. In <i>Morrison,</i> the Court invalidated the civil cause of action established by the Violence Against Women Act on Commerce Clause grounds. 529 U.S. at 607-619, 120 S.Ct. 1740. The Court invalidated the statute because it determined that Congress did not have the power to regulate \"non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 617, 120 S.Ct. 1740. The Court again criticized Congress for failing to include \"a jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Significantly, the Court also noted with approval that lower courts had rejected Commerce Clause challenges to other provisions of the Violence Against Women Act which contained jurisdictional elements. <i>Id.</i> at 613-14 n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After a ten-day trial, a jury convicted Capozzi of being a felon in possession of a firearm, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), attempted extortion affecting interstate commerce, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a) (the \"Hobbs Act\"), and use of a firearm during the attempted extortion, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c). Capozzi challenges his convictions on several grounds. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set forth the facts underlying Capozzi's convictions in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See United States v.

In January 1998, Capozzi purchased a used Chevy Blazer (\"truck\") for $4,500 from Gardner Park Auto Sales (\"Gardner Park\") in Peabody, Massachusetts. Capozzi quickly came to believe that the truck was a lemon. On the evening of February 17, 1998, Capozzi and his friend, Jason Stone, left the truck at Gardner Park with a note telling Michael McGrath, the owner of the dealership, that Capozzi wanted his money returned. At the time, Capozzi was living approximately three hundred yards from Gardner Park in Room # 2 at the Charles Hotel with his girlfriend, Erica Murphy. Stone and his companion, Santina Luca, were staying with Capozzi and his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next afternoon Capozzi and Stone, both armed, returned to see McGrath. Capozzi, who was a convicted felon, carried a revolver that he had purchased from Stone several months earlier. Stone carried a knife that appeared to be a gun because the handle looked like the butt of a revolver. After entering McGrath's office, Stone waited by the door while Capozzi demanded a refund of his money. McGrath refused because Capozzi had put a large dent in the truck. Capozzi tried to bargain, telling McGrath that he would accept $4,000 instead of $4,500. When McGrath again refused, Capozzi unzipped his coat and showed McGrath the gun that was tucked into his pants. McGrath still refused to return Capozzi's money. Angered, Capozzi placed the barrel of the gun to McGrath's head and screamed, \"I'll f____ kill you if you don't give me my money.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the dispute turned violent, a business associate of McGrath's, Carlo Fahkri, and his brother, John Fahkri, happened to arrive at Gardner Park to see McGrath. They entered McGrath's office and tried to defuse the situation. As the Fahkris attempted to mediate, a telephone rang in another part of the building. McGrath told Capozzi that he needed to answer the call and bolted from the room. After escaping, McGrath called the police. Stone, suspecting that McGrath would call the police, took the gun from Capozzi and returned to the Charles Hotel, where he hid Capozzi's gun and his knife. Shortly, the Peabody police arrived at Gardner Park and arrested Capozzi. Several minutes later, another officer located Stone walking from the Charles Hotel toward Gardner Park and arrested him. Because Stone's knife appeared to be a gun, the witnesses on the scene incorrectly told the police that both Stone and Capozzi were carrying guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the Gardner Park incident, authorities were investigating whether Capozzi was involved in a bank robbery in Beverly, Massachusetts. In due course, a federal grand jury returned a five count indictment against Capozzi. The first three counts (identified in the introduction) related to the attempted extortion at Gardner Park; the other two involved the alleged bank robbery. The district court severed the counts relating to the attempted extortion and, following the denial of Capozzi's suppression motion (which we discuss in greater detail <i>infra</i>), the case proceeded to trial. As set forth above, a jury convicted Capozzi of all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi appeals his convictions alleging three errors. He first challenges the district court's refusal to suppress evidence of the gun used in the attempted extortion, arguing that the search warrant under which the police seized the gun was obtained without probable cause and in bad faith. Capozzi next contends that the Hobbs Act count should have been dismissed because application of the Act to Capozzi's conduct exceeds Congress' Commerce Clause authority. Finally, Capozzi argues that even if the government could have proceeded with the Hobbs Act prosecution, the district court nevertheless should have dismissed the Hobbs Act count because the government failed to establish that Capozzi's conduct interfered with interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Suppression Ruling.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with Capozzi that the search warrant which led to the discovery of the gun used in the extortion attempt was issued without probable cause. Nonetheless, the court declined to suppress the evidence of the gun, relying on \"the good faith exception\" established in <i>United States v. Leon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (1984). Capozzi contends the district court's <i>Leon</i> ruling was erroneous. Applying <i>de novo</i> review (but accepting the district court's factual findings absent a demonstration of clear error), <i>see United States v. Owens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 743 (1st Cir.1999), we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our explanation with a recitation of necessary background. Immediately after the Peabody police arrested Capozzi and Stone, the officers on the scene shared information with each other about the crime. One officer told his colleagues that he recently had responded to an emergency call from Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel. Based on this information, the police obtained Capozzi's consent to search his room while he remained in custody. With Erica Murphy and Santina Luca present, several Peabody officers searched the room for more than an hour but could not find any weapons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, February 19, 1998, Capozzi and Stone were arraigned in the Peabody District Court. Murphy and Luca were among those present at the arraignment. Later that day, while walking his beat, Peabody Officer Daniel Murphy, who had been involved in the searches of Capozzi's hotel room, saw Erica Murphy and Santina Luca on the street near the Peabody District Court. Officer Murphy recognized the women from the previous day and asked them if Capozzi had made bail. One woman replied that they had just come from the court and that Capozzi's bail had been set at $50,000; the other stated that the next court date was set for February 23, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same afternoon, Sergeant Thomas Griffin of the Salem Police Department received a telephone call from an informant. The informant told Griffin that she had previously provided tips to another Salem detective and that she had new information to report. She reported that she had been present at the Peabody District Court that morning where she overheard two women discussing a gun and a knife hidden in a hotel room in Peabody. The informant overheard the women say that the police had been unable to find the weapons because they were wrapped in a sock. The informant specified that the gun and knife were used in an assault on a Peabody businessman. The informant remained anonymous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this tip, Griffin called the Peabody police to report the tip, but they took no immediate action. Griffin also told Salem Detective Harry Rocheville about the information he had received. Rocheville, in turn, relayed the tip to F.B.I. Special Agent Gerald Mohan, who was investigating Capozzi's possible involvement in the Beverly bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While traveling to work on February 19, 1998, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Robert Irwin learned from the media that Capozzi and Stone had been arrested for the Gardner Park incident. Capozzi was a suspect in two of Irwin's ongoing investigations. Later that day, Irwin contacted Peabody Detective Richard Robillard, who had been involved in investigating the Gardner Park incident, to learn more about the attempted extortion. Robillard told Irwin that Capozzi was suspected of having a gun, but that searches of the Charles Hotel, Gardner Park, and the surrounding area had failed to uncover it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin offered Robillard the services of the State Police Dive Team for the next day to search a waterway located behind Gardner Park. The dive team's search did not locate any weapons. Officer Murphy was among those present at the dive search; he told Irwin about his encounter the day before with Erica Murphy and Santina Luca. F.B.I. Agent Mohan was also present at the dive search; he told Irwin that he had learned from Rocheville about the anonymous tip in which two women at Capozzi's arraignment stated that the gun used in the crime was hidden in a hotel room in Peabody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the dive search, Irwin began to prepare a search warrant affidavit based on the information that he had collected. Before completing the affidavit, Irwin called Rocheville at the Salem Police Department to learn more about the anonymous tip. Rocheville described the substance of the informant's telephone call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin prepared an affidavit to obtain a search warrant for Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel. The Irwin affidavit described the crime and the unsuccessful search to which Capozzi consented. It also described the fruitless searches of the areas surrounding Gardner Park. Further, it reported the substance of the informant's anonymous tip to the Salem Police and Officer Murphy's conversation with Erica Murphy and Santina Luca in which they told him that they were present at the Peabody District Court for Capozzi's hearing. Finally, it stated that the door of Capozzi's hotel room was locked on February 20th. As a result of this information, Irwin offered his opinion that there was probable cause to believe that the weapons used by Capozzi and Stone in the attempted extortion were located in Room # 2 at the Charles Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After drafting the affidavit, Irwin contacted Essex County Assistant District Attorney Robert Bender, an experienced appellate attorney. Irwin asked Bender if, based on the information he had gathered, there was a basis for searching the room. Bender told him that he had developed enough information to conduct a search and should apply for a warrant. Irwin submitted the affidavit and a warrant application to the Clerk Magistrate of the Peabody District Court (the \"magistrate\"). The magistrate issued the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin, along with representatives of the Peabody Police, conducted the search. The officers first found a knife inside a Kleenex box and then found a revolver that matched the description of the gun that Capozzi had used in the crime. The gun was found inside the lining of a chair wrapped in a pair of boxer shorts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi moved to suppress evidence of the gun, arguing that the Irwin affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause for a warrant because it was based primarily on information provided by an uncorroborated, anonymous informant. He also argued that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception did not apply because Irwin intentionally or recklessly misstated material information in the affidavit, and the affidavit was so lacking in the indicia of probable cause that an objective officer would not reasonably rely on it to obtain a warrant. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Capozzi's motion to suppress. The court agreed that Irwin's affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search because the police had insufficient corroboration of the reliability of the anonymous tip. However, the court concluded that the good faith exception applied because \"given all the circumstances under which he sought the warrant, Trooper Irwin's action and his reliance on the warrant's validity were objectively reasonable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we regard the district court's <i>Leon</i> ruling as sound but its probable cause ruling as more controversial, we proceed directly to the district court's ruling that evidence of the gun was admissible because Irwin obtained the warrant in good faith. <i>See Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 925, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

False Information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capozzi identifies four pieces of information that he claims Irwin intentionally or recklessly omitted from or misstated in the affidavit: (1) the affidavit omitted that the informant claimed to have previously provided other tips to the Salem Police Department; (2) the affidavit misstated that the informant told the officer that a gun (rather than a gun and a knife) were in the room; (3) the affidavit misstated that the informant reported that the gun \"is\" hidden (rather than \"was\" hidden) in the hotel room; and (4) the affidavit misstated the point in time when the police locked Capozzi's hotel room door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its findings of fact after the evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Irwin had prepared his affidavit by collecting information from several officers under significant time pressure and in an \"unfamiliar search scenario.\" It found no evidence that Irwin had acted intentionally or recklessly in making any misstatements or omissions. These findings are not clearly erroneous. At most, Irwin's omissions and misstatements reflect negligence, mistake, or inattention to detail as he rushed to prepare an affidavit in the midst of a developing investigation. Mere negligence or inattention to detail in preparing an affidavit does not deprive the government of the benefits of the <i>Leon</i> exception. <i>See Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d at 20; <i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the omissions and mistakes identified by Capozzi were not material to the magistrate's decision to issue a warrant. <i>See Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745. Irwin's omission of the fact that the informant stated that she had provided prior tips to the police was an immaterial, indeed perhaps even a cautiously appropriate, omission from the affidavit. Irwin had no information to support the informant's claim of providing previous tips. If such information had been included in the affidavit, it may have influenced the magistrate to accord the informant unwarranted credibility. <i>See United States v. Jordan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611606\"><a href=\"/opinion/611606/united-states-v-sherwood-k-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that proof that confidential informant had provided past reliable information may be sufficient by itself to establish reliability of informant's statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin's omission of the informant's statement that a knife would also be found in the hotel room was also immaterial. The focus of the police's investigation had been on the search for two guns, and Irwin's inclusion of the fact that a knife might also be found in the room would not have changed the magistrate's evaluation of the possibility that a gun might be present. In any event, while it might have been preferable for Irwin to have transcribed the tip exactly as he received it, any error can only be regarded as an innocent mistake made under significant time pressure. <i>See</i> p. 332 above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alleged misstatement concerning verb tense is a criticism of the form rather than the substance of Irwin's affidavit. Such technical criticism of the form of the affidavit is insufficient to undermine its veracity. <i>See Illinois v.

Finally, the statement referring to the locked hotel room door was not a misstatement at all. The affidavit did not say, as Capozzi suggests, that the door was locked immediately after Capozzi's arrest. Rather, it stated accurately that the door was locked by the police on February 20, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

In support of this assertion, Capozzi relies heavily on the fact that Irwin's affidavit was partially informed by a hearsay tip from an anonymous source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliance on anonymous tips is \"commonplace\" and \"a necessary part of police work.\" <i>United States v.

Even when based on hearsay, such tips are often \"the stuff of search warrant affidavits.\" <i>Jordan,</i> 999 F.2d at 13-14. Nevertheless, for such a tip to serve as the predicate for probable cause, the officer must attempt to corroborate the informant's story under the totality of the circumstances. <i>See Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Irwin learned from Officer Murphy that the two women who were present at the initial search of Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel were also present at the Peabody District Court for Capozzi's arraignment. Thus, Irwin confirmed that individuals with first-hand knowledge concerning the whereabouts of the weapons used in the crime were present at the location where the informant stated that she had gathered her information. In addition, the informant stated that a failed police search had already been conducted on the hotel room. This information about the prior, unsuccessful search was accurate and not publicly available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The informant's tip was also consistent with information available to the police from other sources. The police had substantial evidence from the initial crime scene investigation that Stone had taken his and Capozzi's weapons and hidden them in the hotel room. The police also knew that neither Stone nor Capozzi could have retrieved the weapons because they were in custody. <i>See Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d at 95 (noting that police investigation which is consistent with a tip provides corroboration). Considering this corroboration, it was objectively reasonable for Irwin to rely on the informant's tip to apply for a warrant to search Capozzi's room at the Charles Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irwin's other conduct also supports his good faith in seeking the warrant. <i>See Ricciardelli,</i> 998 F.2d at 15 (court examines \"all the attendant circumstances\" in determining whether officer acted in objective good faith in believing that there was probable cause). Irwin's was not a \"bare bones affidavit\" which provided the magistrate with only the suspicions and conclusions of the officer and no underlying information. <i>See United States v.

Irwin summarized in detail virtually all of the information available to him, including the investigation of the crime, the failed searches, the conversation between Officer Murphy and Erica Murphy and Santina Luca, and the substance of the anonymous tip. <i>See United States v.

Also, before presenting the affidavit to the magistrate for approval, Irwin sought a legal opinion from Assistant District Attorney Bender that probable cause existed to search the hotel room. <i>See United States v. Tuter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160815\"><a href=\"/opinion/160815/united-states-v-tuter/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span></a></span>, 1299-1300 (8th Cir.2001) (suggesting that contacting attorney for advice on the existence of probable cause before seeking warrant evidences good faith).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record shows that Irwin did not intentionally or recklessly mislead the magistrate by filing a false affidavit, and that he presented sufficient information for an objective officer to believe that there was probable cause to search Capozzi's hotel room.

Accordingly, we hold that the Hobbs Act's \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce standard was constitutionally applied to Capozzi's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence to Sustain the Hobbs Act Conviction.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Capozzi challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the Hobbs Act conviction. He asserts that the government failed to meet its burden of establishing a nexus between his conduct and interstate commerce. Specifically, he asserts that his violent demand for reimbursement from Gardner Park did not have even a \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's determination that the evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury. <i>See United States v. Otero-Mendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775757\"><a href=\"/opinion/775757/united-states-v-jose-a-otero-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 50-51 (1st Cir.2001). In doing so, we examine \"all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Beckett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200355\"><a href=\"/opinion/200355/united-states-v-beckett/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2003). The evidence adduced at trial showed that Gardner Park was a business that bought cars from out-of-state. Capozzi, unhappy with the truck that he had purchased from Gardner Park, threatened violence in an attempt to extort McGrath, the owner of Gardner Park, to reimburse him $4,000 for the truck. On these facts, the jury reasonably could have concluded that if the extortion had been successful, Gardner Park's assets would have been depleted by $4,000, at least until it could have resold Capozzi's truck to another customer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One common method for the government to establish the required \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce is to show that the defendant's activity \"minimally depletes the assets of an entity doing business in interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772789\"><a href=\"/opinion/772789/united-states-v-kieu-minh-nguyen/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2001). To establish a Hobbs Act violation, the government need not show an actual deprivation of assets, but only that a deprivation of the victim's assets would have occurred had the defendant succeeded in the extortion. <i>See United States v. Kattar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502254\"><a href=\"/opinion/502254/united-states-v-george-t-kattar/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Attempted extortion is also proscribed by [the Hobbs Act] so that it is not material ... whether the property was in fact obtained by the defendant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, if Capozzi had successfully extorted McGrath into giving him $4,000 in exchange for the return of the truck, Gardner Park would have been at least temporarily deprived of the use of the money that Capozzi initially paid for the truck. Such a temporary deprivation of the assets of a company engaged in interstate commerce satisfies the \"<i>de minimis</i> effect\" on interstate commerce element required for a successful Hobbs Act prosecution. <i>See United States v. Stillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697706\"><a href=\"/opinion/697706/united-states-v-adam-stillo-sr-and-joseph-t-stillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 559 (7th Cir.1995) (\"the temporary depletion of ... assets until repayment and the risk of non-payment would be sufficient to satisfy the <i>de minimis</i> interstate commerce requirement\"); <i>see also United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (1971), in which it rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to a statute similar to the Hobbs Act. <i>Id.</i> at 561-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>. This statute survived Commerce Clause scrutiny because it contained a jurisdictional element \"which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 562, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As discussed above, the Hobbs Act contains the same sort of limitation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The same rationale distinguishes<i>Morrison,</i> the other case on which Capozzi relies. In <i>Morrison,</i> the Court invalidated the civil cause of action established by the Violence Against Women Act on Commerce Clause grounds. 529 U.S. at 607-619, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1740</span></a></span>. The Court invalidated the statute because it determined that Congress did not have the power to regulate \"non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 617, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
