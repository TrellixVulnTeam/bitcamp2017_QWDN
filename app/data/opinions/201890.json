Richard Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          John H. Cunha, Jr., with whom Charles Allan Hope was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n          John T. McNeil, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           October 28, 2005\n\f                   STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge. Fredrico Tavares was\n\nconvicted in 2002 on one count of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm.   He now appeals the district court’s admission into\n\nevidence of certain tape-recorded conversations he had with a\n\nconfidential government informant. He also challenges the district\n\ncourt’s application of a four-point increase to his offense level\n\nunder the section of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines allowing\n\nsuch an increase for a defendant who possessed a firearm with\n\n“reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection\n\nwith another felony offense.”        U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(5).         Finally,\n\nTavares seeks resentencing in light of the Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), that the Federal\n\nSentencing Guidelines ranges are advisory rather than mandatory.\n\nWe affirm both Tavares’ conviction and his sentence.\n\nI. Background\n\n                   Tavares     was   convicted   in   the   United    States\n\nDistrict   Court   for   the    District   of    Massachusetts   after     a\n\nconfidential informant arranged the sale of an assault rifle from\n\nTavares to an undercover agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,\n\nTobacco, and Firearms (“ATF”).       The sale of the rifle occurred on\n\nApril 27, 2001, but the informant, Neil Baptiste, who was himself\n\na convict, had, at the behest of the ATF agent, been attempting to\n\narrange a gun sale with Tavares since January of that year.               In\n\nJanuary, Baptiste called Tavares several times, indicating that he\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fwished to acquire a firearm and asking about setting up a sale.\n\nFour of the January telephone conversations between Baptiste and\n\nTavares were recorded and, over objection, the recordings were\n\nadmitted into evidence at the trial.\n\n                    The jury convicted Tavares.          At his sentencing\n\nhearing, the court found that Tavares had reason to believe that\n\nthe weapon he sold to the undercover ATF agent would be used in\n\nconnection   with   a   subsequent   felony.       The   court   accordingly\n\nenhanced   Tavares’     offense   level    by   four   points,   yielding   a\n\nsentencing range under the Guidelines of 97¯120 months. In seeking\n\nmitigation of his potential sentence, Tavares spoke about his\n\nailing parents and described how he had supported himself through\n\ncollege and had never belonged to a gang. Responding, the district\n\njudge stated,\n\n           My inclination was to sentence to the maximum,\n           120 months. I am going to give, on the basis\n           of what Mr. Tavares said, some benefit and\n           respect for his statement that he is ready to\n           change his life. There is not much I can do,\n           but I will impose a sentence at the mid-point\n           of that range rather than the maximum.\n\nThe judge then imposed a sentence of 108 months in prison.          Tavares\n\nappealed his conviction and sentence.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n                    Before us on appeal are three issues: (1) whether\n\nthe district court improperly admitted the evidence of the January\n\ntelephone conversations, (2) whether the district judge erred in\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fenhancing Tavares’ offense level, and (3) whether Tavares is\n\nentitled to a remand for resentencing under Booker.    We consider\n\neach issue in turn.\n\nA. The January Conversations\n\n                   Tavares contends that the district court should\n\nhave excluded the taped January conversations under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 404(b), which deems evidence of a defendant’s past\n\nacts inadmissible to prove the defendant acted in conformity with\n\na certain character trait in the charged case.   See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n404(b).   We review a district court’s decision to admit disputed\n\nevidence for abuse of discretion.     See United States v. Flemmi,\n\n402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                   Although Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of past-\n\nacts evidence for propensity purposes, it does permit a party to\n\nintroduce such evidence for “other purposes”; commonly cited\n\nacceptable purposes include proof of knowledge, intent, motive,\n\nand opportunity.      Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).   Here, the government\n\nargues that it introduced the January telephone conversations to\n\nshow Tavares’ knowledge about illicit firearms dealing and intent\n\nto conduct an illicit gun deal, rather than to show propensity.\n\nTavares counters that because the January conversations concerned\n\na potential sale of a gun to Baptiste, whereas the actual sale\n\nsome months later was made to the ATF agent (with Baptiste acting\n\nas go-between), it is improper to impute Tavares’ mental state on\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fthe earlier occasion to the later, consummated transaction.                         This\n\ncharacterization, however, ignores that the January conversations\n\ntend to establish that Tavares knew how to conduct a weapons sale\n\nand   expressed     willingness     to    do   so,    which       are    relevant    and\n\npermissible factors regardless of the identity of the purchaser.\n\n                     The district court’s conclusion that the January\n\nconversations served the permissible purposes of proving knowledge\n\nand intent was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nB. The Increased Offense Level\n\n                     Tavares     next    claims      the    trial       court   wrongly\n\nconcluded that he had reason to believe the assault rifle he sold\n\nto    the   undercover     ATF   agent    would   be       used    or    possessed    in\n\nconnection with another felony.                We review a district court’s\n\nfactual determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines for clear\n\nerror.      United States v. Nunez, 146 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                     In making its determination, the district court\n\nrelied      on   factors   including     the    nature      of    the     weapon,    the\n\nclandestine nature of the sale, and the fact that the sale price\n\nof $1800 was more than six times the market value of the weapon.\n\nThe court also considered the statements Baptiste made to Tavares\n\nin January1 that he wanted to acquire a gun in order to deal with\n\n\n      1\n      As noted earlier, Baptiste was not the actual purchaser of\nthe gun in April, but he orchestrated the sale and acted as\nintermediary. Thus, the motives he expressed to Tavares in the\nJanuary negotiations contributed to Tavares’ overall expectations\nabout how the gun would be used.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fvarious people with whom he “got beef” and that he was “ready to\n\nshoot” those people.      Taken together, these factors provide ample\n\nsupport for the district court’s conclusion.            There was no clear\n\nerror.\n\nC. Applicability of Booker\n\n                     Because Tavares did not raise any objection to his\n\nsentence below, his Booker claim is not preserved and he bears the\n\nburden of showing plain error.         United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).             In this context, a defendant\n\nmust show a “reasonable probability” that the trial judge would\n\nhave sentenced differently under an advisory guidelines regime.\n\nId. at 79.     Although “we are not inclined to be overly demanding\n\nas to proof of probability,” the burden remains on the defendant\n\nto demonstrate a “reasonable indication that the district judge\n\nmight well have reached a different result” had the mandatory\n\nsystem not been in place.          United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d\n\n220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                     Tavares    emphasizes    the   statement   made    by   the\n\ndistrict     judge   at   the    sentencing    in   response    to     Tavares’\n\ndescription of his mitigating family and personal circumstances.\n\nIndicating a desire to credit Tavares’ personal statement, the\n\njudge stated, “There is not much I can do, but I will impose a\n\nsentence at the mid-point of [the Guidelines] range” instead of\n\nthe maximum the judge had initially intended to impose.                      This\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fstatement is ambiguous: it could be a simple recognition of the\n\nconstraints the Guidelines then imposed, or it could indicate the\n\njudge’s view of Tavares’ criminal history.    Either way, we do not\n\ninterpret this statement as indicating a likely different result\n\nunder advisory Guidelines, especially since no other statement\n\nmade at the sentencing hearing supports Tavares’ position.\n\n                In addition, Tavares received a mid-range sentence\n\n(108 months from a range of 97-120 months).   This court treats the\n\nfact that a defendant was given a middle-of-the-range sentence as\n\none factor, but not the deciding factor, in analyzing whether the\n\nAntonakopoulos standard is met.      See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nMercado, 402 F.3d 294, 304 (1st Cir. 2005) (“When, under a\n\nmandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to\n\nsentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the\n\nrange, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting\n\nunder an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have\n\nimposed the same sentence.”). Here, the mid-range sentence is not\n\npaired with any persuasive evidence indicating the court might\n\nhave sentenced differently under an advisory regime.     See United\n\nStates v. Baskin, __ F.3d __, __ (1st Cir. 2005) (denying Booker\n\nremand where defendant was allowed to present mitigating evidence\n\nat sentencing hearing, judge imposed mid-range sentence, and\n\nnothing else in the record indicated a different outcome would be\n\nlikely under advisory Guidelines).\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fIII. Conclusion\n\n                  The conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Indicating a desire to credit Tavares' personal statement, the judge stated, \"There is not much I can do, but I will impose a sentence at the mid-point of [the Guidelines] range\" instead of the maximum the judge had initially intended to impose.

He also challenges the district court's application of a four-point increase to his offense level under the section of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines allowing such an increase for a defendant who possessed a firearm with \"reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). Finally, Tavares seeks resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines ranges are advisory rather than mandatory. We affirm both Tavares' conviction and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts after a confidential informant arranged the sale of an assault rifle from Tavares to an undercover agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\"). The sale of the rifle occurred on April 27, 2001, but the informant, Neil Baptiste, who was himself a convict, had, at the behest of the ATF agent, been attempting to arrange a gun sale with Tavares since January of that year. In January, Baptiste called Tavares several times, indicating that he wished to acquire a firearm and asking about setting up a sale. Four of the January telephone conversations between Baptiste and Tavares were recorded and, over objection, the recordings were admitted into evidence at the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Tavares. At his sentencing hearing, the court found that Tavares had reason to believe that the weapon he sold to the undercover ATF agent would be used in connection with a subsequent felony. The court accordingly enhanced Tavares' offense level by four points, yielding a sentencing range under the Guidelines of 97-120 months. In seeking mitigation of his potential sentence, Tavares spoke about his ailing parents and described how he had supported himself through college and had never belonged to a gang. Responding, the district judge stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My inclination was to sentence to the maximum, 120 months. I am going to give, on the basis of what Mr. Tavares said, some benefit and respect for his statement that he is ready to change his life. There is not much I can do, but I will impose a sentence at the mid-point of that range rather than the maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then imposed a sentence of 108 months in prison. Tavares appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us on appeal are three issues: (1) whether the district court improperly admitted the evidence of the January telephone conversations, (2) whether the district judge erred in enhancing Tavares' offense level, and (3) whether Tavares is entitled to a remand for resentencing under <i>Booker.</i> We consider each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The January Conversations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares contends that the district court should have excluded the taped January conversations under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), which deems evidence of a defendant's past acts inadmissible to prove the defendant acted in conformity with a certain character trait in the charged case. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We review a district court's decision to admit disputed evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of past-acts evidence for propensity purposes, it does permit a party to introduce such evidence for \"other purposes\"; commonly cited acceptable purposes include proof of knowledge, intent, motive, and opportunity. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Here, the government argues that it introduced the January telephone conversations to show Tavares' knowledge about illicit firearms dealing and intent to conduct an illicit gun deal, rather than to show propensity. Tavares counters that because the January conversations concerned a potential sale of a gun to Baptiste, whereas the actual sale some months later was made to the ATF agent (with Baptiste acting as go-between), it is improper to impute Tavares' mental state on the earlier occasion to the later, consummated transaction. This characterization, however, ignores that the January conversations tend to establish that Tavares knew how to conduct a weapons sale and expressed willingness to do so, which are relevant and permissible factors regardless of the identity of the purchaser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that the January conversations served the permissible purposes of proving knowledge and intent was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Increased Offense Level</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares next claims the trial court wrongly concluded that he had reason to believe the assault rifle he sold to the undercover ATF agent would be used or possessed in connection with another felony. We review a district court's factual determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines for clear error. <i>United States v. Nunez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198028\"><a href=\"/opinion/198028/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its determination, the district court relied on factors including the nature of the weapon, the clandestine nature of the sale, and the fact that the sale price of $1800 was more than six times the market value of the weapon. The court also considered the statements Baptiste made to Tavares in January<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that he wanted to acquire a gun in order to deal with various people with whom he \"got beef\" and that he was \"ready to shoot\" those people. Taken together, these factors provide ample support for the district court's conclusion. There was no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Applicability of <i>Booker</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Tavares did not raise any objection to his sentence below, his <i>Booker</i> claim is not preserved and he bears the burden of showing plain error. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2005). In this context, a defendant must show a \"reasonable probability\" that the trial judge would have sentenced differently under an advisory guidelines regime. <i>Id.</i> at 79. Although \"we are not inclined to be overly demanding as to proof of probability,\" the burden remains on the defendant to demonstrate a \"reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result\" had the mandatory system not been in place. <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares emphasizes the statement made by the district judge at the sentencing in response to Tavares' description of his mitigating family and personal circumstances. Indicating a desire to credit Tavares' personal statement, the judge stated, \"There is not much I can do, but I will impose a sentence at the mid-point of [the Guidelines] range\" instead of the maximum the judge had initially intended to impose. This statement is ambiguous: it could be a simple recognition of the constraints the Guidelines then imposed, or it could indicate the judge's view of Tavares' criminal history. Either way, we do not interpret this statement as indicating a likely different result under advisory Guidelines, especially since no other statement made at the sentencing hearing supports Tavares' position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Tavares received a mid-range sentence (108 months from a range of 97-120 months). This court treats the fact that a defendant was given a middle-of-the-range sentence as one factor, but not the deciding factor, in analyzing whether the <i>Antonakopoulos</i> standard is met. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201515\"><a href=\"/opinion/201515/united-states-v-gonzalez-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 304 (1st Cir.2005) (\"When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence.\"). Here, the mid-range sentence is not paired with any persuasive evidence indicating the court might have sentenced differently under an advisory regime. <i>See United States v. Baskin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201804\"><a href=\"/opinion/201804/united-states-v-baskin/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005) (denying <i>Booker</i> remand where defendant was allowed to present mitigating evidence at sentencing hearing, judge imposed mid-range sentence, and nothing else in the record indicated a different outcome would be likely under advisory Guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As noted earlier, Baptiste was not the actual purchaser of the gun in April, but he orchestrated the sale and acted as intermediary. Thus, the motives he expressed to Tavares in the January negotiations contributed to Tavares' overall expectations about how the gun would be used</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
