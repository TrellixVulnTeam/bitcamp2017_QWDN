This case requires us to apply the\n\npleading standards for private securities fraud litigation under\n\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), 15\n\nU.S.C. § 78u-4(b) (2000), and raises several issues of first\n\nimpression for this court.     The district court, acting under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissed the complaint.       We differ with the\n\ndistrict court concerning certain tests to be applied in assessing\n\nsecurities fraud claims and in construction of our precedent.          We\n\nconclude that the complaint as a whole complies with the PSLRA in\n\nsufficient part, and we reverse the dismissal and remand the case\n\nfor   further   proceedings,   with   the   exception   that   we   affirm\n\ndismissal of one of the two claims against defendant Christopher J.\n\nOliver.   Our ruling does not mean that plaintiffs' claims have any\n\nmerit.    It means only that the claims are not to be dismissed at\n\nthis very early stage.    Nothing has been proven yet.\n\n           Charles Mesko and other investors filed a class action\n\nsuit against Cabletron Systems, Inc. and seven individuals who\n\nserved as executives or directors of Cabletron.1          Mesko alleged\n\n\n      1\n          We will refer to the plaintiffs collectively as \"Mesko.\"\nThe individual defendants, along with the offices they held during\nthe relevant period, are: S. Robert Levine, who served as\npresident, chief executive officer, and a member of the board of\ndirectors until his retirement on or about August 6, 1997, in the\nmiddle of the class period; Craig Benson, the chairman of the board\nof directors, chief operating officer, and treasurer; David J.\nKirkpatrick, the director of finance and chief financial officer;\nChristopher   J.   Oliver,   the  director   of   engineering   and\nmanufacturing; and three members of the board of directors who were\nnot officers of Cabletron: Paul R. Duncan, Donald F. McGuinness,\n\n                                  -3-\n\fviolations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange\n\nAct   of   1934,   15   U.S.C.     §§   78j(b),   78t(a),   and    Rule   10b-5\n\npromulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 17\n\nC.F.R. § 240.10b-5 (2002).         Plaintiffs purchased Cabletron stock,\n\nor bought call options or sold put options for Cabletron stock,\n\nbetween March 3, 1997 and December 2, 1997 (the \"class period\").\n\nThe first consolidated amended complaint was rejected for failing\n\nto meet the standards of the PSLRA, but Mesko was granted leave to\n\namend it.     He did, and the district court then ruled that this\n\nsecond consolidated amended complaint (the \"complaint\") satisfied\n\nthe requirements of the PSLRA.            After the judge who issued this\n\nruling died, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.\n\n             Contrary   to   the    first     district   judge's   ruling,    a\n\nsuccessor district judge granted defendants' motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint.    This dismissal occurred before discovery was conducted\n\nor any class was certified.             The district court held that the\n\ncomplaint fails the particularity test for pleading fraud, that it\n\nfails to allege facts supporting a belief that the misstatements\n\nwere material, and that the pleadings do not raise a strong\n\ninference of scienter.       We disagree on all three points.\n\n             As to the particularity ruling, it is unclear if the\n\ndistrict court held that any pleading based upon confidential\n\nsources would fail the PSLRA's pleading requirements, thus adopting\n\n\nand Michael D. Myerow.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe rule from a case it cited, In re Silicon Graphics Securities\n\nLitigation, 970 F. Supp. 746, 763-64 (N.D. Cal. 1997), aff'd, 183\n\nF.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir. 1999).   Alternatively, the court may have\n\nutilized a rule that allows confidential sources if there are other\n\nspecific facts alleged, but then determined that this complaint\n\nlacked such facts.   We reject the Silicon Graphics per se test\n\nforbidding PSLRA pleadings based on confidential sources, and\n\ninstead adopt a test similar to the Second Circuit's test in Novak\n\nv. Kasaks, 216 F.3d 300, 314 (2nd Cir. 2000).   Applying that test,\n\nwe find there was sufficient detail in the allegations, including\n\nthose made by confidential sources, to permit the complaint to go\n\nforward.   We also hold, contrary to the district court, that the\n\ncomplaint provides adequate information concerning internal company\n\ndocuments on which it relies.\n\n           As to materially misleading statements, the district\n\ncourt erred in the overly restrictive test it applied to statements\n\nmade by third parties -- in this instance mostly market analysts --\n\nwhich were in turn based on statements made by company officials.\n\nWe reject the district court's determination that the defendants\n\nmust have either \"controlled\" the content of the third party\n\nstatements or adopted them. Instead we join the majority of courts\n\nin applying the \"entanglement\" test first articulated in Elkind v.\n\nLiggett & Myers, Inc., 635 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir. 1980).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          As to both materiality and scienter, we conclude that the\n\npertinent portions of the complaint sufficiently meet pleading\n\nrequirements at this stage of the case.\n\n          While some of the allegations are stronger than others,\n\nand those against the defendant outside directors present a close\n\ncall, we conclude that the complaint as a whole states a claim\n\nagainst Cabletron    and   against    all   but   one    of   the   individual\n\ndefendants.    As   to   that   defendant,    Oliver,     the     director   of\n\nengineering and manufacturing, we affirm dismissal of the section\n\n10(b) claim against him but not dismissal of the section 20(a)\n\nclaim. We reverse the remainder of the district court decision and\n\nremand.\n\n          In addition to appealing the dismissal of the complaint,\n\nMesko asks this court to remand the case to a district judge who\n\nhad   previously    recused     himself,     on    the    basis     that     his\n\ndisqualification was improper.        We deny this request.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          Mesko filed his original complaint in the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the District of New Hampshire, where the case was\n\nassigned to the late Judge Shane Devine.          On December 23, 1998, in\n\nresponse to defendants' motion to dismiss, Judge Devine ruled that\n\nMesko's first consolidated amended complaint lacked enough detail\n\nconcerning statements made \"on information and belief\" to survive\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fheightened pleading standards under the PSLRA, but granted Mesko\n\nleave to amend.\n\n           Mesko amended the complaint by adding sources for the\n\nallegations pled, particularly \"more than a half dozen former\n\nCabletron employees who worked at the Company during the Class\n\nPeriod.\"   Judge Devine accepted these changes in a one-page order\n\non February 4, 1999, writing, \"The court has reviewed the complaint\n\nand is satisfied that it meets the PSLRA's requirements relative to\n\npleadings based on information and belief.\"     His order invited\n\ndefendants to either renew their motion to dismiss or file an\n\nanswer.2   Shortly after Judge Devine passed away on February 22,\n\n1999, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Mesko suggests that this ruling by Judge Devine\nforeclosed later consideration in the district court of the\ndefendants' subsequently renewed motion to dismiss, under the\n\"law of the case\" doctrine. That is incorrect. The law of\nthe case is a discretionary doctrine, especially as applied to\ninterlocutory orders such as this one.      See Perez-Ruiz v.\nCrespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Interlocutory\norders, including denials of motions to dismiss, remain open\nto trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute the law\nof the case.\").      As Justice Holmes expressed it, \"[T]he\nphrase, law of the case, as applied to the effect of previous\norders on the later action of the court rendering them in the\nsame case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally\nto refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to\ntheir power.\"     Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444\n(1912).     Reconsideration   is   also  appropriate   because\ndefendants filed a motion to strike the complaint hours before\nJudge Devine issued his sua sponte order, so that he did not\nhave their arguments before him.\n\n                               -7-\n\f           The case was then reassigned several times as the result\n\nof recusals.   First it went before Judge Joseph A. DiClerico Jr.,\n\nwho recused himself from the case because he owned stock in\n\ncompanies that were defendants in other securities class actions\n\nbrought by plaintiffs' counsel or their firms.   One of defendants'\n\nattorneys was on the recusal lists of the two other federal\n\ndistrict judges in the District of New Hampshire.   Therefore, the\n\ncase was transferred to the District of Rhode Island for assignment\n\nto a judge there, sitting by designation in the District of New\n\nHampshire, which retained jurisdiction. The case was then assigned\n\nto Chief Judge Ernest C. Torres, but, like Judge DiClerico, he\n\nowned stock in several corporations against which counsel in this\n\ncase had brought securities litigation, and he too disqualified\n\nhimself.   The case was finally reassigned once more, to Judge Mary\n\nM. Lisi.   Neither party objected to any of these recusals at the\n\ntime they occurred.3\n\n           Judge Lisi heard oral argument on the defendants' motion\n\nto dismiss on November 7, 2000.    During oral argument, she asked\n\nMesko to provide a list of those paragraphs in the complaint that\n\nare based on information and belief.   Mesko did so on November 13,\n\n     3\n          Before his decision to recuse himself, Judge DiClerico\nfirst ordered counsel to supply lists identifying all federal and\nstate securities class action suits in which their firms appeared.\nAt that point, Mesko did file a motion seeking a status conference\nand asking that these lists be submitted in camera or under seal.\nOnce this motion was denied, Mesko's attorneys produced the lists\nwithout further objection to the recusals until this appeal.\n\n                                -8-\n\findicating that four of the 126 paragraphs are based on information\n\nand belief; he attributed most of the others to either a document\n\nor a witness who had spoken to counsel.4   On May 23, 2001, Judge\n\nLisi granted the motion to dismiss, determining that the complaint\n\nfailed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Where the dismissal is grounded in Rule 12(b)(6), the\n\nfacts pled in the complaint are taken in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiff.   See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72,\n\n75 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Doe v. Walker, 193 F.3d 42, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)) (applying standard in PSLRA case). We describe the facts in\n\nthe complaint.\n\n          Cabletron, now renamed, was a publicly-traded corporation\n\nregistered in Delaware with its principal place of business in New\n\nHampshire.5   In 1997, at the beginning of      the class period,\n\nCabletron was among the nation's leading manufacturers and vendors\n\n\n\n     4\n          The district court seems to have used inconsistent\ndefinitions of \"information and belief.\" The court first said at\noral argument that, if the confidential sources based their\nallegations on personal knowledge, then their statements were not\nmade \"on information and belief.\" Its written opinion later seemed\nto reverse this position and interpret information and belief\nclaims as any made without plaintiffs' direct personal knowledge.\nMesko's submission rested on the first of these definitions.\n     5\n          Cabletron reorganized itself after the events at issue in\nthis litigation; Cabletron's core business is now carried on under\na new corporate name, Enterasys Networks, Inc.\n\n                               -9-\n\fof equipment for large enterprise computer networks, such as local\n\narea network and wide area network switches, as well as related\n\nhardware,      software,   and    consulting   services.      Its    customers\n\nincluded    sizable     corporations,       universities,    and     government\n\nentities. For the quarter ending on February 28, 1997, immediately\n\nbefore   the    class   period,    Cabletron    reported    strong    financial\n\nperformance, including a twenty-six percent increase in net sales.\n\nIn a company press release, S. Robert Levine, the president and\n\nchief executive officer, said these results represented Cabletron's\n\n\"thirty-second quarter of consecutive record growth, the strongest\n\nand steadiest earnings growth rate among all S&P 500 companies.\"\n\n            These impressive numbers did not last.          After the market\n\nclosed on June 2, 1997, Cabletron announced that its earnings for\n\nthe March-May 1997 quarter were less than those in the prior\n\nquarter.    The earnings, at $0.37 per share, were also well below\n\nstock analysts' previous expectations of about $0.49 per share.\n\nWhen the market opened the following day, June 3, the price of\n\nCabletron common stock fell from $45.75 to $30.35 per share.               This\n\nwas a one-day decline of approximately one-third of its value.\n\nReported results for the June-August quarter were in line with\n\nexpectations.     However, on December 2, Cabletron reported earnings\n\nof $0.08 to $0.12 per share for the September-November quarter,\n\nagain falling short of expectations.            In the same announcement,\n\nCabletron declared that it would take a charge against earnings of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fbetween $25 million and $30 million.         Investors responded with\n\nanother one-day sell-off on December 2, when the price per share\n\nfell from $23.1875 to $15.6875 in heavy trading.           Over the class\n\nperiod as a whole, the price of Cabletron stock declined from a per\n\nshare high of $46.50 to $15.6875, a total drop of almost 67\n\npercent.\n\n           Mesko filed this lawsuit soon thereafter.        The complaint\n\nalleges that a variety of problems, well known to the leadership of\n\nthe company, seriously threatened Cabletron's business at the time\n\nof the class period.       Again, for the purposes of the motion to\n\ndismiss, we assume the allegations to be true.             The company's\n\nballyhooed new products, the SmartSwitch 6000 and SmartSwitch 2200,\n\nencountered    two   serious   problems   that   greatly    slowed    their\n\nmanufacture.   The resulting delay in their commercial availability\n\nwas a blow to a company relying on the SmartSwitch to fuel\n\ncontinued growth.    The European sales force, which had contributed\n\nabout twenty percent of revenues in the fiscal year that ended just\n\nbefore the class period, was being run by inexperienced managers\n\nwho were in over their heads and unable to meet their goals.\n\nCabletron's    pricing    became   grossly   out   of   line   with     its\n\ncompetitors. The company knowingly shipped products that still had\n\nunresolved defects.      Market saturation, increased selling cycles,\n\nand the cancellation of Cabletron's cooperative relationship with\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fits dominant market rival, Cisco Systems, also contributed to these\n\nwoes.\n\n            In the face of these \"adverse factors,\" the complaint\n\nalleges,    the    company's       public      statements    were    unremittingly\n\noptimistic, especially concerning its European operations and the\n\nSmartSwitch.       Even when the company announced the surprising bad\n\nnews about its quarterly earnings on June 2, management maintained\n\nits unjustifiable bright optimism and disclosed only part of the\n\ntroubles facing       Cabletron.         The    failure     to   disclose    and   the\n\npositive    statements       in    the   face    of   contrary      knowledge      were\n\nthemselves securities law violations, the complaint alleges.\n\n            Even worse, Mesko alleges, the defendants tried to hide\n\nthis    downward    spiral    by    fraudulently      inflating      the    company's\n\nquarterly net revenue with a number of techniques, some blatant and\n\nsome more subtle.        These included booking entirely fictitious\n\nsales; making shipments late in one quarter, which had the effect\n\nof bumping up that quarter's revenue, while knowing that the goods\n\nwould be returned during the next quarter; and setting aside newly\n\nreceived raw materials and booking them in a later quarter so that\n\nthey would not appear as liabilities in the quarter when they\n\nactually arrived.        The complaint supports these allegations by\n\nreference to one or more of a half dozen anonymous former Cabletron\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\femployees who say they have personal knowledge of the practices\n\nthey describe.6\n\n          As a result of this frantic end-of-quarter fraud, the\n\ncomplaint alleges, thirty percent of shipments in the last weeks of\n\na quarter were returned early in the following quarter, compared to\n\na typical return rate of one to three percent at other times.   In\n\nturn, the receiving department was \"probably the busiest department\n\nin the Company\" in the early days of a quarter, as employees logged\n\nnumerous pallets of computer equipment, with total values between\n\n$160,000 and $1.2 million, back into the warehouse as returned\n\nmerchandise.   It is a reasonable inference that the timing of this\n\ndisproportionate surge in returns was no coincidence, but was\n\ncaused by attempts to inflate revenue in one quarter, albeit at the\n\nexpense of the next one.\n\n          The complaint states that improperly recognized revenue\n\nfrom the different schemes totaled tens of millions of dollars\n\nduring each of the fiscal quarters at issue.       It derives this\n\nfigure from estimates of two of its former employee sources, one\n\nwho estimates that Cabletron improperly recognized revenue of\n\nbetween $20 million and $30 million per quarter, and another who\n\n\n\n     6\n          The complaint repeatedly refers to its anonymous sources\nas \"former employees with personal knowledge of the relevant facts\"\nor some similar phrase. In the interest of simplicity, we will use\nless wordy formulations, while recognizing that the complaint does\nreiterate the personal basis for its anonymous sources' knowledge\neach time.\n\n                               -13-\n\festimates that the company processed as much as $100 million in\n\n\"phony\" orders during the quarter that ended just before the class\n\nperiod.   The falsely inflated earnings figures that resulted from\n\nthese improper practices were then used in Cabletron's filings with\n\nthe SEC during the class period and in company press releases\n\nannouncing quarterly results.\n\n              The picture that emerges from the pleading as a whole\n\nportrays a frenzied effort by a troubled company to conceal its\n\ndifficulties for as long as possible.            Mesko's complaint suggests\n\nas scienter for this fraud that defendants wanted to keep the house\n\nof cards standing (perhaps expecting salvation from the SmartSwitch\n\nor other developments).      The complaint also offers allegations of\n\nsignificant stock sales by corporate insiders taking their profits\n\nbefore the worst of the news was out.\n\n              It is not difficult to conclude that such practices, if\n\nthey   went    on,   certainly   add   up   to    fraudulent   and    material\n\nmisstatement.        The question at this stage is not whether the\n\npractices occurred -- defendants deny them and actual proof, not\n\njust allegations in a complaint, would be required before any\n\nconclusion about that question could be reached -- but whether the\n\npleadings      accusing   defendants   of    these    practices      meet   the\n\nrequirements of the PSLRA.         Our holding that the complaint is\n\nsufficient returns the case to the district court, which ultimately\n\nwill resolve the broader issues of culpability.\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f             We elaborate on several categories of Mesko's allegations\n\nhere, without reciting every claim in the 79-page complaint; we\n\nwill add some details later when they become relevant to our\n\nanalysis.\n\nA.     Fictitious Sales\n\n             The most egregious examples of fraud alleged in the\n\ncomplaint accuse Cabletron of booking entirely fictitious sales.\n\nEach    of   these    allegations      is   supported    by    reference   to   the\n\nanonymous former employees.\n\n             According to the complaint, the company wrote purchase\n\norders for nonexistent sales of merchandise late in one quarter,\n\nand then logged the merchandise back in as if it had been returned\n\nafter the next quarter began, when in fact the merchandise had\n\nnever left the company's possession.              These supposedly-sold items\n\nwere held in various locations before being returned to inventory.\n\nSome were loaded onto as many as eight tractor-trailers that\n\nremained in the factory yard.                  Some were stored at selected\n\nemployees' homes; the complaint provides the name and address of\n\none employee who allegedly accepted such goods \"at the behest of\"\n\ndefendant     Craig    Benson,   the    chairman    of   the    board   and   chief\n\noperating officer.        Some simply \"sat on the shelves or lay in the\n\ncorridors\" of Cabletron's warehouse until after the quarter ended.\n\nThis scheme allegedly extended, at the close of one quarter, to\n\nremoving equipment from employees' desks and unfinished product\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\ffrom the company's labs, running it through this sold-and-returned\n\nroutine, and then, after the quarter had ended, returning the same\n\nequipment -- with identical serial numbers -- to the offices and\n\nlabs where they had originated.\n\n          Employees had to move this material and to log it back in\n\nwhen it was \"returned.\"   Cabletron used a computer system called\n\n\"Intrepid\" to track orders and returns, and the fictitious sales\n\nand returns were logged into this system.     The broader inference\n\nfrom all of these alleged activities is that, in order to inflate\n\nrevenue, Cabletron used a variety of techniques to create the\n\nappearance of sales where no sales ever occurred.\n\nB.   Inventory Parking and Channel-Stuffing\n\n          Other   merchandise   left   Cabletron's   factories   and\n\nwarehouses but, the complaint alleges, it was still fraudulent for\n\nthe company to count it as sold either because the sales were not\n\nbona fide, or because the customers had an unlimited right of\n\nreturn and those return rights were not disclosed to investors.\n\n          The complaint alleges \"inventory parking\" arrangements\n\nwith certain Cabletron customers, distributors, and resellers.\n\nUnder these arrangements, they agreed to receive shipments of\n\nCabletron products which they had not really ordered and would not\n\nreally buy. One of the former employee sources named two locations\n\nin New Hampshire where inventory was parked: a \"warehouse near\n\nBrock's Lumber in Rochester\" and the grounds of a particular\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fcompany in Somersworth.      The complaint also reports rumors about\n\ninventory parking at other locations, including St. Louis and New\n\nYork City.7\n\n           Cabletron also allegedly engaged in \"channel stuffing,\"\n\nthe   practice   of   inducing   distributors   or   wholesalers    to   buy\n\nCabletron products in excess of their projected needs by promising\n\nthem that the products could be returned \"at any time and for any\n\nreason if they were not sold.\"       This allowed the company to \"dump\n\nexcess inventories of Cabletron products for which there was no\n\npresent demand\" and thereby convert the liability of unsold goods\n\ninto the revenue of supposed sales.         The complaint names five\n\ndistributors who apparently participated in the practice.                 To\n\nsupport the channel stuffing allegation, the complaint cites former\n\nemployees with personal knowledge of Cabletron's sales practices.\n\nC.    Defective and Premature Shipments\n\n           In other instances, Cabletron allegedly inflated revenue\n\ntoward the end of a quarter by making shipments of products sold\n\nwhile knowing that they would not be accepted or would be returned.\n\n           One variation of this theme involved shipping orders in\n\nquarters much earlier than the requested delivery dates.           A former\n\nemployee said the company sent the University of North Carolina a\n\n\n\n      7\n          Mesko identified these less-substantiated rumors to Judge\nLisi among the few allegations made on narrowly-defined information\nand belief, and did not attribute them to the former employees with\npersonal knowledge cited elsewhere in the complaint.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fshipment worth $75 million to $80 million very early on three\n\ndifferent occasions, each one just before the end of a quarter.            A\n\nsecond employee agreed that the company \"regularly\" made such early\n\nshipments.\n\n            Similarly,    according    to   several      former   employees,\n\nCabletron \"regularly\" sold computer equipment late in the quarter\n\nthat    still   had   unresolved   bugs.    Like   the    early   shipments,\n\nCabletron knew that this merchandise would be returned. One former\n\nemployee specified AT&T as a customer that had received such\n\ndefective merchandise on several occasions.\n\nD.     Artificially Reduced Costs\n\n            Cabletron also overstated its net quarterly revenues by\n\nartificially reducing its costs, according to two employees cited\n\nin the complaint.        Raw materials were held in trailers or on\n\nloading docks for weeks after they arrived rather than being booked\n\nin and transferred into storage immediately.          These supplies were\n\nthen moved in and booked as received on the first day of the next\n\nquarter, although they had actually been received during the prior\n\nquarter.     This delay removed the expense of these purchases from\n\nthe quarter when they would otherwise have appeared, thus inflating\n\nnet revenue.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fE.   SmartSwitch Problems\n\n             Most of the \"adverse factors\" noted earlier need little\n\nfurther explanation, but the company's difficulties with its new\n\nSmartSwitch products require some additional context.\n\n             Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch line on March 3, 1997,\n\nthe first day of the class period, with a glowing press release\n\nstating that the products \"set a new standard for price and\n\nperformance.\"      The complaint's quotes from various market analyst\n\nreports make it clear that investors considered the SmartSwitch an\n\nimportant aspect of Cabletron's future growth.\n\n             Unfortunately   for   Cabletron,    SmartSwitch    production\n\nimmediately encountered two serious problems.           First, supplies of\n\ntwo essential components for the SmartSwitch, one provided by\n\nLucent Technologies and the other by LSI Logic, proved unreliable.\n\nSecond, those units the company did manufacture were plagued by\n\nglitches involving their wiring.          These wiring flaws were so\n\nwidespread that the complaint alleges, citing two employees of whom\n\nat   least   one   was   personally   familiar   with    the   facts,   that\n\n\"virtually every SmartSwitch manufactured from April to at least\n\nSeptember 1997 was subject to individualized re-wiring by hand.\"\n\n             The complaint alleges that these problems delayed the\n\navailability of the SmartSwitch during much of the class period,\n\nand that these delays damaged the company.         Information about the\n\nproblems was widely known within the company and was addressed\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fextensively at weekly quality control meetings.                The problems were\n\nalso described in two internal Cabletron databases that were\n\nroutinely     circulated      in    hard    copy   to   managers,   including    to\n\ndefendants Levine, Benson, and Oliver.                   According to a former\n\nemployee alleged to have personal knowledge, Benson directed that\n\nthese reports should not be provided to salespersons \"in order to\n\ninsulate them (and the Company's customers) from knowledge of\n\nproblems relating to SmartSwitches.\"\n\nF.    Insider Stock Sales\n\n              Finally, the complaint points to stock sales by several\n\nof the individual defendants, during and after the class period, as\n\nevidence of scienter. These sales totaled over $180 million during\n\nthe class period.          Almost all of this amount was attributable to\n\nsales by Levine, who stepped down from his positions as president\n\nand chief executive officer and resigned his seat on the board of\n\ndirectors on or about August 6, 1997, midway through the class\n\nperiod.      Between March 26, 1997 and the date of his resignation in\n\nAugust, Levine sold almost three million shares for a total of just\n\nover $89 million.          Levine also sold another 2.7 million shares\n\nbetween September 24 and October 7, 1997, after he had left his\n\nexecutive positions, earning $88.7 million.\n\n              Aside from Levine, the complaint documents smaller stock\n\nsales by four other individual defendants during the class period.\n\nOne   sale    was   made    by     the   chief    financial   officer,   David   J.\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fKirkpatrick, on September 24, 1997; the proceeds were $474,320.\n\nThe remaining sales were made by the three defendants who served as\n\noutside directors on Cabletron's board: Paul R. Duncan, Donald F.\n\nMcGuinness, and Michael D. Myerow.             The sales by these three\n\noutside directors totaled $2.6 million.           Duncan sold almost $1.6\n\nmillion worth of stock on March 28, 1997.               Also on March 28,\n\nMcGuinness sold $66,000 worth of stock; he also sold $152,200 worth\n\nof stock on July 9, 1997.         All the sales Myerow made during the\n\nclass period were after the June disclosures by Cabletron; they\n\nadded up to $796,570.\n\n          The     parties   disagree      about   how   to   calculate   the\n\npercentage of the defendants' stock liquidated during the class\n\nperiod, but Mesko alleges that Levine, McGuinness, and Myerow each\n\nsold approximately one third of their Cabletron holdings, while\n\nKirkpatrick and Duncan each sold over 90 percent of theirs.              The\n\ncomplaint does not document any stock sales during the class period\n\nby either Benson or Oliver, the remaining individual defendants.\n\nIt does note stock sales by Oliver in the four months prior to the\n\nclass period, as well as by Levine, Kirkpatrick, Myerow, and\n\nMcGuinness.\n\n                                       III.\n\n          Under    the   PSLRA,    a    securities   fraud   complaint   must\n\n\"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason\n\nor reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fregarding the statement is made on information and belief, the\n\ncomplaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that\n\nbelief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). Furthermore, in order\n\nto state a claim of securities fraud, the statements alleged to be\n\nmisleading must be misleading to a material degree.                 See Serabian\n\nv. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nFinally,    the     PSLRA   requires      the   complaint    to     state     with\n\nparticularity facts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of\n\nscienter rather than merely a reasonable inference.                 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78u-4(b)(2); Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 196-97\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).      This last requirement alters the usual contours\n\nof a Rule 12(b)(6) ruling because, while a court continues to give\n\nall    reasonable     inferences     to    plaintiffs,      those    inferences\n\nsupporting scienter must be strong ones. Greebel, 194 F.3d at 201.\n\nThe PSLRA did not, however, change significantly this circuit's\n\nprevious underlying substantive standards for adequately pleaded\n\nsecurities fraud, which were already strict.             Id. at 193-94.\n\nA.    Particularity of Fraud Pleadings\n\n           The    district   court     found    the   complaint      lacked   the\n\nparticularity required by the PSLRA in several ways, especially in\n\nits descriptions of confidential sources and its reliance on\n\ninternal company reports.       In addition, defendants argue that the\n\ntotal amount of detail provided in the complaint falls short of\n\nwhat is necessary to satisfy the particularity requirement.\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f          1.        Use of Confidential Sources\n\n          The complaint details numerous statements which were made\n\nto Mesko's counsel by unnamed former Cabletron employees, and which\n\nare said to be based on the personal knowledge of these former\n\nemployees.     Many of its allegations are supported by reference to\n\nthese anonymous statements.\n\n             The parties dispute whether such statements are made \"on\n\ninformation and belief\" and the district court, as noted above,\n\ndefined the concept inconsistently. This inconsistency mirrors the\n\nconflict in the caselaw. Compare ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Group v.\n\nTchuruk, 291 F.3d 336, 351 & n.70 (5th Cir. 2002) (defining\n\n\"information and belief\" in securities fraud pleading as any\n\nallegation made without plaintiffs' personal knowledge), with In re\n\nHoneywell Int'l Sec. Litig., 182 F. Supp. 2d 414, 426 (D.N.J. 2002)\n\n(stating that some allegations made without plaintiffs' personal\n\nknowledge are not made on \"information and belief\").\n\n              The    point   is   pertinent   because   of   the   especially\n\nheightened pleading standards that the PSLRA established for claims\n\nbased on information and belief.         See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1); ABC\n\nArbitrage, 291 F.3d at 350 (\"[F]or allegations made on information\n\nand belief, the plaintiff must . . . state with particularity all\n\nfacts on which that belief is formed, i.e., set forth a factual\n\nbasis   for    such     belief.\").     This   circuit   imposed    a   strict\n\nrequirement on such claims under Rule 9(b) before enactment of the\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fPSLRA.   Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (\"Where allegations of fraud are . . . based only on\n\ninformation and belief, the complaint must set forth the source of\n\nthe information and the reasons for the belief.\").\n\n             Without   deciding    the   more    general   issue   of   whether\n\nconfidential source pleadings in other contexts are made \"on\n\ninformation and belief,\" we hold that in the context of the PSLRA\n\nsuch confidential source allegations must comply with the standard\n\ndescribed below, drawn from the Second Circuit's Novak decision.8\n\nWe further hold that compliance with that standard constitutes\n\ncompliance     with    the     \"information     and   belief\"   particularity\n\nrequirements of section 78u-4(b)(1).\n\n          This court has never interpreted the heightened pleading\n\nrequirement for information and belief, either before the PSLRA or\n\nafter it, as a per se rule that anonymous sources must be named at\n\nthe pleading stage.          The defendants suggest that we adopt such a\n\nper se rule, and cite the Ninth Circuit's decision in Janas v.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          Under this test, some allegations based on anonymous\nsources will not, on their face, be adequate. See ABC Arbitrage,\n291 F.3d at 353-54.    Many securities fraud complaints rely on\nunnamed sources accompanied by only the vaguest detail.       For\nexample, a complaint may include a boilerplate paragraph at its\nbeginning or end stating that its allegations as a whole are\nsupported by investigation of counsel, sometimes including\ninterviews with unnamed sources such as former employees.     See\ngenerally 2 H.S. Bloomenthal, Securities Law Handbook     § 29.10\n(2002 ed.). A general statement that unspecified sources support\nthe complaint's allegations as a whole usually will not suffice.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fMcCracken (In re Silicon Graphics Securities Litigation), 183 F.3d\n\n970, 985 (9th Cir. 1999), as authority for doing so.9\n\n          In Novak, the Second Circuit took a more moderate view of\n\nsection 78u-4(b)(1), rejecting\n\n          any notion that confidential sources must be named as a\n          general matter. In our view, notwithstanding the use of\n          the word \"all,\" [section 78u-4(b)(1)] does not require\n          that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single\n          fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or\n          misleading statements are based. Rather, plaintiffs need\n          only plead with particularity sufficient facts to support\n          those beliefs.\n\n\nNovak, 216 F.3d at 313-14; accord ABC Arbitrage, 291 F.3d at 353;\n\ncf. Fla. State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 270 F.3d\n\n645, 667-68 (8th Cir. 2001) (citing Novak analysis favorably).\n\n          We reject a per se rule such as the Silicon Graphics\n\ntest, and think the two approaches described in Novak are useful\n\nguides for evaluating whether confidential source material meets\n\nthe PSLRA particularity requirement:\n\n          [W]here plaintiffs rely on confidential personal sources\n          but also on other facts, they need not name their sources\n          as long as the latter facts provide an adequate basis for\n          believing that the defendants' statements were false.\n          Moreover, even if personal sources must be identified,\n          there is no requirement that they be named, provided they\n\n\n     9\n          In fact, it is not the Ninth Circuit decision but the\nSilicon Graphics district court opinion, 970 F. Supp. at 763-64,\nthat sets out a strong per se rule. The district court in the\npresent case cites that opinion rather than the Ninth Circuit's, as\ndoes Novak, 216 F.3d at 313. While not entirely clear, the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion can be read as stopping short of endorsing the\ndistrict court's per se rule. See Silicon Graphics, 183 F.3d at\n985.\n\n                                 -25-\n\f             are   described  in   the   complaint   with   sufficient\n             particularity to support the probability that a person in\n             the position occupied by the source would possess the\n             information alleged. In both of these situations, the\n             plaintiffs will have pleaded enough facts to support\n             their belief, even though some arguably relevant facts\n             have been left out.\n\nNovak, 216 F.3d at 314; accord ABC Arbitrage, 291 F.3d at 352-53\n\n(adopting Novak-type test); see also Fitzer v. Sec. Dynamics\n\nTechs., Inc., 119 F. Supp. 2d 12, 21-22 (D. Mass. 2000) (following\n\nNovak test).    The approach we take, similar to Novak, is to look at\n\nall of the facts alleged to see if they \"provide an adequate basis\n\nfor believing that the defendants' statements were false.\"          Novak,\n\n216 F.3d at 314.       This involves an evaluation, inter alia, of the\n\nlevel   of    detail    provided   by   the   confidential   sources,   the\n\ncorroborative nature of the other facts alleged (including from\n\nother sources), the coherence and plausibility of the allegations,\n\nthe number of sources, the reliability of the sources, and similar\n\nindicia.\n\n             This approach, we think, better strikes the balance\n\nCongress intended in the PSLRA.         The statute was designed to erect\n\nbarriers to frivolous strike suits, but not to make meritorious\n\nclaims impossible to bring.        See S. Rep. No. 104-98, at 4 (1995),\n\nreprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 683 (stating that intent of\n\nPSLRA is \"combatting . . . abuses, while maintaining the incentive\n\nfor bringing meritorious actions\"); ABC Arbitrage, 291 F.3d at 354\n\n(noting that PSLRA \"was not enacted to raise the pleading burdens\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f. . . to such a level that facially valid claims, which are not\n\nbrought for nuisance value or as leverage to obtain a favorable or\n\ninflated settlement, must be routinely dismissed\").                A blanket ban\n\non unnamed sources presents obvious policy problems.               Employees or\n\nothers in possession of important information about corporate\n\nmalfeasance may be discouraged from stepping forward if they must\n\nbe identified at the earliest stage of a lawsuit.             See Novak, 216\n\nF.3d at 314.    While we recognize that a case-by-case approach may\n\nprovide less concrete guidance to district courts, the tension\n\ninherent in balancing the two congressional goals cannot be evaded\n\nby adopting an unnecessarily broad per se rule which may prevent\n\npursuit of legitimate cases.\n\n           We also support our conclusion with a helpful analogy\n\nfrom an entirely different field of law: courts' consideration of\n\ngovernment    requests   for      search   warrants   based    on    tips   from\n\nconfidential informants. Courts frequently allow such anonymously-\n\nprovided     information,    if    properly   supported,      to    justify    an\n\notherwise problematic search.        They examine carefully a variety of\n\nfactors before doing so, including the basis offered for the\n\ninformant's     knowledge,     the    existence   of    other       information\n\ncorroborating the informant's allegations, and the amount of self-\n\nverifying detail provided in the allegations themselves.                    E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996).                 None of\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fthese factors is dispositive, and all are weighed in the context of\n\nthe   \"'totality    of    the    circumstances.'\"          United    States      v.\n\nKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Illinois v.\n\nGates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)).                 The overlap between these\n\nconsiderations and those articulated in Novak further reinforces\n\nour view that courts can competently make a careful evaluation of\n\nsecurities fraud pleadings based on anonymous sources, and separate\n\nfrivolous complaints from those with potential merit.\n\n          When these standards are applied to the complaint's\n\nallegations supported by anonymous sources, we find that they\n\nsatisfy the test.        Overall, the accumulated amount of detail the\n\nsources   provide   tends       to    be   self-verifying;       these   are    not\n\nconclusory allegations of fraud, but specific descriptions of the\n\nprecise means through which it occurred, provided by persons said\n\nto have personal knowledge of them.              In addition, the number of\n\ndifferent sources helps the complaint meet the standard.                       Their\n\nconsistent   accounts      reinforce       one   another   and    undermine      any\n\nargument that the complaint relies unduly on the stories of just\n\none or two former employees, possibly disgruntled. Furthermore, as\n\nemployees who were familiar with the activities discussed -- and\n\nthe complaint notes specifically when there are exceptions to this\n\ncharacterization -- the sources have a strong basis of knowledge\n\nfor the claims they make.            Finally, the sources also point to the\n\nstartlingly large number of returns, which they had the experience\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fto judge based on the level of activity in the warehouse and the\n\nnumber of returns employees entered into Intrepid.    This unusual\n\nincrease independently suggests suspicious activity of the kind\n\nthey allege: a tenfold jump in return rates for products shipped\n\nlate in the quarter, with pallets full of as many as forty pieces\n\nof expensive equipment coming back into inventory early in the\n\nfollowing quarter, permits a strong inference that something was at\n\nleast significantly different about sales booked late in the\n\nquarter.\n\n            The level of specific detail about the fictitious sales\n\nis significant. Far from resting on mere assertions, the anonymous\n\nsources describe tractor-trailers in the factory yard, equipment\n\n\"borrowed\" from employees' desks to be fraudulently processed, and\n\nthe unusual activity in the warehouse as products were shuttled\n\nback and forth.    The sources provide the name and address of one\n\nemployee who is said to have stashed goods in the garage of his\n\nhome, and say that Benson told him to do so.    There are multiple\n\nsources for many of the fictitious sales claims.\n\n            There are other categories of allegations with similar\n\ndetail. The principal source for the inventory parking allegations\n\nnames two particular locations where the parking is said to have\n\noccurred.    The complaint names five distributors alleged to have\n\nparticipated in channel stuffing, and the allegations of channel\n\nstuffing rely on two sources with knowledge about sales practices\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fin particular.        As to the premature or defective shipments, the\n\ncomplaint    cites     four   different   employees,   three    with   direct\n\nknowledge.        Between them, they describe the widespread nature of\n\nthe problem and also name specific customers (the University of\n\nNorth Carolina, AT&T) who were affected.        Two employees supply the\n\ninformation that the raw materials were not entered as received\n\nwhen they should have been, and note that they were entered on the\n\nfirst day of the following quarter, underscoring the likelihood\n\nthat the purpose of the delay was inflation of quarterly net\n\nrevenue.\n\n             In sum, the complaint provides enough particular details\n\nto meet the standards of the test we have adopted and justify the\n\nomission of sources' names at the pleading stage.              These details\n\namply supply \"facts on which that belief is formed\" as the PSLRA\n\n(and our precedent) require.\n\n             2.    Internal Company Reporting Systems\n\n            The district court determined that the complaint provided\n\ntoo little detail about internal company documents to which it\n\nreferred.         Presumably, the court had in mind the complaint's\n\nreferences to the Intrepid order-processing system that would\n\nprovide evidence about returns, the quality-control databases that\n\ninformed individual defendants about SmartSwitch problems, or both.\n\n             It is true that merely stating the existence of efficient\n\ninternal reporting systems in a conclusory fashion will not do much\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fto increase the particularity of a securities fraud pleading.              See\n\nShaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1224 n.38 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Here, the complaint does more than that.\n\n           The pleadings about the Intrepid system show that former\n\nemployees had to physically input returns; this is probative of the\n\nbasis that anonymous sources had for recognizing the spike in\n\nreturns early in the quarter.      The quality-control databases serve\n\na more important function, as discussed further below, because they\n\nhelp demonstrate knowledge of SmartSwitch problems on the part of\n\nLevine, Benson, and Oliver.        The complaint also provides more\n\nsubstance about the contents of these systems.              Unlike in Shaw,\n\nwhere we found that a plaintiff failed to provide any \"indication\n\nof the specific factual content of any single report generated by\n\nthe   alleged   reporting   system,\"      id.   (emphasis    removed),     the\n\ncomplaint here says that the two quality control databases (the\n\n\"Product Support Call Tracking Database\" and the \"Phone Support\n\nDatabase\")   reported   customer   service      problems    related   to   the\n\ndefective SmartSwitches. Thus, these databases serve as supporting\n\nevidence of Mesko's allegations.\n\n           3.   Level of Particularity as a Whole\n\n           Defendants argue that, even if the allegations supported\n\nby anonymous sources and internal documents are accepted, the\n\ncomplaint still leaves too many other unanswered questions -- such\n\nas the precise dates of transactions, the names used for phony\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fcustomers, the identities of corporate personnel involved, the\n\nspecific products warehoused, or the exact dollar amounts of\n\nindividual fraudulently recorded sales.              As a result, defendants\n\nargue, the complaint does not satisfy the PSLRA's particularity\n\nrequirements     as    interpreted    in   this   circuit,   particularly    in\n\nGreebel.   Their argument misapplies Greebel and our other caselaw.\n\n           The    defendants     list      factors   found   lacking   in   the\n\ncomplaint in Greebel, 194 F.3d at 203-04, as if they constituted a\n\nchecklist for securities fraud complaints. We explicitly disavowed\n\nthis interpretation in Greebel itself.            194 F.3d at 204 (\"We do not\n\nsay that each of these particulars must appear in a complaint, but\n\ntheir complete absence in this case is indicative of the excessive\n\ngenerality of these allegations.\").            We have since repeated this\n\nclarification.        See Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 80-81.\n\n           In response to the PSLRA, this circuit has adopted a\n\nfact-specific individual case analysis in preference to a list of\n\nfactors required to be pled.          See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 196, 204.\n\nHere, the complaint does include some of the factors missing in\n\nGreebel; the absence of others is not decisive.              Each securities\n\nfraud complaint must be analyzed on its own facts; there is no one-\n\nsize-fits-all template.          Sufficient evidence of one type might\n\nreduce or eliminate the need for evidence in other categories,\n\nwithout thwarting the legislative intent behind the PSLRA.              As the\n\nSixth   Circuit   put     it,   \"In   enacting    the   PSLRA,   Congress   was\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\fconcerned with the quantum, not type, of proof.\" Helwig v. Vencor,\n\nInc., 251 F.3d 540, 551 (6th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (adopting \"fact-\n\nspecific approach\" from Greebel).                 Because a categorical approach\n\nis not appropriate, courts will allow private securities fraud\n\ncomplaints to advance past the pleadings stage when some questions\n\nremained      unanswered,       provided     the     complaint      as   a    whole    is\n\nsufficiently particular to pass muster under the PSLRA. See, e.g.,\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 79-82 (failure of complaint to document\n\nprecise amounts of overstatements of revenue not fatal); Hollin v.\n\nScholastic Corp. (In re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig.), 252 F.3d 63,\n\n72-74 (2d Cir. 2001) (allegations of longer-term trends adequate to\n\nplead   inferences about activity during particular month); Rothman\n\nv. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir. 2000) (complaint need not \"fix\n\nthe   exact    date      and   time   that    [defendants]         became     aware\"   of\n\ninformation that rendered their accounting practices misleading,\n\nbecause it adequately alleged awareness within necessary time\n\nframe); In Re No. Nine Visual Tech. Corp. Sec. Litig., 51 F. Supp.\n\n2d 1, 26-27 (D. Mass. 1999) (complaint survives PSLRA scrutiny\n\ndespite    failure       of    complaint     to    document    precise        amount   of\n\noverstatement       of    inventory    or    to    tie     knowledge     of   inventory\n\nproblems to specific defendants). In contrast, in many cases where\n\nwe have upheld dismissal of securities fraud pleadings, we have\n\ndescribed     the   allegations       they    made    as    very    general     or    even\n\nconclusory. See, e.g., Maldonado v. Dominguez, 137 F.3d 1, 10 (1st\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fCir. 1998) (\"When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find\n\nthat there are no specific allegations [of scienter].\"); Suna v.\n\nBailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 71 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Appellants offer no\n\nfactual support for their conclusory allegations . . . .\"); Gross\n\nv. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In this\n\ncase, Gross has failed to allege any particulars to support his\n\ngeneral allegation of inflated earnings through the use of improper\n\naccounting methods.\").\n\n             Another difference between Greebel and the result in this\n\ncase   is    the   amount   of   discovery   that   had   been   completed   on\n\nparticular fraud allegations when the complaint was evaluated. The\n\ndistrict court in Greebel had already permitted limited discovery\n\nbefore granting a motion to dismiss.         See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 188.\n\nThe complaint had originally relied on a source to support an\n\nallegation that the defendant company fraudulently altered its\n\nbooks.      The district court did not dismiss the complaint at that\n\njuncture.      It did so only after limited discovery revealed that\n\nplaintiffs could not offer this source as a witness capable of\n\ntestifying about the allegation at trial, and after they failed to\n\nproduce adequate additional evidence.           In Greebel, we said that\n\nboth the original denial of a motion to dismiss (before discovery)\n\nand the subsequent dismissal (after some limited discovery) were\n\ncorrect.     Id. at 207.    Similarly, in Gross, the district court had\n\ngranted the plaintiff limited discovery and even an opportunity to\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\famend his complaint afterward.        93 F.3d at 990.       The company then\n\nmoved to dismiss, the district court granted the motion, and this\n\ncourt affirmed, noting key details that were still lacking in the\n\ncomplaint even after the focused discovery.\n\n           To be sure, the particularity requirements apply before\n\nany discovery has been conducted -- indeed, the PSLRA itself stays\n\nall discovery, with certain narrow exceptions, during the pendency\n\nof any motion to dismiss.         15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(3)(B).           But the\n\ndifference in discovery is relevant to a court's evaluation of\n\nsufficient particularity.         In short, under our circuit law, the\n\nprocedural posture of the case matters, and we will scrutinize a\n\npost-discovery motion to dismiss even more stringently than a pre-\n\ndiscovery motion.    See Cooperman v. Individual Inc., 171 F.3d 43,\n\n48-49 & n.8 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 81\n\n(distinguishing    Greebel   on    basis   of    difference      in   amount   of\n\ndiscovery); Maldonado, 137 F.3d at 9 (noting limit on expectations\n\nof   securities   fraud   pleadings    when     discovery   is    incomplete);\n\nGlassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 630 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(collecting cases in various areas of law where courts considered\n\namount of discovery completed when evaluating motion to dismiss).\n\n           As to this complaint, this court has said repeatedly that\n\nthe rigorous standards for pleading securities fraud do not require\n\na plaintiff to plead evidence.        See Cooperman, 171 F.3d at 48-49;\n\nShaw, 82 F.3d at 1225.     Defendants' argument that even more detail\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fbe   required,    before   there   is    any   discovery,   here    amounts   to\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to plead evidence.              The fraud allegations\n\nadvanced in this complaint, with their consistent details provided\n\nfrom at least half a dozen different sources across various alleged\n\nschemes, reinforce each other and suggest reliability of the\n\ninformation      reported.     The      complaint   satisfies      the   PSLRA's\n\nparticularity requirements.\n\nB.   Identification of Materially Misleading Statements\n\n           Having jumped the first hurdle by pleading fraud with\n\nparticularity, Mesko must identify the specific statements rendered\n\nmaterially misleading by the fraud he has pleaded.                   A fact is\n\nmaterial if it is substantially likely \"that the disclosure of the\n\nomitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as\n\nhaving significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made\n\navailable.\"      Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988)\n\n(quoting TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449\n\n(1976)). Information which \"would have assumed actual significance\n\nin the deliberations of a reasonable shareholder\" is material. TSC\n\nIndus., 426 U.S. at 449.             In general, the materiality of a\n\nstatement or omission is a question of fact that should normally be\n\nleft to a jury rather than resolved by the court on a motion to\n\ndismiss. See Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, Inc., 36\n\nF.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir. 1994).          Thus, we review the complaint only\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\fto determine that it pleads the existence of such statements and\n\npresents a plausible jury question of materiality.\n\n             The complaint describes three categories of statements\n\nthat    it   alleges   were    materially    misleading:   (1)    Cabletron's\n\nfinancial report filings with the SEC; (2) direct statements made\n\nby Cabletron officials, either in press releases or in direct\n\nquotes in the media; and (3) statements made by stock analysts and\n\njournalists,       allegedly     echoing    statements   made    to   them   by\n\ndefendants.       According to the district court, the complaint listed\n\nthree statements in the first category, eight statements in the\n\nsecond, and twenty-five statements in the third.\n\n             1.    SEC Filings\n\n             Cabletron made its required filings with the SEC during\n\nthe class period: its Form 10-K for the fiscal year that ended on\n\nFebruary 28, 1997, its Form 10-Q for the March-May 1997 quarter,\n\nand its Form 10-Q for the June-August 1997 quarter.              The Form 10-K\n\nwas signed by all of the individual defendants except for Oliver,\n\nwhile each Form 10-Q was signed by Benson and Kirkpatrick.\n\n             Mesko asserts that, because of the fraudulent revenue\n\nrecognition practices discussed in Part II.A of this opinion, these\n\nSEC filings did not reflect Cabletron's true earnings, rendering\n\nthem materially misleading.10 More specifically, Mesko alleges that\n\n\n       10\n          Mesko also alleges that disclosure of adverse factors was\nrequired in some of the SEC filings, and that failure to so\ndisclose independently rendered them materially misleading.      We\n\n                                      -37-\n\fthe practices violated the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n\n(GAAP), which \"embody the prevailing principles, conventions, and\n\nprocedures defined by the accounting industry from time to time.\"\n\nYoung v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 5 n.1 (1st Cir. 2002); see generally\n\nMigliaccio v. K-Tel Int'l, Inc. (In re K-Tel Int'l, Inc. Sec.\n\nLitig.), 300 F.3d 881, 889-90 (8th Cir. 2002) (elaborating on\n\nmultiple and potentially conflicting sources of GAAP).                Under SEC\n\nregulations, Mesko notes, filings that do not comply with GAAP\n\n\"will be presumed to be misleading and inaccurate.\"                 17 C.F.R. §\n\n210.4-01(a)(1).      As a result, Mesko says, Cabletron's SEC filings\n\nduring the class period were unlawfully false and misleading.\n\n              Merely stating in conclusory fashion that a company's\n\nbooks   are    out   of   compliance    with   GAAP   would   not    in   itself\n\ndemonstrate liability under section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.                     See\n\nSerabian, 24 F.3d at 362.       Indeed, some techniques that result in\n\nearly booking of sales, such as channel stuffing, might prove to be\n\nentirely legitimate, depending on the specific facts. See Greebel,\n\n194 F.3d at 202.\n\n              In this case, however, Mesko alleges that Cabletron's\n\nrevenue was fraudulently inflated by tens of millions of dollars\n\nper quarter.     Given that Cabletron's quarterly revenue ranged from\n\n$371 million to $381 million during the class period, reasonable\n\n\nhandle this claim as we do other direct statements alleged to be\nmisleading because of failure to disclose the adverse factors; we\nconsider those statements in the next subsection.\n\n                                       -38-\n\finvestors   unquestionably     might   consider   a   difference   of   such\n\nmagnitude material. Accurate earnings figures are vital aspects of\n\nthe \"total mix of information\" which investors would consult when\n\nevaluating Cabletron's stock.      Furthermore, the nature of much of\n\nthe alleged inaccuracy in earnings derives from systematic fraud,\n\ndescribed in detail, that extends to completely fictitious sales.\n\nThis distinguishes it from cases where the alleged GAAP violation\n\nconsisted merely of questionable bookkeeping practices. Cf., e.g.,\n\nGross, 93 F.3d at 995-96 (recognition of revenue at time of order\n\nrather than at time of shipment, allegedly in violation of GAAP,\n\nheld insufficient where plaintiff \"failed to allege any particulars\n\nto support his general allegation\"); Serabian, 24 F.3d at 362\n\n(allocation of losses to wrong fiscal quarters, absent other\n\npleadings of fraud, fails to state claim even if in violation of\n\nGAAP).   Mesko has adequately pled that the fraudulent revenue\n\nrecognition rendered Cabletron's SEC filings materially misleading.\n\n            2.   Other Direct Public Statements\n\n            In addition to SEC filings, Cabletron and its executives\n\nmade other direct statements to the public during the class period\n\nthat the complaint alleges were materially misleading.         This court\n\nhas previously attributed direct quotes of company officials in the\n\nnews media to the company, see Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 79-80, and\n\ndoes so again here.       The direct statements catalogued in the\n\ncomplaint   include:   press   releases   announcing    earnings,   public\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\fstatements about the availability of the SmartSwitch, and general\n\noptimistic statements about Cabletron's health.\n\n               First, Cabletron issued press releases during the class\n\nperiod    to    announce     earnings   figures   for    each   quarter.    The\n\ncomplaint alleges that these press releases were misleading for the\n\nsame reason       as   the   SEC   filings:    they   announced   figures   that\n\nreflected fraudulently inflated revenue, and thereby misstated\n\nCabletron's true earnings for each of these quarters.                 The same\n\nanalysis we applied to the SEC filings demonstrates the materiality\n\nof these alleged misstatements.\n\n               Second, the complaint alleges that public statements\n\nabout the SmartSwitch were materially misleading because they gave\n\nthe impression that production and distribution of this important\n\nnew product were \"ramping up\" smoothly when this was not so.\n\nHowever, it specifically identifies only a small number of such\n\nstatements attributable to Cabletron directly (as opposed to third-\n\nparty statements, which we discuss below).11              These are: a press\n\nrelease issued when Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch on March 3,\n\n1997, the first day of the class period; direct quotes in a trade\n\npublication article on March 17, 1997 suggesting that the product\n\n\n\n     11\n          The complaint also includes a catch-all assertion about\nother unspecified \"press releases and other disseminations and\ncommunications about these new SmartSwitch products.\"      Section\n10(b) and Rule 10b-5 require that the specific statements alleged\nto be materially misleading must be identified, and we accordingly\ndisregard this catch-all assertion.\n\n                                        -40-\n\fwas then available; and a media interview with Benson on July 14,\n\n1997 in which he predicted that SmartSwitch problems would be\n\nresolved by September.\n\n              Mesko has not shown why any of these three statements\n\nwere materially misleading when they were made.                   The complaint\n\nfails to demonstrate that the problems which later plagued the\n\nSmartSwitch were known to the individual defendants by mid-March,\n\nwhen the first two statements were made.12            The supply delays might\n\nor might not have been visible to defendants by then, but in any\n\nevent it may also have been reasonable to believe they would soon\n\nbe resolved.       Even Mesko's own sources state that the manual\n\nrewiring to resolve mechanical flaws began in April, not March.\n\nThe   third    statement,   made   by   Benson   in    July,     was   simply   an\n\noptimistic     forward-looking     prediction    about     the    timeline      for\n\nresolving SmartSwitch problems, and Mesko does not even allege that\n\nthis timeline was not met.\n\n              If, however, Cabletron's direct statements created the\n\nimpression that the SmartSwitch was already commercially available\n\non a large scale, the company may then have had a duty to revise\n\n\n      12\n          The complaint does allege that certain other company\npersonnel knew of the SmartSwitch problems in March, including\npublic relations and quality assurance personnel. If Mesko can\ndemonstrate at a later time that the individual defendants are\ntherefore liable as control persons, or that this information made\nits way to the individual defendants so that they have primary\nliability, then this information could provide further basis for a\njury to find that defendants' statements were materially\nmisleading.\n\n                                    -41-\n\fthat impression if later developments substantially undermined the\n\naccuracy of the earlier statements.      See Gross, 93 F.3d at 992\n\n(citing Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir.\n\n1987)). While a company need not reveal every piece of information\n\nthat affects anything said before, it must disclose facts, \"if any,\n\nthat are needed so that what was revealed [before] would not be 'so\n\nincomplete as to mislead.'\"    Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d\n\n10, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (en banc) (quoting SEC v. Tex. Gulf Sulphur\n\nCo., 401 F.2d 833, 862 (2d Cir. 1968)).     Seen in this light, the\n\ncomplaint establishes a reasonable inference of a material omission\n\nwhich, if borne out by evidence, would present a question of fact\n\nfor a jury.   On remand, these allegations should be allowed to\n\nproceed on that more limited basis, that is, not as statements\n\nmisleading when made, but as statements potentially requiring\n\nrevision in light of subsequent developments.     See generally G.S.\n\nPorter, What Did You Know and When Did You Know It?: Public Company\n\nDisclosure and the Mythical Duties to Correct and Update, 68\n\nFordham L. Rev. 2199, 2228-30 (2000) (expressing general skepticism\n\nabout duty to correct but envisioning scenario similar to this one\n\nin which it might rightfully apply).\n\n          Finally,   the   complaint   alleges   that   other   direct\n\nstatements by Cabletron were unduly optimistic in light of the\n\nmounting difficulties facing the company.         Mesko argues that\n\nadverse factors other than the SmartSwitch delays should have been\n\n\n                                -42-\n\fdisclosed earlier or more fully.       For example, the complaint calls\n\nthe June 2, 1997 press release that made partial disclosures of\n\nCabletron's problems materially misleading, because it failed to\n\ndisclose the full extent of those problems.\n\n             The defendants accurately argue that Cabletron was under\n\nno obligation to disclose information on industry-wide trends that\n\nwas available to the public.          Some of the complaint's adverse\n\nfactors, such as the split with Cisco Systems and the increased\n\nmarket saturation, fall into this category.              More fundamentally,\n\nthe complaint lacks the level of detail in these allegations that\n\nit   provides    elsewhere,   and    fails   to   plead     with     sufficient\n\nparticularity that the adverse factors were known to Cabletron but\n\nwere contemporaneously concealed from the public.                  Rather, the\n\nadverse factors are gleaned from the company's disclosures, which\n\nare then alleged to be too little, too late.            \"[P]laintiffs may not\n\nsimply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they\n\nshould have been made earlier.\"       Berliner v. Lotus Dev. Corp., 783\n\nF. Supp. 708, 710 (D. Mass. 1992).         Standing alone, such circular\n\nassertions    represent   little    more   than   the    type   of   \"fraud   by\n\nhindsight\" pleading that we have long rejected. See, e.g., Gross,\n\n93 F.3d at 991; Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n          As noted previously, however, the complaint also relies\n\non these adverse factors to supply a reason for the revenue-padding\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\fat the heart of plaintiffs' case, and as context for understanding\n\nit, rather than as independent grounds for pleading fraud.                 As the\n\nrationale for the other fraudulent actions, these adverse factors\n\nhelp support scienter, and should be considered as such on remand.\n\nCf. No. Nine, 51 F. Supp. 2d at 26 (using allegations advanced in\n\ncomplaint    primarily      to    show     scienter    as   means   to   support\n\nparticularity holding).\n\n            3.   Third-Party Statements\n\n            The complaint catalogues many statements about Cabletron\n\nin reports published by market analysts.                It also cites a few\n\nbusiness news stories about Cabletron.                Mesko alleges that the\n\nthird parties who made these statements -- market analysts or\n\njournalists -- based them on statements that had been made to them\n\nby defendants or by other agents of Cabletron, so that the latter\n\nare   responsible     for        their    materially    misleading       content.\n\nDefendants respond that they have no liability for statements made\n\nby third parties.\n\n            The district court appears to have utilized a two-prong\n\ntest to analyze these statements, requiring that defendants either\n\n\"controlled\" the third party's statements or that they \"adopted\"\n\nthe statements after they were made.            The court then found that the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -44-\n\fcomplaint had not satisfied either of these conditions.13 We reject\n\nthe district court's rule.\n\n            A majority of courts has analyzed third-party statements\n\nby    applying   the   \"entanglement\"      test     developed   by   the   Second\n\nCircuit.      Elkind,    635   F.2d   at     163.     See   generally      2   H.S.\n\nBloomenthal,      Securities   Law    Handbook        §   27.10(4)   (2002     ed.)\n\n(collecting cases).       District courts in this circuit have also\n\nemployed this test, while recognizing that we have not yet embraced\n\nit.    See, e.g., Carney v. Cambridge Tech. Partners, Inc., 135 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 235, 248 & n.7 (D. Mass. 2001); No. Nine, 51 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 30-31; Schaffer v. Timberland Co., 924 F. Supp. 1298, 1310\n\n(D.N.H. 1996).\n\n            We now hold that the entanglement test is the correct\n\napproach.14      This test requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the\n\ndefendants' involvement with third-party statements:\n\n            [L]iability may attach to an analyst's statements where\n            the defendants have expressly or impliedly adopted the\n            statements, placed their imprimatur on the statements, or\n\n\n       13\n          The district court also suggested that some of the\nstatements on which the analysts and journalists based their\nreporting were unactionably vague \"puffing,\" but failed to specify\nwhich of the statements fell into this category or why.\n       14\n          In the past, we had expressly reserved the question of\nwhether statements in a third-party source such as an analyst's\nreport may be attributable to a securities fraud defendant when it\nis not explicit that they are the defendant's direct statements.\nSuna, 107 F.3d at 73. At least one recent case came close to doing\nso but did not need to reach the overarching question.         See\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 79-80.\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f            have otherwise entangled themselves with the analysts to\n            a significant degree. . . . [T]he court will determine\n            whether the complaint contains allegations which,\n            favorably construed and viewed in the context of the\n            entire pleading, could establish a significant and\n            specific,   not   merely   a   casual   or   speculative,\n            entanglement between the defendants and the analysts with\n            respect to the statements at issue.\n\nSchaffer,   924   F.   Supp.    at   1310.    Entanglement   also   includes\n\nsituations where company officials \"intentionally foster a mistaken\n\nbelief concerning a material fact.\"           Elkind, 635 F.2d at 163-64.\n\nAs this articulation of the test makes clear, the district court\n\nerred when it required that defendants \"controlled\" third-party\n\nstatements. Nonetheless, an entanglement claim will be rejected if\n\nit merely suggests or assumes that company insiders provided the\n\ninformation on which analysts or other outsiders based their\n\nreports.    See Suna, 107 F.3d at 73-74; No. Nine, 51 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n31.\n\n            Some of the third-party statements cited in the complaint\n\ndo satisfy the entanglement test.            To give examples of two such\n\nstatements, without reaching the further question of whether they\n\nwere misleading, the complaint alleges that an analyst report\n\nissued on March 25, 1997 stated, on the basis of information from\n\nLevine and other Cabletron executives, that the SmartSwitch 6000\n\nwould \"ship in volume in the second week of April.\"          Further, a May\n\n13 analyst report, based on a presentation by a named Cabletron\n\nofficial    responsible   for    investor    relations,   stated    that   the\n\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\fSmartSwitch products were \"ramping according to plan,\" which by\n\nmid-May seems clearly not to have been so.\n\n           The entanglement test separates mere salesmanship from\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.15     A test that required \"control\"\n\nwould give company officials too much leeway to commit fraud on the\n\nmarket by using analysts as their mouthpieces.          Elkind and its\n\nprogeny set a better boundary.       On remand, the district court\n\nshould evaluate each of the third-party statements under the\n\ncorrect test.\n\nC.   Scienter\n\n          Liability   under   section   10(b)   and   Rule   10b-5   also\n\nrequires scienter, \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive,\n\nmanipulate, or defraud.\"      Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S.\n\n185, 193 n.12 (1976).   Under the PSLRA, the complaint must state\n\nwith particularity facts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of\n\nscienter, rather than merely a reasonable inference.         15 U.S.C. §\n\n78u-4(b)(2); Greebel, 194 F.3d at 195-96.\n\n          The inference of scienter must be reasonable and strong,\n\nbut need not be irrefutable. Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82.          Scienter\n\nmay be demonstrated by indirect evidence, Greebel, 194 F.3d at 196-\n\n\n     15\n          We note, in addition, that new SEC regulations concerning\ndisclosure of communications between companies and analysts may\nhelp to resolve some of these issues in the future. See Regulation\nFD, 17 C.F.R. § § 243.100-243.103 (requiring disclosure to public\nof information provided to analysts simultaneously or soon\nthereafter). See generally Bloomenthal, supra, § 33.10 (discussing\nRegulation FD).\n\n                                 -47-\n\f97, and may extend to a form of extreme recklessness that \"is\n\ncloser to a lesser form of intent,\"    id. at 198-99.   Furthermore,\n\nthis circuit has rejected any rigid formula for pleading scienter,\n\npreferring to rely on a \"fact-specific approach\" that proceeds case\n\nby case.   Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82; see Greebel, 194 F.3d at 196.\n\n           We have specifically rejected the contention that \"facts\n\nshowing motive and opportunity can never be enough to permit the\n\ndrawing of a strong inference of scienter.\"    Greebel, 194 F.3d at\n\n197.   \"[T]he plaintiff may combine various facts and circumstances\n\nindicating fraudulent intent\" -- including those demonstrating\n\nmotive and opportunity -- to satisfy the scienter requirement.\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 82.   However, \"catch-all allegations\" which\n\nmerely assert motive and opportunity, without something more, fail\n\nto satisfy the PSLRA.    Greebel, 194 F.3d at 197 (quoting In re\n\nAdvanta Corp. Sec. Litig., 180 F.3d 525, 535 (3rd Cir. 1999)); see\n\nalso Green Tree, 270 F.3d at 660.\n\n           Applying these standards, we conclude that the complaint\n\nadequately demonstrates scienter.\n\n           We look first to the evidence of conscious wrongdoing,\n\nwhich may provide the \"something more\" necessary to prove scienter.\n\nSee Greebel, 194 F.3d at 201; A. Morales Olazabal, The Search for\n\n\"Middle Ground\": Towards A Harmonized Interpretation of The Private\n\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act's New Pleading Standard, 6 Stan.\n\nJ.L. Bus. & Fin. 153, 187-88 (2001) (\"[T]he obvious should not go\n\n\n                                -48-\n\funstated, and that is that allegations of intentionally fraudulent\n\nconduct also will permit the drawing of a strong inference of\n\nscienter.\").      Accusations of warehousing of the sort plaintiffs\n\nmake   here    are   \"very     serious.\"         Greebel,     194    F.3d    at   202.\n\nSignificant     GAAP    violations       also    \"could     provide       evidence   of\n\nscienter.\" Id. at 203.            \"[A]ccounting shenanigans\" are among the\n\ncharacteristic       types    of    circumstances        which     may    demonstrate\n\nscienter for securities fraud.             See Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249\n\nF.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              Mesko's     complaint        makes        adequate     particularized\n\nallegations of large-scale fraudulent practices over time. In such\n\ncircumstances, these and similar cases make it difficult to escape\n\na   strong     inference     of    the    type     of    recklessness      concerning\n\nwrongdoing that amounts to scienter.\n\n              Other allegations also add to a strong inference of\n\nscienter.     The complaint alleges that Benson specifically directed\n\nsome of the fraudulent warehousing activities at the heart of the\n\ncomplaint.     Again, he may have done no such thing, but we must take\n\nthe allegations in the complaint as true.                   It also alleges that\n\nmany people within the company -- including Levine, Benson, and\n\nOliver   --    received      regular     information      about     the   SmartSwitch\n\nproblems which they should have realized contradicted the company's\n\npublic statements about the rollout of the product.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -49-\n\f          In addition, the complaint identifies concealment of the\n\nserious and worsening deterioration of Cabletron's financial health\n\nas a significant motive for the alleged fraud.   Cf. Aldridge, 284\n\nF.3d at 83 (scienter supported by corporate officers' understanding\n\nthat rollout of new product was \"important to their own survival\n\nand that of the company\"); Nathenson v. Zonagen, Inc., 267 F.3d\n\n400, 425 (5th Cir. 2001) (scienter for misstatements about patent\n\nsupported by fact that company's future depended on patent).\n\nIndeed, it appears that Levine, a cofounder of the company, was\n\nforced out of management as the magnitude of Cabletron's problems\n\nbegan to come to light, thus confirming that these motivating fears\n\nwere realistic.   This is more than the usual concern by executives\n\nto improve financial results; the executives' careers and the very\n\nsurvival of the company were on the line.\n\n          And if these interrelated facts and circumstances still\n\nwere not enough to give rise to a strong inference of scienter, the\n\ncomplaint adds its allegations of insider trading.   Stock sales by\n\ninsiders can supply evidence of scienter.     \"The vitality of the\n\ninference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from\n\nmarginal to strong.\"     Greebel, 194 F.3d at 197-98 (citations\n\nomitted). Here, the insider trading allegations add some weight to\n\nthe other evidence of scienter, and we need not determine whether\n\nalone they would suffice. Levine made the overwhelming majority of\n\nthe sales, and his resignation provides a plausible innocent\n\n\n                               -50-\n\fexplanation for large stock sales.          Id. at 206 (\"It is not unusual\n\nfor individuals leaving a company . . . to sell shares.\").             Still,\n\nthe approximately $177 million he gained from stock sales can be a\n\npowerful incentive. It is also true, as defendants point out, that\n\nmany of the sales, by both Levine and others, occurred after\n\nCabletron's disclosures in early June 1997, even though the share\n\nprice was significantly higher before this time.                 The insider\n\ntrading allegations      nonetheless    provide     additional   ballast   to\n\nMesko's argument for scienter.         They suggest further motive for\n\nsecurities fraud, and they combine with other aspects of the\n\ncomplaint to produce a strong inference of scienter overall.               See\n\nShaw, 82 F.3d at 1224 (although allegations of smaller-scale\n\ninsider trading did not show scienter on their own, they \"provide\n\nsome support\").\n\n            Taking the allegations of the complaint as a whole -- and\n\nas true -- we find that it is not only a reasonable inference but\n\na strong one that defendants possessed a state of mind giving rise\n\nto   a   securities   fraud   claim,   if   fraud   was   committed.     Each\n\nindividual fact about scienter may provide only a brushstroke, but\n\nthe resulting portrait satisfies the requirement for a strong\n\ninference of scienter under the PSLRA.\n\nD.   Pleading of Individual Defendants' Liability\n\n            Finally, we analyze here how the section 10(b) claim in\n\nthe complaint survives, with one exception, against each individual\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\fdefendant.     Again, we do not state that the allegations are true,\n\nnor do we imply anything about those allegations we do not name in\n\nthis summary; we merely show why the complaint is sufficient as to\n\neach defendant to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n             The complaint asserts that, under the so-called group\n\npleading presumption, the court need not consider the liability of\n\neach individual defendant, but may attribute all the statements to\n\nall the defendants as \"collective actions.\"              This circuit has\n\nrecognized a very limited version of the group pleading doctrine\n\nfor securities fraud.     See Serabian, 24 F.3d at 367-68 (dismissal\n\ninappropriate where defendants signed annual report and allegedly\n\nhad access to contrary information).          There is presently great\n\ndebate about the doctrine's continued existence after enactment of\n\nthe PSLRA.    See generally In re Raytheon Sec. Litig., 157 F. Supp.\n\n2d 131, 152-53 (D. Mass. 2001) (collecting cases and concluding\n\nthat presumption survives); W.O. Fisher, Don't Call Me a Securities\n\nLaw Groupie:    The Rise and Possible Demise of the \"Group Pleading\"\n\nProtocol in 10b-5 Cases, 56 Bus. Law. 991 (2001) (reviewing cases\n\nand arguing that PSLRA undermines doctrine).       For purposes of this\n\nopinion, we will set the issue aside without deciding it, because\n\nwe determine without reference to the group pleading presumption\n\nwhether the complaint states a claim against each defendant.\n\n             Cabletron   itself   is   the   clearest.      Most   of   the\n\npotentially actionable statements in the complaint, including the\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\fSEC filings and the press releases, were company documents.              The\n\nscienter alleged against the company's agents is enough to plead\n\nscienter for the company. Mesko has thereby stated a claim against\n\nCabletron that survives the PSLRA's pleading requirements.\n\n              Levine and Kirkpatrick, officers of the company, are\n\nboth alleged to have had access to information contrary to the\n\ncompany's public statements, to have participated in a number of\n\nthe statements (including signing both the Form 10-K and the two\n\nForms 10-Q) and to have made significant stock sales. Benson, also\n\nan officer, did not sell stock or sign the 10-Q, but was alleged to\n\nhave    directed   some   of   the   fraudulent     practices    surrounding\n\nfictitious sales and also to have ordered negative information\n\nabout the SmartSwitch withheld from sales personnel. The complaint\n\nagainst each of them also survives.\n\n              The case against the three outside directors -- Duncan,\n\nMcGuinness, and Myerow -- presents a closer call, but on balance we\n\nbelieve the complaint also suffices in its claims against them.\n\nEach signed the Form 10-K and accepted responsibility for its\n\ncontents.     See Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc., 228 F.3d 1057, 1061-62\n\n(9th Cir. 2000) (holding outside directors responsible for SEC\n\nfilings they signed).      Each is alleged to have made stock sales\n\nthat contribute to a strong inference of scienter against them.\n\nGiven   the    pre-discovery   posture      of   this   case,   the   overall\n\ncomplaint's survival under the PSLRA, and the possibility that\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\fthese three defendants also face control person liability under\n\nsection 20(a), as explained below, we reverse the dismissal of the\n\ncase against them.\n\n          Finally, unlike the outside director defendants, Oliver\n\ndid not sign the Form 10-K or trade Cabletron stock during the\n\nclass period.     Oliver did receive reports from the quality control\n\ndatabases. Unlike the other officers, however, the complaint fails\n\nto connect him specifically to any of the materially misleading\n\nstatements   that    we   have   found   survive   the   PSLRA   pleading\n\nrequirements.16     Consequently, we affirm the dismissal of the\n\nsection 10(b) claim against Oliver.\n\n          The parties did not brief the question of how the section\n\n20(a) claims of control person liability17 against each of the\n\nindividual defendants should be resolved if this court reversed\n\ndismissal of the section 10(b) claims, as we have done; in such\n\ncircumstances we think the best course is to remand those section\n\n\n\n     16\n          Under the group pleading presumption, if we had applied\nit, the result would likely be the same, because the complaint did\nnot allege Oliver's participation in the production of any group-\npublished documents such as SEC filings.\n     17\n          That provision, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a), states:\n               Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls\n               any person liable under any provision of this\n               chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder\n               shall also be liable jointly and severally with and\n               to the same extent as such controlled person . . .\n               unless the controlling person acted in good faith\n               and did not directly or indirectly induce the act\n               or acts constituting the violation . . . .\n\n                                  -54-\n\f20(a) claims as well. See Scholastic, 252 F.3d at 77-78 (remanding\n\nsection 20(a) claims when reversing dismissal of primary liability\n\nclaims, because district court had based section 20(a) dismissal on\n\nprimary liability dismissal); Nathenson, 267 F.3d at 426 n.29\n\n(same).\n\n            Control is a question of fact that \"will not ordinarily\n\nbe resolved summarily at the pleading stage.\"              2 T.L. Hazen,\n\nTreatise on the Law of Securities Regulation § 12.24(1) (4th ed.\n\n2002).    The issue raises a number of complexities that should not\n\nbe resolved on such an underdeveloped record.          Since the section\n\n20(a) claims involve most of the same defendants who remain in the\n\ncase by virtue of our section 10(b) ruling, the practical effect of\n\nreinstating them at this stage is small.          There is a reasonable\n\ninference in the complaint that Oliver may have controlled persons\n\nresponsible   for    promulgating   misleading   information    about     the\n\nSmartSwitch, so we remand the section 20(a) claim against him as\n\nwell. On remand, those individual defendants who wish to challenge\n\ntheir    liability   under   section   20(a)   may,   of   course,   do    so\n\nexplicitly.    Likewise, Mesko may augment his argument for control\n\nperson liability against the defendants, and particularly against\n\nthe outside directors and Oliver.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n            Mesko objects to the recusals by Judge DiClerico and\n\nChief Judge Torres and asks that this case be remanded to Judge\n\n\n                                    -55-\n\fDiClerico because his recusal was inappropriate.               Mesko failed to\n\nraise concerns about these recusals at the time they occurred.\n\nThis court will decide issues that were not argued before the\n\ndistrict court only rarely, and we decline to set aside the recusal\n\ndecisions here.\n\n           \"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that,\n\nabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not\n\nraised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\"        Teamsters Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline\n\nTransp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir 1992).                 The circumstances\n\nhere were hardly extraordinary.           As first one judge and then the\n\nother considered recusal, Mesko \"made not a murmur.\"                  Toscano v.\n\nChandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 384 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           Even    under   normal    circumstances,     with     an    objection\n\npreserved, a district court judge's decision to disqualify himself\n\nor herself is reviewed under the same abuse of discretion standard\n\nused to evaluate refusals to recuse.          United States v. Snyder, 235\n\nF.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"The appellate court, therefore, must\n\nask itself not whether it would have decided as did the trial\n\ncourt, but whether that decision cannot be defended as a rational\n\nconclusion supported by [a] reasonable reading of the record.\")\n\n(quoting In re United States, 158 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\nThe   standard    is   deferential   in     part   because    these    sensitive\n\ndecisions often require a complex balancing of multiple factors.\n\n\n                                     -56-\n\fJudge    DiClerico   and     Chief    Judge    Torres      both   gave   thorough\n\nconsideration to their recusal decisions.                   Chief Judge Torres\n\nspecifically weighed the advice of the Committee on Codes of\n\nConduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, which has\n\nissued a helpful advisory opinion about recusal decisions in a\n\nclass action context.        See Comm. on Codes of Conduct, Adv. Op. No.\n\n99 (July 12, 2000), at http://www.uscourts.gov/guide/vol2/99.html.\n\nWe will not overturn the decisions these judges made, especially\n\ngiven Mesko's failure to argue the point to them directly.\n\n                                        V.\n\n            This decision does not suggest that Mesko's allegations\n\nagainst Cabletron or the individual defendants are true, or that\n\nplaintiffs would prevail at trial.             By reinstating the case and\n\nreturning it to the district court, we hold only that the complaint\n\npresents a sufficient pleading of fraud to avoid dismissal at this\n\nstage.      \"Where   there    is     smoke,   there   is    not   always   fire.\"\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 85; see Serabian, 24 F.3d at 365-66 (\"Despite\n\nour     conclusion   that     certain     allegations       survive      threshold\n\nconsideration, we note that plaintiffs remain a great distance from\n\nactually proving securities fraud.\").\n\n            On remand, the district court may, in its discretion,\n\nlimit or structure discovery so that potentially dispositive issues\n\nare addressed first.       See Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 85.          This technique\n\nhas been used in other securities fraud cases where, despite a\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\fcomplaint's survival of the initial motion to dismiss, plaintiffs\n\nwere ultimately unable to provide allegations strong enough to go\n\nto trial.    See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 207; Gross, 93 F.3d at 990.\n\n            The district court order granting the motion to dismiss\n\nis reversed, except that dismissal of the section 10(b) claim\n\nagainst Oliver is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. Plaintiffs' request that\n\nthe case be remanded to a previously recused judge is denied.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -58-\n\f",

The district court, acting under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), dismissed the complaint. We differ with the district court concerning certain tests to be applied in assessing securities fraud claims and in construction of our precedent. We conclude that the complaint as a whole complies with the PSLRA in sufficient part, and we reverse the dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings, with the exception that we affirm dismissal of one of the two claims against defendant Christopher J. Oliver. Our ruling does not mean that plaintiffs' claims have any merit. It means only that the claims are not to be dismissed at this very early stage. Nothing has been proven yet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles Mesko and other investors filed a class action suit against Cabletron Systems, Inc. and seven individuals who served as executives or directors of Cabletron.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Mesko alleged violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2002). Plaintiffs purchased Cabletron stock, or bought call options or sold put options for Cabletron stock, between March 3, 1997 and December 2, 1997 (the \"class period\"). The first consolidated amended complaint was rejected for failing to meet the standards of the PSLRA, but Mesko was granted leave to amend it. He did, and the district court then ruled that this second consolidated amended complaint (the \"complaint\") satisfied the requirements of the PSLRA. After the judge who issued this ruling died, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the first district judge's ruling, a successor district judge granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. This dismissal occurred before discovery was conducted or any class was certified. The district court held that the complaint fails the particularity test for pleading fraud, that it fails to allege facts supporting a belief that the misstatements were material, and that the pleadings do not raise a strong inference of scienter. We disagree on all three points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the particularity ruling, it is unclear if the district court held that any pleading based upon confidential sources would fail the PSLRA's pleading requirements, thus adopting the rule from a case it cited, <i>In re Silicon Graphics Securities Litigation,</i> 970 F.Supp. 746, 763-64 (N.D.Cal.1997), <i>aff'd,</i> 183 F.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir.1999). Alternatively, the court may have utilized a rule that allows confidential sources if there are other specific facts alleged, but then determined that this complaint lacked such facts. We reject the <i>Silicon Graphics</i> per se test forbidding PSLRA pleadings based on confidential sources, and instead adopt a test similar to the Second Circuit's test in <i>Novak v. Kasaks,</i> 216 F.3d 300, 314 (2nd Cir.2000). Applying that test, we find there was sufficient detail in the allegations, including those made by confidential sources, to permit the complaint to go forward. We also hold, contrary to the district court, that the complaint provides adequate information concerning internal company documents on which it relies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to materially misleading statements, the district court erred in the overly restrictive test it applied to statements made by third parties &#8212; in this instance mostly market analysts &#8212; which were in turn based on statements made by company officials. We reject the district court's determination that the defendants must have either \"controlled\" the content of the third party statements or adopted them. Instead we join the majority of courts in applying the \"entanglement\" test first articulated in <i>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc.,</i> 635 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to both materiality and scienter, we conclude that the pertinent portions of the complaint sufficiently meet pleading requirements at this stage of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the allegations are stronger than others, and those against the defendant outside directors present a close call, we conclude that the complaint as a whole states a claim against Cabletron and against all but one of the individual defendants. As to that defendant, Oliver, the director of engineering and manufacturing, we affirm dismissal of the section 10(b) claim against him but not dismissal of the section 20(a) claim. We reverse the remainder of the district court decision and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to appealing the dismissal of the complaint, Mesko asks this court to remand the case to a district judge who had previously recused himself, on the basis that his disqualification was improper. We deny this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko filed his original complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, where the case was assigned to the late Judge Shane Devine. On December 23, 1998, in response to defendants' motion to dismiss, Judge Devine ruled that Mesko's first consolidated amended complaint lacked enough detail concerning statements made \"on information and belief\" to survive heightened pleading standards under the PSLRA, but granted Mesko leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko amended the complaint by adding sources for the allegations pled, particularly \"more than a half dozen former Cabletron employees who worked at the Company during the Class Period.\" Judge Devine accepted these changes in a one-page order on February 4, 1999, writing, \"The court has reviewed the complaint and is satisfied that it meets the PSLRA's requirements relative to pleadings based on information and belief.\" His order invited defendants to either renew their motion to dismiss or file an answer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Shortly after Judge Devine passed away on February 22, 1999, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was then reassigned several times as the result of recusals. First it went before Judge Joseph A. DiClerico Jr., who recused himself from the case because he owned stock in companies that were defendants in other securities class actions brought by plaintiffs' counsel or their firms. One of defendants' attorneys was on the recusal lists of the two other federal district judges in the District of New Hampshire. Therefore, the case was transferred to the District of Rhode Island for assignment to a judge there, sitting by designation in the District of New Hampshire, which retained jurisdiction. The case was then assigned to Chief Judge Ernest C. Torres, but, like Judge DiClerico, he owned stock in several corporations against which counsel in this case had brought securities litigation, and he too disqualified himself. The case was finally reassigned once more, to Judge Mary M. Lisi. Neither party objected to any of these recusals at the time they occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Lisi heard oral argument on the defendants' motion to dismiss on November 7, 2000. During oral argument, she asked Mesko to provide a list of those paragraphs in the complaint that are based on information and belief. Mesko did so on November 13, indicating that four of the 126 paragraphs are based on information and belief; he attributed most of the others to either a document or a witness who had spoken to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On May 23, 2001, Judge Lisi granted the motion to dismiss, determining that the complaint failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the dismissal is grounded in Rule 12(b)(6), the facts pled in the complaint are taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <i>See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Doe v. Walker,</i> 193 F.3d 42, 42 (1st Cir.1999)) (applying standard in PSLRA case). We describe the facts in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron, now renamed, was a publicly-traded corporation registered in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In 1997, at the beginning of the class period, Cabletron was among the nation's leading manufacturers and vendors of equipment for large enterprise computer networks, such as local area network and wide area network switches, as well as related hardware, software, and consulting services. Its customers included sizable corporations, universities, and government entities. For the quarter ending on February 28, 1997, immediately before the class period, Cabletron reported strong financial performance, including a twenty-six percent increase in net sales. In a company press release, S. Robert Levine, the president and chief executive officer, said these results represented Cabletron's \"thirty-second quarter of consecutive record growth, the strongest and steadiest earnings growth rate among all S &amp; P 500 companies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These impressive numbers did not last. After the market closed on June 2, 1997, Cabletron announced that its earnings for the March-May 1997 quarter were less than those in the prior quarter. The earnings, at $0.37 per share, were also well below stock analysts' previous expectations of about $0.49 per share. When the market opened the following day, June 3, the price of Cabletron common stock fell from $45.75 to $30.35 per share. This was a one-day decline of approximately one-third of its value. Reported results for the June-August quarter were in line with expectations. However, on December 2, Cabletron reported earnings of $0.08 to $0.12 per share for the September-November quarter, again falling short of expectations. In the same announcement, Cabletron declared that it would take a charge against earnings of between $25 million and $30 million. Investors responded with another one-day sell-off on December 2, when the price per share fell from $23.1875 to $15.6875 in heavy trading. Over the class period as a whole, the price of Cabletron stock declined from a per share high of $46.50 to $15.6875, a total drop of almost 67 percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko filed this lawsuit soon thereafter. The complaint alleges that a variety of problems, well known to the leadership of the company, seriously threatened Cabletron's business at the time of the class period. Again, for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, we assume the allegations to be true. The company's ballyhooed new products, the SmartSwitch 6000 and SmartSwitch 2200, encountered two serious problems that greatly slowed their manufacture. The resulting delay in their commercial availability was a blow to a company relying on the SmartSwitch to fuel continued growth. The European sales force, which had contributed about twenty percent of revenues in the fiscal year that ended just before the class period, was being run by inexperienced managers who were in over their heads and unable to meet their goals. Cabletron's pricing became grossly out of line with its competitors. The company knowingly shipped products that still had unresolved defects. Market saturation, increased selling cycles, and the cancellation of Cabletron's cooperative relationship with its dominant market rival, Cisco Systems, also contributed to these woes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these \"adverse factors,\" the complaint alleges, the company's public statements were unremittingly optimistic, especially concerning its European operations and the SmartSwitch. Even when the company announced the surprising bad news about its quarterly earnings on June 2, management maintained its unjustifiable bright optimism and disclosed only part of the troubles facing Cabletron. The failure to disclose and the positive statements in the face of contrary knowledge were themselves securities law violations, the complaint alleges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even worse, Mesko alleges, the defendants tried to hide this downward spiral by fraudulently inflating the company's quarterly net revenue with a number of techniques, some blatant and some more subtle. These included booking entirely fictitious sales; making shipments late in one quarter, which had the effect of bumping up that quarter's revenue, while knowing that the goods would be returned during the next quarter; and setting aside newly received raw materials and booking them in a later quarter so that they would not appear as liabilities in the quarter when they actually arrived. The complaint supports these allegations by reference to one or more of a half dozen anonymous former Cabletron employees who say they have personal knowledge of the practices they describe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this frantic end-of-quarter fraud, the complaint alleges, thirty percent of shipments in the last weeks of a quarter were returned early in the following quarter, compared to a typical return rate of one to three percent at other times. In turn, the receiving department was \"probably the busiest department in the Company\" in the early days of a quarter, as employees logged numerous pallets of computer equipment, with total values between $160,000 and $1.2 million, back into the warehouse as returned merchandise. It is a reasonable inference that the timing of this disproportionate surge in returns was no coincidence, but was caused by attempts to inflate revenue in one quarter, albeit at the expense of the next one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint states that improperly recognized revenue from the different schemes totaled tens of millions of dollars during each of the fiscal quarters at issue. It derives this figure from estimates of two of its former employee sources, one who estimates that Cabletron improperly recognized revenue of between $20 million and $30 million per quarter, and another who estimates that the company processed as much as $100 million in \"phony\" orders during the quarter that ended just before the class period. The falsely inflated earnings figures that resulted from these improper practices were then used in Cabletron's filings with the SEC during the class period and in company press releases announcing quarterly results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The picture that emerges from the pleading as a whole portrays a frenzied effort by a troubled company to conceal its difficulties for as long as possible. Mesko's complaint suggests as scienter for this fraud that defendants wanted to keep the house of cards standing (perhaps expecting salvation from the SmartSwitch or other developments). The complaint also offers allegations of significant stock sales by corporate insiders taking their profits before the worst of the news was out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not difficult to conclude that such practices, if they went on, certainly add up to fraudulent and material misstatement. The question at this stage is not whether the practices occurred &#8212; defendants deny them and actual proof, not just allegations in a complaint, would be required before any conclusion about that question could be reached &#8212; but whether the pleadings accusing defendants of these practices meet the requirements of the PSLRA. Our holding that the complaint is sufficient returns the case to the district court, which ultimately will resolve the broader issues of culpability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elaborate on several categories of Mesko's allegations here, without reciting every claim in the 79-page complaint; we will add some details later when they become relevant to our analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Fictitious Sales</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most egregious examples of fraud alleged in the complaint accuse Cabletron of booking entirely fictitious sales. Each of these allegations is supported by reference to the anonymous former employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the complaint, the company wrote purchase orders for nonexistent sales of merchandise late in one quarter, and then logged the merchandise back in as if it had been returned after the next quarter began, when in fact the merchandise had never left the company's possession. These supposedly-sold items were held in various locations before being returned to inventory. Some were loaded onto as many as eight tractor-trailers that remained in the factory yard. Some were stored at selected employees' homes; the complaint provides the name and address of one employee who allegedly accepted such goods \"at the behest of\" defendant Craig Benson, the chairman of the board and chief operating officer. Some simply \"sat on the shelves or lay in the corridors\" of Cabletron's warehouse until after the quarter ended. This scheme allegedly extended, at the close of one quarter, to removing equipment from employees' desks and unfinished product from the company's labs, running it through this sold-and-returned routine, and then, after the quarter had ended, returning the same equipment &#8212; with identical serial numbers &#8212; to the offices and labs where they had originated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employees had to move this material and to log it back in when it was \"returned.\" Cabletron used a computer system called \"Intrepid\" to track orders and returns, and the fictitious sales and returns were logged into this system. The broader inference from all of these alleged activities is that, in order to inflate revenue, Cabletron used a variety of techniques to create the appearance of sales where no sales ever occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Inventory Parking and Channel-Stuffing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other merchandise left Cabletron's factories and warehouses but, the complaint alleges, it was still fraudulent for the company to count it as sold either because the sales were not bona fide, or because the customers had an unlimited right of return and those return rights were not disclosed to investors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges \"inventory parking\" arrangements with certain Cabletron customers, distributors, and resellers. Under these arrangements, they agreed to receive shipments of Cabletron products which they had not really ordered and would not really buy. One of the former employee sources named two locations in New Hampshire where inventory was parked: a \"warehouse near Brock's Lumber in Rochester\" and the grounds of a particular company in Somersworth. The complaint also reports rumors about inventory parking at other locations, including St. Louis and New York City.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron also allegedly engaged in \"channel stuffing,\" the practice of inducing distributors or wholesalers to buy Cabletron products in excess of their projected needs by promising them that the products could be returned \"at any time and for any reason if they were not sold.\" This allowed the company to \"dump excess inventories of Cabletron products for which there was no present demand\" and thereby convert the liability of unsold goods into the revenue of supposed sales. The complaint names five distributors who apparently participated in the practice. To support the channel stuffing allegation, the complaint cites former employees with personal knowledge of Cabletron's sales practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Defective and Premature Shipments</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other instances, Cabletron allegedly inflated revenue toward the end of a quarter by making shipments of products sold while knowing that they would not be accepted or would be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One variation of this theme involved shipping orders in quarters much earlier than the requested delivery dates. A former employee said the company sent the University of North Carolina a shipment worth $75 million to $80 million very early on three different occasions, each one just before the end of a quarter. A second employee agreed that the company \"regularly\" made such early shipments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, according to several former employees, Cabletron \"regularly\" sold computer equipment late in the quarter that still had unresolved bugs. Like the early shipments, Cabletron knew that this merchandise would be returned. One former employee specified AT &amp; T as a customer that had received such defective merchandise on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Artificially Reduced Costs</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron also overstated its net quarterly revenues by artificially reducing its costs, according to two employees cited in the complaint. Raw materials were held in trailers or on loading docks for weeks after they arrived rather than being booked in and transferred into storage immediately. These supplies were then moved in and booked as received on the first day of the next quarter, although they had actually been received during the prior quarter. This delay removed the expense of these purchases from the quarter when they would otherwise have appeared, thus inflating net revenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>SmartSwitch Problems</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the \"adverse factors\" noted earlier need little further explanation, but the company's difficulties with its new SmartSwitch products require some additional context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch line on March 3, 1997, the first day of the class period, with a glowing press release stating that the products \"set a new standard for price and performance.\" The complaint's quotes from various market analyst reports make it clear that investors considered the SmartSwitch an important aspect of Cabletron's future growth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Cabletron, SmartSwitch production immediately encountered two serious problems. First, supplies of two essential components for the SmartSwitch, one provided by Lucent Technologies and the other by LSI Logic, proved unreliable. Second, those units the company did manufacture were plagued by glitches involving their wiring. These wiring flaws were so widespread that the complaint alleges, citing two employees of whom at least one was personally familiar with the facts, that \"virtually every SmartSwitch manufactured from April to at least September 1997 was subject to individualized re-wiring by hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that these problems delayed the availability of the SmartSwitch during much of the class period, and that these delays damaged the company. Information about the problems was widely known within the company and was addressed extensively at weekly quality control meetings. The problems were also described in two internal Cabletron databases that were routinely circulated in hard copy to managers, including to defendants Levine, Benson, and Oliver. According to a former employee alleged to have personal knowledge, Benson directed that these reports should not be provided to salespersons \"in order to insulate them (and the Company's customers) from knowledge of problems relating to SmartSwitches.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Insider Stock Sales</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint points to stock sales by several of the individual defendants, during and after the class period, as evidence of scienter. These sales totaled over $180 million during the class period. Almost all of this amount was attributable to sales by Levine, who stepped down from his positions as president and chief executive officer and resigned his seat on the board of directors on or about August 6, 1997, midway through the class period. Between March 26, 1997 and the date of his resignation in August, Levine sold almost three million shares for a total of just over $89 million. Levine also sold another 2.7 million shares between September 24 and October 7, 1997, after he had left his executive positions, earning $88.7 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Levine, the complaint documents smaller stock sales by four other individual defendants during the class period. One sale was made by the chief financial officer, David J. Kirkpatrick, on September 24, 1997; the proceeds were $474,320. The remaining sales were made by the three defendants who served as outside directors on Cabletron's board: Paul R. Duncan, Donald F. McGuinness, and Michael D. Myerow. The sales by these three outside directors totaled $2.6 million. Duncan sold almost $1.6 million worth of stock on March 28, 1997. Also on March 28, McGuinness sold $66,000 worth of stock; he also sold $152,200 worth of stock on July 9, 1997. All the sales Myerow made during the class period were after the June disclosures by Cabletron; they added up to $796,570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree about how to calculate the percentage of the defendants' stock liquidated during the class period, but Mesko alleges that Levine, McGuinness, and Myerow each sold approximately one third of their Cabletron holdings, while Kirkpatrick and Duncan each sold over 90 percent of theirs. The complaint does not document any stock sales during the class period by either Benson or Oliver, the remaining individual defendants. It does note stock sales by Oliver in the four months prior to the class period, as well as by Levine, Kirkpatrick, Myerow, and McGuinness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the PSLRA, a securities fraud complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1). Furthermore, in order to state a claim of securities fraud, the statements alleged to be misleading must be misleading to a material degree. <i>See Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc.,</i> 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994). Finally, the PSLRA requires the complaint to state with particularity facts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter rather than merely a reasonable inference. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2); <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 185, 196-97 (1st Cir.1999). This last requirement alters the usual contours of a Rule 12(b)(6) ruling because, while a court continues to give all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs, those inferences supporting scienter must be strong ones. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201. The PSLRA did not, however, change significantly this circuit's previous underlying substantive standards for adequately pleaded securities fraud, which were already strict. <i>Id.</i> at 193-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Particularity of Fraud Pleadings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the complaint lacked the particularity required by the PSLRA in several ways, especially in its descriptions of confidential sources and its reliance on internal company reports. In addition, defendants argue that the total amount of detail provided in the complaint falls short of what is necessary to satisfy the particularity requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Use of Confidential Sources</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint details numerous statements which were made to Mesko's counsel by unnamed former Cabletron employees, and which are said to be based on the personal knowledge of these former employees. Many of its allegations are supported by reference to these anonymous statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether such statements are made \"on information and belief\" and the district court, as noted above, defined the concept inconsistently. This inconsistency mirrors the conflict in the caselaw. <i>Compare ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Group v. Tchuruk,</i> 291 F.3d 336, 351 &amp; n. 70 (5th Cir.2002) (defining \"information and belief\" in securities fraud pleading as any allegation made without plaintiffs' personal knowledge), <i>with In re Honeywell Int'l Sec. Litig.,</i> 182 F.Supp.2d 414, 426 (D.N.J.2002) (stating that some allegations made without plaintiffs' personal knowledge are not made on \"information and belief\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point is pertinent because of the especially heightened pleading standards that the PSLRA established for claims based on information and belief. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1); <i>ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 350 (\"[F]or allegations made on information and belief, the plaintiff must... state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed, <i>i.e.,</i> set forth a factual basis for such belief.\"). This circuit imposed a strict requirement on such claims under Rule 9(b) before enactment of the PSLRA. <i>Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,</i> 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Where allegations of fraud are ... based only on information and belief, the complaint must set forth the source of the information and the reasons for the belief.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without deciding the more general issue of whether confidential source pleadings in other contexts are made \"on information and belief,\" we hold that in the context of the PSLRA such confidential source allegations must comply with the standard described below, drawn from the Second Circuit's <i>Novak</i> decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We further hold that compliance with that standard constitutes compliance with the \"information and belief\" particularity requirements of section 78u-4(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has never interpreted the heightened pleading requirement for information and belief, either before the PSLRA or after it, as a per se rule that anonymous sources must be named at the pleading stage. The defendants suggest that we adopt such a per se rule, and cite the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Janas v. McCracken</i> (<i>In re Silicon Graphics Securities Litigation</i>), 183 F.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir.1999), as authority for doing so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Novak,</i> the Second Circuit took a more moderate view of section 78u-4(b)(1), rejecting</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any notion that confidential sources must be named as a general matter. In our view, notwithstanding the use of the word \"all,\" [section 78u-4(b)(1)] does not require that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or misleading statements are based. Rather, plaintiffs need only plead with particularity <i>sufficient</i> facts to support those beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 313-14; <i>accord ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 353; <i>cf. Fla. State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin.

Moreover, even if personal sources must be identified, there is no requirement that they be named, provided they are described in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged. In both of these situations, the plaintiffs will have pleaded enough facts to support their belief, even though some arguably relevant facts have been left out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314; <i>accord ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 352-53 (adopting <i>Novak</i>-type test); <i>see also Fitzer v. Sec. Dynamics Techs., Inc.,</i> 119 F.Supp.2d 12, 21-22 (D.Mass.2000) (following <i>Novak</i> test). The approach we take, similar to <i>Novak,</i> is to look at all of the facts alleged to see if they \"provide an adequate basis for believing that the defendants' statements were false.\" <i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314. This involves an evaluation, inter alia, of the level of detail provided by the confidential sources, the corroborative nature of the other facts alleged (including from other sources), the coherence and plausibility of the allegations, the number of sources, the reliability of the sources, and similar indicia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach, we think, better strikes the balance Congress intended in the PSLRA. The statute was designed to erect barriers to frivolous strike suits, but not to make meritorious claims impossible to bring. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 104-98, at 4 (1995), <i>reprinted in</i> 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 683 (stating that intent of PSLRA is \"combatting ... abuses, while maintaining the incentive for bringing meritorious actions\"); <i>ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 354 (noting that PSLRA \"was not enacted to raise the pleading burdens ... to such a level that facially valid claims, which are not brought for nuisance value or as leverage to obtain a favorable or inflated settlement, must be routinely dismissed\"). A blanket ban on unnamed sources presents obvious policy problems. Employees or others in possession of important information about corporate malfeasance may be discouraged from stepping forward if they must be identified at the earliest stage of a lawsuit. <i>See Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314. While we recognize that a case-by-case approach may provide less concrete guidance to district courts, the tension inherent in balancing the two congressional goals cannot be evaded by adopting an unnecessarily broad per se rule which may prevent pursuit of legitimate cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also support our conclusion with a helpful analogy from an entirely different field of law: courts' consideration of government requests for search warrants based on tips from confidential informants. Courts frequently allow such anonymously-provided information, if properly supported, to justify an otherwise problematic search. They examine carefully a variety of factors before doing so, including the basis offered for the informant's knowledge, the existence of other information corroborating the informant's allegations, and the amount of self-verifying detail provided in the allegations themselves. <i>E.g., United States v. Barnard,</i> 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996). None of these factors is dispositive, and all are weighed in the context of the \"`totality of the circumstances.'\" <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). The overlap between these considerations and those articulated in <i>Novak</i> further reinforces our view that courts can competently make a careful evaluation of securities fraud pleadings based on anonymous sources, and separate frivolous complaints from those with potential merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When these standards are applied to the complaint's allegations supported by anonymous sources, we find that they satisfy the test. Overall, the accumulated amount of detail the sources provide tends to be self-verifying; these are not conclusory allegations of fraud, but specific descriptions of the precise means through which it occurred, provided by persons said to have personal knowledge of them. In addition, the number of different sources helps the complaint meet the standard. Their consistent accounts reinforce one another and undermine any argument that the complaint relies unduly on the stories of just one or two former employees, possibly disgruntled. Furthermore, as employees who were familiar with the activities discussed &#8212; and the complaint notes specifically when there are exceptions to this characterization &#8212; the sources have a strong basis of knowledge for the claims they make. Finally, the sources also point to the startlingly large number of returns, which they had the experience to judge based on the level of activity in the warehouse and the number of returns employees entered into Intrepid. This unusual increase independently suggests suspicious activity of the kind they allege: a tenfold jump in return rates for products shipped late in the quarter, with pallets full of as many as forty pieces of expensive equipment coming back into inventory early in the following quarter, permits a strong inference that something was at least significantly different about sales booked late in the quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The level of specific detail about the fictitious sales is significant. Far from resting on mere assertions, the anonymous sources describe tractor-trailers in the factory yard, equipment \"borrowed\" from employees' desks to be fraudulently processed, and the unusual activity in the warehouse as products were shuttled back and forth. The sources provide the name and address of one employee who is said to have stashed goods in the garage of his home, and say that Benson told him to do so. There are multiple sources for many of the fictitious sales claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other categories of allegations with similar detail. The principal source for the inventory parking allegations names two particular locations where the parking is said to have occurred. The complaint names five distributors alleged to have participated in channel stuffing, and the allegations of channel stuffing rely on two sources with knowledge about sales practices in particular. As to the premature or defective shipments, the complaint cites four different employees, three with direct knowledge. Between them, they describe the widespread nature of the problem and also name specific customers (the University of North Carolina, AT &amp; T) who were affected. Two employees supply the information that the raw materials were not entered as received when they should have been, and note that they were entered on the first day of the following quarter, underscoring the likelihood that the purpose of the delay was inflation of quarterly net revenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the complaint provides enough particular details to meet the standards of the test we have adopted and justify the omission of sources' names at the pleading stage. These details amply supply \"facts on which that belief is formed\" as the PSLRA (and our precedent) require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Internal Company Reporting Systems</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the complaint provided too little detail about internal company documents to which it referred. Presumably, the court had in mind the complaint's references to the Intrepid order-processing system that would provide evidence about returns, the quality-control databases that informed individual defendants about SmartSwitch problems, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that merely stating the existence of efficient internal reporting systems in a conclusory fashion will not do much to increase the particularity of a securities fraud pleading. <i>See Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 1194, 1224 n. 38 (1st Cir.1996). Here, the complaint does more than that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pleadings about the Intrepid system show that former employees had to physically input returns; this is probative of the basis that anonymous sources had for recognizing the spike in returns early in the quarter. The quality-control databases serve a more important function, as discussed further below, because they help demonstrate knowledge of SmartSwitch problems on the part of Levine, Benson, and Oliver. The complaint also provides more substance about the contents of these systems. Unlike in <i>Shaw,</i> where we found that a plaintiff failed to provide any \"indication of the specific factual content of any single report generated by the alleged reporting system,\" <i>id.</i> (emphasis removed), the complaint here says that the two quality control databases (the \"Product Support Call Tracking Database\" and the \"Phone Support Database\") reported customer service problems related to the defective SmartSwitches. Thus, these databases serve as supporting evidence of Mesko's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Level of Particularity as a Whole</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that, even if the allegations supported by anonymous sources and internal documents are accepted, the complaint still leaves too many other unanswered questions &#8212; such as the precise dates of transactions, the names used for phony customers, the identities of corporate personnel involved, the specific products warehoused, or the exact dollar amounts of individual fraudulently recorded sales. As a result, defendants argue, the complaint does not satisfy the PSLRA's particularity requirements as interpreted in this circuit, particularly in <i>Greebel.</i> Their argument misapplies <i>Greebel</i> and our other caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants list factors found lacking in the complaint in <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203-04, as if they constituted a checklist for securities fraud complaints. We explicitly disavowed this interpretation in <i>Greebel</i> itself. 194 F.3d at 204 (\"We do not say that each of these particulars <i>must</i> appear in a complaint, but their complete absence in this case is indicative of the excessive generality of these allegations.\"). We have since repeated this clarification. <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the PSLRA, this circuit has adopted a fact-specific individual case analysis in preference to a list of factors required to be pled. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196, 204. Here, the complaint does include some of the factors missing in <i>Greebel;</i> the absence of others is not decisive. Each securities fraud complaint must be analyzed on its own facts; there is no one-size-fits-all template. Sufficient evidence of one type might reduce or eliminate the need for evidence in other categories, without thwarting the legislative intent behind the PSLRA. As the Sixth Circuit put it, \"In enacting the PSLRA, Congress was concerned with the quantum, not type, of proof.\" <i>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> 251 F.3d 540, 551 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc) (adopting \"fact-specific approach\" from <i>Greebel</i>). Because a categorical approach is not appropriate, courts will allow private securities fraud complaints to advance past the pleadings stage when some questions remained unanswered, provided the complaint as a whole is sufficiently particular to pass muster under the PSLRA. <i>See, e.g., Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79-82 (failure of complaint to document precise amounts of overstatements of revenue not fatal); <i>Hollin v. Scholastic Corp. (In re Scholastic Corp. Sec. Litig.</i>), 252 F.3d 63, 72-74 (2d Cir. 2001) (allegations of longer-term trends adequate to plead inferences about activity during particular month); <i>Rothman v. Gregor,</i> 220 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir.2000) (complaint need not \"fix the exact date and time that [defendants] became aware\" of information that rendered their accounting practices misleading, because it adequately alleged awareness within necessary time frame); <i>In re No. Nine Visual Tech. Corp. Sec. Litig.,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d 1, 26-27 (D.Mass.1999) (complaint survives PSLRA scrutiny despite failure of complaint to document precise amount of overstatement of inventory or to tie knowledge of inventory problems to specific defendants). In contrast, in many cases where we have upheld dismissal of securities fraud pleadings, we have described the allegations they made as very general or even conclusory. <i>See, e.g., Maldonado v.</i> <i>Dominguez,</i> 137 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1998) (\"When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find that there are no specific allegations [of scienter].\"); <i>Suna v. Bailey Corp.,</i> 107 F.3d 64, 71 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Appellants offer no factual support for their conclusory allegations....\"); <i>Gross v. Summa Four, Inc.,</i> 93 F.3d 987, 996 (1st Cir.1996) (\"In this case, Gross has failed to allege any particulars to support his general allegation of inflated earnings through the use of improper accounting methods.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another difference between <i>Greebel</i> and the result in this case is the amount of discovery that had been completed on particular fraud allegations when the complaint was evaluated. The district court in <i>Greebel</i> had already permitted limited discovery before granting a motion to dismiss. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 188. The complaint had originally relied on a source to support an allegation that the defendant company fraudulently altered its books. The district court did not dismiss the complaint at that juncture. It did so only after limited discovery revealed that plaintiffs could not offer this source as a witness capable of testifying about the allegation at trial, and after they failed to produce adequate additional evidence. In <i>Greebel,</i> we said that both the original denial of a motion to dismiss (before discovery) and the subsequent dismissal (after some limited discovery) were correct. <i>Id.</i> at 207. Similarly, in <i>Gross,</i> the district court had granted the plaintiff limited discovery and even an opportunity to amend his complaint afterward. 93 F.3d at 990. The company then moved to dismiss, the district court granted the motion, and this court affirmed, noting key details that were still lacking in the complaint even after the focused discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the particularity requirements apply before any discovery has been conducted &#8212; indeed, the PSLRA itself stays all discovery, with certain narrow exceptions, during the pendency of any motion to dismiss. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(3)(B). But the difference in discovery is relevant to a court's evaluation of sufficient particularity. In short, under our circuit law, the procedural posture of the case matters, and we will scrutinize a post-discovery motion to dismiss even more stringently than a pre-discovery motion. <i>See Cooperman v. Individual Inc.,</i> 171 F.3d 43, 48-49 &amp; n. 8 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 81 (distinguishing <i>Greebel</i> on basis of difference in amount of discovery); <i>Maldonado,</i> 137 F.3d at 9 (noting limit on expectations of securities fraud pleadings when discovery is incomplete); <i>Glassman v. Computervision Corp.,</i> 90 F.3d 617, 630 (1st Cir.1996) (collecting cases in various areas of law where courts considered amount of discovery completed when evaluating motion to dismiss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to this complaint, this court has said repeatedly that the rigorous standards for pleading securities fraud do not require a plaintiff to plead evidence. <i>See Cooperman,</i> 171 F.3d at 48-49; <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225. Defendants' argument that even more detail be required, before there is any discovery, here amounts to requiring plaintiffs to plead evidence. The fraud allegations advanced in this complaint, with their consistent details provided from at least half a dozen different sources across various alleged schemes, reinforce each other and suggest reliability of the information reported. The complaint satisfies the PSLRA's particularity requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Identification of Materially Misleading Statements</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having jumped the first hurdle by pleading fraud with particularity, Mesko must identify the specific statements rendered materially misleading by the fraud he has pleaded. A fact is material if it is substantially likely \"that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the `total mix' of information made available.\" <i>Basic Inc. v. Levinson,</i> 485 U.S. 224, 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988) (quoting <i>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976)). Information which \"would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of a reasonable shareholder\" is material. <i>TSC Indus.,</i> 426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126. In general, the materiality of a statement or omission is a question of fact that should normally be left to a jury rather than resolved by the court on a motion to dismiss. <i>See Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, Inc.,</i> 36 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.1994). Thus, we review the complaint only to determine that it pleads the existence of such statements and presents a plausible jury question of materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint describes three categories of statements that it alleges were materially misleading: (1) Cabletron's financial report filings with the SEC; (2) direct statements made by Cabletron officials, either in press releases or in direct quotes in the media; and (3) statements made by stock analysts and journalists, allegedly echoing statements made to them by defendants. According to the district court, the complaint listed three statements in the first category, eight statements in the second, and twenty-five statements in the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>SEC Filings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron made its required filings with the SEC during the class period: its Form 10-K for the fiscal year that ended on February 28, 1997, its Form 10-Q for the March-May 1997 quarter, and its Form 10-Q for the June-August 1997 quarter. The Form 10-K was signed by all of the individual defendants except for Oliver, while each Form 10-Q was signed by Benson and Kirkpatrick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko asserts that, because of the fraudulent revenue recognition practices discussed in Part II.A of this opinion, these SEC filings did not reflect Cabletron's true earnings, rendering them materially misleading.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> More specifically, Mesko alleges that the practices violated the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which \"embody the prevailing principles, conventions, and procedures defined by the accounting industry from time to time.\" <i>Young v. Lepone,</i> 305 F.3d 1, 5 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see generally Migliaccio v. K-Tel Int'l, Inc. (In re K-tel Int'l, Inc. Sec. Litig.</i>), 300 F.3d 881, 889-90 (8th Cir.2002) (elaborating on multiple and potentially conflicting sources of GAAP). Under SEC regulations, Mesko notes, filings that do not comply with GAAP \"will be presumed to be misleading and inaccurate.\" 17 C.F.R. &#167; 210.4-01(a)(1). As a result, Mesko says, Cabletron's SEC filings during the class period were unlawfully false and misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merely stating in conclusory fashion that a company's books are out of compliance with GAAP would not in itself demonstrate liability under section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. <i>See Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 362. Indeed, some techniques that result in early booking of sales, such as channel stuffing, might prove to be entirely legitimate, depending on the specific facts. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, Mesko alleges that Cabletron's revenue was fraudulently inflated by tens of millions of dollars per quarter. Given that Cabletron's quarterly revenue ranged from $371 million to $381 million during the class period, reasonable investors unquestionably might consider a difference of such magnitude material. Accurate earnings figures are vital aspects of the \"total mix of information\" which investors would consult when evaluating Cabletron's stock. Furthermore, the nature of much of the alleged inaccuracy in earnings derives from systematic fraud, described in detail, that extends to completely fictitious sales. This distinguishes it from cases where the alleged GAAP violation consisted merely of questionable bookkeeping practices. <i>Cf., e.g., Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 995-96 (recognition of revenue at time of order rather than at time of shipment, allegedly in violation of GAAP, held insufficient where plaintiff \"failed to allege any particulars to support his general allegation\"); <i>Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 362 (allocation of losses to wrong fiscal quarters, absent other pleadings of fraud, fails to state claim even if in violation of GAAP). Mesko has adequately pled that the fraudulent revenue recognition rendered Cabletron's SEC filings materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Other Direct Public Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to SEC filings, Cabletron and its executives made other direct statements to the public during the class period that the complaint alleges were materially misleading. This court has previously attributed direct quotes of company officials in the news media to the company, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79-80, and does so again here. The direct statements catalogued in the complaint include: press releases announcing earnings, public statements about the availability of the SmartSwitch, and general optimistic statements about Cabletron's health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Cabletron issued press releases during the class period to announce earnings figures for each quarter. The complaint alleges that these press releases were misleading for the same reason as the SEC filings: they announced figures that reflected fraudulently inflated revenue, and thereby misstated Cabletron's true earnings for each of these quarters. The same analysis we applied to the SEC filings demonstrates the materiality of these alleged misstatements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the complaint alleges that public statements about the SmartSwitch were materially misleading because they gave the impression that production and distribution of this important new product were \"ramping up\" smoothly when this was not so. However, it specifically identifies only a small number of such statements attributable to Cabletron directly (as opposed to third-party statements, which we discuss below).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> These are: a press release issued when Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch on March 3, 1997, the first day of the class period; direct quotes in a trade publication article on March 17, 1997 suggesting that the product was then available; and a media interview with Benson on July 14, 1997 in which he predicted that SmartSwitch problems would be resolved by September.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko has not shown why any of these three statements were materially misleading when they were made. The complaint fails to demonstrate that the problems which later plagued the SmartSwitch were known to the individual defendants by mid-March, when the first two statements were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The supply delays might or might not have been visible to defendants by then, but in any event it may also have been reasonable to believe they would soon be resolved. Even Mesko's own sources state that the manual rewiring to resolve mechanical flaws began in April, not March. The third statement, made by Benson in July, was simply an optimistic forward-looking prediction about the timeline for resolving SmartSwitch problems, and Mesko does not even allege that this timeline was not met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, however, Cabletron's direct statements created the impression that the SmartSwitch was already commercially available on a large scale, the company may then have had a duty to revise that impression if later developments substantially undermined the accuracy of the earlier statements. <i>See Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 992 (citing <i>Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc.,</i> 814 F.2d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir.1987)). While a company need not reveal every piece of information that affects anything said before, it must disclose facts, \"if any, that are needed so that what was revealed [before] would not be `so incomplete as to mislead.'\" <i>Backman v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc) (quoting <i>SEC v. Tex. Gulf Sulphur Co.,</i> 401 F.2d 833, 862 (2d Cir.1968)). Seen in this light, the complaint establishes a reasonable inference of a material <i>omission</i> which, if borne out by evidence, would present a question of fact for a jury. On remand, these allegations should be allowed to proceed on that more limited basis, that is, not as statements misleading when made, but as statements potentially requiring revision in light of subsequent developments. <i>See generally</i> G.S. Porter, <i>What Did You Know and When Did You Know It?: Public Company Disclosure and the Mythical Duties to Correct and Update,</i> 68 Fordham L.Rev. 2199, 2228-30 (2000) (expressing general skepticism about duty to correct but envisioning scenario similar to this one in which it might rightfully apply).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint alleges that other direct statements by Cabletron were unduly optimistic in light of the mounting difficulties facing the company. Mesko argues that adverse factors other than the SmartSwitch delays should have been disclosed earlier or more fully. For example, the complaint calls the June 2, 1997 press release that made partial disclosures of Cabletron's problems materially misleading, because it failed to disclose the full extent of those problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants accurately argue that Cabletron was under no obligation to disclose information on industry-wide trends that was available to the public. Some of the complaint's adverse factors, such as the split with Cisco Systems and the increased market saturation, fall into this category. More fundamentally, the complaint lacks the level of detail in these allegations that it provides elsewhere, and fails to plead with sufficient particularity that the adverse factors were known to Cabletron but were contemporaneously concealed from the public. Rather, the adverse factors are gleaned from the company's disclosures, which are then alleged to be too little, too late. \"[P]laintiffs may not simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they should have been made earlier.\" <i>Berliner v. Lotus Dev. Corp.,</i> 783 F.Supp. 708, 710 (D.Mass.1992). Standing alone, such circular assertions represent little more than the type of \"fraud by hindsight\" pleading that we have long rejected. <i>See, e.g., Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 991; <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, however, the complaint also relies on these adverse factors to supply a reason for the revenue-padding at the heart of plaintiffs' case, and as context for understanding it, rather than as independent grounds for pleading fraud. As the rationale for the other fraudulent actions, these adverse factors help support scienter, and should be considered as such on remand. <i>Cf. No. Nine,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d at 26 (using allegations advanced in complaint primarily to show scienter as means to support particularity holding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Third-Party Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint catalogues many statements about Cabletron in reports published by market analysts. It also cites a few business news stories about Cabletron. Mesko alleges that the third parties who made these statements &#8212; market analysts or journalists &#8212; based them on statements that had been made to them by defendants or by other agents of Cabletron, so that the latter are responsible for their materially misleading content. Defendants respond that they have no liability for statements made by third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have utilized a two-prong test to analyze these statements, requiring that defendants either \"controlled\" the third party's statements or that they \"adopted\" the statements after they were made. The court then found that the complaint had not satisfied either of these conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> We reject the district court's rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A majority of courts has analyzed third-party statements by applying the \"entanglement\" test developed by the Second Circuit. <i>Elkind,</i> 635 F.2d at 163. <i>See generally</i> 2 H.S. Bloomenthal, <i>Securities Law Handbook</i> &#167; 27.10(4) (2002 ed.) (collecting cases). District courts in this circuit have also employed this test, while recognizing that we have not yet embraced it. <i>See, e.g., Carney v. Cambridge Tech. Partners, Inc.,</i> 135 F.Supp.2d 235, 248 &amp; n. 7 (D.Mass.2001); <i>No. Nine,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d at 30-31; <i>Schaffer v. Timberland Co.,</i> 924 F.Supp. 1298, 1310 (D.N.H.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now hold that the entanglement test is the correct approach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> This test requires the plaintiff to demonstrate the defendants' involvement with third-party statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[L]iability may attach to an analyst's statements where the defendants have expressly or impliedly adopted the statements, placed their imprimatur on the statements, or have otherwise entangled themselves with the analysts to a significant degree.... [T]he court will determine whether the complaint contains allegations which, favorably construed and viewed in the context of the entire pleading, could establish a significant and specific, not merely a casual or speculative, entanglement between the defendants and the analysts with respect to the statements at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Schaffer,</i> 924 F.Supp. at 1310. Entanglement also includes situations where company officials \"intentionally foster a mistaken belief concerning a material fact.\" <i>Elkind,</i> 635 F.2d at 163-64. As this articulation of the test makes clear, the district court erred when it required that defendants \"controlled\" third-party statements. Nonetheless, an entanglement claim will be rejected if it merely suggests or assumes that company insiders provided the information on which analysts or other outsiders based their reports. <i>See Suna,</i> 107 F.3d at 73-74; <i>No. Nine,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the third-party statements cited in the complaint do satisfy the entanglement test. To give examples of two such statements, without reaching the further question of whether they were misleading, the complaint alleges that an analyst report issued on March 25, 1997 stated, on the basis of information from Levine and other Cabletron executives, that the SmartSwitch 6000 would \"ship in volume in the second week of April.\" Further, a May 13 analyst report, based on a presentation by a named Cabletron official responsible for investor relations, stated that the SmartSwitch products were \"ramping according to plan,\" which by mid-May seems clearly not to have been so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entanglement test separates mere salesmanship from fraudulent misrepresentation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> A test that required \"control\" would give company officials too much leeway to commit fraud on the market by using analysts as their mouthpieces. <i>Elkind</i> and its progeny set a better boundary.

Morales Olazabal, <i>The Search for \"Middle Ground\": Towards A Harmonized Interpretation of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act's New Pleading Standard,</i> 6 Stan. J.L. Bus. &amp; Fin. 153, 187-88 (2001) (\"[T]he obvious should not go unstated, and that is that allegations of intentionally fraudulent conduct also will permit the drawing of a strong inference of scienter.\"). Accusations of warehousing of the sort plaintiffs make here are \"very serious.\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 202. Significant GAAP violations also \"could provide evidence of scienter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 203. \"[A]ccounting shenanigans\" are among the characteristic types of circumstances which may demonstrate scienter for securities fraud. <i>See Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> 249 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko's complaint makes adequate particularized allegations of large-scale fraudulent practices over time. In such circumstances, these and similar cases make it difficult to escape a strong inference of the type of recklessness concerning wrongdoing that amounts to scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other allegations also add to a strong inference of scienter. The complaint alleges that Benson specifically directed some of the fraudulent warehousing activities at the heart of the complaint. Again, he may have done no such thing, but we must take the allegations in the complaint as true. It also alleges that many people within the company &#8212; including Levine, Benson, and Oliver &#8212; received regular information about the SmartSwitch problems which they should have realized contradicted the company's public statements about the rollout of the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the complaint identifies concealment of the serious and worsening deterioration of Cabletron's financial health as a significant motive for the alleged fraud. <i>Cf. Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 83 (scienter supported by corporate officers' understanding that rollout of new product was \"important to their own survival and that of the company\"); <i>Nathenson v. Zonagen, Inc.,</i> 267 F.3d 400, 425 (5th Cir.2001) (scienter for misstatements about patent supported by fact that company's future depended on patent). Indeed, it appears that Levine, a cofounder of the company, was forced out of management as the magnitude of Cabletron's problems began to come to light, thus confirming that these motivating fears were realistic. This is more than the usual concern by executives to improve financial results; the executives' careers and the very survival of the company were on the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And if these interrelated facts and circumstances still were not enough to give rise to a strong inference of scienter, the complaint adds its allegations of insider trading. Stock sales by insiders can supply evidence of scienter. \"The vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal to strong.\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98 (citations omitted). Here, the insider trading allegations add some weight to the other evidence of scienter, and we need not determine whether alone they would suffice. Levine made the overwhelming majority of the sales, and his resignation provides a plausible innocent explanation for large stock sales. <i>Id.</i> at 206 (\"It is not unusual for individuals leaving a company ... to sell shares.\"). Still, the approximately $177 million he gained from stock sales can be a powerful incentive. It is also true, as defendants point out, that many of the sales, by both Levine and others, occurred after Cabletron's disclosures in early June 1997, even though the share price was significantly higher before this time. The insider trading allegations nonetheless provide additional ballast to Mesko's argument for scienter. They suggest further motive for securities fraud, and they combine with other aspects of the complaint to produce a strong inference of scienter overall. <i>See Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1224 (although allegations of smaller-scale insider trading did not show scienter on their own, they \"provide some support\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the allegations of the complaint as a whole &#8212; and as true &#8212; we find that it is not only a reasonable inference but a strong one that defendants possessed a state of mind giving rise to a securities fraud claim, if fraud was committed. Each individual fact about scienter may provide only a brushstroke, but the resulting portrait satisfies the requirement for a strong inference of scienter under the PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Pleading of Individual Defendants' Liability</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we analyze here how the section 10(b) claim in the complaint survives, with one exception, against each individual defendant. Again, we do not state that the allegations are true, nor do we imply anything about those allegations we do not name in this summary; we merely show why the complaint is sufficient as to each defendant to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint asserts that, under the so-called group pleading presumption, the court need not consider the liability of each individual defendant, but may attribute all the statements to all the defendants as \"collective actions.\" This circuit has recognized a very limited version of the group pleading doctrine for securities fraud. <i>See Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 367-68 (dismissal inappropriate where defendants signed annual report and allegedly had access to contrary information). There is presently great debate about the doctrine's continued existence after enactment of the PSLRA. <i>See generally In re Raytheon Sec. Litig.,</i> 157 F.Supp.2d 131, 152-53 (D.Mass.2001) (collecting cases and concluding that presumption survives); W.O. Fisher, <i>Don't Call Me a Securities Law Groupie: The Rise and Possible Demise of the \"Group Pleading\" Protocol in 10b-5 Cases,</i> 56 Bus. Law. 991 (2001) (reviewing cases and arguing that PSLRA undermines doctrine). For purposes of this opinion, we will set the issue aside without deciding it, because we determine without reference to the group pleading presumption whether the complaint states a claim against each defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron itself is the clearest. Most of the potentially actionable statements in the complaint, including the SEC filings and the press releases, were company documents. The scienter alleged against the company's agents is enough to plead scienter for the company. Mesko has thereby stated a claim against Cabletron that survives the PSLRA's pleading requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levine and Kirkpatrick, officers of the company, are both alleged to have had access to information contrary to the company's public statements, to have participated in a number of the statements (including signing both the Form 10-K and the two Forms 10-Q) and to have made significant stock sales. Benson, also an officer, did not sell stock or sign the 10-Q, but was alleged to have directed some of the fraudulent practices surrounding fictitious sales and also to have ordered negative information about the SmartSwitch withheld from sales personnel. The complaint against each of them also survives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case against the three outside directors &#8212; Duncan, McGuinness, and Myerow &#8212; presents a closer call, but on balance we believe the complaint also suffices in its claims against them. Each signed the Form 10-K and accepted responsibility for its contents. <i>See Howard v. Everex Sys., Inc.,</i> 228 F.3d 1057, 1061-62 (9th Cir.2000) (holding outside directors responsible for SEC filings they signed). Each is alleged to have made stock sales that contribute to a strong inference of scienter against them. Given the pre-discovery posture of this case, the overall complaint's survival under the PSLRA, and the possibility that these three defendants also face control person liability under section 20(a), as explained below, we reverse the dismissal of the case against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, unlike the outside director defendants, Oliver did not sign the Form 10-K or trade Cabletron stock during the class period. Oliver did receive reports from the quality control databases. Unlike the other officers, however, the complaint fails to connect him specifically to any of the materially misleading statements that we have found survive the PSLRA pleading requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Consequently, we affirm the dismissal of the section 10(b) claim against Oliver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties did not brief the question of how the section 20(a) claims of control person liability<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> against each of the individual defendants should be resolved if this court reversed dismissal of the section 10(b) claims, as we have done; in such circumstances we think the best course is to remand those section 20(a) claims as well. <i>See Scholastic,</i> 252 F.3d at 77-78 (remanding section 20(a) claims when reversing dismissal of primary liability claims, because district court had based section 20(a) dismissal on primary liability dismissal); <i>Nathenson,</i> 267 F.3d at 426 n. 29 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Control is a question of fact that \"will not ordinarily be resolved summarily at the pleading stage.\" 2 T.L. Hazen, <i>Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation</i> &#167; 12.24(1) (4th ed.2002). The issue raises a number of complexities that should not be resolved on such an underdeveloped record. Since the section 20(a) claims involve most of the same defendants who remain in the case by virtue of our section 10(b) ruling, the practical effect of reinstating them at this stage is small. There is a reasonable inference in the complaint that Oliver may have controlled persons responsible for promulgating misleading information about the SmartSwitch, so we remand the section 20(a) claim against him as well. On remand, those individual defendants who wish to challenge their liability under section 20(a) may, of course, do so explicitly. Likewise, Mesko may augment his argument for control person liability against the defendants, and particularly against the outside directors and Oliver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko objects to the recusals by Judge DiClerico and Chief Judge Torres and asks that this case be remanded to Judge DiClerico because his recusal was inappropriate. Mesko failed to raise concerns about these recusals at the time they occurred.

Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992). The circumstances here were hardly extraordinary. As first one judge and then the other considered recusal, Mesko \"made not a murmur.\" <i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> 934 F.2d 383, 384 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even under normal circumstances, with an objection preserved, a district court judge's decision to disqualify himself or herself is reviewed under the same abuse of discretion standard used to evaluate refusals to recuse. <i>United States v.

The standard is deferential in part because these sensitive decisions often require a complex balancing of multiple factors. Judge DiClerico and Chief Judge Torres both gave thorough consideration to their recusal decisions. Chief Judge Torres specifically weighed the advice of the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, which has issued a helpful advisory opinion about recusal decisions in a class action context. <i>See</i> Comm. on Codes of Conduct, Adv. Op. No. 99 (July 12, 2000), <i>at</i> http://www.uscourts.gov/guide/vol2/99.html.

By reinstating the case and returning it to the district court, we hold only that the complaint presents a sufficient pleading of fraud to avoid dismissal at this stage. \"Where there is smoke, there is not always fire.\" <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 85; <i>see Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 365-66 (\"Despite our conclusion that certain allegations survive threshold consideration, we note that plaintiffs remain a great distance from actually proving securities fraud.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court may, in its discretion, limit or structure discovery so that potentially dispositive issues are addressed first. <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 85.

The district court, acting under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), dismissed the complaint. We differ with the district court concerning certain tests to be applied in assessing securities fraud claims and in construction of our precedent. We conclude that the complaint as a whole complies with the PSLRA in sufficient part, and we reverse the dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings, with the exception that we affirm dismissal of one of the two claims against defendant Christopher J. Oliver. Our ruling does not mean that plaintiffs' claims have any merit. It means only that the claims are not to be dismissed at this very early stage. Nothing has been proven yet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charles Mesko and other investors filed a class action suit against Cabletron Systems, Inc. and seven individuals who served as executives or directors of Cabletron.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Mesko alleged violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2002). Plaintiffs purchased Cabletron stock, or bought call options or sold put options for Cabletron stock, between March 3, 1997 and December 2, 1997 (the \"class period\"). The first consolidated amended complaint was rejected for failing to meet the standards of the PSLRA, but Mesko was granted leave to amend it. He did, and the district court then ruled that this second consolidated amended complaint (the \"complaint\") satisfied the requirements of the PSLRA. After the judge who issued this ruling died, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the first district judge's ruling, a successor district judge granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. This dismissal occurred before discovery was conducted or any class was certified. The district court held that the complaint fails the particularity test for pleading fraud, that it fails to allege facts supporting a belief that the misstatements were material, and that the pleadings do not raise a strong inference of scienter. We disagree on all three points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the particularity ruling, it is unclear if the district court held that any pleading based upon confidential sources would fail the PSLRA's pleading requirements, thus adopting the rule from a case it cited, <i>In re Silicon Graphics Securities Litigation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639714\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639714/in-re-silicon-graphics-inc-securities-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 763-64 (N.D.Cal.1997), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765192\"><a href=\"/opinion/765192/in-re-silicon-graphics-inc-securities-litigation-edmund-j-janas-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 985 (9th Cir.1999). Alternatively, the court may have utilized a rule that allows confidential sources if there are other specific facts alleged, but then determined that this complaint lacked such facts. We reject the <i>Silicon Graphics</i> per se test forbidding PSLRA pleadings based on confidential sources, and instead adopt a test similar to the Second Circuit's test in <i>Novak v. Kasaks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769157\"><a href=\"/opinion/769157/carol-novak-robert-nieman-joseph-desena-on-behalf-of-themselves-and-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 314 (2nd Cir.2000). Applying that test, we find there was sufficient detail in the allegations, including those made by confidential sources, to permit the complaint to go forward. We also hold, contrary to the district court, that the complaint provides adequate information concerning internal company documents on which it relies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to materially misleading statements, the district court erred in the overly restrictive test it applied to statements made by third parties &#8212; in this instance mostly market analysts &#8212; which were in turn based on statements made by company officials. We reject the district court's determination that the defendants must have either \"controlled\" the content of the third party statements or adopted them. Instead we join the majority of courts in applying the \"entanglement\" test first articulated in <i>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384555\"><a href=\"/opinion/384555/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97716-arnold-b-elkind/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 163 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to both materiality and scienter, we conclude that the pertinent portions of the complaint sufficiently meet pleading requirements at this stage of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the allegations are stronger than others, and those against the defendant outside directors present a close call, we conclude that the complaint as a whole states a claim against Cabletron and against all but one of the individual defendants. As to that defendant, Oliver, the director of engineering and manufacturing, we affirm dismissal of the section 10(b) claim against him but not dismissal of the section 20(a) claim. We reverse the remainder of the district court decision and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to appealing the dismissal of the complaint, Mesko asks this court to remand the case to a district judge who had previously recused himself, on the basis that his disqualification was improper. We deny this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko filed his original complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, where the case was assigned to the late Judge Shane Devine. On December 23, 1998, in response to defendants' motion to dismiss, Judge Devine ruled that Mesko's first consolidated amended complaint lacked enough detail concerning statements made \"on information and belief\" to survive heightened pleading standards under the PSLRA, but granted Mesko leave to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko amended the complaint by adding sources for the allegations pled, particularly \"more than a half dozen former Cabletron employees who worked at the Company during the Class Period.\" Judge Devine accepted these changes in a one-page order on February 4, 1999, writing, \"The court has reviewed the complaint and is satisfied that it meets the PSLRA's requirements relative to pleadings based on information and belief.\" His order invited defendants to either renew their motion to dismiss or file an answer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Shortly after Judge Devine passed away on February 22, 1999, the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was then reassigned several times as the result of recusals. First it went before Judge Joseph A. DiClerico Jr., who recused himself from the case because he owned stock in companies that were defendants in other securities class actions brought by plaintiffs' counsel or their firms. One of defendants' attorneys was on the recusal lists of the two other federal district judges in the District of New Hampshire. Therefore, the case was transferred to the District of Rhode Island for assignment to a judge there, sitting by designation in the District of New Hampshire, which retained jurisdiction. The case was then assigned to Chief Judge Ernest C. Torres, but, like Judge DiClerico, he owned stock in several corporations against which counsel in this case had brought securities litigation, and he too disqualified himself. The case was finally reassigned once more, to Judge Mary M. Lisi. Neither party objected to any of these recusals at the time they occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Lisi heard oral argument on the defendants' motion to dismiss on November 7, 2000. During oral argument, she asked Mesko to provide a list of those paragraphs in the complaint that are based on information and belief. Mesko did so on November 13, indicating that four of the 126 paragraphs are based on information and belief; he attributed most of the others to either a document or a witness who had spoken to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On May 23, 2001, Judge Lisi granted the motion to dismiss, determining that the complaint failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the dismissal is grounded in Rule 12(b)(6), the facts pled in the complaint are taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <i>See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199878\"><a href=\"/opinion/199878/aldridge-v-at-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Doe v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198664\"><a href=\"/opinion/198664/doe-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1999)) (applying standard in PSLRA case). We describe the facts in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron, now renamed, was a publicly-traded corporation registered in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In 1997, at the beginning of the class period, Cabletron was among the nation's leading manufacturers and vendors of equipment for large enterprise computer networks, such as local area network and wide area network switches, as well as related hardware, software, and consulting services. Its customers included sizable corporations, universities, and government entities. For the quarter ending on February 28, 1997, immediately before the class period, Cabletron reported strong financial performance, including a twenty-six percent increase in net sales. In a company press release, S. Robert Levine, the president and chief executive officer, said these results represented Cabletron's \"thirty-second quarter of consecutive record growth, the strongest and steadiest earnings growth rate among all S &amp; P 500 companies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These impressive numbers did not last. After the market closed on June 2, 1997, Cabletron announced that its earnings for the March-May 1997 quarter were less than those in the prior quarter. The earnings, at $0.37 per share, were also well below stock analysts' previous expectations of about $0.49 per share. When the market opened the following day, June 3, the price of Cabletron common stock fell from $45.75 to $30.35 per share. This was a one-day decline of approximately one-third of its value. Reported results for the June-August quarter were in line with expectations. However, on December 2, Cabletron reported earnings of $0.08 to $0.12 per share for the September-November quarter, again falling short of expectations. In the same announcement, Cabletron declared that it would take a charge against earnings of between $25 million and $30 million. Investors responded with another one-day sell-off on December 2, when the price per share fell from $23.1875 to $15.6875 in heavy trading. Over the class period as a whole, the price of Cabletron stock declined from a per share high of $46.50 to $15.6875, a total drop of almost 67 percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko filed this lawsuit soon thereafter. The complaint alleges that a variety of problems, well known to the leadership of the company, seriously threatened Cabletron's business at the time of the class period. Again, for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, we assume the allegations to be true. The company's ballyhooed new products, the SmartSwitch 6000 and SmartSwitch 2200, encountered two serious problems that greatly slowed their manufacture. The resulting delay in their commercial availability was a blow to a company relying on the SmartSwitch to fuel continued growth. The European sales force, which had contributed about twenty percent of revenues in the fiscal year that ended just before the class period, was being run by inexperienced managers who were in over their heads and unable to meet their goals. Cabletron's pricing became grossly out of line with its competitors. The company knowingly shipped products that still had unresolved defects. Market saturation, increased selling cycles, and the cancellation of Cabletron's cooperative relationship with its dominant market rival, Cisco Systems, also contributed to these woes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these \"adverse factors,\" the complaint alleges, the company's public statements were unremittingly optimistic, especially concerning its European operations and the SmartSwitch. Even when the company announced the surprising bad news about its quarterly earnings on June 2, management maintained its unjustifiable bright optimism and disclosed only part of the troubles facing Cabletron. The failure to disclose and the positive statements in the face of contrary knowledge were themselves securities law violations, the complaint alleges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even worse, Mesko alleges, the defendants tried to hide this downward spiral by fraudulently inflating the company's quarterly net revenue with a number of techniques, some blatant and some more subtle. These included booking entirely fictitious sales; making shipments late in one quarter, which had the effect of bumping up that quarter's revenue, while knowing that the goods would be returned during the next quarter; and setting aside newly received raw materials and booking them in a later quarter so that they would not appear as liabilities in the quarter when they actually arrived. The complaint supports these allegations by reference to one or more of a half dozen anonymous former Cabletron employees who say they have personal knowledge of the practices they describe.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of this frantic end-of-quarter fraud, the complaint alleges, thirty percent of shipments in the last weeks of a quarter were returned early in the following quarter, compared to a typical return rate of one to three percent at other times. In turn, the receiving department was \"probably the busiest department in the Company\" in the early days of a quarter, as employees logged numerous pallets of computer equipment, with total values between $160,000 and $1.2 million, back into the warehouse as returned merchandise. It is a reasonable inference that the timing of this disproportionate surge in returns was no coincidence, but was caused by attempts to inflate revenue in one quarter, albeit at the expense of the next one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint states that improperly recognized revenue from the different schemes totaled tens of millions of dollars during each of the fiscal quarters at issue. It derives this figure from estimates of two of its former employee sources, one who estimates that Cabletron improperly recognized revenue of between $20 million and $30 million per quarter, and another who estimates that the company processed as much as $100 million in \"phony\" orders during the quarter that ended just before the class period. The falsely inflated earnings figures that resulted from these improper practices were then used in Cabletron's filings with the SEC during the class period and in company press releases announcing quarterly results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The picture that emerges from the pleading as a whole portrays a frenzied effort by a troubled company to conceal its difficulties for as long as possible. Mesko's complaint suggests as scienter for this fraud that defendants wanted to keep the house of cards standing (perhaps expecting salvation from the SmartSwitch or other developments). The complaint also offers allegations of significant stock sales by corporate insiders taking their profits before the worst of the news was out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not difficult to conclude that such practices, if they went on, certainly add up to fraudulent and material misstatement. The question at this stage is not whether the practices occurred &#8212; defendants deny them and actual proof, not just allegations in a complaint, would be required before any conclusion about that question could be reached &#8212; but whether the pleadings accusing defendants of these practices meet the requirements of the PSLRA. Our holding that the complaint is sufficient returns the case to the district court, which ultimately will resolve the broader issues of culpability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elaborate on several categories of Mesko's allegations here, without reciting every claim in the 79-page complaint; we will add some details later when they become relevant to our analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Fictitious Sales</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most egregious examples of fraud alleged in the complaint accuse Cabletron of booking entirely fictitious sales. Each of these allegations is supported by reference to the anonymous former employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the complaint, the company wrote purchase orders for nonexistent sales of merchandise late in one quarter, and then logged the merchandise back in as if it had been returned after the next quarter began, when in fact the merchandise had never left the company's possession. These supposedly-sold items were held in various locations before being returned to inventory. Some were loaded onto as many as eight tractor-trailers that remained in the factory yard. Some were stored at selected employees' homes; the complaint provides the name and address of one employee who allegedly accepted such goods \"at the behest of\" defendant Craig Benson, the chairman of the board and chief operating officer. Some simply \"sat on the shelves or lay in the corridors\" of Cabletron's warehouse until after the quarter ended. This scheme allegedly extended, at the close of one quarter, to removing equipment from employees' desks and unfinished product from the company's labs, running it through this sold-and-returned routine, and then, after the quarter had ended, returning the same equipment &#8212; with identical serial numbers &#8212; to the offices and labs where they had originated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employees had to move this material and to log it back in when it was \"returned.\" Cabletron used a computer system called \"Intrepid\" to track orders and returns, and the fictitious sales and returns were logged into this system. The broader inference from all of these alleged activities is that, in order to inflate revenue, Cabletron used a variety of techniques to create the appearance of sales where no sales ever occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Inventory Parking and Channel-Stuffing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other merchandise left Cabletron's factories and warehouses but, the complaint alleges, it was still fraudulent for the company to count it as sold either because the sales were not bona fide, or because the customers had an unlimited right of return and those return rights were not disclosed to investors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges \"inventory parking\" arrangements with certain Cabletron customers, distributors, and resellers. Under these arrangements, they agreed to receive shipments of Cabletron products which they had not really ordered and would not really buy. One of the former employee sources named two locations in New Hampshire where inventory was parked: a \"warehouse near Brock's Lumber in Rochester\" and the grounds of a particular company in Somersworth. The complaint also reports rumors about inventory parking at other locations, including St. Louis and New York City.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron also allegedly engaged in \"channel stuffing,\" the practice of inducing distributors or wholesalers to buy Cabletron products in excess of their projected needs by promising them that the products could be returned \"at any time and for any reason if they were not sold.\" This allowed the company to \"dump excess inventories of Cabletron products for which there was no present demand\" and thereby convert the liability of unsold goods into the revenue of supposed sales. The complaint names five distributors who apparently participated in the practice. To support the channel stuffing allegation, the complaint cites former employees with personal knowledge of Cabletron's sales practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Defective and Premature Shipments</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other instances, Cabletron allegedly inflated revenue toward the end of a quarter by making shipments of products sold while knowing that they would not be accepted or would be returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One variation of this theme involved shipping orders in quarters much earlier than the requested delivery dates. A former employee said the company sent the University of North Carolina a shipment worth $75 million to $80 million very early on three different occasions, each one just before the end of a quarter. A second employee agreed that the company \"regularly\" made such early shipments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, according to several former employees, Cabletron \"regularly\" sold computer equipment late in the quarter that still had unresolved bugs. Like the early shipments, Cabletron knew that this merchandise would be returned. One former employee specified AT &amp; T as a customer that had received such defective merchandise on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Artificially Reduced Costs</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron also overstated its net quarterly revenues by artificially reducing its costs, according to two employees cited in the complaint. Raw materials were held in trailers or on loading docks for weeks after they arrived rather than being booked in and transferred into storage immediately. These supplies were then moved in and booked as received on the first day of the next quarter, although they had actually been received during the prior quarter. This delay removed the expense of these purchases from the quarter when they would otherwise have appeared, thus inflating net revenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>SmartSwitch Problems</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the \"adverse factors\" noted earlier need little further explanation, but the company's difficulties with its new SmartSwitch products require some additional context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch line on March 3, 1997, the first day of the class period, with a glowing press release stating that the products \"set a new standard for price and performance.\" The complaint's quotes from various market analyst reports make it clear that investors considered the SmartSwitch an important aspect of Cabletron's future growth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Cabletron, SmartSwitch production immediately encountered two serious problems. First, supplies of two essential components for the SmartSwitch, one provided by Lucent Technologies and the other by LSI Logic, proved unreliable. Second, those units the company did manufacture were plagued by glitches involving their wiring. These wiring flaws were so widespread that the complaint alleges, citing two employees of whom at least one was personally familiar with the facts, that \"virtually every SmartSwitch manufactured from April to at least September 1997 was subject to individualized re-wiring by hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that these problems delayed the availability of the SmartSwitch during much of the class period, and that these delays damaged the company. Information about the problems was widely known within the company and was addressed extensively at weekly quality control meetings. The problems were also described in two internal Cabletron databases that were routinely circulated in hard copy to managers, including to defendants Levine, Benson, and Oliver. According to a former employee alleged to have personal knowledge, Benson directed that these reports should not be provided to salespersons \"in order to insulate them (and the Company's customers) from knowledge of problems relating to SmartSwitches.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Insider Stock Sales</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint points to stock sales by several of the individual defendants, during and after the class period, as evidence of scienter. These sales totaled over $180 million during the class period. Almost all of this amount was attributable to sales by Levine, who stepped down from his positions as president and chief executive officer and resigned his seat on the board of directors on or about August 6, 1997, midway through the class period. Between March 26, 1997 and the date of his resignation in August, Levine sold almost three million shares for a total of just over $89 million. Levine also sold another 2.7 million shares between September 24 and October 7, 1997, after he had left his executive positions, earning $88.7 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Levine, the complaint documents smaller stock sales by four other individual defendants during the class period. One sale was made by the chief financial officer, David J. Kirkpatrick, on September 24, 1997; the proceeds were $474,320. The remaining sales were made by the three defendants who served as outside directors on Cabletron's board: Paul R. Duncan, Donald F. McGuinness, and Michael D. Myerow. The sales by these three outside directors totaled $2.6 million. Duncan sold almost $1.6 million worth of stock on March 28, 1997. Also on March 28, McGuinness sold $66,000 worth of stock; he also sold $152,200 worth of stock on July 9, 1997. All the sales Myerow made during the class period were after the June disclosures by Cabletron; they added up to $796,570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree about how to calculate the percentage of the defendants' stock liquidated during the class period, but Mesko alleges that Levine, McGuinness, and Myerow each sold approximately one third of their Cabletron holdings, while Kirkpatrick and Duncan each sold over 90 percent of theirs. The complaint does not document any stock sales during the class period by either Benson or Oliver, the remaining individual defendants. It does note stock sales by Oliver in the four months prior to the class period, as well as by Levine, Kirkpatrick, Myerow, and McGuinness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the PSLRA, a securities fraud complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1). Furthermore, in order to state a claim of securities fraud, the statements alleged to be misleading must be misleading to a material degree. <i>See Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195389\"><a href=\"/opinion/195389/serabian-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir.1994). Finally, the PSLRA requires the complaint to state with particularity facts that give rise to a \"strong inference\" of scienter rather than merely a reasonable inference. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2); <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198674\"><a href=\"/opinion/198674/greebel-v-ftp-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 196-97 (1st Cir.1999). This last requirement alters the usual contours of a Rule 12(b)(6) ruling because, while a court continues to give all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs, those inferences supporting scienter must be strong ones. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201. The PSLRA did not, however, change significantly this circuit's previous underlying substantive standards for adequately pleaded securities fraud, which were already strict. <i>Id.</i> at 193-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Particularity of Fraud Pleadings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the complaint lacked the particularity required by the PSLRA in several ways, especially in its descriptions of confidential sources and its reliance on internal company reports. In addition, defendants argue that the total amount of detail provided in the complaint falls short of what is necessary to satisfy the particularity requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Use of Confidential Sources</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint details numerous statements which were made to Mesko's counsel by unnamed former Cabletron employees, and which are said to be based on the personal knowledge of these former employees. Many of its allegations are supported by reference to these anonymous statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether such statements are made \"on information and belief\" and the district court, as noted above, defined the concept inconsistently. This inconsistency mirrors the conflict in the caselaw. <i>Compare ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Group v.

In our view, notwithstanding the use of the word \"all,\" [section 78u-4(b)(1)] does not require that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or misleading statements are based.

In both of these situations, the plaintiffs will have pleaded enough facts to support their belief, even though some arguably relevant facts have been left out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314; <i>accord ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 352-53 (adopting <i>Novak</i>-type test); <i>see also Fitzer v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 21-22 (D.Mass.2000) (following <i>Novak</i> test). The approach we take, similar to <i>Novak,</i> is to look at all of the facts alleged to see if they \"provide an adequate basis for believing that the defendants' statements were false.\" <i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314. This involves an evaluation, inter alia, of the level of detail provided by the confidential sources, the corroborative nature of the other facts alleged (including from other sources), the coherence and plausibility of the allegations, the number of sources, the reliability of the sources, and similar indicia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach, we think, better strikes the balance Congress intended in the PSLRA. The statute was designed to erect barriers to frivolous strike suits, but not to make meritorious claims impossible to bring. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 104-98, at 4 (1995), <i>reprinted in</i> 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 683 (stating that intent of PSLRA is \"combatting ... abuses, while maintaining the incentive for bringing meritorious actions\"); <i>ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 354 (noting that PSLRA \"was not enacted to raise the pleading burdens ... to such a level that facially valid claims, which are not brought for nuisance value or as leverage to obtain a favorable or inflated settlement, must be routinely dismissed\"). A blanket ban on unnamed sources presents obvious policy problems. Employees or others in possession of important information about corporate malfeasance may be discouraged from stepping forward if they must be identified at the earliest stage of a lawsuit. <i>See Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 314. While we recognize that a case-by-case approach may provide less concrete guidance to district courts, the tension inherent in balancing the two congressional goals cannot be evaded by adopting an unnecessarily broad per se rule which may prevent pursuit of legitimate cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also support our conclusion with a helpful analogy from an entirely different field of law: courts' consideration of government requests for search warrants based on tips from confidential informants. Courts frequently allow such anonymously-provided information, if properly supported, to justify an otherwise problematic search. They examine carefully a variety of factors before doing so, including the basis offered for the informant's knowledge, the existence of other information corroborating the informant's allegations, and the amount of self-verifying detail provided in the allegations themselves. <i>E.g., United States v. Barnard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200078\"><a href=\"/opinion/200078/united-states-v-barnard/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v.

None of these factors is dispositive, and all are weighed in the context of the \"`totality of the circumstances.'\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span> (1983)). The overlap between these considerations and those articulated in <i>Novak</i> further reinforces our view that courts can competently make a careful evaluation of securities fraud pleadings based on anonymous sources, and separate frivolous complaints from those with potential merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When these standards are applied to the complaint's allegations supported by anonymous sources, we find that they satisfy the test. Overall, the accumulated amount of detail the sources provide tends to be self-verifying; these are not conclusory allegations of fraud, but specific descriptions of the precise means through which it occurred, provided by persons said to have personal knowledge of them. In addition, the number of different sources helps the complaint meet the standard. Their consistent accounts reinforce one another and undermine any argument that the complaint relies unduly on the stories of just one or two former employees, possibly disgruntled. Furthermore, as employees who were familiar with the activities discussed &#8212; and the complaint notes specifically when there are exceptions to this characterization &#8212; the sources have a strong basis of knowledge for the claims they make. Finally, the sources also point to the startlingly large number of returns, which they had the experience to judge based on the level of activity in the warehouse and the number of returns employees entered into Intrepid. This unusual increase independently suggests suspicious activity of the kind they allege: a tenfold jump in return rates for products shipped late in the quarter, with pallets full of as many as forty pieces of expensive equipment coming back into inventory early in the following quarter, permits a strong inference that something was at least significantly different about sales booked late in the quarter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The level of specific detail about the fictitious sales is significant. Far from resting on mere assertions, the anonymous sources describe tractor-trailers in the factory yard, equipment \"borrowed\" from employees' desks to be fraudulently processed, and the unusual activity in the warehouse as products were shuttled back and forth. The sources provide the name and address of one employee who is said to have stashed goods in the garage of his home, and say that Benson told him to do so. There are multiple sources for many of the fictitious sales claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other categories of allegations with similar detail. The principal source for the inventory parking allegations names two particular locations where the parking is said to have occurred. The complaint names five distributors alleged to have participated in channel stuffing, and the allegations of channel stuffing rely on two sources with knowledge about sales practices in particular. As to the premature or defective shipments, the complaint cites four different employees, three with direct knowledge. Between them, they describe the widespread nature of the problem and also name specific customers (the University of North Carolina, AT &amp; T) who were affected. Two employees supply the information that the raw materials were not entered as received when they should have been, and note that they were entered on the first day of the following quarter, underscoring the likelihood that the purpose of the delay was inflation of quarterly net revenue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the complaint provides enough particular details to meet the standards of the test we have adopted and justify the omission of sources' names at the pleading stage. These details amply supply \"facts on which that belief is formed\" as the PSLRA (and our precedent) require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Internal Company Reporting Systems</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the complaint provided too little detail about internal company documents to which it referred. Presumably, the court had in mind the complaint's references to the Intrepid order-processing system that would provide evidence about returns, the quality-control databases that informed individual defendants about SmartSwitch problems, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that merely stating the existence of efficient internal reporting systems in a conclusory fashion will not do much to increase the particularity of a securities fraud pleading. <i>See Shaw v.

Here, the complaint does more than that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pleadings about the Intrepid system show that former employees had to physically input returns; this is probative of the basis that anonymous sources had for recognizing the spike in returns early in the quarter. The quality-control databases serve a more important function, as discussed further below, because they help demonstrate knowledge of SmartSwitch problems on the part of Levine, Benson, and Oliver. The complaint also provides more substance about the contents of these systems. Unlike in <i>Shaw,</i> where we found that a plaintiff failed to provide any \"indication of the specific factual content of any single report generated by the alleged reporting system,\" <i>id.</i> (emphasis removed), the complaint here says that the two quality control databases (the \"Product Support Call Tracking Database\" and the \"Phone Support Database\") reported customer service problems related to the defective SmartSwitches. Thus, these databases serve as supporting evidence of Mesko's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Level of Particularity as a Whole</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that, even if the allegations supported by anonymous sources and internal documents are accepted, the complaint still leaves too many other unanswered questions &#8212; such as the precise dates of transactions, the names used for phony customers, the identities of corporate personnel involved, the specific products warehoused, or the exact dollar amounts of individual fraudulently recorded sales. As a result, defendants argue, the complaint does not satisfy the PSLRA's particularity requirements as interpreted in this circuit, particularly in <i>Greebel.</i> Their argument misapplies <i>Greebel</i> and our other caselaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants list factors found lacking in the complaint in <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203-04, as if they constituted a checklist for securities fraud complaints. We explicitly disavowed this interpretation in <i>Greebel</i> itself. 194 F.3d at 204 (\"We do not say that each of these particulars <i>must</i> appear in a complaint, but their complete absence in this case is indicative of the excessive generality of these allegations.\"). We have since repeated this clarification. <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the PSLRA, this circuit has adopted a fact-specific individual case analysis in preference to a list of factors required to be pled. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196, 204. Here, the complaint does include some of the factors missing in <i>Greebel;</i> the absence of others is not decisive. Each securities fraud complaint must be analyzed on its own facts; there is no one-size-fits-all template. Sufficient evidence of one type might reduce or eliminate the need for evidence in other categories, without thwarting the legislative intent behind the PSLRA. As the Sixth Circuit put it, \"In enacting the PSLRA, Congress was concerned with the quantum, not type, of proof.\" <i>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773420\"><a href=\"/opinion/773420/a-carl-helwig-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 551 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc) (adopting \"fact-specific approach\" from <i>Greebel</i>). Because a categorical approach is not appropriate, courts will allow private securities fraud complaints to advance past the pleadings stage when some questions remained unanswered, provided the complaint as a whole is sufficiently particular to pass muster under the PSLRA. <i>See, e.g., Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79-82 (failure of complaint to document precise amounts of overstatements of revenue not fatal); <i>Hollin v.

In contrast, in many cases where we have upheld dismissal of securities fraud pleadings, we have described the allegations they made as very general or even conclusory. <i>See, e.g., Maldonado v.</i> <i>Dominguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197814\"><a href=\"/opinion/197814/maldonado-v-dominguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1998) (\"When we examine these pleadings carefully, we find that there are no specific allegations [of scienter].\"); <i>Suna v.

The district court in <i>Greebel</i> had already permitted limited discovery before granting a motion to dismiss. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 188. The complaint had originally relied on a source to support an allegation that the defendant company fraudulently altered its books. The district court did not dismiss the complaint at that juncture. It did so only after limited discovery revealed that plaintiffs could not offer this source as a witness capable of testifying about the allegation at trial, and after they failed to produce adequate additional evidence. In <i>Greebel,</i> we said that both the original denial of a motion to dismiss (before discovery) and the subsequent dismissal (after some limited discovery) were correct. <i>Id.</i> at 207. Similarly, in <i>Gross,</i> the district court had granted the plaintiff limited discovery and even an opportunity to amend his complaint afterward. 93 F.3d at 990. The company then moved to dismiss, the district court granted the motion, and this court affirmed, noting key details that were still lacking in the complaint even after the focused discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the particularity requirements apply before any discovery has been conducted &#8212; indeed, the PSLRA itself stays all discovery, with certain narrow exceptions, during the pendency of any motion to dismiss. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(3)(B). But the difference in discovery is relevant to a court's evaluation of sufficient particularity. In short, under our circuit law, the procedural posture of the case matters, and we will scrutinize a post-discovery motion to dismiss even more stringently than a pre-discovery motion. <i>See Cooperman v. Individual Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762535\"><a href=\"/opinion/762535/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90450-steven-g-cooperman-v-individual-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 48-49 &amp; n. 8 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 81 (distinguishing <i>Greebel</i> on basis of difference in amount of discovery); <i>Maldonado,</i> 137 F.3d at 9 (noting limit on expectations of securities fraud pleadings when discovery is incomplete); <i>Glassman v. Computervision Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196899\"><a href=\"/opinion/196899/glassman-v-computervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 630 (1st Cir.1996) (collecting cases in various areas of law where courts considered amount of discovery completed when evaluating motion to dismiss).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to this complaint, this court has said repeatedly that the rigorous standards for pleading securities fraud do not require a plaintiff to plead evidence. <i>See Cooperman,</i> 171 F.3d at 48-49; <i>Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1225. Defendants' argument that even more detail be required, before there is any discovery, here amounts to requiring plaintiffs to plead evidence. The fraud allegations advanced in this complaint, with their consistent details provided from at least half a dozen different sources across various alleged schemes, reinforce each other and suggest reliability of the information reported. The complaint satisfies the PSLRA's particularity requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Identification of Materially Misleading Statements</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having jumped the first hurdle by pleading fraud with particularity, Mesko must identify the specific statements rendered materially misleading by the fraud he has pleaded.

In general, the materiality of a statement or omission is a question of fact that should normally be left to a jury rather than resolved by the court on a motion to dismiss. <i>See Lucia v.

Thus, we review the complaint only to determine that it pleads the existence of such statements and presents a plausible jury question of materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint describes three categories of statements that it alleges were materially misleading: (1) Cabletron's financial report filings with the SEC; (2) direct statements made by Cabletron officials, either in press releases or in direct quotes in the media; and (3) statements made by stock analysts and journalists, allegedly echoing statements made to them by defendants. According to the district court, the complaint listed three statements in the first category, eight statements in the second, and twenty-five statements in the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>SEC Filings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabletron made its required filings with the SEC during the class period: its Form 10-K for the fiscal year that ended on February 28, 1997, its Form 10-Q for the March-May 1997 quarter, and its Form 10-Q for the June-August 1997 quarter. The Form 10-K was signed by all of the individual defendants except for Oliver, while each Form 10-Q was signed by Benson and Kirkpatrick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko asserts that, because of the fraudulent revenue recognition practices discussed in Part II.A of this opinion, these SEC filings did not reflect Cabletron's true earnings, rendering them materially misleading.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> More specifically, Mesko alleges that the practices violated the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which \"embody the prevailing principles, conventions, and procedures defined by the accounting industry from time to time.\" <i>Young v. Lepone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200124\"><a href=\"/opinion/200124/cape-ann-investors-v-lepone/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see generally Migliaccio v.

Litig.</i>), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span>, 889-90 (8th Cir.2002) (elaborating on multiple and potentially conflicting sources of GAAP). Under SEC regulations, Mesko notes, filings that do not comply with GAAP \"will be presumed to be misleading and inaccurate.\" 17 C.F.R. &#167; 210.4-01(a)(1). As a result, Mesko says, Cabletron's SEC filings during the class period were unlawfully false and misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merely stating in conclusory fashion that a company's books are out of compliance with GAAP would not in itself demonstrate liability under section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. <i>See Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 362. Indeed, some techniques that result in early booking of sales, such as channel stuffing, might prove to be entirely legitimate, depending on the specific facts. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, Mesko alleges that Cabletron's revenue was fraudulently inflated by tens of millions of dollars per quarter. Given that Cabletron's quarterly revenue ranged from $371 million to $381 million during the class period, reasonable investors unquestionably might consider a difference of such magnitude material. Accurate earnings figures are vital aspects of the \"total mix of information\" which investors would consult when evaluating Cabletron's stock. Furthermore, the nature of much of the alleged inaccuracy in earnings derives from systematic fraud, described in detail, that extends to completely fictitious sales. This distinguishes it from cases where the alleged GAAP violation consisted merely of questionable bookkeeping practices. <i>Cf., e.g., Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 995-96 (recognition of revenue at time of order rather than at time of shipment, allegedly in violation of GAAP, held insufficient where plaintiff \"failed to allege any particulars to support his general allegation\"); <i>Serabian,</i> 24 F.3d at 362 (allocation of losses to wrong fiscal quarters, absent other pleadings of fraud, fails to state claim even if in violation of GAAP). Mesko has adequately pled that the fraudulent revenue recognition rendered Cabletron's SEC filings materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Other Direct Public Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to SEC filings, Cabletron and its executives made other direct statements to the public during the class period that the complaint alleges were materially misleading. This court has previously attributed direct quotes of company officials in the news media to the company, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79-80, and does so again here. The direct statements catalogued in the complaint include: press releases announcing earnings, public statements about the availability of the SmartSwitch, and general optimistic statements about Cabletron's health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Cabletron issued press releases during the class period to announce earnings figures for each quarter. The complaint alleges that these press releases were misleading for the same reason as the SEC filings: they announced figures that reflected fraudulently inflated revenue, and thereby misstated Cabletron's true earnings for each of these quarters. The same analysis we applied to the SEC filings demonstrates the materiality of these alleged misstatements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the complaint alleges that public statements about the SmartSwitch were materially misleading because they gave the impression that production and distribution of this important new product were \"ramping up\" smoothly when this was not so. However, it specifically identifies only a small number of such statements attributable to Cabletron directly (as opposed to third-party statements, which we discuss below).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> These are: a press release issued when Cabletron unveiled the SmartSwitch on March 3, 1997, the first day of the class period; direct quotes in a trade publication article on March 17, 1997 suggesting that the product was then available; and a media interview with Benson on July 14, 1997 in which he predicted that SmartSwitch problems would be resolved by September.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mesko has not shown why any of these three statements were materially misleading when they were made. The complaint fails to demonstrate that the problems which later plagued the SmartSwitch were known to the individual defendants by mid-March, when the first two statements were made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The supply delays might or might not have been visible to defendants by then, but in any event it may also have been reasonable to believe they would soon be resolved. Even Mesko's own sources state that the manual rewiring to resolve mechanical flaws began in April, not March. The third statement, made by Benson in July, was simply an optimistic forward-looking prediction about the timeline for resolving SmartSwitch problems, and Mesko does not even allege that this timeline was not met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, however, Cabletron's direct statements created the impression that the SmartSwitch was already commercially available on a large scale, the company may then have had a duty to revise that impression if later developments substantially undermined the accuracy of the earlier statements. <i>See Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 992 (citing <i>Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484931\"><a href=\"/opinion/484931/gilbert-roeder-etc-v-alpha-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir.1987)). While a company need not reveal every piece of information that affects anything said before, it must disclose facts, \"if any, that are needed so that what was revealed [before] would not be `so incomplete as to mislead.'\" <i>Backman v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546070\"><a href=\"/opinion/546070/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95389-irving-a-backman-v-polaroid-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc) (quoting <i>SEC v. Tex. Gulf Sulphur Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"281898\"><a href=\"/opinion/281898/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-texas-gulf-sulphur-co-a-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 862 (2d Cir.1968)). Seen in this light, the complaint establishes a reasonable inference of a material <i>omission</i> which, if borne out by evidence, would present a question of fact for a jury. On remand, these allegations should be allowed to proceed on that more limited basis, that is, not as statements misleading when made, but as statements potentially requiring revision in light of subsequent developments. <i>See generally</i> G.S. Porter, <i>What Did You Know and When Did You Know It?: Public Company Disclosure and the Mythical Duties to Correct and Update,</i> 68 Fordham L.Rev. 2199, 2228-30 (2000) (expressing general skepticism about duty to correct but envisioning scenario similar to this one in which it might rightfully apply).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the complaint alleges that other direct statements by Cabletron were unduly optimistic in light of the mounting difficulties facing the company. Mesko argues that adverse factors other than the SmartSwitch delays should have been disclosed earlier or more fully. For example, the complaint calls the June 2, 1997 press release that made partial disclosures of Cabletron's problems materially misleading, because it failed to disclose the full extent of those problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants accurately argue that Cabletron was under no obligation to disclose information on industry-wide trends that was available to the public. Some of the complaint's adverse factors, such as the split with Cisco Systems and the increased market saturation, fall into this category. More fundamentally, the complaint lacks the level of detail in these allegations that it provides elsewhere, and fails to plead with sufficient particularity that the adverse factors were known to Cabletron but were contemporaneously concealed from the public. Rather, the adverse factors are gleaned from the company's disclosures, which are then alleged to be too little, too late. \"[P]laintiffs may not simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they should have been made earlier.\" <i>Berliner v. Lotus Dev. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1362033\"><a href=\"/opinion/1362033/berliner-v-lotus-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 710 (D.Mass.1992). Standing alone, such circular assertions represent little more than the type of \"fraud by hindsight\" pleading that we have long rejected. <i>See, e.g., Gross,</i> 93 F.3d at 991; <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590895\"><a href=\"/opinion/590895/amy-greenstone-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-cambex-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, however, the complaint also relies on these adverse factors to supply a reason for the revenue-padding at the heart of plaintiffs' case, and as context for understanding it, rather than as independent grounds for pleading fraud. As the rationale for the other fraudulent actions, these adverse factors help support scienter, and should be considered as such on remand. <i>Cf. No. Nine,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d at 26 (using allegations advanced in complaint primarily to show scienter as means to support particularity holding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Third-Party Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint catalogues many statements about Cabletron in reports published by market analysts.

As this articulation of the test makes clear, the district court erred when it required that defendants \"controlled\" third-party statements.

The complaint alleges that Benson specifically directed some of the fraudulent warehousing activities at the heart of the complaint. Again, he may have done no such thing, but we must take the allegations in the complaint as true. It also alleges that many people within the company &#8212; including Levine, Benson, and Oliver &#8212; received regular information about the SmartSwitch problems which they should have realized contradicted the company's public statements about the rollout of the product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the complaint identifies concealment of the serious and worsening deterioration of Cabletron's financial health as a significant motive for the alleged fraud. <i>Cf. Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 83 (scienter supported by corporate officers' understanding that rollout of new product was \"important to their own survival and that of the company\"); <i>Nathenson v.

Indeed, it appears that Levine, a cofounder of the company, was forced out of management as the magnitude of Cabletron's problems began to come to light, thus confirming that these motivating fears were realistic. This is more than the usual concern by executives to improve financial results; the executives' careers and the very survival of the company were on the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And if these interrelated facts and circumstances still were not enough to give rise to a strong inference of scienter, the complaint adds its allegations of insider trading. Stock sales by insiders can supply evidence of scienter. \"The vitality of the inference to be drawn depends on the facts, and can range from marginal to strong.\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197-98 (citations omitted). Here, the insider trading allegations add some weight to the other evidence of scienter, and we need not determine whether alone they would suffice. Levine made the overwhelming majority of the sales, and his resignation provides a plausible innocent explanation for large stock sales. <i>Id.</i> at 206 (\"It is not unusual for individuals leaving a company ... to sell shares.\"). Still, the approximately $177 million he gained from stock sales can be a powerful incentive. It is also true, as defendants point out, that many of the sales, by both Levine and others, occurred after Cabletron's disclosures in early June 1997, even though the share price was significantly higher before this time. The insider trading allegations nonetheless provide additional ballast to Mesko's argument for scienter. They suggest further motive for securities fraud, and they combine with other aspects of the complaint to produce a strong inference of scienter overall. <i>See Shaw,</i> 82 F.3d at 1224 (although allegations of smaller-scale insider trading did not show scienter on their own, they \"provide some support\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking the allegations of the complaint as a whole &#8212; and as true &#8212; we find that it is not only a reasonable inference but a strong one that defendants possessed a state of mind giving rise to a securities fraud claim, if fraud was committed. Each individual fact about scienter may provide only a brushstroke, but the resulting portrait satisfies the requirement for a strong inference of scienter under the PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Pleading of Individual Defendants' Liability</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we analyze here how the section 10(b) claim in the complaint survives, with one exception, against each individual defendant.

Most of the potentially actionable statements in the complaint, including the SEC filings and the press releases, were company documents.

Benson, also an officer, did not sell stock or sign the 10-Q, but was alleged to have directed some of the fraudulent practices surrounding fictitious sales and also to have ordered negative information about the SmartSwitch withheld from sales personnel.

Since the section 20(a) claims involve most of the same defendants who remain in the case by virtue of our section 10(b) ruling, the practical effect of reinstating them at this stage is small. There is a reasonable inference in the complaint that Oliver may have controlled persons responsible for promulgating misleading information about the SmartSwitch, so we remand the section 20(a) claim against him as well. On remand, those individual defendants who wish to challenge their liability under section 20(a) may, of course, do so explicitly.

That is incorrect. The law of the case is a discretionary doctrine, especially as applied to interlocutory orders such as this one<i>See Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195400\"><a href=\"/opinion/195400/perez-ruiz-v-crespo-guillen/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Interlocutory orders, including denials of motions to dismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute the law of the case.\"). As Justice Holmes expressed it, \"[T]he phrase, law of the case, as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power.\" <i>Messinger v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97670\"><a href=\"/opinion/97670/messenger-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 444, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></span> (1912). Reconsideration is also appropriate because defendants filed a motion to strike the complaint hours before Judge Devine issued his sua sponte order, so that he did not have their arguments before him.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Before his decision to recuse himself, Judge DiClerico first ordered counsel to supply lists identifying all federal and state securities class action suits in which their firms appeared. At that point, Mesko did file a motion seeking a status conference and asking that these lists be submitted in camera or under seal. Once this motion was denied, Mesko's attorneys produced the lists without further objection to the recusals until this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court seems to have used inconsistent definitions of \"information and belief.\" The court first said at oral argument that, if the confidential sources based their allegations on personal knowledge, then their statements were not made \"on information and belief.\" Its written opinion later seemed to reverse this position and interpret information and belief claims as any made without<i>plaintiffs'</i> direct personal knowledge. Mesko's submission rested on the first of these definitions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Cabletron reorganized itself after the events at issue in this litigation; Cabletron's core business is now carried on under a new corporate name, Enterasys Networks, Inc</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The complaint repeatedly refers to its anonymous sources as \"former employees with personal knowledge of the relevant facts\" or some similar phrase. In the interest of simplicity, we will use less wordy formulations, while recognizing that the complaint does reiterate the personal basis for its anonymous sources' knowledge each time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Mesko identified these less-substantiated rumors to Judge Lisi among the few allegations made on narrowly-defined information and belief, and did not attribute them to the former employees with personal knowledge cited elsewhere in the complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Under this test, some allegations based on anonymous sources will not, on their face, be adequate<i>See ABC Arbitrage,</i> 291 F.3d at 353-54. Many securities fraud complaints rely on unnamed sources accompanied by only the vaguest detail. For example, a complaint may include a boilerplate paragraph at its beginning or end stating that its allegations as a whole are supported by investigation of counsel, sometimes including interviews with unnamed sources such as former employees. <i>See generally</i> 2 H.S. Bloomenthal, <i>Securities Law Handbook</i> &#167; 29.10 (2002 ed.). A general statement that unspecified sources support the complaint's allegations as a whole usually will not suffice.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In fact, it is not the Ninth Circuit decision but the<i>Silicon Graphics</i> district court opinion, 970 F.Supp. at 763-64, that sets out a strong per se rule. The district court in the present case cites that opinion rather than the Ninth Circuit's, as does <i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 313. While not entirely clear, the Ninth Circuit's opinion can be read as stopping short of endorsing the district court's per se rule. <i>See Silicon Graphics,</i> 183 F.3d at 985.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Mesko also alleges that disclosure of adverse factors was required in some of the SEC filings, and that failure to so disclose independently rendered them materially misleading. We handle this claim as we do other direct statements alleged to be misleading because of failure to disclose the adverse factors; we consider those statements in the next subsection</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The complaint also includes a catch-all assertion about other unspecified \"press releases and other disseminations and communications about these new SmartSwitch products.\" Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 require that the specific statements alleged to be materially misleading must be identified, and we accordingly disregard this catch-all assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The complaint does allege that certain other company personnel knew of the SmartSwitch problems in March, including public relations and quality assurance personnel. If Mesko can demonstrate at a later time that the individual defendants are therefore liable as control persons, or that this information made its way to the individual defendants so that they have primary liability, then this information could provide further basis for a jury to find that defendants' statements were materially misleading</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The district court also suggested that some of the statements on which the analysts and journalists based their reporting were unactionably vague \"puffing,\" but failed to specify which of the statements fell into this category or why</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In the past, we had expressly reserved the question of whether statements in a third-party source such as an analyst's report may be attributable to a securities fraud defendant when it is not explicit that they are the defendant's direct statements<i>Suna,</i> 107 F.3d at 73. At least one recent case came close to doing so but did not need to reach the overarching question. <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79-80.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We note, in addition, that new SEC regulations concerning disclosure of communications between companies and analysts may help to resolve some of these issues in the future<i>See</i> Regulation FD, 17 C.F.R. &#167; &#167; 243.100-243.103 (requiring disclosure to public of information provided to analysts simultaneously or soon thereafter). <i>See generally</i> Bloomenthal, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 33.10 (discussing Regulation FD).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Under the group pleading presumption, if we had applied it, the result would likely be the same, because the complaint did not allege Oliver's participation in the production of any group-published documents such as SEC filings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> That provision, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a), states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person ... unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation....</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
