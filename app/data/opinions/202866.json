Macarius, with whom Law Offices of Saher J. Macarius,\nwas on brief for petitioner.\n     Manuel A. Palau, Trial Attorney, Civil Division, United States\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, were on\nbrief, for respondent.\n     Nadine Wettstein and Matthew Downer, on brief for amicus\ncuriae American Immigration Law Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n                           July 31, 2007\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     Adil Chedad petitions for review\n\nof a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") upholding\n\nthe   order    of   an   Immigration    Judge   (\"IJ\")   pretermitting   his\n\napplication for adjustment of status and declaring him removable\n\nfrom the United States.        The basis of the IJ's decision, and its\n\naffirmance, was that Chedad was ineligible for any such adjustment\n\nbecause he had overstayed a period of voluntary departure imposed\n\nas part of a prior BIA order closing the removal proceedings\n\nagainst   him.1      Before   the   voluntary   departure   period   lapsed,\n\nhowever, Chedad had filed a motion with the BIA to reopen those\n\nproceedings due to previously unavailable evidence.\n\n              The BIA granted the motion to reopen and remanded the\n\nmatter to the IJ, who, as just noted, deemed Chedad ineligible for\n\nany further relief because he had disobeyed the voluntary departure\n\norder.    Chedad argues that the BIA erroneously affirmed the IJ's\n\nruling, either because the filing of his motion to reopen tolled\n\nthe running of the voluntary departure period, or because the BIA's\n\nallowance of the motion stripped the voluntary departure order of\n\nany legal significance.       We deny Chedad's petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n1\n     The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"the INA\") provides a\nmechanism for an alien, subject to the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral and other limitations, \"to depart the United States\nvoluntarily at his own expense\" in lieu of continued participation\nin removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1) (2005).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\n            The    Immigration   and    Naturalization   Service   (\"INS\")\n\ncommenced removal proceedings against Chedad, a native of Morocco,\n\nin 1997, asserting that he had remained in the United States beyond\n\nthe time permitted by the six-month nonimmigrant visa issued to him\n\nin 1994.2   Chedad appeared before the IJ with counsel on May 28,\n\n1998 and admitted overstaying his visa.           He also requested a\n\ncontinuance of the proceedings on the ground that his wife, Joanne\n\nS. Francisco--a lawful permanent resident of the United States--had\n\nfiled an application for citizenship, as well as a visa application\n\non Chedad's behalf, known as an I-130 petition.           See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1154(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 204.1(a)(1) (2006).3           If Francisco\n\nbecame a naturalized citizen of the United States, then Chedad\n\nwould become immediately eligible to apply for adjustment of status\n\nto that of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence.          See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i).       The IJ therefore granted Chedad's\n\nmotion for a continuance to allow the processing of his spouse's\n\napplications.     Chedad later received a second continuance for that\n\n\n2\n     In March 2003, the INS was abolished and its functions were\ntransferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.\nSee Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §§ 451(b)\nand 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135, 2195 and 2205, codified at 6 U.S.C. §§\n271(b) and 291(a) (Supp. 2006). For consistency, we will refer to\nthe responsible agency as \"the INS\" throughout our opinion.\n3\n     Since Chedad's proceedings before the BIA, many of its\nregulations have been recodified without changing their substance.\nFor purposes of clarity, we will cite to the applicable regulations\nas currently codified.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpurpose.   Meanwhile, Francisco's I-130 petition on Chedad's behalf\n\nwas approved on October 21, 1998.\n\n           Francisco's application for naturalization was still\n\npending when removal proceedings against Chedad resumed on March 4,\n\n1999. Though Chedad sought another continuance on that ground, the\n\nIJ refused, giving him the choice between the entry of a final\n\norder of removal and an opportunity to seek voluntary departure.\n\nId. § 1229c(b).   Chedad elected voluntary departure and received a\n\ncontinuance so that he could obtain a valid travel document for the\n\npurpose of leaving the country.\n\n           When Chedad reappeared before the IJ on June 11, 1999, he\n\nagain moved for a continuance to allow the processing of his wife's\n\napplication for citizenship; the IJ again denied the motion.\n\nInstead, the IJ granted Chedad's motion for voluntary departure,\n\nrequiring him to leave in sixty days.    Id. § 1229c(b)(2).   The IJ\n\nalso warned Chedad of the consequences of disobeying the voluntary\n\ndeparture order, including the loss of the opportunity to pursue\n\nadjustment of immigration status through several different avenues\n\nfor a period of ten years.   Id. § 1229c(d)(1) (Supp. 2006).4\n\n\n\n\n4\n     In 2006, Congress amended 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) through the\nViolence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization\nAct of 2005.    Pub. L. No. 109-162 § 812, 119 Stat. 2960, 3057\n(2006). This amendment, in relevant part, renumbered the penalty\nprovision of § 1229c(d) as § 1229c(d)(1). For purposes of clarity,\nwe will cite to the current subsection number throughout our\nopinion.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f             Chedad appealed the IJ's denial of his final motion for\n\na continuance to the BIA.            During the pendency of the appeal, on\n\nMay 24, 2001, Francisco completed the naturalization process.                     On\n\nJuly 15, 2002, with the appeal still pending, Chedad filed a motion\n\nto remand with the BIA, citing his newly minted status as the\n\nspouse of a United States citizen, as well as the prior approval of\n\nhis I-130 petition.\n\n             The BIA dismissed Chedad's appeal and denied his motion\n\nto remand in an order issued on October 25, 2002.                  First, the BIA\n\nruled that the IJ had not abused her discretion in denying Chedad's\n\nfinal   request        for   a   continuance   of    the   removal   proceedings.\n\nSecond,     the   BIA    denied    the   motion     to   remand   because    it   was\n\nunaccompanied by an application for adjustment of Chedad's status\n\nto   that   of    an    alien    admitted   for   lawful    permanent   residence\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as required by BIA rules.                   8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(1).         The BIA granted Chedad thirty days from the date\n\nof its order to depart the country voluntarily, repeating the IJ's\n\nadmonition about the consequences of any failure to do so.5\n\n             On November 22, 2002, before the expiration of the\n\nvoluntary departure period, Chedad filed a motion with the BIA to\n\nreopen the removal proceedings, again asserting that he had become\n\n\n5\n     The execution of the IJ's sixty-day voluntary departure order\nhad been stayed pending Chedad's appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.6(a).\nBecause thirty days had already expired by the time Chedad filed\nthe appeal, thirty days of voluntary departure time remained at the\ntime of the BIA's decision. See id. § 1240.26(f).\n\n                                         -5-\n\feligible for adjustment of status under § 1255(a).    This filing,\n\nmade within ninety days of the BIA's decision as required by the\n\nINA, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(7)(C)(1), and its implementing regulations,\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), included the application for adjustment of\n\nstatus and supporting materials that had been omitted from Chedad's\n\nearlier motion to remand.   Noting that Chedad's motion to reopen\n\n\"demonstrate[d] that he is now prima facie eligible for adjustment\n\nof status,\" the BIA granted the motion in an order dated February\n\n21, 2003, remanding the case to the IJ \"for proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\"    The BIA's order made no mention of the\n\nvoluntary departure requirement previously imposed.\n\n          When the proceedings found their way back to the IJ,\n\nhowever, the prior voluntary departure order--which Chedad had not\n\nsatisfied--proved dispositive.    The IJ determined that, because\n\nChedad had failed to leave the United States as required, he had\n\nbecome ineligible for adjustment of status by operation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229c(d).   The IJ rejected Chedad's arguments that (1) the BIA\n\nhad nullified its voluntary departure order by granting his motion\n\nto reopen, and (2) the filing of his motion to reopen, on November\n\n22, 2002, had tolled the running of the voluntary departure period.\n\nIn rejecting these arguments, the IJ relied on Matter of Shaar, 21\n\nI. & N. Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff'd, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998),\n\nwhich held that the filing of a motion to reopen does not itself\n\ntoll the voluntary departure period. The IJ therefore pretermitted\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fChedad's application for adjustment of status and ordered him\n\nremoved from the United States.\n\n           Chedad appealed, repeating the arguments he had made\n\nbefore the IJ. In particular, Chedad noted that Shaar had recently\n\nbeen overruled by the Ninth Circuit, which held that a timely\n\nmotion to reopen could toll the voluntary departure period. Azarte\n\nv. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278, 1289 (9th Cir. 2005).              The BIA,\n\nhowever, did not consider itself bound by Azarte, or similar\n\ndecisions from other circuits, in a case arising within this\n\ncourt's appellate jurisdiction, and therefore rejected Chedad's\n\ntolling argument.     As to Chedad's contention that the BIA had\n\nemasculated its prior voluntary departure order by granting the\n\nmotion to reopen, the BIA explained that the latter decision \"was\n\nbased solely on the fact that [Chedad] had established prima facie\n\neligibility for relief and not based on [the BIA's] adjudication of\n\nthe merits of his claim; also, [his] motion had not been opposed by\n\n[the INS] so no issues were raised to rebut [his] eligibility for\n\nrelief.\"   The BIA therefore upheld the IJ's ruling that Chedad was\n\ndisqualified   from   seeking   adjustment   of   status   based   on   his\n\ndisobedience of the voluntary departure order--a fact that had not\n\nbeen considered by the BIA in previously deciding to remand the\n\ncase.   Chedad then petitioned this court for review.\n\n           In his petition, Chedad argues that the BIA mistakenly\n\nupheld the IJ's reliance on the voluntary departure order as a\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fbasis   for    disqualifying     him    from       further    relief.       We    have\n\njurisdiction over such a petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1),\n\nwhich   provides       for   \"review   of     a    final     order    of   removal,\"\n\nnotwithstanding        the    jurisdiction-stripping            provision        of   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i).        DaCosta v. Gonzales, 449 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (exercising jurisdiction over BIA's ruling that violation of\n\nvoluntary departure order rendered alien ineligible for adjustment\n\nof status because BIA did not reach merits of adjustment claim).\n\n              Chedad contends that the BIA erred in refusing to treat\n\n(1) the filing of his motion to reopen as tolling the voluntary\n\ndeparture period, or (2) the allowance of the motion as depriving\n\nthe voluntary departure order of its effect.                 In considering such\n\narguments,     \"[w]e    afford   de    novo       review   to   the    BIA's     legal\n\nconclusions, but cede some deference to its interpretations of the\n\nINA.\"   Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing\n\nINS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425 (1999)).\n\n                                       II.\n\n              Chedad argues that the provisions of the INA authorizing\n\nmotions to reopen, on the one hand, and voluntary departure, on the\n\nother, conflict in such a way as to require the timely filing of\n\nthe former to toll the running of the latter.                   This argument has\n\nprevailed in a number of circuits, see Ugokwe v. Attorney Gen., 453\n\nF.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir. 2006); Kanivets v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d\n\n330, 335 (3d Cir. 2005); Sidikhouya v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 950, 952\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f(8th Cir. 2005); Azarte, 394 F.3d at 1289, but has failed in\n\nothers, see Dekoladenu v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 500, 507 (4th Cir.\n\n2006); Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 2006).\n\nWe now consider the question.\n\n                The      INA's    voluntary      departure         provision     plays     an\n\nimportant         part     in    the    smooth       functioning     of    the    country's\n\nimmigration procedures. See, e.g., DaCosta, 449 F.3d at 50; Bocova\n\nv. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 265 (1st Cir. 2005).                             Subject to a\n\nnumber of qualifications, the Attorney General, at his discretion,\n\nmay    grant      an     alien's       request    to      depart    the    United    States\n\nvoluntarily, either in lieu of commencing deportation proceedings\n\nor    at    the       conclusion       of    those    proceedings.          8    U.S.C.   §§\n\n1229c(a)(1), (b)(1).                From the alien's perspective, voluntary\n\ndeparture         offers     certain        benefits,      among    them    avoiding      the\n\npenalties attendant to deportation, which include five- or ten-year\n\nbars       on     seeking        readmission         to   the      country.         Id.    §§\n\n1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (ii); Bocova, 412 F.3d at 265 & n.1.                                    The\n\ngovernment also benefits from voluntary departure by \"expediting\n\ndepartures and eliminating the costs associated with deportation.\"\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 265.\n\n                The INA imposes harsh penalties, however, on aliens who\n\ndo not live up to their end of the voluntary departure bargain.                            An\n\nalien who \"fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the\n\ntime period specified\" receives monetary sanctions and becomes\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fineligible for a number of forms of immigration relief, including\n\nadjustment of status, for a period of ten years.                   8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229c(d)(1).         The IJ relied on this provision in pretermitting\n\nChedad's application for adjustment of status based on his wife's\n\nnaturalization.         The INA also strictly limits the time allowable\n\nfor the alien to leave the United States.                    In a case, like\n\nChedad's, of voluntary departure ordered at the conclusion of\n\ndeportation proceedings, the voluntary departure period cannot\n\nexceed 60 days.6        Id. § 1229c(b)(2).\n\n              The availability of motions to reopen removal proceedings\n\nis also restricted.        Id. § 1229a(7).    Such motions must be based on\n\nmaterial evidence that \"was not available and could not have been\n\ndiscovered      or    presented   at    the   former   hearing,\"     including\n\n\"circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing\" which\n\nbear on the alien's eligibility for discretionary relief. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(1).       An alien ordinarily may file only one such motion\n\nafter   the     close    of   proceedings.      8   U.S.C.    §   1229a(7)(A).\n\nFurthermore, and of particular note here, a motion to reopen \"shall\n\nbe filed within 90 days of the date of an administrative order of\n\nremoval,\" subject to certain exceptions inapplicable to Chedad.\n\nId. § 1229a(7)(C)(1).\n\n\n\n\n6\n     By contrast, a voluntary departure period granted prior to the\nend of removal proceedings cannot exceed 120 days. 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229c(a)(2)(A).\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           Those courts holding that a timely motion to reopen\n\nsuspends   the   running     of   the    voluntary     departure   period   have\n\nperceived a conflict between § 1229a(7)(C)(1), which allows ninety\n\ndays to file a motion to reopen, and § 1229c(b)(2), which limits\n\nvoluntary departure granted at the close of removal proceedings to\n\njust sixty days.    Ugokwe, 453 F.3d at 1331; Kanivets, 424 F.3d at\n\n335; Sidikhouya, 407 F.3d at 952; Azarte, 394 F.3d at 1286.                 While\n\nthe motion to reopen had long been recognized in deportation\n\nproceedings as a matter of practice and, later, by administrative\n\nrulemaking, Congress did not put its imprimatur on the vehicle\n\nuntil the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility    Act   of    1996      (\"IIRAIRA\"),    which   \"provided     the\n\n[aforementioned] statutory right to a motion to reopen.\"               Azarte,\n\n394 F.3d at 1283 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c)(6)(A) (1996)). IIRAIRA\n\nalso, however, \"drastically limited the time allowed for voluntary\n\ndeparture,\" id. at 1285, imposing, inter alia, the sixty-day\n\nlimitation found at 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2).\n\n           The joint effect of these provisions is practically to\n\nforeclose the availability of motions to reopen in most cases where\n\nthe alien has received voluntary departure.               As Azarte observes,\n\neven an alien who seeks reopening at the outset of the voluntary\n\ndeparture period has little hope of receiving a decision before the\n\nexpiration of the departure deadline.            394 F.3d at 1287.      If the\n\nalien defies the voluntary departure order by remaining in the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fUnited States pending action on the motion to reopen, the alien\n\nwill be automatically cut off from a number of avenues of relief by\n\noperation of § 1229c(d)(1), including, in many cases, the very\n\nrelief he or she sought reopening to pursue, i.e., adjustment of\n\nstatus.   On the other hand, if the alien complies with the order\n\nand leaves, the BIA will treat the motion as withdrawn, also\n\nprecluding any relief.    8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d).    Azarte and its\n\nprogeny reason that this \"'Catch-22' situation\" calls for tolling\n\nthe voluntary departure period while the alien awaits the BIA's\n\nruling on a timely motion to reopen.   Kanivetz, 424 F.3d at 334;\n\nsee also Ugokwe, 453 F.3d at 1331; Sidikhouya, 407 F.3d at 952.\n\n          Though there is some force to this reasoning, we believe\n\nthat it proceeds from an erroneous premise, namely, that motions to\n\nreopen are available only in proceedings where voluntary departure\n\nhas been granted.    Subsection 1229a(7), however, permits \"one\n\nmotion to reopen proceedings under this section,\" which include all\n\n\"proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of\n\nan alien.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1229a(1)(A).   Proceedings where voluntary\n\ndeparture has not been granted, naturally, spawn no \"conflict\"\n\nbetween the deadline for moving to reopen and the deadline for\n\nleaving the country voluntarily.\n\n          In our view, holding aliens to the sixty-day limit on\n\nvoluntary departure imposed by § 1229c(b)(2), despite the ninety-\n\nday limit on motions to reopen granted by § 1229a(7)(C)(1), does\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fnot   \"deprive[]   the   motion   to   reopen   provision   of   meaning   by\n\neliminating the availability of such motions to those granted\n\nvoluntary departure.\"       Azarte, 394 F.3d at 1288.             Rather, §\n\n1229a(7) has significance for aliens who have not sought the\n\nbenefits of voluntary departure and can therefore pursue reopening\n\nwithout regard for the sixty-day deadline.7          See Dekoladenu, 459\n\nF.3d at 505-06.    We cannot accept Azarte's reasoning that Congress\n\ncould not have intended to subject motions to reopen to the\n\nvoluntary departure cutoff because that would \"preclude their\n\navailability in a significant number of cases, likely a substantial\n\nmajority.\"   394 F.3d at 1289; accord Banda-Ortiz, 445 F.3d at 393\n\n(Smith, J., dissenting). Azarte did not cite any authority for the\n\nproposition that voluntary departure is entered in \"a substantial\n\nmajority\" of removal proceedings.         In fact, as the Fourth Circuit\n\nnoted in Dekoladenu, 459 F.3d at 506 n.5, available statistics\n\nindicate that voluntary departure was granted in just ten percent\n\n\n\n7\n     Without disputing this point, the dissent nevertheless joins\nAzarte in rejecting \"the proposition that Congress, while expressly\ncodifying the tradition of motions to reopen, intended sub silentio\nto preclude their availability\" in cases of voluntary departure.\n394 F.3d at 1289. As we explain, however, because our reading of\nIIRAIRA will preclude (at least as a practical matter) motions to\nreopen only in the relatively small percentage of cases where\naliens elect voluntary departure, we hardly think it \"implausible\"\nthat Congress intended such a result.        Indeed, we think it\nconsiderably less plausible that, despite IIRAIRA's unmistakable\npurpose in ensuring that voluntary departure in fact results in the\nalien's leaving the United States in a timely manner, Congress\nintended to allow an alien to avoid doing so through the simple\nexpedient of filing a motion to reopen.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fof removal cases in 2006, and has never been granted in more than\n\neighteen percent of them in any of the last five years. Executive\n\nOffice for Immigration Review, FY 2005 Statistical Yearbook Q1\n\n(2006), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/statspub/fy06syb.pdf\n\n(last visited May 25, 2007).\n\n          We read §§ 1229a(7)(C)(1) and 1229c(b)(2), then, as\n\nevincing a congressional intent to make the benefits of voluntary\n\ndeparture available only to aliens who agree to give up the fight\n\nand leave the country willingly.8     See Banda-Ortiz, 445 F.3d at\n\n391.   This may or may not be wise policy, but it is, we believe,\n\nthe most plausible construction of the statute.   As Azarte notes,\n\nthe pre-IIRAIRA version of the INA put no time limits on voluntary\n\ndeparture, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(e) (1995), resulting in departure\n\n\n8\n     We do not imply that aliens granted voluntary departure may\nnot move to reopen. As a practical matter, however, aliens who\nreceive voluntary departure should not expect their motions to\nreopen to be heard before they depart; they should expect to have\nto renew their attempts at immigration relief from abroad.      We\nfully recognize that such relief will necessarily exclude\nreopening, because INS rules do not permit an alien subjected to\nremoval proceedings to move to reopen them after leaving the\ncountry. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). But this rule does nothing\nto prevent the alien from pursuing the ultimate relief he or she\nseeks, i.e., the right to remain in the United States legally,\nthrough other avenues after complying with a voluntary departure\norder. Indeed, that is one of the main attractions of voluntary\ndeparture from the alien's perspective: it comes without the\nwaiting periods for seeking readmission attendant to an order of\nremoval. See Bocova, 412 F.3d at 265 & n.1. The unavailability of\nreopening from abroad, then, does not counsel in favor of tolling\nthe departure period based on the filing of a motion to reopen; in\nfact, it reinforces our conclusion that doing so would disrupt the\ncarefully calibrated bargain reflected in the voluntary departure\nprovisions of IIRAIRA.\n\n                               -14-\n\fperiods that frequently measured one year or more.                    394 F.3d at\n\n1284.   But IIRAIRA reined in this practice by allowing only 120 or\n\n60 days to depart voluntarily, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(2)(A), (b)(2),\n\nprohibiting courts from issuing any \"stay of an alien's removal\n\npending consideration of any claim with respect to voluntary\n\ndeparture,\" id. § 1229c(f), and imposing strict and mandatory\n\nsanctions on aliens who fail to depart on time, id. § 1229c(d)(1).\n\nThese provisions reflect a coherent effort to ensure that voluntary\n\ndeparture    does,   in   fact,   result      in    the    alien's    expeditious\n\ndeparture from the United States.               Reading § 1229a(7)(C)(1) as\n\nstopping    the   voluntary    departure      clock      would   contravene     this\n\npurpose,    allowing   the    filing    of    motions      to    reopen   to   delay\n\nvoluntary departure dates.        We cannot read the INA, as amended by\n\nIIRAIRA, as achieving this self-defeating result. See Banda-Ortiz,\n\n445 F.3d at 391.\n\n            The   conclusion      we    reach      has    been     criticized     as\n\noveremphasizing IIRAIRA's voluntary departure provisions at the\n\nexpense of those \"expressly codifying the tradition of motions to\n\nreopen . . . .\"      Azarte, 394 F.3d at 1289; see also Banda-Ortiz,\n\n445 F.3d at 391 (Smith, J., dissenting).                 Chedad makes a similar\n\ncomplaint in arguing that the voluntary departure provision does\n\nnot undermine his \"statutory right\" to file a motion to reopen.                    A\n\nstatutory right, however, is only as broad as the statute in\n\nquestion has made it.        As set forth above, we do not believe that\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fIIRAIRA made the right to seek reopening broad enough to supersede\n\nthe sixty-day limitation on voluntary departure imposed by a\n\ndifferent provision of the same act.\n\n              Chedad also urges us to disregard the BIA's 1996 decision\n\nin Shaar, on which both the IJ and the BIA relied in rejecting his\n\ntolling argument.        We have recognized that \"Shaar's continuing\n\nvitality is questionable,\" Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2006), but here, that likely infirmity is beside the point.\n\nOur decision does not in any way turn on Shaar but on IIRIA itself.\n\nCf.   id.      The   relevant    provisions     of   the   act    simply   do   not\n\ncontemplate suspending the voluntary departure period so that\n\naliens   who    have   chosen    that   form    of   relief   also   can   pursue\n\nreopening.     See Banda-Ortiz, 445 F.3d at 391.           That this might lead\n\naliens in removal proceedings to eschew voluntary departure so as\n\nnot to jeopardize their opportunity to reopen, and thus deprive the\n\ngovernment of the benefits of voluntary departure in a number of\n\ncases,      cannot   support    judicially     rewriting    the   statute.      If\n\nCongress thinks it has gone too far, it can make the necessary\n\nrevisions to the INA.\n\n                                        III.\n\n              Chedad also argues that, by granting his motion to\n\nreopen, the BIA vacated its prior decision affirming the IJ's\n\nvoluntary departure order such that his failure to comply with it\n\ncould not have triggered the penalties imposed by § 1229c(d)(1).\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fThe government responds that this argument is foreclosed by our\n\ndecision in DaCosta.        We agree.\n\n            In   DaCosta,     as    here,      the    BIA     entered   a   voluntary\n\ndeparture   order    against       the    alien,     but,     after   the   departure\n\ndeadline had passed, granted her motion to reopen the removal\n\nproceedings to consider her application for adjustment of status.\n\n449 F.3d at 47.       On remand, the INS argued that the alien was\n\nbarred   from    seeking    adjustment         of    status    by   operation     of   §\n\n1229(c)(d)(1),      because    she       had   not    complied      with    the   prior\n\nvoluntary departure order.           Id. at 48.        The IJ disagreed, ruling\n\nthat \"the BIA's order reopening the case extinguished the legal\n\nconsequences of [the alien's] failure to depart,\" but the BIA\n\noverturned that ruling on appeal.                    Id.      We upheld the BIA's\n\ndecision, reasoning that while \"the BIA's reopening of the case had\n\nthe legal effect of vacating the [voluntary departure] order, it\n\ncould not 'retroactively nullify' DaCosta's previous violation of\n\nthe terms of that order.\"9                Id. at 50-51 (quoting Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 370 F.3d 176, 180 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n\n\n\n9\n Amicus directs our attention to the Seventh Circuit's decision in\nOrichitch v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 595 (7th Cir. 2005), which held\nthat, by granting a motion to reopen filed after the deadline set\nby a prior voluntary departure order had lapsed, the BIA\n\"dispos[ed] of the order that otherwise triggered the operative\neffect\" of § 1229c(d)(1). Id. at 598. But this holding is at odds\nwith our holding in DaCosta, which we are bound to apply. See,\ne.g., United States v. Malouf, 466 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f             The same is true here.   The BIA's order of October 25,\n\n2002, rejecting Chedad's appeal from the IJ's denial of his request\n\nfor a continuance and denying his motion for remand, required\n\nChedad to leave the United States within thirty days or to suffer\n\nthe consequences enumerated in § 1229(c)(d)(1).      Chedad did not do\n\nso.   Instead, on November 22, 2002, he filed a motion to reopen,\n\nwhich the BIA ultimately granted on February 23, 2003.        At that\n\npoint, Chedad had overstayed his voluntary departure time by nearly\n\nthree months.     Section 1229c(d)(1) provides, unequivocally, that\n\n\"[i]f an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this\n\nsection and fails voluntarily to depart the United States within\n\nthe time specified, the alien shall . . . be ineligible for a\n\nperiod of 10 years for any further relief under . . . section[]\n\n. . . 1255 . . . of this title.\"        Chedad was permitted to depart\n\nvoluntarily, but failed to do so within the time specified.      He is\n\ntherefore barred from seeking adjustment of status for ten years.\n\nThis result follows automatically from Chedad's violation of the\n\nvoluntary departure order and cannot be altered by the BIA's later\n\ndecision to reopen the proceedings.       DaCosta, 449 F.3d at 51.\n\n             As Chedad points out, he filed his motion to reopen\n\nbefore the expiration of the voluntary departure period, while\n\nDaCosta waited until after the departure deadline had passed to\n\nfile hers.    In rejecting DaCosta's argument that the BIA nullified\n\nits voluntary departure order by reopening her case, we did note\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthat the \"voluntary departure period had already expired before she\n\nfiled her motion to reopen with the BIA.\"            449 F.3d at 50.       The\n\noutcome in DaCosta, however, turned on when the BIA granted the\n\nmotion to reopen, not when the motion was filed, because the \"order\n\nreopening DaCosta's case could not expunge her previous violation\n\nof an order to depart.\"        Id. at 51.        An alien cannot avoid the\n\nconsequences of § 1229c(d)(1) by filing a motion to reopen before\n\nthe departure deadline, allowing the deadline to pass without\n\nleaving the country, and receiving a favorable decision on the\n\nmotion to reopen somewhere down the road.           Such a result would be\n\ntantamount to tolling the departure period on the basis of a motion\n\nto reopen, so long as the motion is ultimately granted.             As we have\n\nexplained, we do not believe that IIRAIRA permits this outcome.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n           We recognize that the consequences of our decision are\n\nharsh: though Chedad's wife is an American citizen, he must leave\n\nthe   United   States,   and   cannot     seek    adjustment   of    his   own\n\nimmigration status for another ten years.           Moreover, this outcome\n\npresumably could have been avoided if Chedad's motion to remand the\n\ncase on the basis of his wife's newly acquired citizenship, which\n\nhe filed before the voluntary departure order became final, had\n\nbeen accompanied by his petition for adjustment of status as\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\frequired by the regulations.10        Nevertheless, neither the BIA's\n\ndecision to deny the motion based on this technical misstep, nor\n\nthe quality of Chedad's counsel's performance, are before us.\n\nChedad's   petition      presents    only   questions   of   statutory\n\ninterpretation which we have resolved against him.       The petition\n\nfor review is therefore denied.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n                  - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n10\n     Echoing this sentiment, the dissent suggests that Chedad's\ncase illustrates the importance of treating a motion to reopen as\ntolling the voluntary departure period, because \"with only one\nminor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is\nprecluded from seeking any relief for ten years.\" In fact, the\nten-year bar on relief arises from a mistake of a different\ncharacter--Chedad's failure to comply with the voluntary departure\norder despite his undisputed appreciation of the consequences.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f               LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.              Congress passed the\n\nIllegal    Immigration       Reform    and        Immigrant   Responsibility    Act\n\n(“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), containing\n\nboth the voluntary departure provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, and the\n\nmotion to reopen provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7), seemingly\n\nunaware of the conflict it was creating for those aliens who are\n\ngranted voluntary departure and wish to exercise their statutory\n\nright to file a motion to reopen.            I respectfully disagree with the\n\nmajority's resolution of that conflict.\n\n               As the majority acknowledges, an alien who files a motion\n\nto reopen after being granted voluntary departure, but before she\n\ndeparts, will, absent extraordinary circumstances, be unable to\n\nobtain a decision from the BIA before she is required to depart.\n\nSee Dekoladenu v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 500, 504 (4th Cir. 2006) (\"As\n\na practical matter, the BIA will rarely reach a decision on a\n\nmotion    to    reopen     before   the     end    of   the   voluntary   departure\n\nperiod.\"); Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 387, 393 n.5 (5th Cir.\n\n2006) (Smith, J., dissenting) (describing the backlog of cases\n\nbefore the BIA); 2006 EOIR Stat. Y.B. T2 (stating that in fiscal\n\nyear 2006, the BIA received 9,256 motions to reopen, about 23% of\n\nthe total number of appeals filed with the BIA in that year).                   Once\n\nshe departs, the alien's motion to reopen is withdrawn, and the\n\nlimitation      of   one   motion     per   alien       prevents   re-filing   after\n\ndeparture.      8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d).         If, like Chedad, the alien does\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fnot depart by the expiration of the voluntary departure period, any\n\nrelief will be denied due to her failure to depart, even if the\n\nmotion to reopen is granted.          8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (stating that a\n\nfailure to depart within the voluntary departure period will result\n\nin ineligibility “for a period of 10 years . . . [for] any further\n\nrelief,” including, inter alia, cancellation of removal, adjustment\n\nof status, and change of nonimmigrant classification). Thus, it is\n\neffectively       impossible   for    an    alien       who    receives    voluntary\n\ndeparture   to     obtain   any    relief    through      the   motion    to   reopen\n\nprocess, despite the seemingly all-inclusive textual provision\n\nallowing such motions.\n\n            Although the majority acknowledges this conflict, it\n\nfinds that Congress intended the voluntary departure provision to\n\ntake precedence over the motion to reopen provision.                       Under the\n\nmajority's interpretation, the statutory text allowing \"an alien,\"\n\nwithout further restriction or limitation, to file a motion to\n\nreopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), in effect applies only to those\n\naliens who do not apply for and receive voluntary departure.                       I\n\nfind   unpersuasive     the    reason      cited   by    the    majority    for   its\n\ninsistence that Congress intended this reading of the statute.\n\n            The     majority      asserts      that     Congress    intended      the\n\nlimitations on the voluntary departure period to be strictly\n\nenforced, even at the expense of an alien's right to file a motion\n\nto reopen, because of the importance of voluntary departure to the\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f\"smooth   functioning   of    the   country's    immigration    procedures.\"\n\nRelatedly, the majority notes that IIRIRA made a number of changes\n\nto the previously existing voluntary departure rules, including\n\nlimiting the length of the departure period and increasing the\n\nsanctions imposed on aliens who failed to comply with the terms of\n\nthe departure agreement.\n\n           I agree with the majority's conclusion that these changes\n\nreinforce the point that voluntary departure is a particularly\n\nimportant component of our immigration system.            However, in trying\n\nto resolve the statutory conflict raised here, we cannot look to\n\nIIRIRA's modifications to the voluntary departure scheme without\n\ngiving equal attention to IIRIRA's adoption of the motion to reopen\n\nprovision.     See   Banda-Ortiz,       445   F.3d   at   392   (Smith,   J.,\n\ndissenting)   (agreeing      that   \"voluntary   departure      represents    a\n\nbargain struck between an alien and the government,\" but objecting\n\n\"to limiting our search for the terms of that bargain to statutory\n\nprovisions conferring benefits on only one of the parties\").                 In\n\nother words, the best way to discern Congress' intent when it\n\npassed IIRIRA is to examine the statute as a whole, rather than\n\nfocusing on a single piece.         In my view, the panel majority gives\n\nshort shrift to IIRIRA's simultaneous addition of a right to file\n\na motion to reopen, and, therefore, fails to account for that\n\ncomponent of the statute in its assessment of Congress' intent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           Instead of effectively writing an exception into the\n\nmotion to reopen provision on such dubious grounds, I would follow\n\nthe majority of circuit courts and hold that a motion to reopen,\n\nfiled before the expiration of the voluntary departure period,\n\nautomatically tolls the running of that period until the BIA\n\nresolves the motion.    See Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278, 1289\n\n(9th Cir. 2005) (\"The BIA's interpretation . . . deprives the\n\nmotion   to   reopen   provision   of     meaning    by   eliminating      the\n\navailability of such motions to those granted voluntary departure.\n\nAn approach more consistent with the statute as a whole is to toll\n\nthe   voluntary   departure   period    when   an   alien,   prior   to   the\n\nexpiration of his voluntary departure period, files a timely motion\n\nto reopen . . . . Such an interpretation would effectuate both\n\nstatutory provisions.\" (footnote omitted)); see also Ugokwe v. U.S.\n\nAtt'y Gen., 453 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir. 2006); Kanivets v.\n\nGonzales, 424 F.3d 330, 335-36 (3d Cir. 2005); Sidikhouya v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 950, 952 (8th Cir. 2005).          But see Dekoladenu,\n\n459 F.3d at 505 (holding that the BIA is not required to toll the\n\nvoluntary departure period when a timely motion to reopen is filed\n\nbecause of the statutory construction canon requiring that narrower\n\nprovisions    (here,   the    voluntary    departure      provision)      take\n\nprecedence over conflicting general provisions (here, the motion to\n\nreopen provision)); Banda-Ortiz, 445 F.3d at 390-91 (holding that\n\nthe BIA is not required to toll the voluntary departure period\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fbecause such tolling would be \"in tension with, if not opposed to,\n\nlimits   on    the   length   of   and   authority   to   extend   voluntary\n\ndeparture,\" contrary to Congress' intent).\n\n              The two statutory provisions at issue here inescapably\n\nconflict, creating a certainty that the strict application of one\n\nprovision will distort the other. Although the majority's approach\n\nenforces a literal reading of the voluntary departure provision, it\n\ndoes so by effectively rewriting the plain text of the motion to\n\nreopen provision.      In the face of such a conflict, tolling offers\n\na way of harmonizing the conflicting statutes instead of choosing\n\nbetween them.\n\n              Tolling . . . accords with all of Congress's\n              objectives in IIRIRA. It preserves the right\n              of all removable aliens to file a single,\n              good-faith motion to reopen after a final\n              adjudicative order of the BIA. It also allows\n              aliens to seek voluntary departure without\n              fear   of   surrendering  other  avenues   of\n              procedural relief. Finally, it does no damage\n              to Congress's desire to place reasonable\n              limits on the voluntary departure period: The\n              total time initially allotted for departure\n              (and hence the time available to file to\n              reopen) still cannot exceed sixty days, and\n              limiting claimants to one motion to reopen,\n              supported by evidence of newly-discovered\n              facts, will temper the frequency and duration\n              of tolling.\n\nBanda-Ortiz, 445 F.3d at 394 (Smith, J., dissenting).\n\n              We have previously stated that tolling the voluntary\n\ndeparture period is not legally equivalent to extending it. Bocova\n\nv. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 269 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"A suspension of a\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fvoluntary departure period merely tolls the running of that period;\n\nit does not extend it.\")11; see also Desta v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d\n\n741, 747 (9th Cir. 2004) (defining a stay of voluntary departure as\n\n\"stopping the clock from running,\" but noting that a stay does not\n\n\"add[] more time to that clock\"); Lopez-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 383\n\nF.3d 650, 652 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"Staying a voluntary departure order\n\nmerely tolls the voluntary departure period; after the stay expires\n\n. . ., the clock begins ticking again and the alien has the balance\n\nof the days left in which to leave the country.\").      The distinction\n\nbetween a stay or tolling of a period and an extension of the\n\nperiod is widely recognized.    See, e.g., Johnson v. Railway Exp.\n\nAgency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 473 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring in\n\npart   and   dissenting   in   part)   (noting   that     the   \"common\n\nunderstanding\" of tolling is that \"tolling entails a suspension\n\nrather than an extension of a period of limitations\"); Sobers v.\n\nShannon Optical Co., 473 A.2d 1035, 1037 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984)\n\n(\"[A] suspension of proceedings and a tolling of time limitations\n\ncannot be construed as the equivalent of an extension of time.\").\n\n\n\n11\n  In Bocova v. Gonzales, we held that an alien who has received\nvoluntary departure and who seeks judicial review of the BIA's\nresolution of his case must file a motion seeking a stay of\nvoluntary departure before the departure period expires and must\nexplicitly request a stay. 412 F.3d 257, 268-69 (1st Cir. 2005).\nIn that case we rejected the claim that we could reinstate a\nvoluntary departure period that had expired while an appeal was\npending with our court; our ability to stay the departure period is\nlimited to cases in which a formal stay is requested before the\nperiod ends. Id.\n\n                                -26-\n\fApplying      that   principle,    the       tolling     approach   here    does    not\n\ncontravene the text of the voluntary departure provision. As Judge\n\nSmith, dissenting from the Fifth Circuit's decision in Banda-Ortiz,\n\nobserved, reliance on the doctrine of tolling does not \"undermine\"\n\nthe statutory text simply because the effect may be to lengthen the\n\nnumber of calendar days before the alien is required to depart.\n\n445 F.3d at 395 (Smith, J., dissenting).\n\n              We invoke the tolling remedy in our system of justice\n\nwhere the strict application of the time allotted for a particular\n\naction or filing leads to unfair or unjust results.                   See Salois v.\n\nDime Sav. Bank of N.Y., 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1997) (observing\n\nthat \"under federal law, equitable tolling is applied to statutes\n\nof limitations 'to prevent unjust results or to maintain the\n\nintegrity of a statute'\" (quoting King v. California, 784 F.2d 910,\n\n915 (9th Cir. 1986))).          I am not suggesting that the remedy of\n\nequitable tolling, in the classic sense, applies here. That remedy\n\napplies when the \"extraordinary circumstances\" of a particular case\n\nrequire relief from the time limits of a statute.                      Here, we are\n\ntrying   to    avoid   unfairness       on    a   much    larger    scale   from    the\n\nunforeseen      conflict   of     two    statutory       provisions.        But    that\n\ndifference only strengthens the argument for the application of a\n\ntolling remedy derived from equitable principles that are designed\n\nto preserve the integrity of a statutory deadline while avoiding\n\nthe harshness that can result from its unyielding application.\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f            The   majority   asserts    that   the   tolling     approach,\n\narticulated most fully by the Ninth Circuit in Azarte, 394 F.3d\n\n1278, is premised on the notion that \"motions to reopen are\n\navailable only in proceedings where voluntary departure has been\n\ngranted.\"    I find nothing in the text or reasoning of the other\n\ncircuits' opinions suggesting reliance on such a dubious premise.\n\nThe statute says that all aliens who have been unsuccessful in\n\nremoval proceedings may file a single motion to reopen, without any\n\nreference to those who receive voluntary departure and those who do\n\nnot.   I agree with the majority that there is no conflict between\n\nthis provision and the voluntary departure provision as applied to\n\nthose aliens who do not receive voluntary departure.           In my view,\n\nhowever, this observation is simply a restatement of the problem\n\nand not a resolution of it.\n\n            The majority also responds to the tolling approach by\n\nsaying that Chedad has no \"statutory right\" to file a motion to\n\nreopen because the statute does not provide such a right for those\n\nwho receive voluntary departure.         As the majority puts it: a\n\n\"statutory right [] is only as broad as the statute in question has\n\nmade it.\"    However, under the plain text of the statute, Chedad,\n\nlike every other alien who has been ordered removed, has a right to\n\nfile a single motion to reopen, so long as he does so within sixty\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fdays of the final order of removal.12        8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A).\n\nThe statement that Chedad has no \"right\" to file a motion to reopen\n\nderives not from the text of the statute, but from the majority's\n\nunderstanding of the legislative intent underlying that statute.\n\nLike the Ninth Circuit, I think \"the proposition that Congress,\n\nwhile expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen,\n\nintended   sub   silentio    to   preclude   their     availability   in    a\n\nsignificant    number   of   cases,\"   Azarte,   394   F.3d   at   1289,   is\n\nimplausible.\n\n           Although this case has all the indicia of a classic\n\ndebate over statutory interpretation, it has substantial real world\n\nimplications.    In fiscal year 2006, immigration courts granted\n\nvoluntary departure to over 22,000 aliens.           2006 EOIR Stat. Y.B.\n\nQ1.   There is no dispute that tolling is unavailable for aliens who\n\nfail to file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the\n\nvoluntary departure deadline.          See supra note 3.      Importantly,\n\nthose aliens who have received voluntary departure already have\n\nbeen required to show good moral character for five years and the\n\nabsence of any convictions for aggravated felonies or crimes of\n\n\n\n12\n     The statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), imposes a ninety-\nday deadline for filing motions to reopen.        However, we have\npreviously held that aliens who have received voluntary departure\nmust file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the\nvoluntary departure period, which is statutorily limited to sixty\ndays. See Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2006).\nTherefore, for aliens in Chedad's situation, the effective deadline\nfor such motions is only sixty days.\n\n                                   -29-\n\fmoral turpitude.     See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(1); see also Banda-\n\nOrtiz, 445 F.3d at 393 (Smith, J., dissenting) (\"The result is\n\nparticularly    harsh   when   one    considers    that   it   operates   to\n\ndisadvantage those aliens whose good behavior has entitled them to\n\nthe solicitude of the law of voluntary departure.\").           Even if only\n\na small percentage of those aliens granted voluntary departure\n\nwould file a timely motion to reopen, the majority's decision\n\nunwisely precludes any possibility of relief for aliens who might\n\nbe   entitled   to   such   relief    despite     the   exacting   standards\n\napplicable to motions to reopen.\n\n           The specific facts of this case illustrate that harsh\n\nreality.   Chedad has been in the United States for thirteen years,\n\nand has been in immigration proceedings for almost ten years, after\n\nhe overstayed his six-month non-immigrant visa.            At the time the\n\nproceedings began, he was married to a lawful permanent resident,\n\nwho had a pending application for naturalized citizenship, and he\n\nhas consistently asked the IJ and the BIA for a continuance so that\n\nhis wife's application could be processed and, accordingly, his\n\nstatus could be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). Although the IJ initially granted\n\nChedad a continuance, the IJ refused to allow any further delays\n\nafter a year.   Chedad requested and received voluntary departure,\n\nand asked again for a continuance.          The IJ denied his request and\n\ngave him sixty days to leave the country.         Chedad promptly filed an\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fappeal with the BIA.         While his appeal was pending, his wife's\n\ncitizenship was approved.       With his appeal still before the BIA,\n\nChedad filed a timely motion to remand, asking that his case be\n\nsent back to the IJ, before the BIA had decided the appeal, so that\n\nhe   could   adjust   his   status   in    light   of   his    wife's     American\n\ncitizenship.\n\n             Chedad, however, made his one and only procedural error\n\nat that time. His motion to remand was not accompanied by a\n\npetition for adjustment of status, as the regulations required. On\n\nthe basis of this technical oversight, the BIA denied the motion to\n\nremand   and    reinstated     the   IJ's    voluntary        departure    order.\n\nTherefore, Chedad could only present evidence of his wife's change\n\nin citizenship status through a motion to reopen filed with the\n\nBIA.   He filed that motion in a timely manner.               The BIA, in fact,\n\ngranted the motion to reopen, finding that he had made a prima\n\nfacie showing of his eligibility for adjustment of status.13                   The\n\nBIA sent his case back to the IJ, who then denied all relief\n\nbecause Chedad had remained in the country after the expiration of\n\nthe voluntary departure period.           If the timely filing of Chedad's\n\nmotion to reopen tolled the running of the sixty-day voluntary\n\n\n\n13\n     In order to prevail on a motion to reopen, an alien must\nsatisfy two requirements: she must \"establish a 'prima facie case\nfor the underlying substantive relief sought' and . . . introduce\n'previously unavailable, material evidence.'\" Fesseha v. Ashcroft,\n333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,\n104 (1988)).\n\n                                     -31-\n\fdeparture period, he could have presented his case for relief to\n\nthe IJ.\n\n            Chedad has shown consistent cooperation and compliance\n\nwith   a   maze   of   immigration   laws   and   regulations.      He   has\n\ndemonstrated his good moral character for a period of five years\n\nand has not been convicted of any aggravated felonies or crimes of\n\nmoral turpitude.       He is married to an American citizen and now,\n\nafter nearly a decade of navigating our legal system, with only one\n\nminor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is\n\nprecluded from seeking any relief for ten years.                 That stark\n\noutcome may be repeated many times over by the failure to harmonize\n\nthe conflicting statutory provisions at issue in this case in a\n\nsensible and fair manner.\n\n            I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\f",

The basis of the IJ's decision, and its affirmance, was that Chedad was ineligible for any such adjustment because he had overstayed a period of voluntary departure imposed as part of a prior BIA order closing the removal proceedings against him.<sup>[1]</sup> Before the voluntary departure period lapsed, however, Chedad had filed a motion with the BIA to reopen those proceedings due to previously unavailable evidence.</p>\n<p>The BIA granted the motion to reopen and remanded the matter to the IJ, who, as just noted, deemed Chedad ineligible for any further relief because he had disobeyed the voluntary departure order. Chedad argues that the BIA erroneously affirmed the IJ's ruling, either because the filing of his motion to reopen tolled the running of the voluntary departure period, or because the BIA's allowance of the motion stripped the voluntary departure order of any legal significance. We deny Chedad's petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") commenced removal proceedings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> against Chedad, a native of Morocco, in 1997, asserting that he had remained in the United States beyond the time permitted by the six-month nonimmigrant visa issued to him in 1994.<sup>[2]</sup> Chedad appeared before the IJ with counsel on May 28, 1998 and admitted overstaying his visa. He also requested a continuance of the proceedings on the ground that his wife, Joanne S. Franciscoa lawful permanent resident of the United Stateshad filed an application for citizenship, as well as a visa application on Chedad's behalf, known as an I-130 petition. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 204.1(a)(1) (2006).<sup>[3]</sup> If Francisco became a naturalized citizen of the United States, then Chedad would become immediately eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). The IJ therefore granted Chedad's motion for a continuance to allow the processing of his spouse's applications. Chedad later received a second continuance for that purpose. Meanwhile, Francisco's I-130 petition on Chedad's behalf was approved on October 21, 1998.</p>\n<p>Francisco's application for naturalization was still pending when removal proceedings against Chedad resumed on March 4, 1999. Though Chedad sought another continuance on that ground, the IJ refused, giving him the choice between the entry of a final order of removal and an opportunity to seek voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b). Chedad elected voluntary departure and received a continuance so that he could obtain a valid travel document for the purpose of leaving the country.</p>\n<p>When Chedad reappeared before the IJ on June 11, 1999, he again moved for a continuance to allow the processing of his wife's application for citizenship; the IJ again denied the motion. Instead, the IJ granted Chedad's motion for voluntary departure, requiring him to leave in sixty days. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b)(2). The IJ also warned Chedad of the consequences of disobeying the voluntary departure order, including the loss of the opportunity to pursue adjustment of immigration status through several different avenues for a period of ten years. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(d)(1) (Supp.2006).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Chedad appealed the IJ's denial of his final motion for a continuance to the BIA. During the pendency of the appeal, on May 24, 2001, Francisco completed the naturalization process. On July 15, 2002, with the appeal still pending, Chedad filed a motion to remand with the BIA, citing his newly minted status as the spouse of a United States citizen, as well as the prior approval of his I-130 petition.</p>\n<p>The BIA dismissed Chedad's appeal and denied his motion to remand in an order issued on October 25, 2002. First, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> BIA ruled that the IJ had not abused her discretion in denying Chedad's final request for a continuance of the removal proceedings. Second, the BIA denied the motion to remand because it was unaccompanied by an application for adjustment of Chedad's status to that of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as required by BIA rules. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA granted Chedad thirty days from the date of its order to depart the country voluntarily, repeating the IJ's admonition about the consequences of any failure to do so.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 22, 2002, before the expiration of the voluntary departure period, Chedad filed a motion with the BIA to reopen the removal proceedings, again asserting that he had become eligible for adjustment of status under § 1255(a). This filing, made within ninety days of the BIA's decision as required by the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), and its implementing regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), included the application for adjustment of status and supporting materials that had been omitted from Chedad's earlier motion to remand. Noting that Chedad's motion to reopen \"demonstrate[d] that he is now prima facie eligible for adjustment of status,\" the BIA granted the motion in an order dated February 21, 2003, remanding the case to the IJ \"for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\" The BIA's order made no mention of the voluntary departure requirement previously imposed.</p>\n<p>When the proceedings found their way back to the IJ, however, the prior voluntary departure orderwhich Chedad had not satisfiedproved dispositive. The IJ determined that, because Chedad had failed to leave the United States as required, he had become ineligible for adjustment of status by operation of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). The IJ rejected Chedad's arguments that (1) the BIA had nullified its voluntary departure order by granting his motion to reopen, and (2) the filing of his motion to reopen, on November 22, 2002, had tolled the running of the voluntary departure period. In rejecting these arguments, the IJ relied on <i>Matter of Shaar,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), <i>aff'd,</i> 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir.1998), which held that the filing of a motion to reopen does not itself toll the voluntary departure period. The IJ therefore pretermitted Chedad's application for adjustment of status and ordered him removed from the United States.</p>\n<p>Chedad appealed, repeating the arguments he had made before the IJ. In particular, Chedad noted that <i>Shaar</i> had recently been overruled by the Ninth Circuit, which held that a timely motion to reopen could toll the voluntary departure period. <i>Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1278, 1289 (9th Cir.2005). The BIA, however, did not consider itself bound by <i>Azarte,</i> or similar decisions from other circuits, in a case arising within this court's appellate jurisdiction, and therefore rejected Chedad's tolling argument. As to Chedad's contention that the BIA had emasculated its prior voluntary departure order by granting the motion to reopen, the BIA explained that the latter decision \"was based solely on the fact that [Chedad] had established prima facie eligibility for relief and not based on [the BIA's] adjudication of the merits of his claim; also, [his] motion had not been opposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> by [the INS] so no issues were raised to rebut [his] eligibility for relief.\" The BIA therefore upheld the IJ's ruling that Chedad was disqualified from seeking adjustment of status based on his disobedience of the voluntary departure order  a fact that had not been considered by the BIA in previously deciding to remand the case. Chedad then petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p>In his petition, Chedad argues that the BIA mistakenly upheld the IJ's reliance on the voluntary departure order as a basis for disqualifying him from further relief. We have jurisdiction over such a petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), which provides for \"review of a final order of removal,\" notwithstanding the jurisdiction-stripping provision of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). <i>DaCosta v. Gonzales,</i> 449 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (exercising jurisdiction over BIA's ruling that violation of voluntary departure order rendered alien ineligible for adjustment of status because BIA did not reach merits of adjustment claim).</p>\n<p>Chedad contends that the BIA erred in refusing to treat (1) the filing of his motion to reopen as tolling the voluntary departure period, or (2) the allowance of the motion as depriving the voluntary departure order of its effect. In considering such arguments, \"[w]e afford de novo review to the BIA's legal conclusions, but cede some deference to its interpretations of the INA.\" <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Chedad argues that the provisions of the INA authorizing motions to reopen, on the one hand, and voluntary departure, on the other, conflict in such a way as to require the timely filing of the former to toll the running of the latter. This argument has prevailed in a number of circuits, <i>see </i><i>Ugokwe v. Attorney Gen.,</i> 453 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Kanivets v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 330, 335 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Sidikhouya v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 950, 952 (8th Cir.2005); <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1289, but has failed in others, <i>see </i><i>Dekoladenu v. Gonzales,</i> 459 F.3d 500, 507 (4th Cir.2006); <i>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir.2006). We now consider the question.</p>\n<p>The INA's voluntary departure provision plays an important part in the smooth functioning of the country's immigration procedures. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>DaCosta,</i> 449 F.3d at 50; <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 265 (1st Cir.2005). Subject to a number of qualifications, the Attorney General, at his discretion, may grant an alien's request to depart the United States voluntarily, either in lieu of commencing deportation proceedings or at the conclusion of those proceedings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1). From the alien's perspective, voluntary departure offers certain benefits, among them avoiding the penalties attendant to deportation, which include five- or ten-year bars on seeking readmission to the country. <i>Id.</i> §§ 1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (ii); <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265 &amp; n. 1. The government also benefits from voluntary departure by \"expediting departures and eliminating the costs associated with deportation.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p>The INA imposes harsh penalties, however, on aliens who do not live up to their end of the voluntary departure bargain. An alien who \"fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time period specified\" receives monetary sanctions and becomes ineligible for a number of forms of immigration relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of ten years. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1). The IJ relied on this provision in pretermitting Chedad's application for adjustment of status based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> on his wife's naturalization. The INA also strictly limits the time allowable for the alien to leave the United States. In a case, like Chedad's, of voluntary departure ordered at the conclusion of deportation proceedings, the voluntary departure period cannot exceed 60 days.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The availability of motions to reopen removal proceedings is also restricted. <i>Id.</i> § 1229a(c)(7). Such motions must be based on material evidence that \"was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,\" including \"circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing\" which bear on the alien's eligibility for discretionary relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). An alien ordinarily may file only one such motion after the close of proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A). Furthermore, and of particular note here, a motion to reopen \"shall be filed within 90 days of the date of an administrative order of removal,\" subject to certain exceptions inapplicable to Chedad. <i>Id.</i> § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p>Those courts holding that a timely motion to reopen suspends the running of the voluntary departure period have perceived a conflict between § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), which allows ninety days to file a motion to reopen, and § 1229c(b)(2), which limits voluntary departure granted at the close of removal proceedings to just sixty days. <i>Ugokwe,</i> 453 F.3d at 1331; <i>Kanivets,</i> 424 F.3d at 335; <i>Sidikhouya,</i> 407 F.3d at 952; <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1286. While the motion to reopen had long been recognized in deportation proceedings as a matter of practice and, later, by administrative rulemaking, Congress did not put its imprimatur on the vehicle until the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), which \"provided the [aforementioned] statutory right to a motion to reopen.\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1283 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A) (1996)). IIRIRA also, however, \"drastically limited the time allowed for voluntary departure,\" <i>id.</i> at 1285, imposing, <i>inter alia,</i> the sixty-day limitation found at 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The joint effect of these provisions is practically to foreclose the availability of motions to reopen in most cases where the alien has received voluntary departure. As <i>Azarte</i> observes, even an alien who seeks reopening at the outset of the voluntary departure period has little hope of receiving a decision before the expiration of the departure deadline. 394 F.3d at 1287. If the alien defies the voluntary departure order by remaining in the United States pending action on the motion to reopen, the alien will be automatically cut off from a number of avenues of relief by operation of § 1229c(d)(1), including, in many cases, the very relief he or she sought reopening to pursue, <i>i.e.,</i> adjustment of status. On the other hand, if the alien complies with the order and leaves, the BIA will treat the motion as withdrawn, also precluding any relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). <i>Azarte</i> and its progeny reason that this \"`Catch-22' situation\" calls for tolling the voluntary departure period while the alien awaits the BIA's ruling on a timely motion to reopen. <i>Kanivets,</i> 424 F.3d at 334; <i>see also </i><i>Ugokwe,</i> 453 F.3d at 1331; <i>Sidikhouya,</i> 407 F.3d at 952.</p>\n<p>Though there is some force to this reasoning, we believe that it proceeds from an erroneous premise, namely, that motions to reopen are available <i>only</i> in proceedings where voluntary departure has been granted. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> Subsection 1229a(c)(7), however, permits \"one motion to reopen proceedings under this section,\" which include <i>all</i> \"proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1). Proceedings where voluntary departure has not been granted, naturally, spawn no \"conflict\" between the deadline for moving to reopen and the deadline for leaving the country voluntarily.</p>\n<p>In our view, holding aliens to the sixty-day limit on voluntary departure imposed by § 1229c(b)(2), despite the ninety-day limit on motions to reopen granted by § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), does not \"deprive[ ] the motion to reopen provision of meaning by eliminating the availability of such motions to those granted voluntary departure.\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1288. Rather, § 1229a(c)(7) has significance for aliens who have not sought the benefits of voluntary departure and can therefore pursue reopening without regard for the sixty-day deadline.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Dekoladenu,</i> 459 F.3d at 505-06. We cannot accept <i>Azarte</i>'s reasoning that Congress could not have intended to subject motions to reopen to the voluntary departure cutoff because that would \"preclude their availability in a significant number of cases, likely a substantial majority.\" 394 F.3d at 1289; <i>accord </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 393 (Smith, J., dissenting). <i>Azarte</i> did not cite any authority for the proposition that voluntary departure is entered in \"a substantial majority\" of removal proceedings. In fact, as the Fourth Circuit noted in <i>Dekoladenu,</i> 459 F.3d at 506 n. 5, available statistics indicate that voluntary departure was granted in just ten percent of removal cases in 2006, and has never been granted in more than eighteen percent of them in any of the last five years. Executive Office for Immigration Review, <i>FY 2005 Statistical Yearbook</i> Q1 (2006), <i>available at</i> http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/statspub/fy06 syb.pdf (last visited May 25, 2007).</p>\n<p>We read §§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 1229c(b)(2), then, as evincing a congressional intent to make the benefits of voluntary departure available only to aliens who agree to give up the fight and leave the country willingly.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> F.3d at 391. This may or may not be wise policy, but it is, we believe, the most plausible construction of the statute. As <i>Azarte</i> notes, the pre-IIRIRA version of the INA put no time limits on voluntary departure, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(e) (1995), resulting in departure periods that frequently measured one year or more. 394 F.3d at 1284. But IIRIRA reined in this practice by allowing only 120 or 60 days to depart voluntarily, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(2)(A), (b)(2), prohibiting courts from issuing any \"stay of an alien's removal pending consideration of any claim with respect to voluntary departure,\" <i>id.</i> § 1229c(f), and imposing strict and mandatory sanctions on aliens who fail to depart on time, <i>id.</i> § 1229c(d)(1). These provisions reflect a coherent effort to ensure that voluntary departure does, in fact, result in the alien's expeditious departure from the United States. Reading § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) as stopping the voluntary departure clock would contravene this purpose, allowing the filing of motions to reopen to delay voluntary departure dates. We cannot read the INA, as amended by IIRIRA, as achieving this self-defeating result. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p>The conclusion we reach has been criticized as overemphasizing IIRIRA's voluntary departure provisions at the expense of those \"expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen. . . .\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1289; <i>see also </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391 (Smith, J., dissenting). Chedad makes a similar complaint in arguing that the voluntary departure provision does not undermine his \"statutory right\" to file a motion to reopen. A statutory right, however, is only as broad as the statute in question has made it. As set forth above, we do not believe that IIRIRA made the right to seek reopening broad enough to supersede the sixty-day limitation on voluntary departure imposed by a different provision of the same act.</p>\n<p>Chedad also urges us to disregard the BIA's 1996 decision in <i>Shaar,</i> on which both the IJ and the BIA relied in rejecting his tolling argument. We have recognized that \"<i>Shaar</i>'s continuing vitality is questionable,\" <i>Naeem v. Gonzales,</i> 469 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir.2006), but here, that likely infirmity is beside the point. Our decision does not in any way turn on <i>Shaar</i> but on IIRIRA itself. <i>Cf. id.</i> The relevant provisions of the act simply do not contemplate suspending the voluntary departure period so that aliens who have chosen that form of relief also can pursue reopening. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391. That this might lead aliens in removal proceedings to eschew voluntary departure so as not to jeopardize their opportunity to reopen, and thus deprive the government of the benefits of voluntary departure in a number of cases, cannot support judicially rewriting the statute. If Congress thinks it has gone too far, it can make the necessary revisions to the INA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Chedad also argues that, by granting his motion to reopen, the BIA vacated its prior decision affirming the IJ's voluntary departure order such that his failure to comply with it could not have triggered the penalties imposed by § 1229c(d)(1). The government responds that this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <i>DaCosta.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>DaCosta,</i> as here, the BIA entered a voluntary departure order against the alien, but, <i>after the departure deadline had</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> <i>passed,</i> granted her motion to reopen the removal proceedings to consider her application for adjustment of status. 449 F.3d at 47. On remand, the INS argued that the alien was barred from seeking adjustment of status by operation of § 1229c(d)(1), because she had not complied with the prior voluntary departure order. <i>Id.</i> at 48. The IJ disagreed, ruling that \"the BIA's order reopening the case extinguished the legal consequences of [the alien's] failure to depart,\" but the BIA overturned that ruling on appeal. <i>Id.</i> We upheld the BIA's decision, reasoning that while \"the BIA's reopening of the case had the legal effect of vacating the [voluntary departure] order, it could not `retroactively nullify' DaCosta's previous violation of the terms of that order.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 50-51 (quoting <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 370 F.3d 176, 180 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>The same is true here. The BIA's order of October 25, 2002, rejecting Chedad's appeal from the IJ's denial of his request for a continuance and denying his motion for remand, required Chedad to leave the United States within thirty days or to suffer the consequences enumerated in § 1229c(d)(1). Chedad did not do so. Instead, on November 22, 2002, he filed a motion to reopen, which the BIA ultimately granted on February 23, 2003. At that point, Chedad had overstayed his voluntary departure time by nearly three months. Section 1229c(d)(1) provides, unequivocally, that \"[i]f an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time specified, the alien shall . . . be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under . . . section[ ] . . . 1255 . . . of this title.\" Chedad was permitted to depart voluntarily, but failed to do so within the time specified. He is therefore barred from seeking adjustment of status for ten years. This result follows automatically from Chedad's violation of the voluntary departure order and cannot be altered by the BIA's later decision to reopen the proceedings. <i>DaCosta,</i> 449 F.3d at 51.</p>\n<p>As Chedad points out, he filed his motion to reopen <i>before</i> the expiration of the voluntary departure period, while DaCosta waited until <i>after</i> the departure deadline had passed to file hers. In rejecting DaCosta's argument that the BIA nullified its voluntary departure order by reopening her case, we did note that the \"voluntary departure period had already expired <i>before</i> she filed her motion to reopen with the BIA.\" 449 F.3d at 50. The outcome in <i>DaCosta,</i> however, turned on when the BIA granted the motion to reopen, not when the motion was filed, because the \"order reopening DaCosta's case could not expunge her previous violation of an order to depart.\" <i>Id.</i> at 51. An alien cannot avoid the consequences of § 1229c(d)(1) by filing a motion to reopen before the departure deadline, allowing the deadline to pass without leaving the country, and receiving a favorable decision on the motion to reopen somewhere down the road. Such a result would be tantamount to tolling the departure period on the basis of a motion to reopen, so long as the motion is ultimately granted. As we have explained, we do not believe that IIRIRA permits this outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> IV.</h2>\n<p>We recognize that the consequences of our decision are harsh: though Chedad's wife is an American citizen, he must leave the United States, and cannot seek adjustment of his own immigration status for another ten years. Moreover, this outcome presumably could have been avoided if Chedad's motion to remand the case on the basis of his wife's newly acquired citizenship, which he filed before the voluntary departure order became final, had been accompanied by his petition for adjustment of status as required by the regulations.<sup>[10]</sup> Nevertheless, neither the BIA's decision to deny the motion based on this technical misstep, nor the quality of Chedad's counsel's performance, are before us. Chedad's petition presents only questions of statutory interpretation which we have resolved against him. The petition for review is therefore <i>denied.</i></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), containing both the voluntary departure provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, and the motion to reopen provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7), seemingly unaware of the conflict it was creating for those aliens who are granted voluntary departure <i>and</i> wish to exercise their statutory right to file a motion to reopen. I respectfully disagree with the majority's resolution of that conflict.</p>\n<p>As the majority acknowledges, an alien who files a motion to reopen after being granted voluntary departure, but before she departs, will, absent extraordinary circumstances, be unable to obtain a decision from the BIA before she is required to depart. <i>See </i><i>Dekoladenu v. Gonzales,</i> 459 F.3d 500, 504 (4th Cir.2006) (\"As a practical matter, the BIA will rarely reach a decision on a motion to reopen before the end of the voluntary departure period.\"); <i>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 387, 393 n. 5 (5th Cir.2006) (Smith, J., dissenting) (describing the backlog of cases before the BIA); 2006 EOIR Stat. Y.B. T2 (stating that in fiscal year 2006, the BIA received 9,256 motions to reopen, about 23% of the total number of appeals filed with the BIA in that year). Once she departs, the alien's motion to reopen is withdrawn, and the limitation of one motion per alien prevents re-filing after departure. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). If, like Chedad, the alien does not depart by the expiration of the voluntary departure period, any relief will be denied due to her failure to depart, even if the motion to reopen is granted. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (stating that a failure to depart within the voluntary departure period will result in ineligibility \"for a period of 10 years . . . [for] any further relief,\" including, <i>inter alia,</i> cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and change of nonimmigrant classification). Thus, it is effectively impossible for an alien who receives voluntary departure to obtain any relief through the motion to reopen process, despite the seemingly all-inclusive textual provision allowing such motions.</p>\n<p>Although the majority acknowledges this conflict, it finds that Congress intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> the voluntary departure provision to take precedence over the motion to reopen provision. Under the majority's interpretation, the statutory text allowing \"an alien,\" without further restriction or limitation, to file a motion to reopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), in effect applies only to those aliens who do not apply for and receive voluntary departure. I find unpersuasive the reason cited by the majority for its insistence that Congress intended this reading of the statute.</p>\n<p>The majority asserts that Congress intended the limitations on the voluntary departure period to be strictly enforced, even at the expense of an alien's right to file a motion to reopen, because of the importance of voluntary departure to the \"smooth functioning of the country's immigration procedures.\" Relatedly, the majority notes that IIRIRA made a number of changes to the previously existing voluntary departure rules, including limiting the length of the departure period and increasing the sanctions imposed on aliens who failed to comply with the terms of the departure agreement.</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority's conclusion that these changes reinforce the point that voluntary departure is a particularly important component of our immigration system. However, in trying to resolve the statutory conflict raised here, we cannot look to IIRIRA's modifications to the voluntary departure scheme without giving equal attention to IIRIRA's adoption of the motion to reopen provision. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 392 (Smith, J., dissenting) (agreeing that \"voluntary departure represents a bargain struck between an alien and the government,\" but objecting \"to limiting our search for the terms of that bargain to statutory provisions conferring benefits on only one of the parties\"). In other words, the best way to discern Congress' intent when it passed IIRIRA is to examine the statute as a whole, rather than focusing on a single piece. In my view, the panel majority gives short shrift to IIRIRA's simultaneous addition of a right to file a motion to reopen, and, therefore, fails to account for that component of the statute in its assessment of Congress' intent.</p>\n<p>Instead of effectively writing an exception into the motion to reopen provision on such dubious grounds, I would follow the majority of circuit courts and hold that a motion to reopen, filed before the expiration of the voluntary departure period, automatically tolls the running of that period until the BIA resolves the motion. <i>See </i><i>Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1278, 1289 (9th Cir.2005) (\"The BIA's interpretation . . . deprives the motion to reopen provision of meaning by eliminating the availability of such motions to those granted voluntary departure. An approach more consistent with the statute as a whole is to toll the voluntary departure period when an alien, prior to the expiration of his voluntary departure period, files a timely motion to reopen. . . . Such an interpretation would effectuate both statutory provisions.\" (footnote omitted)); <i>see also </i><i>Ugokwe v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,</i> 453 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Kanivets v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 330, 335-36 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Sidikhouya v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 950, 952 (8th Cir.2005). <i>But see </i><i>Dekoladenu,</i> 459 F.3d at 505 (holding that the BIA is not required to toll the voluntary departure period when a timely motion to reopen is filed because of the statutory construction canon requiring that narrower provisions (here, the voluntary departure provision) take precedence over conflicting general provisions (here, the motion to reopen provision)); <i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 390-91 (holding that the BIA is not required to toll the voluntary departure period because such tolling would be \"in tension with, if not opposed to, limits on the length <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> of and authority to extend voluntary departure,\" contrary to Congress' intent).</p>\n<p>The two statutory provisions at issue here inescapably conflict, creating a certainty that the strict application of one provision will distort the other. Although the majority's approach enforces a literal reading of the voluntary departure provision, it does so by effectively rewriting the plain text of the motion to reopen provision. In the face of such a conflict, tolling offers a way of harmonizing the conflicting statutes instead of choosing between them.</p>\n<blockquote>Tolling . . . accords with all of Congress's objectives in IIRIRA. It preserves the right of all removable aliens to file a single, good-faith motion to reopen after a final adjudicative order of the BIA. It also allows aliens to seek voluntary departure without fear of surrendering other avenues of procedural relief. Finally, it does no damage to Congress's desire to place reasonable limits on the voluntary departure period: The total time initially allotted for departure (and hence the time available to file to reopen) still cannot exceed sixty days, and limiting claimants to one motion to reopen, supported by evidence of newly-discovered facts, will temper the frequency and duration of tolling.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 394 (Smith, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>We have previously stated that tolling the voluntary departure period is not legally equivalent to extending it. <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 269 (1st Cir.2005) (\"A suspension of a voluntary departure period merely tolls the running of that period; it does not extend it.\")<sup>[11]</sup>; <i>see also </i><i>Desta v. Ashcroft,</i> 365 F.3d 741, 747 (9th Cir.2004) (defining a stay of voluntary departure as \"stopping the clock from running,\" but noting that a stay does not \"add[ ] more time to that clock\"); <i>Lopez-Chavez v. Ashcroft,</i> 383 F.3d 650, 652 (7th Cir.2004) (\"Staying a voluntary departure order merely tolls the voluntary departure period; after the stay expires . . ., the clock begins ticking again and the alien has the balance of the days left in which to leave the country.\"). The distinction between a stay or tolling of a period and an extension of the period is widely recognized. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Railway Exp. Agency, Inc.,</i> 421 U.S. 454, 473, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the \"common understanding\" of tolling is that \"tolling entails a suspension rather than an extension of a period of limitations\"); <i>Sobers v. Shannon Optical Co.,</i> 326 Pa.Super. 170, 473 A.2d 1035, 1037 (1984) (\"[A] suspension of proceedings and a tolling of time limitations cannot be construed as the equivalent of an extension of time.\"). Applying that principle, the tolling approach here does not contravene the text of the voluntary departure provision. As Judge Smith, dissenting from the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> observed, reliance on the doctrine of tolling does not \"undermine\" the statutory text simply because the effect may be to lengthen the number of calendar days before the alien is required to depart. 445 F.3d at 395 (Smith, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>We invoke the tolling remedy in our system of justice where the strict application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> of the time allotted for a particular action or filing leads to unfair or unjust results. <i>See </i><i>Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank of N.Y.,</i> 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1997) (observing that \"under federal law, equitable tolling is applied to statutes of limitations `to prevent unjust results or to maintain the integrity of a statute'\" (quoting <i>King v. California,</i> 784 F.2d 910, 915 (9th Cir. 1986))). I am not suggesting that the remedy of equitable tolling, in the classic sense, applies here. That remedy applies when the \"extraordinary circumstances\" of a particular case require relief from the time limits of a statute. Here, we are trying to avoid unfairness on a much larger scale from the unforeseen conflict of two statutory provisions. But that difference only strengthens the argument for the application of a tolling remedy derived from equitable principles that are designed to preserve the integrity of a statutory deadline while avoiding the harshness that can result from its unyielding application.</p>\n<p>The majority asserts that the tolling approach, articulated most fully by the Ninth Circuit in <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d 1278, is premised on the notion that \"motions to reopen are available <i>only</i> in proceedings where voluntary departure has been granted.\" I find nothing in the text or reasoning of the other circuits' opinions suggesting reliance on such a dubious premise. The statute says that <i>all</i> aliens who have been unsuccessful in removal proceedings may file a single motion to reopen, without any reference to those who receive voluntary departure and those who do not. I agree with the majority that there is no conflict between this provision and the voluntary departure provision as applied to those aliens who do not receive voluntary departure. In my view, however, this observation is simply a restatement of the problem and not a resolution of it.</p>\n<p>The majority also responds to the tolling approach by saying that Chedad has no \"statutory right\" to file a motion to reopen because the statute does not provide such a right for those who receive voluntary departure. As the majority puts it: a \"statutory right [ ] is only as broad as the statute in question has made it.\" However, under the plain text of the statute, Chedad, like every other alien who has been ordered removed, has a right to file a single motion to reopen, so long as he does so within sixty days of the final order of removal.<sup>[12]</sup> 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A). The statement that Chedad has no \"right\" to file a motion to reopen derives not from the text of the statute, but from the majority's understanding of the legislative intent underlying that statute. Like the Ninth Circuit, I think \"the proposition that Congress, while expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen, intended sub silentio to preclude their availability in a significant number of cases,\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1289, is implausible.</p>\n<p>Although this case has all the indicia of a classic debate over statutory interpretation, it has substantial real world implications. In fiscal year 2006, immigration courts granted voluntary departure to over 22,000 aliens. 2006 EOIR Stat. Y.B. Q1. There is no dispute that tolling is unavailable for aliens who fail to file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure deadline. <i>See supra</i> note 3. Importantly, those aliens who have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> received voluntary departure already have been required to show good moral character for five years and the absence of any convictions for aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 393 (Smith, J., dissenting) (\"The result is particularly harsh when one considers that it operates to disadvantage those aliens whose good behavior has entitled them to the solicitude of the law of voluntary departure.\"). Even if only a small percentage of those aliens granted voluntary departure would file a timely motion to reopen, the majority's decision unwisely precludes any possibility of relief for aliens who might be entitled to such relief despite the exacting standards applicable to motions to reopen.</p>\n<p>The specific facts of this case illustrate that harsh reality. Chedad has been in the United States for thirteen years, and has been in immigration proceedings for almost ten years, after he overstayed his six-month non-immigrant visa. At the time the proceedings began, he was married to a lawful permanent resident, who had a pending application for naturalized citizenship, and he has consistently asked the IJ and the BIA for a continuance so that his wife's application could be processed and, accordingly, his status could be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). Although the IJ initially granted Chedad a continuance, the IJ refused to allow any further delays after a year. Chedad requested and received voluntary departure, and asked again for a continuance. The IJ denied his request and gave him sixty days to leave the country. Chedad promptly filed an appeal with the BIA. While his appeal was pending, his wife's citizenship was approved. With his appeal still before the BIA, Chedad filed a timely motion to remand, asking that his case be sent back to the IJ, before the BIA had decided the appeal, so that he could adjust his status in light of his wife's American citizenship.</p>\n<p>Chedad, however, made his one and only procedural error at that time. His motion to remand was not accompanied by a petition for adjustment of status, as the regulations required. On the basis of this technical oversight, the BIA denied the motion to remand and reinstated the IJ's voluntary departure order. Therefore, Chedad could only present evidence of his wife's change in citizenship status through a motion to reopen filed with the BIA. He filed that motion in a timely manner. The BIA, in fact, granted the motion to reopen, finding that he had made a prima facie showing of his eligibility for adjustment of status.<sup>[13]</sup> The BIA sent his case back to the IJ, who then denied all relief because Chedad had remained in the country after the expiration of the voluntary departure period. If the timely filing of Chedad's motion to reopen tolled the running of the sixty-day voluntary departure period, he could have presented his case for relief to the IJ.</p>\n<p>Chedad has shown consistent cooperation and compliance with a maze of immigration laws and regulations. He has demonstrated his good moral character for a period of five years and has not been convicted of any aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude. He is married to an American citizen and now, after nearly a decade of navigating our legal system, with only one minor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> precluded from seeking any relief for ten years. That stark outcome may be repeated many times over by the failure to harmonize the conflicting statutory provisions at issue in this case in a sensible and fair manner.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"the INA\") provides a mechanism for an alien, subject to the discretion of the Attorney General and other limitations, \"to depart the United States voluntarily at his own expense\" in lieu of continued participation in removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1) (2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  In March 2003, the INS was abolished and its functions were transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. <i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, §§ 451(b) <i>and</i> 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135, 2195 <i>and</i> 2205, <i>codified at</i> 6 U.S.C. §§ 271(b) <i>and</i> 291(a) (Supp.2006). For consistency, we will refer to the responsible agency as \"the INS\" throughout our opinion.</p>\n<p>[3]  Since Chedad's proceedings before the BIA, many of its regulations have been recodified without changing their substance. For purposes of clarity, we will cite to the applicable regulations as currently codified.</p>\n<p>[4]  In 2006, Congress amended 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) through the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-162 § 812, 119 Stat. 2960, 3057 (2006). This amendment, in relevant part, renumbered the penalty provision of § 1229c(d) as § 1229c(d)(1). For purposes of clarity, we will cite to the current subsection number throughout our opinion.</p>\n<p>[5]  The execution of the IJ's sixty-day voluntary departure order had been stayed pending Chedad's appeal. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.6(a). Because thirty days had already expired by the time Chedad filed the appeal, thirty days of voluntary departure time remained at the time of the BIA's decision. <i>See id.</i> § 1240.26(f).</p>\n<p>[6]  By contrast, a voluntary departure period granted prior to the end of removal proceedings cannot exceed 120 days. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>[7]  Without disputing this point, the dissent nevertheless joins <i>Azarte</i> in rejecting \"the proposition that Congress, while expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen, intended sub silentio to preclude their availability\" in cases of voluntary departure. 394 F.3d at 1289. As we explain, however, because our reading of IIRIRA will preclude (at least as a practical matter) motions to reopen only in the relatively small percentage of cases where aliens elect voluntary departure, we hardly think it \"implausible\" that Congress intended such a result. Indeed, we think it considerably less plausible that, despite IIRIRA's unmistakable purpose in ensuring that voluntary departure in fact results in the alien's leaving the United States in a timely manner, Congress intended to allow an alien to avoid doing so through the simple expedient of filing a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>[8]  We do not imply that aliens granted voluntary departure may not move to reopen. As a practical matter, however, aliens who receive voluntary departure should not expect their motions to reopen to be heard before they depart; they should expect to have to renew their attempts at immigration relief from abroad. We fully recognize that such relief will necessarily exclude reopening, because INS rules do not permit an alien subjected to removal proceedings to move to reopen them after leaving the country. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). But this rule does nothing to prevent the alien from pursuing the <i>ultimate</i> relief he or she seeks, <i>i.e.,</i> the right to remain in the United States legally, through other avenues after complying with a voluntary departure order. Indeed, that is one of the main attractions of voluntary departure from the alien's perspective: it comes without the waiting periods for seeking readmission attendant to an order of removal. <i>See </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265 &amp; n. 1. The unavailability of reopening from abroad, then, does not counsel in favor of tolling the departure period based on the filing of a motion to reopen; in fact, it reinforces our conclusion that doing so would disrupt the carefully calibrated bargain reflected in the voluntary departure provisions of IIRIRA.</p>\n<p>[9]  Amicus directs our attention to the Seventh Circuit's decision in <i>Orichitch v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 595 (7th Cir.2005), which held that, by granting a motion to reopen filed after the deadline set by a prior voluntary departure order had lapsed, the BIA \"dispos[ed] of the order that otherwise triggered the operative effect\" of § 1229c(d)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 598. But this holding is at odds with our holding in <i>DaCosta,</i> which we are bound to apply. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Malouf,</i> 466 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[10]  Echoing this sentiment, the dissent suggests that Chedad's case illustrates the importance of treating a motion to reopen as tolling the voluntary departure period, because \"with only one minor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is precluded from seeking any relief for ten years.\" In fact, the ten-year bar on relief arises from a mistake of a different character  Chedad's failure to comply with the voluntary departure order despite his undisputed appreciation of the consequences.</p>\n<p>[11]  In <i>Bocova v. Gonzales</i><i>,</i> we held that an alien who has received voluntary departure and who seeks judicial review of the BIA's resolution of his case must file a motion seeking a stay of voluntary departure before the departure period expires and must explicitly request a stay. 412 F.3d 257, 268-69 (1st Cir.2005). In that case we rejected the claim that we could reinstate a voluntary departure period that had expired while an appeal was pending with our court; our ability to stay the departure period is limited to cases in which a formal stay is requested before the period ends. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[12]  The statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), imposes a ninety-day deadline for filing motions to reopen. However, we have previously held that aliens who have received voluntary departure must file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period, which is statutorily limited to sixty days. See <i>Naeem v. Gonzales,</i> 469 F.3d 33, 37-38 (1st Cir.2006). Therefore, for aliens in Chedad's situation, the effective deadline for such motions is only sixty days.</p>\n<p>[13]  In order to prevail on a motion to reopen, an alien must satisfy two requirements: she must \"establish a `prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought' and . . . introduce `previously unavailable, material evidence.'\" <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n\n</div>",

The basis of the IJ's decision, and its affirmance, was that Chedad was ineligible for any such adjustment because he had overstayed a period of voluntary departure imposed as part of a prior BIA order closing the removal proceedings against him.<sup>[1]</sup> Before the voluntary departure period lapsed, however, Chedad had filed a motion with the BIA to reopen those proceedings due to previously unavailable evidence.</p>\n<p>The BIA granted the motion to reopen and remanded the matter to the IJ, who, as just noted, deemed Chedad ineligible for any further relief because he had disobeyed the voluntary departure order. Chedad argues that the BIA erroneously affirmed the IJ's ruling, either because the filing of his motion to reopen tolled the running of the voluntary departure period, or because the BIA's allowance of the motion stripped the voluntary departure order of any legal significance. We deny Chedad's petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") commenced removal proceedings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> against Chedad, a native of Morocco, in 1997, asserting that he had remained in the United States beyond the time permitted by the six-month nonimmigrant visa issued to him in 1994.<sup>[2]</sup> Chedad appeared before the IJ with counsel on May 28, 1998 and admitted overstaying his visa. He also requested a continuance of the proceedings on the ground that his wife, Joanne S. Franciscoa lawful permanent resident of the United Stateshad filed an application for citizenship, as well as a visa application on Chedad's behalf, known as an I-130 petition. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 204.1(a)(1) (2006).<sup>[3]</sup> If Francisco became a naturalized citizen of the United States, then Chedad would become immediately eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). The IJ therefore granted Chedad's motion for a continuance to allow the processing of his spouse's applications. Chedad later received a second continuance for that purpose. Meanwhile, Francisco's I-130 petition on Chedad's behalf was approved on October 21, 1998.</p>\n<p>Francisco's application for naturalization was still pending when removal proceedings against Chedad resumed on March 4, 1999. Though Chedad sought another continuance on that ground, the IJ refused, giving him the choice between the entry of a final order of removal and an opportunity to seek voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b). Chedad elected voluntary departure and received a continuance so that he could obtain a valid travel document for the purpose of leaving the country.</p>\n<p>When Chedad reappeared before the IJ on June 11, 1999, he again moved for a continuance to allow the processing of his wife's application for citizenship; the IJ again denied the motion. Instead, the IJ granted Chedad's motion for voluntary departure, requiring him to leave in sixty days. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b)(2). The IJ also warned Chedad of the consequences of disobeying the voluntary departure order, including the loss of the opportunity to pursue adjustment of immigration status through several different avenues for a period of ten years. <i>Id.</i> § 1229c(d)(1) (Supp.2006).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Chedad appealed the IJ's denial of his final motion for a continuance to the BIA. During the pendency of the appeal, on May 24, 2001, Francisco completed the naturalization process. On July 15, 2002, with the appeal still pending, Chedad filed a motion to remand with the BIA, citing his newly minted status as the spouse of a United States citizen, as well as the prior approval of his I-130 petition.</p>\n<p>The BIA dismissed Chedad's appeal and denied his motion to remand in an order issued on October 25, 2002. First, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> BIA ruled that the IJ had not abused her discretion in denying Chedad's final request for a continuance of the removal proceedings. Second, the BIA denied the motion to remand because it was unaccompanied by an application for adjustment of Chedad's status to that of an alien admitted for lawful permanent residence pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as required by BIA rules. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA granted Chedad thirty days from the date of its order to depart the country voluntarily, repeating the IJ's admonition about the consequences of any failure to do so.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 22, 2002, before the expiration of the voluntary departure period, Chedad filed a motion with the BIA to reopen the removal proceedings, again asserting that he had become eligible for adjustment of status under § 1255(a). This filing, made within ninety days of the BIA's decision as required by the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), and its implementing regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), included the application for adjustment of status and supporting materials that had been omitted from Chedad's earlier motion to remand. Noting that Chedad's motion to reopen \"demonstrate[d] that he is now prima facie eligible for adjustment of status,\" the BIA granted the motion in an order dated February 21, 2003, remanding the case to the IJ \"for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\" The BIA's order made no mention of the voluntary departure requirement previously imposed.</p>\n<p>When the proceedings found their way back to the IJ, however, the prior voluntary departure orderwhich Chedad had not satisfiedproved dispositive. The IJ determined that, because Chedad had failed to leave the United States as required, he had become ineligible for adjustment of status by operation of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). The IJ rejected Chedad's arguments that (1) the BIA had nullified its voluntary departure order by granting his motion to reopen, and (2) the filing of his motion to reopen, on November 22, 2002, had tolled the running of the voluntary departure period. In rejecting these arguments, the IJ relied on <i>Matter of Shaar,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753070\"><a href=\"/opinion/753070/98-cal-daily-op-serv-2764-98-daily-journal-dar-3803-arie-shaar/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1998), which held that the filing of a motion to reopen does not itself toll the voluntary departure period. The IJ therefore pretermitted Chedad's application for adjustment of status and ordered him removed from the United States.</p>\n<p>Chedad appealed, repeating the arguments he had made before the IJ. In particular, Chedad noted that <i>Shaar</i> had recently been overruled by the Ninth Circuit, which held that a timely motion to reopen could toll the voluntary departure period. <i>Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788917\"><a href=\"/opinion/788917/salvador-azarte-celia-castellon-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1289 (9th Cir.2005). The BIA, however, did not consider itself bound by <i>Azarte,</i> or similar decisions from other circuits, in a case arising within this court's appellate jurisdiction, and therefore rejected Chedad's tolling argument. As to Chedad's contention that the BIA had emasculated its prior voluntary departure order by granting the motion to reopen, the BIA explained that the latter decision \"was based solely on the fact that [Chedad] had established prima facie eligibility for relief and not based on [the BIA's] adjudication of the merits of his claim; also, [his] motion had not been opposed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> by [the INS] so no issues were raised to rebut [his] eligibility for relief.\" The BIA therefore upheld the IJ's ruling that Chedad was disqualified from seeking adjustment of status based on his disobedience of the voluntary departure order  a fact that had not been considered by the BIA in previously deciding to remand the case. Chedad then petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p>In his petition, Chedad argues that the BIA mistakenly upheld the IJ's reliance on the voluntary departure order as a basis for disqualifying him from further relief. We have jurisdiction over such a petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), which provides for \"review of a final order of removal,\" notwithstanding the jurisdiction-stripping provision of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). <i>DaCosta v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202228\"><a href=\"/opinion/202228/da-costa-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (exercising jurisdiction over BIA's ruling that violation of voluntary departure order rendered alien ineligible for adjustment of status because BIA did not reach merits of adjustment claim).</p>\n<p>Chedad contends that the BIA erred in refusing to treat (1) the filing of his motion to reopen as tolling the voluntary departure period, or (2) the allowance of the motion as depriving the voluntary departure order of its effect. In considering such arguments, \"[w]e afford de novo review to the BIA's legal conclusions, but cede some deference to its interpretations of the INA.\" <i>Da Silva v.

We now consider the question.</p>\n<p>The INA's voluntary departure provision plays an important part in the smooth functioning of the country's immigration procedures. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>DaCosta,</i> 449 F.3d at 50; <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 265 (1st Cir.2005). Subject to a number of qualifications, the Attorney General, at his discretion, may grant an alien's request to depart the United States voluntarily, either in lieu of commencing deportation proceedings or at the conclusion of those proceedings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1). From the alien's perspective, voluntary departure offers certain benefits, among them avoiding the penalties attendant to deportation, which include five- or ten-year bars on seeking readmission to the country. <i>Id.</i> §§ 1182(a)(9)(A)(i), (ii); <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265 &amp; n. 1. The government also benefits from voluntary departure by \"expediting departures and eliminating the costs associated with deportation.\" <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p>The INA imposes harsh penalties, however, on aliens who do not live up to their end of the voluntary departure bargain. An alien who \"fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time period specified\" receives monetary sanctions and becomes ineligible for a number of forms of immigration relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of ten years. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1). The IJ relied on this provision in pretermitting Chedad's application for adjustment of status based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> on his wife's naturalization. The INA also strictly limits the time allowable for the alien to leave the United States. In a case, like Chedad's, of voluntary departure ordered at the conclusion of deportation proceedings, the voluntary departure period cannot exceed 60 days.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 1229c(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The availability of motions to reopen removal proceedings is also restricted. <i>Id.</i> § 1229a(c)(7). Such motions must be based on material evidence that \"was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,\" including \"circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing\" which bear on the alien's eligibility for discretionary relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). An alien ordinarily may file only one such motion after the close of proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A). Furthermore, and of particular note here, a motion to reopen \"shall be filed within 90 days of the date of an administrative order of removal,\" subject to certain exceptions inapplicable to Chedad. <i>Id.</i> § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p>Those courts holding that a timely motion to reopen suspends the running of the voluntary departure period have perceived a conflict between § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), which allows ninety days to file a motion to reopen, and § 1229c(b)(2), which limits voluntary departure granted at the close of removal proceedings to just sixty days. <i>Ugokwe,</i> 453 F.3d at 1331; <i>Kanivets,</i> 424 F.3d at 335; <i>Sidikhouya,</i> 407 F.3d at 952; <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1286. While the motion to reopen had long been recognized in deportation proceedings as a matter of practice and, later, by administrative rulemaking, Congress did not put its imprimatur on the vehicle until the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), which \"provided the [aforementioned] statutory right to a motion to reopen.\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1283 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A) (1996)). IIRIRA also, however, \"drastically limited the time allowed for voluntary departure,\" <i>id.</i> at 1285, imposing, <i>inter alia,</i> the sixty-day limitation found at 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The joint effect of these provisions is practically to foreclose the availability of motions to reopen in most cases where the alien has received voluntary departure. As <i>Azarte</i> observes, even an alien who seeks reopening at the outset of the voluntary departure period has little hope of receiving a decision before the expiration of the departure deadline. 394 F.3d at 1287. If the alien defies the voluntary departure order by remaining in the United States pending action on the motion to reopen, the alien will be automatically cut off from a number of avenues of relief by operation of § 1229c(d)(1), including, in many cases, the very relief he or she sought reopening to pursue, <i>i.e.,</i> adjustment of status. On the other hand, if the alien complies with the order and leaves, the BIA will treat the motion as withdrawn, also precluding any relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). <i>Azarte</i> and its progeny reason that this \"`Catch-22' situation\" calls for tolling the voluntary departure period while the alien awaits the BIA's ruling on a timely motion to reopen. <i>Kanivets,</i> 424 F.3d at 334; <i>see also </i><i>Ugokwe,</i> 453 F.3d at 1331; <i>Sidikhouya,</i> 407 F.3d at 952.</p>\n<p>Though there is some force to this reasoning, we believe that it proceeds from an erroneous premise, namely, that motions to reopen are available <i>only</i> in proceedings where voluntary departure has been granted. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> Subsection 1229a(c)(7), however, permits \"one motion to reopen proceedings under this section,\" which include <i>all</i> \"proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1). Proceedings where voluntary departure has not been granted, naturally, spawn no \"conflict\" between the deadline for moving to reopen and the deadline for leaving the country voluntarily.</p>\n<p>In our view, holding aliens to the sixty-day limit on voluntary departure imposed by § 1229c(b)(2), despite the ninety-day limit on motions to reopen granted by § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), does not \"deprive[ ] the motion to reopen provision of meaning by eliminating the availability of such motions to those granted voluntary departure.\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1288. Rather, § 1229a(c)(7) has significance for aliens who have not sought the benefits of voluntary departure and can therefore pursue reopening without regard for the sixty-day deadline.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Dekoladenu,</i> 459 F.3d at 505-06. We cannot accept <i>Azarte</i>'s reasoning that Congress could not have intended to subject motions to reopen to the voluntary departure cutoff because that would \"preclude their availability in a significant number of cases, likely a substantial majority.\" 394 F.3d at 1289; <i>accord </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 393 (Smith, J., dissenting). <i>Azarte</i> did not cite any authority for the proposition that voluntary departure is entered in \"a substantial majority\" of removal proceedings. In fact, as the Fourth Circuit noted in <i>Dekoladenu,</i> 459 F.3d at 506 n. 5, available statistics indicate that voluntary departure was granted in just ten percent of removal cases in 2006, and has never been granted in more than eighteen percent of them in any of the last five years. Executive Office for Immigration Review, <i>FY 2005 Statistical Yearbook</i> Q1 (2006), <i>available at</i> http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/statspub/fy06 syb.pdf (last visited May 25, 2007).</p>\n<p>We read §§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 1229c(b)(2), then, as evincing a congressional intent to make the benefits of voluntary departure available only to aliens who agree to give up the fight and leave the country willingly.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> F.3d at 391. This may or may not be wise policy, but it is, we believe, the most plausible construction of the statute. As <i>Azarte</i> notes, the pre-IIRIRA version of the INA put no time limits on voluntary departure, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(e) (1995), resulting in departure periods that frequently measured one year or more. 394 F.3d at 1284. But IIRIRA reined in this practice by allowing only 120 or 60 days to depart voluntarily, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(2)(A), (b)(2), prohibiting courts from issuing any \"stay of an alien's removal pending consideration of any claim with respect to voluntary departure,\" <i>id.</i> § 1229c(f), and imposing strict and mandatory sanctions on aliens who fail to depart on time, <i>id.</i> § 1229c(d)(1). These provisions reflect a coherent effort to ensure that voluntary departure does, in fact, result in the alien's expeditious departure from the United States. Reading § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) as stopping the voluntary departure clock would contravene this purpose, allowing the filing of motions to reopen to delay voluntary departure dates. We cannot read the INA, as amended by IIRIRA, as achieving this self-defeating result. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p>The conclusion we reach has been criticized as overemphasizing IIRIRA's voluntary departure provisions at the expense of those \"expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen. . . .\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1289; <i>see also </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391 (Smith, J., dissenting). Chedad makes a similar complaint in arguing that the voluntary departure provision does not undermine his \"statutory right\" to file a motion to reopen. A statutory right, however, is only as broad as the statute in question has made it. As set forth above, we do not believe that IIRIRA made the right to seek reopening broad enough to supersede the sixty-day limitation on voluntary departure imposed by a different provision of the same act.</p>\n<p>Chedad also urges us to disregard the BIA's 1996 decision in <i>Shaar,</i> on which both the IJ and the BIA relied in rejecting his tolling argument. We have recognized that \"<i>Shaar</i>'s continuing vitality is questionable,\" <i>Naeem v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202513\"><a href=\"/opinion/202513/naeem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006), but here, that likely infirmity is beside the point. Our decision does not in any way turn on <i>Shaar</i> but on IIRIRA itself. <i>Cf. id.</i> The relevant provisions of the act simply do not contemplate suspending the voluntary departure period so that aliens who have chosen that form of relief also can pursue reopening. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 391. That this might lead aliens in removal proceedings to eschew voluntary departure so as not to jeopardize their opportunity to reopen, and thus deprive the government of the benefits of voluntary departure in a number of cases, cannot support judicially rewriting the statute. If Congress thinks it has gone too far, it can make the necessary revisions to the INA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Chedad also argues that, by granting his motion to reopen, the BIA vacated its prior decision affirming the IJ's voluntary departure order such that his failure to comply with it could not have triggered the penalties imposed by § 1229c(d)(1). The government responds that this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <i>DaCosta.</i> We agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>DaCosta,</i> as here, the BIA entered a voluntary departure order against the alien, but, <i>after the departure deadline had</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> <i>passed,</i> granted her motion to reopen the removal proceedings to consider her application for adjustment of status. 449 F.3d at 47. On remand, the INS argued that the alien was barred from seeking adjustment of status by operation of § 1229c(d)(1), because she had not complied with the prior voluntary departure order. <i>Id.</i> at 48. The IJ disagreed, ruling that \"the BIA's order reopening the case extinguished the legal consequences of [the alien's] failure to depart,\" but the BIA overturned that ruling on appeal. <i>Id.</i> We upheld the BIA's decision, reasoning that while \"the BIA's reopening of the case had the legal effect of vacating the [voluntary departure] order, it could not `retroactively nullify' DaCosta's previous violation of the terms of that order.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 50-51 (quoting <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201050\"><a href=\"/opinion/201050/khalil-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 180 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>The same is true here. The BIA's order of October 25, 2002, rejecting Chedad's appeal from the IJ's denial of his request for a continuance and denying his motion for remand, required Chedad to leave the United States within thirty days or to suffer the consequences enumerated in § 1229c(d)(1). Chedad did not do so. Instead, on November 22, 2002, he filed a motion to reopen, which the BIA ultimately granted on February 23, 2003. At that point, Chedad had overstayed his voluntary departure time by nearly three months. Section 1229c(d)(1) provides, unequivocally, that \"[i]f an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time specified, the alien shall . . . be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under . . . section[ ] . . . 1255 . . . of this title.\" Chedad was permitted to depart voluntarily, but failed to do so within the time specified. He is therefore barred from seeking adjustment of status for ten years. This result follows automatically from Chedad's violation of the voluntary departure order and cannot be altered by the BIA's later decision to reopen the proceedings. <i>DaCosta,</i> 449 F.3d at 51.</p>\n<p>As Chedad points out, he filed his motion to reopen <i>before</i> the expiration of the voluntary departure period, while DaCosta waited until <i>after</i> the departure deadline had passed to file hers. In rejecting DaCosta's argument that the BIA nullified its voluntary departure order by reopening her case, we did note that the \"voluntary departure period had already expired <i>before</i> she filed her motion to reopen with the BIA.\" 449 F.3d at 50. The outcome in <i>DaCosta,</i> however, turned on when the BIA granted the motion to reopen, not when the motion was filed, because the \"order reopening DaCosta's case could not expunge her previous violation of an order to depart.\" <i>Id.</i> at 51. An alien cannot avoid the consequences of § 1229c(d)(1) by filing a motion to reopen before the departure deadline, allowing the deadline to pass without leaving the country, and receiving a favorable decision on the motion to reopen somewhere down the road. Such a result would be tantamount to tolling the departure period on the basis of a motion to reopen, so long as the motion is ultimately granted. As we have explained, we do not believe that IIRIRA permits this outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> IV.</h2>\n<p>We recognize that the consequences of our decision are harsh: though Chedad's wife is an American citizen, he must leave the United States, and cannot seek adjustment of his own immigration status for another ten years. Moreover, this outcome presumably could have been avoided if Chedad's motion to remand the case on the basis of his wife's newly acquired citizenship, which he filed before the voluntary departure order became final, had been accompanied by his petition for adjustment of status as required by the regulations.<sup>[10]</sup> Nevertheless, neither the BIA's decision to deny the motion based on this technical misstep, nor the quality of Chedad's counsel's performance, are before us. Chedad's petition presents only questions of statutory interpretation which we have resolved against him. The petition for review is therefore <i>denied.</i></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), containing both the voluntary departure provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, and the motion to reopen provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7), seemingly unaware of the conflict it was creating for those aliens who are granted voluntary departure <i>and</i> wish to exercise their statutory right to file a motion to reopen. I respectfully disagree with the majority's resolution of that conflict.</p>\n<p>As the majority acknowledges, an alien who files a motion to reopen after being granted voluntary departure, but before she departs, will, absent extraordinary circumstances, be unable to obtain a decision from the BIA before she is required to depart. <i>See </i><i>Dekoladenu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795369\"><a href=\"/opinion/795369/christopher-mensah-dekoladenu-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 504 (4th Cir.2006) (\"As a practical matter, the BIA will rarely reach a decision on a motion to reopen before the end of the voluntary departure period.\"); <i>Banda-Ortiz v.

Y.B. T2 (stating that in fiscal year 2006, the BIA received 9,256 motions to reopen, about 23% of the total number of appeals filed with the BIA in that year). Once she departs, the alien's motion to reopen is withdrawn, and the limitation of one motion per alien prevents re-filing after departure. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). If, like Chedad, the alien does not depart by the expiration of the voluntary departure period, any relief will be denied due to her failure to depart, even if the motion to reopen is granted. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (stating that a failure to depart within the voluntary departure period will result in ineligibility \"for a period of 10 years . . . [for] any further relief,\" including, <i>inter alia,</i> cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, and change of nonimmigrant classification). Thus, it is effectively impossible for an alien who receives voluntary departure to obtain any relief through the motion to reopen process, despite the seemingly all-inclusive textual provision allowing such motions.</p>\n<p>Although the majority acknowledges this conflict, it finds that Congress intended <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> the voluntary departure provision to take precedence over the motion to reopen provision. Under the majority's interpretation, the statutory text allowing \"an alien,\" without further restriction or limitation, to file a motion to reopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), in effect applies only to those aliens who do not apply for and receive voluntary departure. I find unpersuasive the reason cited by the majority for its insistence that Congress intended this reading of the statute.</p>\n<p>The majority asserts that Congress intended the limitations on the voluntary departure period to be strictly enforced, even at the expense of an alien's right to file a motion to reopen, because of the importance of voluntary departure to the \"smooth functioning of the country's immigration procedures.\" Relatedly, the majority notes that IIRIRA made a number of changes to the previously existing voluntary departure rules, including limiting the length of the departure period and increasing the sanctions imposed on aliens who failed to comply with the terms of the departure agreement.</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority's conclusion that these changes reinforce the point that voluntary departure is a particularly important component of our immigration system. However, in trying to resolve the statutory conflict raised here, we cannot look to IIRIRA's modifications to the voluntary departure scheme without giving equal attention to IIRIRA's adoption of the motion to reopen provision. <i>See </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 392 (Smith, J., dissenting) (agreeing that \"voluntary departure represents a bargain struck between an alien and the government,\" but objecting \"to limiting our search for the terms of that bargain to statutory provisions conferring benefits on only one of the parties\"). In other words, the best way to discern Congress' intent when it passed IIRIRA is to examine the statute as a whole, rather than focusing on a single piece. In my view, the panel majority gives short shrift to IIRIRA's simultaneous addition of a right to file a motion to reopen, and, therefore, fails to account for that component of the statute in its assessment of Congress' intent.</p>\n<p>Instead of effectively writing an exception into the motion to reopen provision on such dubious grounds, I would follow the majority of circuit courts and hold that a motion to reopen, filed before the expiration of the voluntary departure period, automatically tolls the running of that period until the BIA resolves the motion. <i>See </i><i>Azarte v.

Although the majority's approach enforces a literal reading of the voluntary departure provision, it does so by effectively rewriting the plain text of the motion to reopen provision. In the face of such a conflict, tolling offers a way of harmonizing the conflicting statutes instead of choosing between them.</p>\n<blockquote>Tolling . . . accords with all of Congress's objectives in IIRIRA. It preserves the right of all removable aliens to file a single, good-faith motion to reopen after a final adjudicative order of the BIA. It also allows aliens to seek voluntary departure without fear of surrendering other avenues of procedural relief. Finally, it does no damage to Congress's desire to place reasonable limits on the voluntary departure period: The total time initially allotted for departure (and hence the time available to file to reopen) still cannot exceed sixty days, and limiting claimants to one motion to reopen, supported by evidence of newly-discovered facts, will temper the frequency and duration of tolling.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 394 (Smith, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>We have previously stated that tolling the voluntary departure period is not legally equivalent to extending it. <i>Bocova v.

Applying that principle, the tolling approach here does not contravene the text of the voluntary departure provision. As Judge Smith, dissenting from the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> observed, reliance on the doctrine of tolling does not \"undermine\" the statutory text simply because the effect may be to lengthen the number of calendar days before the alien is required to depart. 445 F.3d at 395 (Smith, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>We invoke the tolling remedy in our system of justice where the strict application <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> of the time allotted for a particular action or filing leads to unfair or unjust results. <i>See </i><i>Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank of N.Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197626\"><a href=\"/opinion/197626/salois-v-the-dime/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1997) (observing that \"under federal law, equitable tolling is applied to statutes of limitations `to prevent unjust results or to maintain the integrity of a statute'\" (quoting <i>King v.

I am not suggesting that the remedy of equitable tolling, in the classic sense, applies here. That remedy applies when the \"extraordinary circumstances\" of a particular case require relief from the time limits of a statute. Here, we are trying to avoid unfairness on a much larger scale from the unforeseen conflict of two statutory provisions. But that difference only strengthens the argument for the application of a tolling remedy derived from equitable principles that are designed to preserve the integrity of a statutory deadline while avoiding the harshness that can result from its unyielding application.</p>\n<p>The majority asserts that the tolling approach, articulated most fully by the Ninth Circuit in <i>Azarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788917\"><a href=\"/opinion/788917/salvador-azarte-celia-castellon-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, is premised on the notion that \"motions to reopen are available <i>only</i> in proceedings where voluntary departure has been granted.\" I find nothing in the text or reasoning of the other circuits' opinions suggesting reliance on such a dubious premise. The statute says that <i>all</i> aliens who have been unsuccessful in removal proceedings may file a single motion to reopen, without any reference to those who receive voluntary departure and those who do not. I agree with the majority that there is no conflict between this provision and the voluntary departure provision as applied to those aliens who do not receive voluntary departure. In my view, however, this observation is simply a restatement of the problem and not a resolution of it.</p>\n<p>The majority also responds to the tolling approach by saying that Chedad has no \"statutory right\" to file a motion to reopen because the statute does not provide such a right for those who receive voluntary departure. As the majority puts it: a \"statutory right [ ] is only as broad as the statute in question has made it.\" However, under the plain text of the statute, Chedad, like every other alien who has been ordered removed, has a right to file a single motion to reopen, so long as he does so within sixty days of the final order of removal.<sup>[12]</sup> 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A). The statement that Chedad has no \"right\" to file a motion to reopen derives not from the text of the statute, but from the majority's understanding of the legislative intent underlying that statute. Like the Ninth Circuit, I think \"the proposition that Congress, while expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen, intended sub silentio to preclude their availability in a significant number of cases,\" <i>Azarte,</i> 394 F.3d at 1289, is implausible.</p>\n<p>Although this case has all the indicia of a classic debate over statutory interpretation, it has substantial real world implications. In fiscal year 2006, immigration courts granted voluntary departure to over 22,000 aliens. 2006 EOIR Stat. Y.B. Q1. There is no dispute that tolling is unavailable for aliens who fail to file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure deadline. <i>See supra</i> note 3. Importantly, those aliens who have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> received voluntary departure already have been required to show good moral character for five years and the absence of any convictions for aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Banda-Ortiz,</i> 445 F.3d at 393 (Smith, J., dissenting) (\"The result is particularly harsh when one considers that it operates to disadvantage those aliens whose good behavior has entitled them to the solicitude of the law of voluntary departure.\"). Even if only a small percentage of those aliens granted voluntary departure would file a timely motion to reopen, the majority's decision unwisely precludes any possibility of relief for aliens who might be entitled to such relief despite the exacting standards applicable to motions to reopen.</p>\n<p>The specific facts of this case illustrate that harsh reality. Chedad has been in the United States for thirteen years, and has been in immigration proceedings for almost ten years, after he overstayed his six-month non-immigrant visa. At the time the proceedings began, he was married to a lawful permanent resident, who had a pending application for naturalized citizenship, and he has consistently asked the IJ and the BIA for a continuance so that his wife's application could be processed and, accordingly, his status could be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). Although the IJ initially granted Chedad a continuance, the IJ refused to allow any further delays after a year. Chedad requested and received voluntary departure, and asked again for a continuance. The IJ denied his request and gave him sixty days to leave the country. Chedad promptly filed an appeal with the BIA. While his appeal was pending, his wife's citizenship was approved. With his appeal still before the BIA, Chedad filed a timely motion to remand, asking that his case be sent back to the IJ, before the BIA had decided the appeal, so that he could adjust his status in light of his wife's American citizenship.</p>\n<p>Chedad, however, made his one and only procedural error at that time. His motion to remand was not accompanied by a petition for adjustment of status, as the regulations required. On the basis of this technical oversight, the BIA denied the motion to remand and reinstated the IJ's voluntary departure order. Therefore, Chedad could only present evidence of his wife's change in citizenship status through a motion to reopen filed with the BIA. He filed that motion in a timely manner. The BIA, in fact, granted the motion to reopen, finding that he had made a prima facie showing of his eligibility for adjustment of status.<sup>[13]</sup> The BIA sent his case back to the IJ, who then denied all relief because Chedad had remained in the country after the expiration of the voluntary departure period. If the timely filing of Chedad's motion to reopen tolled the running of the sixty-day voluntary departure period, he could have presented his case for relief to the IJ.</p>\n<p>Chedad has shown consistent cooperation and compliance with a maze of immigration laws and regulations. He has demonstrated his good moral character for a period of five years and has not been convicted of any aggravated felonies or crimes of moral turpitude. He is married to an American citizen and now, after nearly a decade of navigating our legal system, with only one minor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> precluded from seeking any relief for ten years. That stark outcome may be repeated many times over by the failure to harmonize the conflicting statutory provisions at issue in this case in a sensible and fair manner.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"the INA\") provides a mechanism for an alien, subject to the discretion of the Attorney General and other limitations, \"to depart the United States voluntarily at his own expense\" in lieu of continued participation in removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a)(1), (b)(1) (2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  In March 2003, the INS was abolished and its functions were transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. <i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, §§ 451(b) <i>and</i> 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135, 2195 <i>and</i> 2205, <i>codified at</i> 6 U.S.C. §§ 271(b) <i>and</i> 291(a) (Supp.2006). For consistency, we will refer to the responsible agency as \"the INS\" throughout our opinion.</p>\n<p>[3]  Since Chedad's proceedings before the BIA, many of its regulations have been recodified without changing their substance. For purposes of clarity, we will cite to the applicable regulations as currently codified.</p>\n<p>[4]  In 2006, Congress amended 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) through the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-162 § 812, 119 Stat. 2960, 3057 (2006). This amendment, in relevant part, renumbered the penalty provision of § 1229c(d) as § 1229c(d)(1). For purposes of clarity, we will cite to the current subsection number throughout our opinion.</p>\n<p>[5]  The execution of the IJ's sixty-day voluntary departure order had been stayed pending Chedad's appeal. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.6(a). Because thirty days had already expired by the time Chedad filed the appeal, thirty days of voluntary departure time remained at the time of the BIA's decision. <i>See id.</i> § 1240.26(f).</p>\n<p>[6]  By contrast, a voluntary departure period granted prior to the end of removal proceedings cannot exceed 120 days. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>[7]  Without disputing this point, the dissent nevertheless joins <i>Azarte</i> in rejecting \"the proposition that Congress, while expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen, intended sub silentio to preclude their availability\" in cases of voluntary departure. 394 F.3d at 1289. As we explain, however, because our reading of IIRIRA will preclude (at least as a practical matter) motions to reopen only in the relatively small percentage of cases where aliens elect voluntary departure, we hardly think it \"implausible\" that Congress intended such a result. Indeed, we think it considerably less plausible that, despite IIRIRA's unmistakable purpose in ensuring that voluntary departure in fact results in the alien's leaving the United States in a timely manner, Congress intended to allow an alien to avoid doing so through the simple expedient of filing a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p>[8]  We do not imply that aliens granted voluntary departure may not move to reopen. As a practical matter, however, aliens who receive voluntary departure should not expect their motions to reopen to be heard before they depart; they should expect to have to renew their attempts at immigration relief from abroad. We fully recognize that such relief will necessarily exclude reopening, because INS rules do not permit an alien subjected to removal proceedings to move to reopen them after leaving the country. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). But this rule does nothing to prevent the alien from pursuing the <i>ultimate</i> relief he or she seeks, <i>i.e.,</i> the right to remain in the United States legally, through other avenues after complying with a voluntary departure order. Indeed, that is one of the main attractions of voluntary departure from the alien's perspective: it comes without the waiting periods for seeking readmission attendant to an order of removal. <i>See </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 265 &amp; n. 1. The unavailability of reopening from abroad, then, does not counsel in favor of tolling the departure period based on the filing of a motion to reopen; in fact, it reinforces our conclusion that doing so would disrupt the carefully calibrated bargain reflected in the voluntary departure provisions of IIRIRA.</p>\n<p>[9]  Amicus directs our attention to the Seventh Circuit's decision in <i>Orichitch v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791710\"><a href=\"/opinion/791710/viktoria-b-orichitch-v-alberto-r-gonzales-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2005), which held that, by granting a motion to reopen filed after the deadline set by a prior voluntary departure order had lapsed, the BIA \"dispos[ed] of the order that otherwise triggered the operative effect\" of § 1229c(d)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 598. But this holding is at odds with our holding in <i>DaCosta,</i> which we are bound to apply. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Malouf,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[10]  Echoing this sentiment, the dissent suggests that Chedad's case illustrates the importance of treating a motion to reopen as tolling the voluntary departure period, because \"with only one minor mistake, he will be required to leave the country and is precluded from seeking any relief for ten years.\" In fact, the ten-year bar on relief arises from a mistake of a different character  Chedad's failure to comply with the voluntary departure order despite his undisputed appreciation of the consequences.</p>\n<p>[11]  In <i>Bocova v. Gonzales</i><i>,</i> we held that an alien who has received voluntary departure and who seeks judicial review of the BIA's resolution of his case must file a motion seeking a stay of voluntary departure before the departure period expires and must explicitly request a stay. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 268-69 (1st Cir.2005). In that case we rejected the claim that we could reinstate a voluntary departure period that had expired while an appeal was pending with our court; our ability to stay the departure period is limited to cases in which a formal stay is requested before the period ends. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[12]  The statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), imposes a ninety-day deadline for filing motions to reopen. However, we have previously held that aliens who have received voluntary departure must file their motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period, which is statutorily limited to sixty days. See <i>Naeem v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202513\"><a href=\"/opinion/202513/naeem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 37-38 (1st Cir.2006). Therefore, for aliens in Chedad's situation, the effective deadline for such motions is only sixty days.</p>\n<p>[13]  In order to prevail on a motion to reopen, an alien must satisfy two requirements: she must \"establish a `prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought' and . . . introduce `previously unavailable, material evidence.'\" <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112016\"><a href=\"/opinion/112016/ins-v-abudu/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 104, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112016\"><a href=\"/opinion/112016/ins-v-abudu/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
