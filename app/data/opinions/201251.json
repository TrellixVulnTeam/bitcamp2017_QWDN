Paul Elie Delva, a citizen of Haiti and\n\n  a former member of the Haitian National Police, seeks judicial\n\n  review of a Board of Immigration Appeals' order finding him\n\n  ineligible for asylum.1       Delva argues that the Board erred in\n\n  concluding that his alleged persecution was motivated solely by\n\n  his activities as a police officer rather than, at least in\n\n  part, by his political opinion.\n\n           This court's review of the Board's decision is narrowly\n\ncircumscribed.    To the extent that Delva challenges the Board's\n\nfactual findings, those findings \"can be reversed only if the\n\nevidence   [he]   presented    .   .    .    was   such   that     a    reasonable\n\nfactfinder would have to conclude [to the contrary].\"                      INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).                 In other words, to\n\nreverse, we \"must find that the evidence not only supports that\n\nconclusion, but compels it.\"           Id. at 481 n.1; see also 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B). To the extent that Delva challenges the Board's\n\napplication of the relevant legal standards to his factual\n\ncircumstances,    that   application         is    entitled   to       substantial\n\ndeference as well.       INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448\n\n(1987); Alverez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 3-4, 5 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           Under those standards, the Board's decision in this\n\ncase easily survives review.           To be eligible for asylum, Delva\n\n\n     1\n      Before the Board, Delva also sought withholding of removal\nand relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, but\nhe does not contest the denial of that relief on appeal.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhad to prove that he \"is unable or unwilling to return to . . .\n\n[his] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"           8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b);\n\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992). The evidence\n\nin the record does not compel the conclusion that Delva either\n\nwas persecuted in the past or has a genuine and well-founded fear\n\nof being persecuted in the future on account of any of the\n\nenumerated grounds.\n\nPast Persecution\n\n           In support of his claim of past persecution, Delva\n\nclaims   that   politically    connected   gangsters,   whom    he    was\n\ninvestigating   and   trying   to    arrest,   threatened   him;     twice\n\nattacked his sister's home, destroying her personal property and\n\nscaring her and his cousin; and once shot at his car.                 Even\n\nassuming that those events occurred and that they rose to the\n\nlevel of \"persecution,\" the Board concluded that any persecution\n\nsuffered by Delva was solely on account of his activities as a\n\npolice officer, not on account of his actual or imputed political\n\nopinion, the only protected ground relied upon by Delva.2\n\n\n     2\n      In his application for asylum, Delva claimed persecution on\naccount of both his political opinion and his membership in a\nparticular social group (presumably, the Haitian National Police).\nBefore the Board, however, he claimed persecution only on the basis\nof his political opinion. To the extent that he now claims to fear\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          In reaching that conclusion, the Board did not find\n\nDelva to be per se ineligible for asylum based solely on his\n\nstatus as a policeman.        Cf. Velarde v. INS, 140 F.3d 1305, 1312\n\n(9th Cir. 1998) (faulting Board for finding applicant ineligible\n\nfor asylum based solely on her status as a security guard without\n\nconsidering strong evidence that she was persecuted on political\n\ngrounds). Rather, the Board took into account Delva's membership\n\nin the KID Party and his investigation of politically connected\n\nindividuals but found no evidence of a connection between his\n\nactual or imputed political opinions and the threats and attacks\n\nthat he reported.    That analysis is legally correct.             Just as it\n\nis wrong to infer the absence of a political motive based solely\n\non the victim's status as a police officer, id., it would be\n\nequally wrong to infer the presence of a political motive based\n\nsolely on that status.        See Samoya Cabrera v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d\n\n10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that \"[p]articipation in a civil\n\ndefense patrol does not by itself compel a conclusion that an\n\nindividual is subject to politically-inspired persecution\").\n\n          The absence of a political motive is borne out by the\n\nrecord.   There     is   no   evidence    that   Delva   was   a   political\n\nactivist. Cf. Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n\npersecution on account of his membership in the social group of\nformer police officers, that claim is forfeited, both because he\ndid not raise it before the Board, Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 761, and\nbecause he did not adequately brief it on appeal, United States v.\nBongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f(finding political motive established where applicant was a\n\npolitical     activist     who    attended    party   meetings,     helped   to\n\ncampaign    and    raise   money,    and     worked   with    a   neighborhood\n\ncommittee).       Nor is there any evidence that the Lavalas Family\n\nParty, whose members allegedly threatened Delva, was directly\n\nopposed to the KID Party, to which Delva belonged.                    Cf. id.\n\n(applicant, who was active in pro-Aristide party, was shot by\n\nmember of anti-Aristide party). To the contrary, even though the\n\ntwo parties may \"not have the same political visions,\" as Delva\n\ntestified, they were both pro-Aristide.                Finally, there is no\n\nevidence that those who threatened Delva and invaded his sister's\n\nhome knew or cared about Delva's membership in the KID.\n\n            On the other hand, the record is replete with evidence\n\nthat Delva was targeted because of his police activities.                  Delva\n\nhimself acknowledged that \"there was a direct connection between\n\n[his]   job    and    [his]      persecution.\"        That    connection     was\n\ncorroborated by Delva's sole witness (a Boston police officer who\n\nhad served as a United Nations monitor and trainer of Delva's\n\nunit of the Haitian National Police), who testified that police\n\nofficers were targeted by their former detainees.                   The State\n\nDepartment also reported attacks on members of the Haitian\n\nNational    Police.        Furthermore,      those    who    threatened    Delva\n\nrepeatedly referred to him as a \"policeman.\"\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Absent a finding of past persecution on a protected\n\nground, the burden is on the petitioner to show that he has a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on that ground. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1).    The Board's conclusion that Delva had not met\n\nthat burden is amply supported by the evidence.\n\n           \"The standard for proving a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution   has   both    objective   and    subjective       components.\"\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 430-31.            \"[T]o establish asylum\n\neligibility, an applicant must not only harbor a genuine fear of\n\nfuture   persecution,   but    also   must    establish    an   objectively\n\nreasonable basis for that fear.\"        Laurent, 359 F.3d at 65.\n\n           As to the subjective component, both the immigration\n\njudge and the Board doubted the sincerity of Delva's fear of\n\nfuture persecution, based on his repeated returns to Haiti after\n\ntrips to Canada and the Dominican Republic. That inference, which\n\nis supported by undisputed facts and not challenged on appeal, is\n\nentitled to judicial deference.         See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           To establish the objective component of a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution, Delva had to show \"by credible, direct, and\n\nspecific   evidence,\"      Ravindran,   976    F.3d   at   758    (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted), that \"a reasonable person\n\nin [his] circumstances would fear persecution,\" Aguilar-Solis,\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f168 F.3d at 572.         Delva presented no such evidence at the\n\nadministrative level.         And in his appellate brief, he relies\n\nsolely on the presumption of future persecution that would arise\n\nif he had established past persecution, which, as discussed\n\nabove, he did not do.         Indeed, at the end of his brief, Delva\n\nconcedes   that    \"it   is    impossible      to   determine   what   effect\n\n[Delva's] past actions [as a police officer] will have on the\n\nfuture of [Delva] if ordered removed.\" Delva therefore failed to\n\nmeet his burden of showing \"by credible, direct, and specific\n\nevidence,\" Ravindran, 976 F.3d at 758 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted), that \"a reasonable person in [his]\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution.\"              Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n\nat 572.\n\n           To clinch matters, other record evidence supports the\n\nopposite conclusion–-that Delva's fear of future persecution was\n\nnot objectively reasonable.         The State Department's Profile of\n\nAsylum Claims and Country Conditions, introduced by the INS,\n\nstates that \"the likelihood of an erstwhile Aristide activist\n\nencountering political harassment upon returning to Haiti appears\n\nto be extremely slight.\"         While the State Department reported\n\nsome politically motivated killings, they were of political\n\ncandidates   and   party      leaders,   not    rank-and-file    members   of\n\nopposing parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Accordingly, the petition for review is denied, and the\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals is summarily affirmed.\n\nSee Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -8-\n\f",

To the contrary, even though the\n\ntwo parties may \"not have the same political visions,\" as Delva\n\ntestified, they were both pro-Aristide.                Finally, there is no\n\nevidence that those who threatened Delva and invaded his sister's\n\nhome knew or cared about Delva's membership in the KID.\n\n            On the other hand, the record is replete with evidence\n\nthat Delva was targeted because of his police activities.                  Delva\n\nhimself acknowledged that \"there was a direct connection between\n\n[his]   job    and    [his]      persecution.\"        That    connection     was\n\ncorroborated by Delva's sole witness (a Boston police officer who\n\nhad served as a United Nations monitor and trainer of Delva's\n\nunit of the Haitian National Police), who testified that police\n\nofficers were targeted by their former detainees.                   The State\n\nDepartment also reported attacks on members of the Haitian\n\nNational    Police.        Furthermore,      those    who    threatened    Delva\n\nrepeatedly referred to him as a \"policeman.\"\n\nWell-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Absent a finding of past persecution on a protected\n\nground, the burden is on the petitioner to show that he has a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on that ground. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1).    The Board's conclusion that Delva had not met\n\nthat burden is amply supported by the evidence.\n\n           \"The standard for proving a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution   has   both    objective   and    subjective       components.\"\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 430-31.            \"[T]o establish asylum\n\neligibility, an applicant must not only harbor a genuine fear of\n\nfuture   persecution,   but    also   must    establish    an   objectively\n\nreasonable basis for that fear.\"        Laurent, 359 F.3d at 65.\n\n           As to the subjective component, both the immigration\n\njudge and the Board doubted the sincerity of Delva's fear of\n\nfuture persecution, based on his repeated returns to Haiti after\n\ntrips to Canada and the Dominican Republic. That inference, which\n\nis supported by undisputed facts and not challenged on appeal, is\n\nentitled to judicial deference.         See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           To establish the objective component of a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution, Delva had to show \"by credible, direct, and\n\nspecific   evidence,\"      Ravindran,   976    F.3d   at   758    (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted), that \"a reasonable person\n\nin [his] circumstances would fear persecution,\" Aguilar-Solis,\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f168 F.3d at 572.         Delva presented no such evidence at the\n\nadministrative level.         And in his appellate brief, he relies\n\nsolely on the presumption of future persecution that would arise\n\nif he had established past persecution, which, as discussed\n\nabove, he did not do.         Indeed, at the end of his brief, Delva\n\nconcedes   that    \"it   is    impossible      to   determine   what   effect\n\n[Delva's] past actions [as a police officer] will have on the\n\nfuture of [Delva] if ordered removed.\" Delva therefore failed to\n\nmeet his burden of showing \"by credible, direct, and specific\n\nevidence,\" Ravindran, 976 F.3d at 758 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted), that \"a reasonable person in [his]\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution.\"              Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n\nat 572.\n\n           To clinch matters, other record evidence supports the\n\nopposite conclusion–-that Delva's fear of future persecution was\n\nnot objectively reasonable.         The State Department's Profile of\n\nAsylum Claims and Country Conditions, introduced by the INS,\n\nstates that \"the likelihood of an erstwhile Aristide activist\n\nencountering political harassment upon returning to Haiti appears\n\nto be extremely slight.\"         While the State Department reported\n\nsome politically motivated killings, they were of political\n\ncandidates   and   party      leaders,   not    rank-and-file    members   of\n\nopposing parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Accordingly, the petition for review is denied, and the\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals is summarily affirmed.\n\nSee Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -8-\n\f</pre>",
