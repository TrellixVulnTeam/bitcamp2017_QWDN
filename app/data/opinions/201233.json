Michael     Morgan\n\npled    guilty   to    conspiracy       to distribute in excess of                     100\n\nkilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 and\n\n21     U.S.C.    §    841(a)(1),       while         reserving       the       right    to\n\nchallenge at his sentencing hearing the quantity of drugs\n\nfor which he was responsible.                  He now appeals the 40-month\n\nsentence    imposed      on    three     principal         grounds.        Finding      no\n\nmerit in this triumvirate, we affirm.\n\n            In November 2001, the government charged Morgan, a\n\nJamaican    musician     who     became    a        United    States    citizen        the\n\nprevious    month,     and     Beverly     Pryme,         also   Jamaican       and    the\n\nmother     of    three    of     his     children,           with    conspiracy         to\n\ndistribute over 100 kg. of marijuana from January 1990 until\n\nOctober 22, 2001.             The indictment was the happenstance of\n\nthe 1999 arrest of Daniel Merritt for a domestic assault in\n\nMerrimack,       New     Hampshire;            he        confessed     to       selling\n\napproximately 262 pounds of marijuana supplied by Morgan, a\n\nformer    college      friend,     and    Pryme.           Facing     drug      and    tax\n\nevasion    charges,      Merritt       agreed       to    cooperate,       a    decision\n\nwhich netted him a 27-month sentence.\n\n            To that end, in July 2001, Merritt bridged the two-\n\nyear hiatus since his arrest and twice telephoned Morgan,\n\nrecording the conversations.               Later that month, Merritt met\n\nPryme for the first of two controlled buys, neither of which\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fPryme disclosed to Morgan who was traveling abroad some of\n\nthat    time.        Pryme    was    arrested during a            third       controlled\n\nbuy, and the two were subsequently indicted.\n\n            On December 4, 2001, Morgan proffered a statement\n\nto the government.             He described his early college dealings\n\nwith Merritt through 1998; his surprise to hear from Merritt\n\nagain    in      2001;       and     his        disagreement      with        Pryme    for\n\ncontinuing       to    supply       larger      quantities      of   marijuana        from\n\nsuppliers       in    New    York    with       whom    Pryme was “intimate” but\n\ncalled “murderers.”                Morgan stated his primary sources were\n\n“Big Dred,” “Mark,” and his brother, “Tender.”\n\n            On       July    10,    2002,       the    government    sent      Morgan    a\n\nproposed      plea     agreement       in       which    it   agreed     to    drop    two\n\ncounts in exchange for Morgan’s agreeing to plead guilty to\n\na conspiracy involving over 100 kg. of marijuana.                                 Morgan\n\ndid not execute the agreement and attempted an amendment to\n\nmake the agreement “subject to a disclaimer” of the “weight\n\nand scope.”           With the plea agreement in limbo, the parties\n\nsubmitted briefs to the district court addressing whether\n\nMorgan    could       plead    guilty to          the   offense but reserve            for\n\nsentencing           the     weight        of     drugs       attributed        to     his\n\ninvolvement.\n\n            On November 5, 2002, the government refused to meet\n\nagain with Morgan for safety valve consideration, explaining\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fto his counsel the decision was “[i]n light of your client’s\n\ncontinued insistence that he is not responsible for 100 or\n\nmore kilograms of marijuana.”          On November 8, 2002, however,\n\nthe district court ruled on Morgan’s motion, holding that\n\nunder United     States v.   O’Campo,     973 F.2d 1015, 1026       (1st\n\nCir. 1992), “the base offense level of a co-conspirator at\n\nsentencing    should   reflect   only    the   quantity    of   drugs   he\n\nreasonably foresees [] is the object of the conspiracy to\n\ndistribute after he joins the conspiracy.”                Then applying\n\nDerman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nwhich addressed the duties of the judge and jury in a drug\n\nconspiracy case, post-Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), the court concluded “defendant may enter a plea of\n\nguilty to the conspiracy charged in count one and reserve\n\nthe right to contest at sentencing the quantity of drugs for\n\nwhich he is to be held responsible under the law” contingent\n\nupon his agreeing to additional conditions. 1\n\n\n    1\n        The conditions were:\n            (1) he must admit that the conspiracy as\n            a   whole  involved  in   excess  of    100\n            kilograms of marijuana, while reserving\n            the right to contest at sentencing the\n            quantity of marijuana for which he can be\n            held legally accountable;\n            (2) he must acknowledge his understanding\n            that   the   maximum  sentence   for    the\n            conspiracy charged is forty years and\n            that the maximum sentence he potentially\n            could be subject to is forty years;\n                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                 -4-\n\f              At the sentencing hearing, the government presented\n\nthree       witnesses   to     prove     the    quantity       of   marijuana\n\nattributable to Morgan under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 for purposes\n\nof the court’s setting the base level of the offense.                      The\n\ncourt also heard arguments on whether Morgan was entitled to\n\nthe       two-level   reduction    under       U.S.S.G.    §    5C1.2,   which\n\nincorporates the safety valve statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f),\n\nand a two-level departure for substantial assistance under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\n\n              Daniel Merritt, questioned by both counsel and the\n\ncourt,      testified   that    Morgan     sold   him     approximately    130\n\n\n\n      1\n          (...continued)\n              (3) he must acknowledge his understanding\n              that the court will make a determination\n              of the quantity of marijuana for which he\n              may be held legally accountable, and that\n              his base offense level under the . . .\n              Guidelines (“U.S.S.G.”) will be determined\n              by the quantity for which he is found to\n              be legally responsible; and\n              (4) he must acknowledge his understanding\n              that if the court determines the drug\n              quantity   for   which   the  defendant   is\n              legally responsible is 100 kilograms or\n              more, he could be subject to a five year\n              mandatory minimum sentence unless U.S.S.G.\n              § 5K1.1 (18 U.S.C. § 3553(e)) and/or\n              U.S.S.G.   §   5C1.2(a)(5)   (18   U.S.C.  §\n              3553(f)) are found by the court to be\n              applicable, in which case the court in\n              the exercise of its discretion could\n              impose a sentence below the mandatory\n              minium   if   the   court   deemed   such  a\n              sentence to be appropriate under the\n              guidelines.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fpounds of marijuana, most of which he resold in small five\n\nto twenty pound quantities.               He added, however, he sold to\n\nDaniel     Scharn    of   Billerica,      Massachusetts,        the      bulk    of    at\n\nleast      100    pounds.       Beverly     Pryme,     who    also       identified\n\nanother source for the marijuana she sold Merritt, told the\n\ncourt      Morgan    provided    75    to   80    pounds      of    marijuana          to\n\nMerritt.          Finally,   Patrol    Sergeant        Paul   Poirier           of    the\n\nMerrimack Police Department described his investigation and\n\nsurveillance that led to Pryme’s arrest and told the court\n\nhe   believed       Pryme    “downplayed”        the   amount       of    marijuana\n\nattributable to Morgan.           Based on the evidence and arguments\n\nof counsel, the court then stated:\n\n             As we all know from experience, evidence\n             concerning quantities is often comprised\n             of estimates, estimates as to quantities,\n             estimates as to the number of times\n             deliveries are made, and estimates as to\n             over what period of time those deliveries\n             were made. Evidence concerning quantities\n             depends also on memories, some of which\n             are good and some of which are not so\n             good. Therefore extrapolation is required\n             when such evidence is received, and in my\n             opinion the Court must be cautious when\n             extrapolating.\n\nApplying     the    standards    of   U.S.S.G.     §    1B1.3      to    all    of    the\n\nevidence “over the last few hours,” the court found between\n\n80   and    100     kilograms    of   marijuana        were   attributable             to\n\nMorgan, resulting in a total offense level of 24.\n\n             Without elaboration, the court declined to give the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftwo-level reduction under the fifth element of U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2.         It   also   rejected     Morgan’s     motion      under    U.S.S.G.    §\n\n5K1.1. Morgan based his motion upon a presumption that the\n\nplea         agreement     was    revitalized      when   the    court    attributed\n\nless         than   100    kilograms    of    marijuana     to   him. 2    Observing\n\nthat Morgan’s truthfulness remained an issue throughout the\n\nhearing and that the government’s position was not taken in\n\nbad faith, the court concluded it would not “in effect force\n\na    5K1      motion      on   the   government.”         Morgan      challenges    both\n\nconclusions in this appeal as well as the court’s refusal to\n\ndepart downward under U.S.S.G. § 5H1.6 in consideration of\n\nhis extraordinary family ties and responsibilities.\n\n    I.       Drug Quantity for Sentencing and Safety Valve Purposes\n\n                Morgan characterizes the court’s finding between 80\n\nto 100 kilograms attributable to his role in the conspiracy\n\nas       “judicial confirmation” that he did not participate in\n\nthe      “full      131.59       kilo   conspiracy”       and    as    proof   of    his\n\ntruthfulness for purposes of applying the safety valve and\n\nsubstantial assistance reductions to his sentence.                             We deal\n\nwith each contention in turn.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n     The    court  adopted   the   presentence   report’s\nrecommendation for a 3-level decrease in Morgan’s offense\nlevel based on his acceptance of responsibility under\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.\n\n                                             -7-\n\f                                  A.    Drug Quantity\n\n              As oft-written, “[w]e review the sentencing court’s\n\nfactual findings, which must be supported by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, for clear error.”                          United States v. Lopez,\n\n299 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir. 2002), citing United States v.\n\nDamon,        127    F.3d        139,    141      (1st        Cir.    1997).         That\n\n“preponderance,” United States v. Marks, 365 F.3d 101, 105\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), simply requires the government to present\n\nenough information, free from the strictures of the rules of\n\nevidence       which        do    not    apply         to    sentencing      hearings,\n\n“provided       that      the    information         has     sufficient    indicia     of\n\nreliability to support its probable accuracy,” Lopez, 299\n\nF.3d at 89; Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(3), to make it more likely\n\nthan not that the fact to be proved is true.                              We then will\n\n“treat[] with deference” the district court’s determination\n\nwhich    we    will       reverse      “only    if,     after    reviewing     all    the\n\nevidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction\n\nthat a mistake has been committed.”                          Lopez, 299 F.3d at 87\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n              Despite        Morgan’s          persistently          conflating      the\n\ninquiries       on       drug     weight       and     the     vindication     of     his\n\ntruthfulness         in     testifying       about      his     involvement     in    the\n\nconspiracy,         we    must    untangle       the    two     issues.     While     the\n\ntestimony       at    the       sentencing      hearing       established      at    most\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fapproximately     135     pounds    to    be     attributed     to   Morgan’s\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy, the presentence report more\n\nfully   documented      additional       quantities     from    recipients,\n\nparticularly     Scharn    and     Stanbury,      whom,   the    government\n\nconceded,   it   perhaps    “should       have   been   more   diligent”   in\n\ncalling to testify “to get over 100 kilos.” 3                  Nevertheless,\n\nthe district court also had benefit of the background facts\n\nfrom the presentence report, which we, too, utilize in our\n\nreview for clear error.          See id. at 86, citing United States\n\nv. Brady, 168 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1999).                   The pandect on\n\nsentencing and the standard of review we must follow require\n\nno more.    Assessing the credibility of the witnesses against\n\nthe background facts in the presentence report, the district\n\ncourt did not err in concluding Morgan was responsible for\n\n80 to 100 kilograms of marijuana involved in the conspiracy,\n\nresulting in a base offense level of 24.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n     Although underscoring the evidence Pryme and Merritt\nagreed not to disclose certain marijuana sales to Morgan and\nhis extensive absence from the country to pursue his music\ncareer, these facts in the presentence report support the\ncourt’s decision to attribute certain amounts of marijuana\nto Morgan in the first instance.     That evidence does not\ncast doubt, however, on the ultimate quantity attributable\nto the conspiracy as a whole.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f        B.

Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), Morgan contends the district court failed\n\nto make its own independent determination of whether he met\n\n\n\n    4\n     18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) provides the five criteria to\nimpose a sentence “without regard to any statutory minimum\nsentence”:\n         (1) the defendant does not have more than\n         1 criminal history point, as determined\n         under the sentencing guidelines;\n         (2) the defendant did not use violence or\n         credible threats of violence or possess a\n         firearm or other dangerous weapon (or\n         induce another participant to do so) in\n         connection with the offense;\n         (3) the offense did not result in death\n         or serious bodily injury to any person;\n         (4) the defendant was not an organizer,\n         leader, manager, or supervisor of others\n         in the offense, as determined under the\n         sentencing guidelines and was not engaged\n         in a continuing criminal enterprise, as\n         defined in section 408 of the Controlled\n         Substances Act; and\n         (5) not later than the time of the\n         sentencing hearing, the defendant has\n         truthfully provided to the Government all\n         information and evidence the defendant has\n         concerning the offense or offenses that\n         were part of the same course of conduct\n         or of a common scheme or plan, but the\n         fact that the defendant has no relevant\n         or useful other information to provide or\n         that the Government is already aware of\n         the information shall not preclude a\n         determination    by  the  court   that  the\n         defendant    has    complied    with   this\n         requirement.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2 mirrors these requirements.\n\n                            -10-\n\fthe only contested element of the safety valve provision,\n\nthat he provide all information and evidence of the offense.\n\nThat void in the court’s determination cannot be filled with\n\nthe government’s generally subjective belief of his lack of\n\ncandor, Morgan asserts.\n\n             We   disagree.       Although       on   its      face    the    court’s\n\nsummary      statement     denying      safety    valve     relief      appears    to\n\nprovide scant satisfaction of the specific factual findings\n\nof which our precedent speaks, 5 Matos, 328 F.3d at 40, the\n\nfull record of the sentencing hearing surely amplifies the\n\nconclusion.           During      several        interchanges,          the    court\n\ncommented on Morgan’s lack of candor in downplaying his role\n\nin the conspiracy and in offering all of the information the\n\ngovernment sought.          Asking its own questions and listening\n\nto the witnesses’ testimony as well as counsels’ arguments\n\ninvolving credibility, the court then made the “independent\n\ndetermination” U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2 requires.                       United States v.\n\nWhite, 119 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             We   review    de   novo    interpretations          of    the    safety\n\nvalve provision under § 3553(f) and the guideline, U.S.S.G.\n\n§   5C1.2,    while   “[o]n      the   other     hand,    we    review   for    clear\n\nerror the factual findings relating to whether a defendant\n\n\n      5\n     The court stated,“[t]he Court declines to give that\ntwo-point reduction on the grounds [] the requirements of\nthe fifth prong under 5C1.2 have not been met.”\n\n                                       -11-\n\fhas qualified for the ‘safety valve’ provisions.”                          Id. at 73\n\nn.6.     Under this standard, we cannot say the court erred in\n\ndenying relief.\n\n              Indeed, the court’s dissatisfaction with Morgan’s\n\ncandor        surfaced    again    when       it   rejected   Morgan’s      argument\n\nunder § 5K1.1, stating that Morgan’s truthfulness “has been\n\nan    issue    throughout        this    hearing.”          Concluding      no    plea\n\nagreement was ever struck, the court properly gave effect to\n\nthe    government’s        decision          not    to     request     a    downward\n\ndeparture for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\n\nAlthough Morgan here insists the government’s plea agreement\n\nbecame    effective       upon    the     court’s        concluding    he   did    not\n\nparticipate in the total amount of marijuana involved in the\n\nconspiracy,      his     argument       is     fatuous.       Assuming      we    have\n\njurisdiction to entertain the question - a matter on which\n\nwe take no view - the district court did not err in refusing\n\nto depart under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\n\nII.    Downward Departure.\n\n              Morgan     contends       the    district       court    abused     its\n\ndiscretion      in     failing     to    grant      a    downward     departure     to\n\nreflect        the     extraordinary           family       circumstances         his\n\nincarceration and Pryme’s imminent deportation would visit\n\non his    three children.           We lack jurisdiction to entertain\n\nthis issue.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f               As we have enumerated in United States v. Dewire,\n\n271 F.3d 333, 337 (1st Cir. 2001), a discretionary refusal\n\nto depart is not appealable if the district court correctly\n\napplied the guidelines, see United States v. Saldana, 109\n\nF.3d 100, 102 (1st Cir. 1997); correctly applied the law,\n\nsee United States v. Lauzon, 938 F.2d 326, 330 (1st Cir.\n\n1991);      and    did    not   mistakenly     believe      it       lacked    the\n\ndiscretion to depart, see United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d\n\n42, 51 (1st Cir. 2000).              Here, the court, recognizing the\n\n“unfortunate       fact    of   life”   that     both   parents        may    face\n\nimprisonment, expressly declined to depart under U.S.S.G. §\n\n5H1.6.      The issue, then, is not properly before us.\n\n               Thus, the district court did not err in determining\n\nthe     drug    quantity    attributable       to    Morgan,     rejecting       a\n\ndeparture for his substantial assistance, and refusing to\n\napply a safety valve departure under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\n\nIII.     Post-Argument Claim.\n\n               Following oral argument, Morgan submitted letters\n\nunder Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) seeking additional review of his\n\nsentencing in light of Blakely v. Washington, ___ U.S. ___,\n\n124    S.   Ct.    2531    (2004).      Our   precedent     forecloses         this\n\nissue.\n\n               Blakely recently held that a Washington state court\n\njudge    violated    the    sixth    amendment      right   to   a    jury    trial\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fwhen he sentenced a defendant who pled guilty to kidnaping\n\nto   a   far    longer     prison    term    than    the    standard           statutory\n\nmaximum for this offense, based on the judge's own finding\n\nof the statutory aggravated circumstance that the defendant\n\nacted    with    “deliberate        cruelty.”        This    fact    was       “neither\n\nadmitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury.”                                Id. at\n\n2537.     Blakely could potentially affect the trial court’s\n\nsentence in the present case, which was based partially on\n\nits own finding holding Morgan responsible for between 80\n\nand 100 kilograms of marijuana as the amount that he could\n\nreasonably        foresee     within        the    scope     of     the        criminal\n\noperation.        Blakely raises the possibility that this fact\n\nshould    not     have     been   decided     by    the     judge,    but        instead\n\nneeded to have been determined by a jury or admitted by the\n\ndefendant.\n\n               Morgan never raised this Blakely issue at the trial\n\ncourt,    in    his   original      briefs    to    this    court,        or    in   oral\n\nargument.       Instead, he presented the issue to this court for\n\nthis first time after oral argument.\n\n               When   an   argument    has    been    waived,        no    review     is\n\npossible,        unless the court engages in the rare exercise of\n\nits power to excuse waiver.             But when an argument has merely\n\nbeen forfeited, plain error review may be available.                                  See\n\nUnited    States      v.   Mitchell,     807       F.3d    800,   807      (1st      Cir.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f1996).           Waiver       is     the     intentional          relinquishment      or\n\nabandonment of a right; forfeiture is generally defined as\n\nthe mere failure to raise an issue in a timely manner.                                See\n\nUnited     States       v.    Olano,    505 U.S. 725, 733 (1993); United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 433, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                The question now is whether plain error review is\n\navailable in this situation.                       When a party merely fails to\n\nraise an issue in proceedings below but does raise the issue\n\non appeal, we will still review that issue for plain error.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st\n\nCir.      2003).        But     this    case       is   a   bit   different;    Morgan\n\nneither raised the issue below nor initially in this court.\n\nThe normal rule is that new issues cannot be raised at all\n\nin a rule 28(j) filing, see United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d\n\n155,      163    (1st    Cir.      1993).      A    more    difficult    question     is\n\nwhether such a rule is appropriate where a party is raising\n\na   new    issue    in     response        to a    potentially crucial         Supreme\n\nCourt      decision      that      issued      only     after     briefing    and   oral\n\nargument were completed.                   After Apprendi was issued, several\n\ndefendants         filed      rule     28(j)      letters    with    this    court:   we\n\nagreed      to   consider       the    Apprendi issue, but only on plain\n\nerror review.           See United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41-\n\n42 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. LaFreniere, 236 F.3d\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f41, 48-50 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           We       need     not    definitively       resolve       whether        plain\n\nerror review would be available in this case, because even\n\nassuming       arguendo      that     it    is,     Morgan's      Blakely     argument\n\ncould not prevail using such a standard.\n\n           In the post-Apprendi world, this court adopted a\n\nrule    that    any    such        error    in    sentencing       should      be    held\n\nharmless      so    long     as    the     evidence    for     the    trial    judge’s\n\nfactual    findings        is      overwhelming       and    no    reasonable        jury\n\ncould   have       disagreed       with     them.      See   Sustache-Rivera           v.\n\nUnited States, 221 F.3d 8, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2000).                             This rule\n\ndoes    not        apply     to     the     present     case.           The    judge’s\n\ndetermination          was        surely     reasonable,          but    given        the\n\nconvoluted state of the evidence presented at the sentencing\n\nhearing, we cannot say the court’s findings were compelled\n\nby the evidence.\n\n           Plain error review is extremely deferential; errors\n\nwill be corrected only if “(1) . . . an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected\n\n[his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired\n\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.”         United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); see Olano, 505 U.S. at 732-37.                           Under existing\n\n(post-Apprendi,        pre-Blakely)          First     Circuit       precedent,      the\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fjudge is     empowered   in   a   conspiracy case to determine          the\n\nexact amount of drugs that a defendant reasonably foresaw,\n\nso long as his sentence is no greater than that which could\n\nbe imposed based on          the total quantity of drugs that the\n\njury had found for the conspiracy as a whole.               See Derman,\n\n298   F.3d    34,   42-43.     Because    the   trial   judge   acted    in\n\naccordance with circuit precedent, we cannot say plain error\n\noccurred, and we need not proceed further.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

He now appeals the 40-month sentence imposed on three principal grounds. Finding no merit in this triumvirate, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2001, the government charged Morgan, a Jamaican musician who became a United States citizen the previous month, and Beverly Pryme, also Jamaican and the mother of three of his children, with conspiracy to distribute over 100 kg. of marijuana from January 1990 until October 22, 2001. The indictment was the happenstance of the 1999 arrest of Daniel Merritt for a domestic assault in Merrimack, New Hampshire; he confessed to selling approximately 262 pounds of marijuana supplied by Morgan, a former college friend, and Pryme. Facing drug and tax evasion charges, Merritt agreed to cooperate, a decision which netted him a 27-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To that end, in July 2001, Merritt bridged the two-year hiatus since his arrest and twice telephoned Morgan, recording the conversations. Later that month, Merritt met Pryme for the first of two controlled buys, neither of which Pryme disclosed to Morgan who was traveling abroad some of that time. Pryme was arrested during a third controlled buy, and the two were subsequently indicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, Morgan proffered a statement to the government. He described his early college dealings with Merritt through 1998; his surprise to hear from Merritt again in 2001; and his disagreement with Pryme for continuing to supply larger quantities of marijuana from suppliers in New York with whom Pryme was \"intimate\" but called \"murderers.\" Morgan stated his primary sources were \"Big Dred,\" \"Mark,\" and his brother, \"Tender.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2002, the government sent Morgan a proposed plea agreement in which it agreed to drop two counts in exchange for Morgan's agreeing to plead guilty to a conspiracy involving over 100 kg. of marijuana. Morgan did not execute the agreement and attempted an amendment to make the agreement \"subject to a disclaimer\" of the \"weight and scope.\" With the plea agreement in limbo, the parties submitted briefs to the district court addressing whether Morgan could plead guilty to the offense but reserve for sentencing the weight of drugs attributed to his involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 2002, the government refused to meet again with Morgan for safety valve consideration, explaining to his counsel the decision was \"[i]n light of your client's continued insistence that he is not responsible for 100 or more kilograms of marijuana.\" On November 8, 2002, however, the district court ruled on Morgan's motion, holding that under <i>United States v. O'Campo,</i> 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir.1992), \"the base offense level of a co-conspirator at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees [ ] is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.\" Then applying <i>Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir.2002), which addressed the duties of the judge and jury in a drug conspiracy case, post-<i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the court concluded \"defendant may enter a plea of guilty to the conspiracy charged in count one and reserve the right to contest at sentencing the quantity of drugs for which he is to be held responsible under the law\" contingent upon his agreeing to additional conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented three witnesses to prove the quantity of marijuana attributable to Morgan under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 for purposes of the court's setting the base level of the offense. The court also heard arguments on whether Morgan was entitled to the two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which incorporates the safety valve statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), and a two-level departure for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniel Merritt, questioned by both counsel and the court, testified that Morgan sold him approximately 130 pounds of marijuana, most of which he resold in small five to twenty pound quantities. He added, however, he sold to Daniel Scharn of Billerica, Massachusetts, the bulk of at least 100 pounds. Beverly Pryme, who also identified another source for the marijuana she sold Merritt, told the court Morgan provided 75 to 80 pounds of marijuana to Merritt. Finally, Patrol Sergeant Paul Poirier of the Merrimack Police Department described his investigation and surveillance that led to Pryme's arrest and told the court he believed Pryme \"downplayed\" the amount of marijuana attributable to Morgan. Based on the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court then stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we all know from experience, evidence concerning quantities is often comprised of estimates, estimates as to quantities, estimates as to the number of times deliveries are made, and estimates as to over what period of time those deliveries were made. Evidence concerning quantities depends also on memories, some of which are good and some of which are not so good. Therefore extrapolation is required when such evidence is received, and in my opinion the Court must be cautious when extrapolating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standards of U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 to all of the evidence \"over the last few hours,\" the court found between 80 and 100 kilograms of marijuana were attributable to Morgan, resulting in a total offense level of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without elaboration, the court declined to give the two-level reduction under the fifth element of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2. It also rejected Morgan's motion under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1. Morgan based his motion upon a presumption that the plea agreement was revitalized when the court attributed less than 100 kilograms of marijuana to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Observing that Morgan's truthfulness remained an issue throughout the hearing and that the government's position was not taken in bad faith, the court concluded it would not \"in effect force a 5K1 motion on the government.\" Morgan challenges both conclusions in this appeal as well as the court's refusal to depart downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.6 in consideration of his extraordinary family ties and responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.

We deal with each contention in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A. Drug Quantity</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As oft-written, \"[w]e review the sentencing court's factual findings, which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 299 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir.2002), <i>citing United States v. Damon,</i> 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir.1997). That \"preponderance,\" <i>United States v. Marks,</i> 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.2004), simply requires the government to present enough information, free from the strictures of the rules of evidence which do not apply to sentencing hearings, \"provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy,\" <i>Lopez,</i> 299 F.3d at 89; Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3), to make it more likely than not that the fact to be proved is true. We then will \"treat[ ] with deference\" the district court's determination which we will reverse \"only if, after reviewing all the evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 299 F.3d at 87 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Morgan's persistently conflating the inquiries on drug weight and the vindication of his truthfulness in testifying about his involvement in the conspiracy, we must untangle the two issues. While the testimony at the sentencing hearing established at most approximately 135 pounds to be attributed to Morgan's participation in the conspiracy, the presentence report more fully documented additional quantities from recipients, particularly Scharn and Stanbury, whom, the government conceded, it perhaps \"should have been more diligent\" in calling to testify \"to get over 100 kilos.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Nevertheless, the district court also had benefit of the background facts from the presentence report, which we, too, utilize in our review for clear error. <i>See id.</i> at 86, <i>citing United States v. Brady,</i> 168 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir.1999). The pandect on sentencing and the standard of review we must follow require no more. Assessing the credibility of the witnesses against the background facts in the presentence report, the district court did not err in concluding Morgan was responsible for 80 to 100 kilograms of marijuana involved in the conspiracy, resulting in a base offense level of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B. Safety Valve and Substantial Assistance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the \"battleground\" of the fifth element of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2003), Morgan contends the district court failed to make its own independent determination of whether he met the only contested element of the safety valve provision, that he provide all information and evidence of the offense. That void in the court's determination cannot be filled with the government's generally subjective belief of his lack of candor, Morgan asserts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. Although on its face the court's summary statement denying safety valve relief appears to provide scant satisfaction of the specific factual findings of which our precedent speaks,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Matos,</i> 328 F.3d at 40, the full record of the sentencing hearing surely amplifies the conclusion. During several interchanges, the court commented on Morgan's lack of candor in downplaying his role in the conspiracy and in offering all of the information the government sought. Asking its own questions and listening to the witnesses' testimony as well as counsels' arguments involving credibility, the court then made the \"<i>independent</i> determination\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 requires. <i>United States v. White,</i> 119 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo interpretations of the safety valve provision under &#167; 3553(f) and the guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, while \"[o]n the other hand, we review for clear error the factual findings relating to whether a defendant has qualified for the `safety valve' provisions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 73 n. 6. Under this standard, we cannot say the court erred in denying relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the court's dissatisfaction with Morgan's candor surfaced again when it rejected Morgan's argument under &#167; 5K1.1, stating that Morgan's truthfulness \"has been an issue throughout this hearing.\" Concluding no plea agreement was ever struck, the court properly gave effect to the government's decision not to request a downward departure for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1. Although Morgan here insists the government's plea agreement became effective upon the court's concluding he did not participate in the total amount of marijuana involved in the conspiracy, his argument is fatuous. Assuming we have jurisdiction to entertain the question &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; the district court did not err in refusing to depart under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>Downward Departure.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morgan contends the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a downward departure to reflect the extraordinary family circumstances his incarceration and Pryme's imminent deportation would visit on his three children. We lack jurisdiction to entertain this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have enumerated in <i>United States v. Dewire,</i> 271 F.3d 333, 337 (1st Cir.2001), a discretionary refusal to depart is not appealable if the district court correctly applied the guidelines, <i>see United States v. Saldana,</i> 109 F.3d 100, 102 (1st Cir.1997); correctly applied the law, <i>see United States v. Lauzon,</i> 938 F.2d 326, 330 (1st Cir.1991); and did not mistakenly believe it lacked the discretion to depart, <i>see United States v. Snyder,</i> 235 F.3d 42, 51 (1st Cir.2000). Here, the court, recognizing the \"unfortunate fact of life\" that both parents may face imprisonment, expressly declined to depart under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.6. The issue, then, is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court did not err in determining the drug quantity attributable to Morgan, rejecting a departure for his substantial assistance, and refusing to apply a safety valve departure under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>III. Post-Argument Claim.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following oral argument, Morgan submitted letters under Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) seeking additional review of his sentencing in light of <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Our precedent forecloses this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Blakely</i> recently held that a Washington state court judge violated the sixth amendment right to a jury trial when he sentenced a defendant who pled guilty to kidnaping to a far longer prison term than the standard statutory maximum for this offense, based on the judge's own finding of the statutory aggravated circumstance that the defendant acted with \"deliberate cruelty.\" This fact was \"neither admitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2537. <i>Blakely</i> could potentially affect the trial court's sentence in the present case, which was based partially on its own finding holding Morgan responsible for between 80 and 100 kilograms of marijuana as the amount that he could reasonably foresee within the scope of the criminal operation. <i>Blakely</i> raises the possibility that this fact should not have been decided by the judge, but instead needed to have been determined by a jury or admitted by the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morgan never raised this <i>Blakely</i> issue at the trial court, in his original briefs to this court, or in oral argument. Instead, he presented the issue to this court for this first time after oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an argument has been waived, no review is possible, unless the court engages in the rare exercise of its power to excuse waiver. But when an argument has merely been forfeited, plain error review may be available. <i>See United States v. Mitchell,</i> 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.1996). Waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a right; forfeiture is generally defined as the mere failure to raise an issue in a timely manner. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question now is whether plain error review is available in this situation. When a party merely fails to raise an issue in proceedings below but does raise the issue on appeal, we will still review that issue for plain error. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Thurston,</i> 358 F.3d 51, 63 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2003). But this case is a bit different; Morgan neither raised the issue below <i>nor</i> initially in this court. The normal rule is that new issues cannot be raised at all in a rule 28(j) filing, <i>see United States v. Nason,</i> 9 F.3d 155, 163 (1st Cir.1993). A more difficult question is whether such a rule is appropriate where a party is raising a new issue in response to a potentially crucial Supreme Court decision that issued only after briefing and oral argument were completed. After <i>Apprendi</i> was issued, several defendants filed rule 28(j) letters with this court: we agreed to consider the <i>Apprendi</i> issue, but only on plain error review. <i>See United States v. Baltas,</i> 236 F.3d 27, 41-42 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. LaFreniere,</i> 236 F.3d 41, 48-50 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not definitively resolve whether plain error review would be available in this case, because even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that it is, Morgan's <i>Blakely</i> argument could not prevail using such a standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the post-<i>Apprendi</i> world, this court adopted a rule that any such error in sentencing should be held harmless so long as the evidence for the trial judge's factual findings is overwhelming and no reasonable jury could have disagreed with them. <i>See Sustache-Rivera v. United States,</i> 221 F.3d 8, 18-19 (1st Cir.2000). This rule does not apply to the present case. The judge's determination was surely reasonable, but given the convoluted state of the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, we cannot say the court's findings were compelled by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plain error review is extremely deferential; errors will be corrected only if \"(1) ... an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see Olano,</i> 505 U.S. at 732-37, 112 S.Ct. 2727. Under existing (post-<i>Apprendi,</i> pre-<i>Blakely</i>) First Circuit precedent, the judge is empowered in a conspiracy case to determine the exact amount of drugs that a defendant reasonably foresaw, so long as his sentence is no greater than that which could be imposed based on the total quantity of drugs that the jury had found for the conspiracy as a whole. <i>See Derman,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 42-43. Because the trial judge acted in accordance with circuit precedent (not yet clearly established to be erroneous), we cannot say plain error occurred, and we need not proceed further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The conditions were:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) he must admit that the conspiracy as a whole involved in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana, while reserving the right to contest at sentencing the quantity of marijuana for which he can be held legally accountable;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) he must acknowledge his understanding that the maximum sentence for the conspiracy charged is forty years and that the maximum sentence he potentially could be subject to is forty years;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) he must acknowledge his understanding that the court will make a determination of the quantity of marijuana for which he may be held legally accountable, and that his base offense level under the ...

He now appeals the 40-month sentence imposed on three principal grounds. Finding no merit in this triumvirate, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2001, the government charged Morgan, a Jamaican musician who became a United States citizen the previous month, and Beverly Pryme, also Jamaican and the mother of three of his children, with conspiracy to distribute over 100 kg. of marijuana from January 1990 until October 22, 2001. The indictment was the happenstance of the 1999 arrest of Daniel Merritt for a domestic assault in Merrimack, New Hampshire; he confessed to selling approximately 262 pounds of marijuana supplied by Morgan, a former college friend, and Pryme. Facing drug and tax evasion charges, Merritt agreed to cooperate, a decision which netted him a 27-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To that end, in July 2001, Merritt bridged the two-year hiatus since his arrest and twice telephoned Morgan, recording the conversations. Later that month, Merritt met Pryme for the first of two controlled buys, neither of which Pryme disclosed to Morgan who was traveling abroad some of that time. Pryme was arrested during a third controlled buy, and the two were subsequently indicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, Morgan proffered a statement to the government. He described his early college dealings with Merritt through 1998; his surprise to hear from Merritt again in 2001; and his disagreement with Pryme for continuing to supply larger quantities of marijuana from suppliers in New York with whom Pryme was \"intimate\" but called \"murderers.\" Morgan stated his primary sources were \"Big Dred,\" \"Mark,\" and his brother, \"Tender.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2002, the government sent Morgan a proposed plea agreement in which it agreed to drop two counts in exchange for Morgan's agreeing to plead guilty to a conspiracy involving over 100 kg. of marijuana. Morgan did not execute the agreement and attempted an amendment to make the agreement \"subject to a disclaimer\" of the \"weight and scope.\" With the plea agreement in limbo, the parties submitted briefs to the district court addressing whether Morgan could plead guilty to the offense but reserve for sentencing the weight of drugs attributed to his involvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 5, 2002, the government refused to meet again with Morgan for safety valve consideration, explaining to his counsel the decision was \"[i]n light of your client's continued insistence that he is not responsible for 100 or more kilograms of marijuana.\" On November 8, 2002, however, the district court ruled on Morgan's motion, holding that under <i>United States v.

The court also heard arguments on whether Morgan was entitled to the two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which incorporates the safety valve statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), and a two-level departure for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daniel Merritt, questioned by both counsel and the court, testified that Morgan sold him approximately 130 pounds of marijuana, most of which he resold in small five to twenty pound quantities. He added, however, he sold to Daniel Scharn of Billerica, Massachusetts, the bulk of at least 100 pounds. Beverly Pryme, who also identified another source for the marijuana she sold Merritt, told the court Morgan provided 75 to 80 pounds of marijuana to Merritt. Finally, Patrol Sergeant Paul Poirier of the Merrimack Police Department described his investigation and surveillance that led to Pryme's arrest and told the court he believed Pryme \"downplayed\" the amount of marijuana attributable to Morgan. Based on the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court then stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we all know from experience, evidence concerning quantities is often comprised of estimates, estimates as to quantities, estimates as to the number of times deliveries are made, and estimates as to over what period of time those deliveries were made.

While the testimony at the sentencing hearing established at most approximately 135 pounds to be attributed to Morgan's participation in the conspiracy, the presentence report more fully documented additional quantities from recipients, particularly Scharn and Stanbury, whom, the government conceded, it perhaps \"should have been more diligent\" in calling to testify \"to get over 100 kilos.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Nevertheless, the district court also had benefit of the background facts from the presentence report, which we, too, utilize in our review for clear error. <i>See id.</i> at 86, <i>citing United States v.

The pandect on sentencing and the standard of review we must follow require no more. Assessing the credibility of the witnesses against the background facts in the presentence report, the district court did not err in concluding Morgan was responsible for 80 to 100 kilograms of marijuana involved in the conspiracy, resulting in a base offense level of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.

During several interchanges, the court commented on Morgan's lack of candor in downplaying his role in the conspiracy and in offering all of the information the government sought. Asking its own questions and listening to the witnesses' testimony as well as counsels' arguments involving credibility, the court then made the \"<i>independent</i> determination\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 requires. <i>United States v.

Waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a right; forfeiture is generally defined as the mere failure to raise an issue in a timely manner. <i>See United States v.

A more difficult question is whether such a rule is appropriate where a party is raising a new issue in response to a potentially crucial Supreme Court decision that issued only after briefing and oral argument were completed. After <i>Apprendi</i> was issued, several defendants filed rule 28(j) letters with this court: we agreed to consider the <i>Apprendi</i> issue, but only on plain error review. <i>See United States v.
