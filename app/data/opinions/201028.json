On July 30, 2003, Univar USA, Inc., a\n\nchemical distribution and production company, secured an injunction\n\nenjoining Teamsters Union Local 251 from committing a number of\n\nunlawful acts on its then two-week-old picket line outside Univar's\n\nfacilities.    The    injunction,    issued    pursuant     to   the   Norris-\n\nLaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 101 et seq., prohibits Union members\n\nand/or picketers from trespassing on Univar's property; threatening\n\nor   assaulting      Univar's     employees,    suppliers,       independent\n\ncontractors,   or    others     seeking   to   enter   or    exit      Univar's\n\nfacilities; standing within 20 feet of any vehicle entering or\n\nleaving the facilities; blocking any vehicle entering or leaving\n\nthe facilities; and placing in the roadway or on Univar's property\n\nany object with the intention of damaging Univar's vehicles or the\n\nvehicles of Univar's suppliers, employees, or business invitees.\n\nThe injunction also requires picketers to move in single file while\n\non the picket line.\n\n          The Union brings this appeal to contest the issuance of\n\nthe injunction.     The Union does not dispute that behavior of the\n\nsort enjoined occurred on its picket line between July 16, 2003\n\n(the day the Union began its strike) and July 30, 2003 (the day the\n\ninjunction issued).      Rather, the Union notes that \"the nation's\n\nlabor policy counsels that district courts be chary about intruding\n\ninto the [labor dispute] field\" because of \"the long, sometimes\n\ntragic[] history of premature judicial intervention in labor-\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmanagement controversies.\" Independent Oil & Chem. Workers v.\n\nProctor & Gamble, 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988).             Building from\n\nthis presumption against intervention and invoking the statutory\n\nadmonition that \"no injunction or temporary restraining order shall\n\nbe issued on account of any threat or unlawful act excepting\n\nagainst the person or persons, association, or organization making\n\nthe threat or committing the unlawful act or actually authorizing\n\nor ratifying the same after actual knowledge thereof,\" 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n107(a), the Union contends that \"[t]he record is completely bereft\n\nof any evidence which supports the District Court's conclusion that\n\nthe Union actually ratified and/or authorized unlawful acts after\n\nknowledge thereof.\"        Alternatively, the Union asserts that \"the\n\nrecord is similarly devoid of any evidence demonstrating that\n\nillegal acts were likely to continue unless restrained.\"             Univar's\n\nresponse contains a challenge to the Union's interpretation of ยง\n\n107(a) and its application to this case, but we leave the legal\n\nissues   to    another   day   because   the   appeal    is   susceptible    of\n\nresolution on narrower grounds.\n\n              The district court supportably found that, on July 17,\n\n2003, the Union's President and Business Agent, Joseph Bairos, had\n\ntold picketers to picket back and forth in an orderly fashion\n\n(after putting an end to the picketers' practice of using mirrors\n\nto   reflect    sunlight    into   the    faces   of    Univar   drivers    and\n\nemployees).     Nevertheless, on July 18, 2003, Bairos arrived at the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fstrike   scene   and   saw    that   picketers   were   not   following   his\n\ninstructions.    Instead, they had blocked a train from making a\n\ndelivery to Univar.          The district court described (in an oral\n\nruling) what happened next:\n\n                  Mr. Bairos did not instruct the\n           picketers to disperse from in front of the\n           train and move back and forth in an orderly\n           fashion.   Rather, he did not tell them to\n           disperse until after he had personally spoken\n           to the train engineer and secured an assurance\n           from that engineer that the delivery would not\n           be made to the Plaintiff that day.\n\n           The court also found that on the picket line, \"there is\n\na designated contact person, either the union steward or the most\n\nsenior employee, with whom [Bairos] and/or [another business agent\n\nwith responsibility for the Univar strike and the picketing] may\n\ncommunicate by cell phone.\"\n\n           The court then relied heavily on these two findings in\n\nrejecting the Union's no-ratification/authorization argument:\n\n           On July 17th, Mr. Bairos instructed that the\n           picketers be orderly and that they keep\n           moving. On the very next day, however, when\n           he was on the scene himself and saw that the\n           picketers were not acting in an orderly\n           fashion or moving but rather standing in front\n           of the train engine, rather than reiterate his\n           previous instruction and to order his members\n           to disperse, he personally secured the\n           assurances from the engineer not to make the\n           delivery, engaged in some conversation with\n           the engineer, and then once he secured\n           assurance from the engineer, the membership\n           dispersed.\n\n                  This activity on the part of Mr.\n           Bairos, as president of the union, in my mind\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          is the equivalent of [a] wink and nod. That\n          is, it is as though he's saying to the members\n          that it's fine to congregate as they did and\n          to remain in place, in other words, to do as I\n          do rather than to do what I told you to do\n          yesterday . . . .\n\n                 Moreover, as Mr. Bairos has testified,\n          even when leadership may not be physically\n          present on the line, there is a contact person\n          so designated with whom the leadership can\n          talk by cell phone and receive reports of what\n          is going on.\n\n                 Taking all of these [and other] facts\n          into account, this Court finds that the\n          Defendant union in this case had actual\n          knowledge of these unlawful acts and by\n          actions of the leadership itself authorized\n          and/or ratified after the fact those unlawful\n          acts.\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n          In presenting its argument that the record is \"bereft\" of\n\nevidence that Union officers authorized and/or ratified the illegal\n\nconduct giving rise to the injunction, the Union all but ignores\n\nthe district court's determinations that such authorization or\n\nratification occurred because, inter alia, (1) Bairos gave \"a wink\n\nand a nod\" to the unruly picketers, and (2) the Union at all\n\nrelevant times had an agent on the picket line and thus was on\n\nnotice of the unlawful behavior underlying the injunction.1   Thus,\n\nassuming arguendo that authorization or ratification were required,\n\nthe district court expressly made such a finding with its finding\n\n\n     1\n      Indeed, in quoting the allegedly \"relevant\" portion of the\ncourt's ruling in its Statement of Facts, the Union omits the\nunderlined language quoted above and replaces it with an ellipsis.\n\n                               -5-\n\fof \"a wink and a nod.\"       The Union presents no argument that the\n\nfinding was not supported by the evidence and so has waived the\n\nargument.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   And in any event, our reading of the record does not\n\npersuade us that the court reversibly erred in its factual findings\n\nor in tailoring its injunction to those findings.\n\n            We also reject the Union's argument that the district\n\ncourt erred     in   determining    that      illegal    acts   were   likely   to\n\ncontinue unless restrained.             There was uncontradicted evidence\n\nthat, well after the Union was on notice that Univar was seeking an\n\ninjunction, persons attempting to drive into and out of Univar's\n\nfacilities    were   subjected     to    assaults,      threats,   having   their\n\nvehicles blocked, and dangerous games of \"chicken\" by persons\n\n(presumably Union members or sympathizers) driving other vehicles.\n\nThe record as a whole supports the court's conclusions that an\n\ninjunction was necessary to preserve the peace in a situation with\n\nescalating tensions and lawlessness, and that an injunction against\n\nthe Union was an appropriate mechanism for defusing the situation.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f",
