Petitioner Richard R. Desrosier\n\nappeals from the district court's denial of his petition for a writ\n\nof   habeas   corpus,     claiming   that   he   did   not   knowingly     or\n\nintelligently plead guilty to second-degree murder in Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court because he had not been adequately informed of the\n\nelements of the offense.      We affirm.\n\n           Desrosier was indicted on one count each of first- and\n\nsecond-degree murder for killing a young woman in Worcester in\n\nApril 1990.    As related by the Commonwealth at the plea hearing,\n\nthe evidence against him included the testimony of an acquaintance\n\nthat a foursome consisting of himself, Desrosier, the victim, and\n\nanother, underage, girl had obtained vodka and beer on the day of\n\nthe killing and had gone up to the roof of a defunct railroad\n\nterminal to drink it.      At some point, Desrosier and the victim were\n\nleft alone.     When the acquaintance returned, over Desrosier's\n\nprotest, he saw that the victim's prone and unclad body was\n\nengulfed in flames.       Desrosier then stated that he had killed the\n\nvictim because she had refused to have sex with him.\n\n           The acquaintance fled the scene but later returned with\n\nthe police, who found the victim's body on a lower section of the\n\nroof of the terminal, nineteen feet below an opening on the level\n\nwhere   Desrosier   had    last   been   seen.   The   Commonwealth      also\n\nrecounted the statements of a number of other people who had\n\ninteracted with Desrosier in the wake of the murder.                  Their\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fproffered testimony was that Desrosier had blood on his clothing\n\nand hands which he acknowledged was another person's blood, and\n\nthat Desrosier told them that he had just killed someone.                   The\n\npolice also retrieved clothing from Desrosier's home with stains\n\nmatching the victim's blood type.\n\n            At the plea hearing, Desrosier conceded that he had no\n\nreason to doubt that the killing had occurred in the manner\n\ndescribed but explained that he had no independent recollection of\n\nthe events of that evening because he had \"blacked out\" from\n\ndrinking.    Desrosier, who described himself at the time as a\n\ntwenty-three year-old high-school graduate, also testified that he\n\nunderstood the difference between the sentences for first- and\n\nsecond-degree murder with respect to parole.1              He further stated\n\nthat his lawyer had discussed with him the Commonwealth's evidence,\n\n\"the defenses [he] could raise and the other things [he] could do\n\nif [he] had a trial,\" and \"the pros and cons of having a trial, as\n\nopposed to entering a plea of guilty.\"              His counsel, with whom\n\nDesrosier said he was satisfied, added that Desrosier had been\n\ngiven copies of the police reports prepared as part of the murder\n\ninvestigation   as    well   as   a   transcript    of   the   probable   cause\n\nhearing, which he had \"reviewed . . . many times.\"                The Superior\n\nCourt   accepted     Desrosier's      plea   to   second-degree    murder   and\n\n\n\n1\n The difference is that there is no parole from a sentence for\nfirst-degree murder. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, ยง 2 (2000).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsentenced him to a mandatory term of life in prison.\n\n            Some five years later, Desrosier moved to withdraw his\n\nplea, arguing, inter alia, that he had not been sufficiently\n\ninformed of the elements of first- or second-degree murder.2                           A\n\ndifferent Superior Court justice from the one who had taken the\n\nplea     held    an    evidentiary        hearing,   at     which    Desrosier       was\n\nrepresented by different counsel.                At this hearing, Desrosier\n\ncalled as a witness his former defense attorney, who testified\n\nthat, prior to the entry of the plea, the two of them had \"assessed\n\neverything, and we discussed it,\" including the police and autopsy\n\nreports, the probable cause hearing, the main witnesses, and\n\ndefense counsel's investigation.              Desrosier did not testify.\n\n            The       Superior    Court    granted   the    motion,       ruling    that\n\n\"because    there       is   no    record    that    the    defendant       was     ever\n\nspecifically informed of the elements of murder in the first or\n\nsecond degree, including the requisite level of intent needed to\n\ncommit    such    crimes,    the    defendant's      plea    was    not    freely    and\n\nunderstandingly made.\"            Massachusetts v. Desrosier, No. 90-2097,\n\nslip op. at 10 (Mass. Super. Ct. Nov. 7, 2000).                    Specifically, the\n\ncourt found that the judge who took the plea \"failed to discuss any\n\nof the elements of the murder charges, including intent, in his\n\n\n\n2\n When Desrosier filed the motion, he was proceeding pro se and\nasserted a number of different grounds for relief, including\nineffective assistance of counsel.     This claim was withdrawn,\nhowever, by Desrosier's counsel at the motion hearing.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fcolloquy even after the defendant claimed he had a 'blackout.'\"\n\nId.   The court also concluded that Desrosier's statements at the\n\nplea hearing were \"not specific enough to demonstrate that [he] was\n\nfully informed of the elements of the crime.\"       Id.\n\n            The   Commonwealth   appealed    this   decision    to   the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court, which reversed.         Massachusetts v.\n\nDesrosier, 778 N.E.2d 1 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002).        While observing\n\nthat \"it would have been preferable had the plea hearing judge\n\nexplained the elements of murder in the first and second degrees at\n\nthe plea hearing,\" the Appeals Court nevertheless concluded that\n\n\"the record demonstrates that the defendant did, in fact, plead\n\nfreely and understandingly.\"     Id. at 6.   The court noted that\n\n      the defendant heard a detailed recitation of the evidence\n      against him, and stated that he did not have any reason\n      to doubt the veracity of that evidence; he acknowledged\n      he admitted [the] killing . . . to numerous persons; [he]\n      affirmed he had discussed possible defenses with his\n      attorney; defense counsel testified he had discussed the\n      evidence with the defendant, and they had 'assessed\n      everything'; and there is no suggestion that the\n      defendant was not on notice of the charges contained in\n      the indictment.\n\nId. at 8.    Citing specifically to Desrosier's statements at the\n\nplea hearing, the Appeals Court reasoned that \"as a matter of\n\ncommon sense, a discussion of 'defenses' and the 'pros and cons of\n\nhaving a trial' would not take place in isolation,\" but \"almost\n\ncertainly would have referred to the elements of the crimes to\n\nwhich the defenses would be advanced.\"        Id. at 6-7.      The court\n\nruled that, as such, the record demonstrated that Desrosiers had\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbeen   advised    of    the    elements    of    the      offense   as   required   by\n\nHenderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637 (1976).                   778 N.E.2d at 5-6.\n\n            After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his\n\napplication for further appellate review, 782 N.E.2d 515 (Mass.\n\n2003), Desrosier filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\n\nfederal district court, claiming that the decision of the Appeals\n\nCourt amounted to an unreasonable application of Supreme Court\n\nprecedent under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\nof 1996,    28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d) (2007) (\"AEDPA\").                   The petition was\n\nreferred to a magistrate judge, id. ยง 636(b)(1)(B) (2007), who\n\nrecommended that it be denied.              The magistrate judge determined\n\nthat the Appeals Court had not unreasonably applied Supreme Court\n\nprecedent when it held \"that discussions between [Desrosier] and\n\nhis lawyer necessarily included advice concerning elements of the\n\ncrime with which [Desrosier] was charged,\" and that \"although\n\nreasonable      minds   could    disagree       as   to    the   [Appeals    Court's]\n\nfindings of fact, those findings are not unreasonable in light of\n\nthe    record   which    was    available       to   [it]\"    (footnote     omitted).\n\nDesrosier v. Bissonette, No. 03-40194, slip op. at 10-11, 12 (D.\n\nMass. Dec. 19, 2005).\n\n            The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report\n\nand recommendation over Desrosier's objections. The court reasoned\n\nthat, because the elements of second-degree murder \"are neither\n\ncomplex nor esoteric . . . it is hardly unbridled conjecture to\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fdraw the inference that, in the course of assessing and discussing\n\n'everything' about the case, [Desrosier] was made aware by counsel\n\nthat the Commonwealth had to prove he intended to cause the\n\nvictim's death.\"   Desrosier v. Bissonette, No. 03-40194, slip op.\n\nat 6, 7 (D. Mass. Sept. 19, 2006).      (footnote omitted).   Desrosier\n\nthen applied for, and was granted, a certificate of appealability\n\non the issues of whether the Appeals Court's decision involved an\n\nunreasonable   application   of   Supreme    Court   precedent   or   an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts.      This appeal followed.\n\n           In considering an appeal from a denial of a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus, we review the district courtโs legal conclusions de\n\nnovo.    See, e.g., Furr v. Brady, 440 F.3d 34, 36-37 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Under AEDPA, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief\n\nโwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\n\nState court proceedingsโ unless the state court decision (1) โwas\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited Statesโ or (2) โwas based on an unreasonable determination\n\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\n\nproceeding.โ   28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d).      We agree with the magistrate\n\njudge and the district court that the Appeals Court's decision\n\nsuffers from neither of these infirmities.\n\n           \"A guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights,\n\nand is valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f. . . .   Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having\n\nbeen informed of the crime's elements, this standard is not met and\n\nthe plea is invalid.\"    Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S. 175, 183 (2005)\n\n(citing Henderson, 426 U.S. at 647).     As the Appeals Court noted,\n\nthis rule does not require the judge who took the plea to have\n\nexplained the elements of the offense to the defendant, provided\n\nthat the record adequately reflects that defense counsel did so.\n\nId.   The record need not, however, contain defense counsel's\n\nexplicit affirmation to that effect.        \"[E]ven without such an\n\nexpress representation, it may be appropriate to presume that in\n\nmost cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the\n\noffense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he\n\nis being asked to admit.\"    Henderson, 426 U.S. at 647.\n\n           Contrary to Desrosier's contention, the Appeals Court did\n\nnot unreasonably apply these federal constitutional rules for a\n\nvalid guilty plea.      While the court did not invoke, by name, a\n\n\"presumption\" that defense counsel had explained the elements of\n\nsecond-degree murder to Desrosier, its reasoning was entirely\n\nconsistent with that aspect of Henderson.       Based on Desrosier's\n\nadmissions at the plea hearing that he had discussed the \"defenses\"\n\nand the \"pros and cons of having a trial\" with his former attorney,\n\nas well as on the attorney's testimony at the motion hearing that\n\nhe and his client had \"discussed\" and \"assessed everything,\" the\n\nAppeals Court concluded that defense counsel had informed Desrosier\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fof   the   elements    of   the   charge     of   second-degree    murder.3\n\nMassachusetts v. Desrosier, 778 N.E.2d at 5-7.             Given that the\n\nSupreme Court has never required defense counsel to say outright\n\nthat he or she has discussed the elements of the crime with the\n\ndefendant in order for a constitutionally valid plea to result--\n\nindeed,    Henderson   in   applying   the   presumption   holds   to   the\n\ncontrary--the Appeals Court did not unreasonably apply federal\n\nlaw.4\n\n\n3\n Lending further support to the Appeals Court's decision, as the\ndistrict court noted, is the fact that the elements of second-\ndegree murder are not difficult to explain or understand. See,\ne.g., United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995)\n(\"the method for determining the defendant's understanding of the\ncharge will vary from case to case depending on the complexity of\nthe charges, the capacity of the defendant, and the attendant\ncircumstances\").\n4\n Relying on North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), Desrosier\nargues that, because he did not expressly admit to acts\nconstituting second-degree murder but merely stated that he had no\nreason to doubt the Commonwealth's version of facts, his counsel\nwas required to explain the elements of both first- and second-\ndegree murder to him.      We have our doubts as to Desroiser's\npremise, see, e.g., United States v. Tunning, 69 F.3d 107, 111 (6th\nCir. 1995) (holding that Alford applies only when the defendant\npleads guilty while asserting his innocence, not merely while\nrefusing to admit the acts constituting the crime), but, in any\nevent, we disagree with his conclusion. Though the Massachusetts\nSupreme Judicial Court has arguably read Alford to require that a\ndefendant understand the elements of both the crime with which he\nwas charged and the crime to which he pleaded guilty, Massachusetts\nv. Nikas, 727 N.E.2d 1166, 1169-70 (Mass. 2000), we do not read\nAlford so rigidly, and Desrosier does not cite any federal court\ndecision, let alone any Supreme Court decision, that does. Cf.\nAllard v. Helgemoe, 572 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1978) (\"Alford holds\nthat a court may constitutionally accept a plea of guilty from a\ndefendant who continues to protest his innocence\"). By rejecting\nDesrosier's Alford argument, then, the Appeals Court did not\nunreasonably apply federal law.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          Though Desrosier does not argue that the Appeals Court's\n\ndecision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,\n\nthat idea permeated both his brief and oral argument in this case.\n\nIn particular, he objects to what he sees as the Appeals Court's\n\nessentially discarding the motion court's finding that his prior\n\nattorney did not, in fact, inform him of the elements of second-\n\ndegree murder.      We see things differently.      The Appeals Court\n\nsimply disagreed with the motion court about the legal significance\n\nof the fact that defense counsel did not expressly state that he\n\nrecited the elements to Desrosier.       In any event, federal courts\n\ncannot grant habeas relief based on mere disagreements with how a\n\nstate court conducts its appellate review. In other words, \"state-\n\ncourt   judgments   must   be   upheld   unless,   after   the   closest\n\nexamination of the state-court judgment, a federal court is firmly\n\nconvinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated.\"\n\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 388 (2000) (plurality opinion).\n\nWe are unconvinced that anything approaching the unconstitutional\n\nhappened here.\n\n          Furthermore, to the extent that the Appeals Court did\n\nresolve any facts in overturning the Superior Court's decision,\n\nDesrosier has the burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence,\n\nthat those factual determinations were unreasonable.        28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2254(e)(1).   He has not done so.   Indeed, he has never come forward\n\nwith any evidence to contradict his former attorney's version of\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fevents or to negate the inference that they did in fact discuss the\n\nelements of second-degree murder.     It is not enough for him simply\n\nto argue for the contrary inference at this point.      The district\n\ncourt properly dismissed Desrosier's petition.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

The court noted that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> the defendant heard a detailed recitation of the evidence against him, and stated that he did not have any reason to doubt the veracity of that evidence; he acknowledged he admitted [the] killing . . . to numerous persons; [he] affirmed he had discussed possible defenses with his attorney; defense counsel testified he had discussed the evidence with the defendant, and they had `assessed everything'; and there is no suggestion that the defendant was not on notice of the charges contained in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 8. Citing specifically to Desrosier's statements at the plea hearing, the Appeals Court reasoned that \"as a matter of common sense, a discussion of `defenses' and the `pros and cons of having a trial' would not take place in isolation,\" but \"almost certainly would have referred to the elements of the crimes to which the defenses would be advanced.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6-7. The court ruled that, as such, the record demonstrated that Desrosiers had been advised of the elements of the offense as required by <i>Henderson v. Morgan,</i> 426 U.S. 637, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976). 778 N.E.2d at 5-6.</p>\n<p>After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his application for further appellate review, 438 Mass. 1104, 782 N.E.2d 515 (2003), Desrosier filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, claiming that the decision of the Appeals Court amounted to an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d) (2007) (\"AEDPA\"). The petition was referred to a magistrate judge, <i>id.</i> ยง 636(b)(1)(B) (2007), who recommended that it be denied. The magistrate judge determined that the Appeals Court had not unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent when it held \"that discussions between [Desrosier] and his lawyer necessarily included advice concerning elements of the crime with which [Desrosier] was charged,\" and that \"although reasonable minds could disagree as to the [Appeals Court's] findings of fact, those findings are not unreasonable in light of the record which was available to [it]\" (footnote omitted). <i>Desrosier v. Bissonette,</i> No. 03-40194, slip op. at 10-11, 12 (D.Mass. Dec. 19, 2005).</p>\n<p>The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation over Desrosier's objections. The court reasoned that, because the elements of second-degree murder \"are neither complex nor esoteric . . . it is hardly unbridled conjecture to draw the inference that, in the course of assessing and discussing `everything' about the case, [Desrosier] was made aware by counsel that the Commonwealth had to prove he intended to cause the victim's death.\" <i>Desrosier v. Bissonette,</i> No. 03-40194, slip op. at 6, 7 (D.Mass. Sept. 19, 2006). (footnote omitted). Desrosier then applied for, and was granted, a certificate of appealability on the issues of whether the Appeals Court's decision involved an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent or an unreasonable determination of the facts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>In considering an appeal from a denial of a petition for habeas corpus, we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Furr v. Brady,</i> 440 F.3d 34, 36-37 (1st Cir.2006). Under AEDPA, a federal court cannot grant habeas relief \"with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\" unless the state court decision (1) \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" or (2) \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d). We agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that the Appeals Court's decision suffers from neither of these infirmities.</p>\n<p>\"A guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and is valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. . . . Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime's elements, this standard is not met and the plea is invalid.\" <i>Bradshaw v. Stumpf,</i> 545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005) (citing <i>Henderson,</i> 426 U.S. at 647, 96 S.Ct. 2253). As the Appeals Court noted, this rule does not require the judge who took the plea to have explained the elements of the offense to the defendant, provided that the record adequately reflects that defense counsel did so. <i>Id.</i> The record need not, however, contain defense counsel's explicit affirmation to that effect. \"[E]ven without such an express representation, it may be appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\" <i>Henderson,</i> 426 U.S. at 647, 96 S.Ct. 2253.</p>\n<p>Contrary to Desrosier's contention, the Appeals Court did not unreasonably apply these federal constitutional rules for a valid guilty plea. While the court did not invoke, by name, a \"presumption\" that defense counsel had explained the elements of second-degree murder to Desrosier, its reasoning was entirely consistent with that aspect of <i>Henderson.</i> Based on Desrosier's admissions at the plea hearing that he had discussed the \"defenses\" and the \"pros and cons of having a trial\" with his former attorney, as well as on the attorney's testimony at the motion hearing that he and his client had \"discussed\" and \"assessed everything,\" the Appeals Court concluded that defense counsel had informed Desrosier of the elements of the charge of second-degree murder.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Massachusetts v. Desrosier,</i> 778 N.E.2d at 5-7. Given that the Supreme Court has never required defense counsel to say outright that he or she has discussed the elements of the crime with the defendant in order for a constitutionally valid plea to result ย indeed, <i>Henderson</i> in applying the presumption holds to the contrary ย the Appeals Court did not unreasonably apply federal law.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Though Desrosier does not argue that the Appeals Court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts, that idea permeated both his brief and oral argument in this case. In particular, he objects to what he sees as the Appeals Court's essentially discarding the motion court's finding that his prior attorney did not, in fact, inform him of the elements of second-degree murder. We see things differently. The Appeals Court simply disagreed with the motion court about the legal significance of the fact that defense counsel did not expressly state that he recited the elements to Desrosier. In any event, federal courts cannot grant habeas relief based on mere disagreements with how a state court conducts its appellate review. In other words, \"state-court judgments must be upheld unless, after the closest examination of the state-court judgment, a federal court is firmly convinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 388, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (plurality opinion). We are unconvinced that anything approaching the unconstitutional happened here.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to the extent that the Appeals Court did resolve any facts in overturning the Superior Court's decision, Desrosier has the burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that those factual determinations were unreasonable. 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(e)(1). He has not done so. Indeed, he has never come forward with any evidence to contradict his former attorney's version of events or to negate the inference that they did in fact discuss the elements of second-degree murder. It is not enough for him simply to argue for the contrary inference at this point. The district court properly dismissed Desrosier's petition.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The difference is that there is no parole from a sentence for first-degree murder. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, ยง 2 (2000).</p>\n<p>[2]  When Desrosier filed the motion, he was proceeding pro se and asserted a number of different grounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of counsel. This claim was withdrawn, however, by Desrosier's counsel at the motion hearing.</p>\n<p>[3]  Lending further support to the Appeals Court's decision, as the district court noted, is the fact that the elements of second-degree murder are not difficult to explain or understand. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cotal-Crespo,</i> 47 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1995) (\"the method for determining the defendant's understanding of the charge will vary from case to case depending on the complexity of the charges, the capacity of the defendant, and the attendant circumstances\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Relying on <i>North Carolina v. Alford,</i> 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), Desrosier argues that, because he did not expressly admit to acts constituting second-degree murder but merely stated that he had no reason to doubt the Commonwealth's version of facts, his counsel was required to explain the elements of <i>both</i> first- and second-degree murder to him. We have our doubts as to Desroiser's premise, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Tunning,</i> 69 F.3d 107, 111 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that <i>Alford</i> applies only when the defendant pleads guilty while asserting his innocence, not merely while refusing to admit the acts constituting the crime), but, in any event, we disagree with his conclusion. Though the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has arguably read <i>Alford</i> to require that a defendant understand the elements of both the crime with which he was charged and the crime to which he pleaded guilty, <i>Massachusetts v. Nikas,</i> 431 Mass. 453, 727 N.E.2d 1166, 1169-70 (2000), we do not read <i>Alford</i> so rigidly, and Desrosier does not cite any federal court decision, let alone any Supreme Court decision, that does. <i>Cf. </i><i>Allard v. Helgemoe,</i> 572 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1978) (\"<i>Alford</i> holds that a court may constitutionally accept a plea of guilty from a defendant who continues to protest his innocence\"). By rejecting Desrosier's <i>Alford</i> argument, then, the Appeals Court did not unreasonably apply federal law.</p>\n\n</div>",

Desrosier appeals from the district court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he did not knowingly or intelligently plead guilty to second-degree murder in Massachusetts Superior Court because he had not been adequately informed of the elements of the offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p>Desrosier was indicted on one count each of first- and second-degree murder for killing a young woman in Worcester in April 1990. As related by the Commonwealth at the plea hearing, the evidence against him included the testimony of an acquaintance that a foursome consisting of himself, Desrosier, the victim, and another, underage, girl had obtained vodka and beer on the day of the killing and had gone up to the roof of a defunct railroad terminal to drink it. At some point, Desrosier and the victim were left alone. When the acquaintance returned, over Desrosier's protest, he saw that the victim's prone and unclad body was engulfed in flames. Desrosier then stated that he had killed the victim because she had refused to have sex with him.</p>\n<p>The acquaintance fled the scene but later returned with the police, who found the victim's body on a lower section of the roof of the terminal, nineteen feet below an opening on the level where Desrosier had last been seen. The Commonwealth also recounted the statements of a number of other people who had interacted with Desrosier in the wake of the murder. Their proffered testimony was that Desrosier had blood on his clothing and hands which he acknowledged was another person's blood, and that Desrosier told them that he had just killed someone. The police also retrieved clothing from Desrosier's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> home with stains matching the victim's blood type.</p>\n<p>At the plea hearing, Desrosier conceded that he had no reason to doubt that the killing had occurred in the manner described but explained that he had no independent recollection of the events of that evening because he had \"blacked out\" from drinking. Desrosier, who described himself at the time as a twenty-three year-old high-school graduate, also testified that he understood the difference between the sentences for first- and second-degree murder with respect to parole.<sup>[1]</sup> He further stated that his lawyer had discussed with him the Commonwealth's evidence, \"the defenses [he] could raise and the other things [he] could do if [he] had a trial,\" and \"the pros and cons of having a trial, as opposed to entering a plea of guilty.\" His counsel, with whom Desrosier said he was satisfied, added that Desrosier had been given copies of the police reports prepared as part of the murder investigation as well as a transcript of the probable cause hearing, which he had \"reviewed . . . many times.\" The Superior Court accepted Desrosier's plea to second-degree murder and sentenced him to a mandatory term of life in prison.</p>\n<p>Some five years later, Desrosier moved to withdraw his plea, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that he had not been sufficiently informed of the elements of first- or second-degree murder.<sup>[2]</sup> A different Superior Court justice from the one who had taken the plea held an evidentiary hearing, at which Desrosier was represented by different counsel. At this hearing, Desrosier called as a witness his former defense attorney, who testified that, prior to the entry of the plea, the two of them had \"assessed everything, and we discussed it,\" including the police and autopsy reports, the probable cause hearing, the main witnesses, and defense counsel's investigation. Desrosier did not testify.</p>\n<p>The Superior Court granted the motion, ruling that \"because there is no record that the defendant was ever specifically informed of the elements of murder in the first or second degree, including the requisite level of intent needed to commit such crimes, the defendant's plea was not freely and understandingly made.\" <i>Massachusetts v. Desrosier,</i> No. 90-2097, slip op. at 10 (Mass.Super.Ct. Nov. 7, 2000). Specifically, the court found that the judge who took the plea \"failed to discuss any of the elements of the murder charges, including intent, in his colloquy even after the defendant claimed he had a `blackout.'\" <i>Id.</i> The court also concluded that Desrosier's statements at the plea hearing were \"not specific enough to demonstrate that [he] was fully informed of the elements of the crime.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth appealed this decision to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, which reversed. <i>Massachusetts v.

We have our doubts as to Desroiser's premise, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Tunning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706946\"><a href=\"/opinion/706946/united-states-v-ronald-l-tunning/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 111 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that <i>Alford</i> applies only when the defendant pleads guilty while asserting his innocence, not merely while refusing to admit the acts constituting the crime), but, in any event, we disagree with his conclusion. Though the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has arguably read <i>Alford</i> to require that a defendant understand the elements of both the crime with which he was charged and the crime to which he pleaded guilty, <i>Massachusetts v. Nikas,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span>, 1169-70 (2000), we do not read <i>Alford</i> so rigidly, and Desrosier does not cite any federal court decision, let alone any Supreme Court decision, that does. <i>Cf. </i><i>Allard v. Helgemoe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353898\"><a href=\"/opinion/353898/donald-a-allard-v-raymond-a-helgemoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1978) (\"<i>Alford</i> holds that a court may constitutionally accept a plea of guilty from a defendant who continues to protest his innocence\"). By rejecting Desrosier's <i>Alford</i> argument, then, the Appeals Court did not unreasonably apply federal law.</p>\n\n</div>",
