Marlin Turner appeals a\n\nSentencing Guidelines ruling relating to his criminal history\n\nscore, which took into account a prior juvenile adjudication in\n\nTennessee.    Although     he   filed        a   notice   of   appeal    from    the\n\nadjudication, it was neither pursued by Turner nor by the State.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n           While a minor living in Franklin County, Tennessee, in\n\n1998, Turner ran away from a juvenile offender program, and was\n\nsubsequently arrested and arraigned in Franklin County Juvenile\n\nCourt for theft and possession of a firearm.               While detained in a\n\njuvenile facility in Rhea County, Tennessee, pending trial on these\n\ncharges,   Turner    vandalized    and       attempted    to   set   fire   to   his\n\ndetention cell.      Consequently, a second delinquency petition was\n\nlodged against him in the Rhea County Juvenile Court.                   Meanwhile,\n\nTurner had been adjudicated delinquent on the pending theft and\n\nfirearm charges in Franklin County, where he was committed to a\n\njuvenile detention facility for an indefinite term.\n\n           On May 28, 1998, Turner appeared in Rhea County Juvenile\n\nCourt for a bench trial on the pending arson charges.                 An attorney\n\nwho had never handled a criminal delinquency case was appointed to\n\nrepresent him.      The court-appointed counsel consulted with Turner\n\nbefore the bench trial commenced, and Turner executed a written\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fstatement acknowledging his various procedural rights at trial,\n\nincluding the right to remain silent, to be represented by counsel,\n\nto review a copy of the charges against him, to present evidence in\n\nhis own behalf, to cross-examine the State’s witnesses, and to\n\n“appeal” from any adverse judgment, viz., to receive a de novo jury\n\ntrial in the circuit court.               Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 37-1-121 to 129,\n\n159(a).1         Following the hearing, Turner was found delinquent,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, then sentenced to an indeterminate\n\ncommitment to a juvenile detention program, which was to run\n\nconcurrently with the earlier Franklin County sentence.\n\n              Under the State’s two-tier trial system, a defendant may\n\nopt   for    a     bench   trial     in   the   juvenile   court,   with   somewhat\n\ncurtailed procedural protections, after which he may opt to appeal\n\nto the circuit court for a de novo jury trial.                       Accordingly,\n\nTurner's counsel submitted a timely notice of appeal from the Rhea\n\nCounty judgment.           The district attorney informed Turner’s counsel\n\nthat the State would decide whether to proceed with the Rhea County\n\nappeal once the circuit court had ruled upon Turner’s pending\n\nappeal      from    the    earlier    Franklin    County   adjudication.      When\n\nTurner’s counsel learned that the circuit court had denied that\n\npending appeal, he concluded that the State would not pursue the\n\n\n\n      1\n      Although the state statute utilizes the label “appeal,” the\ncircuit court is not an appellate tribunal, but rather a de novo\ntrial court. Hereinafter, we employ the term “appeal” exclusively\nin this specialized sense.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fRhea County appeal, inasmuch as the sentences imposed under both\n\njudgments were to run concurrently.          For some undisclosed reason,\n\nhowever, the circuit court never scheduled Turner’s Rhea County\n\nappeal for a de novo trial.\n\n           While in juvenile detention, Turner threatened to kill\n\nPresident Clinton and the Clinton family.            Upon reaching age 18,\n\nTurner was tried in federal district court and found guilty of that\n\noffense.     Subsequently,    while   in     custody   for   violating    his\n\nsupervised release, Turner assaulted a correctional officer, and\n\nwas   convicted.     The   presentence     report    recommended   that   the\n\ndistrict court include the two Tennessee juvenile adjudications in\n\nits calculation of Turner’s criminal history category (\"CHC\") under\n\nthe Guidelines.    Whereupon, Turner objected on the ground that the\n\nconcurrent sentence imposed on his Rhea County conviction was\n\nneither final nor reliable, since the circuit court never acted\n\nupon his pending notice of appeal.         The district court denied the\n\nobjection and determined that both juvenile convictions should be\n\nconsidered   in    calculating    Turner’s    CHC.     On    appeal,   Turner\n\nchallenges this aspect of the sentencing determination.\n\n                                     II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n           The district court’s ruling on Turner’s CHC is subject to\n\nde novo review. See United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont, 268 F.3d 8,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2001).     The Guidelines require that we consider “any\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by\n\nguilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not\n\npart of the [] offense [of conviction],”     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a),\n\nwhich encompasses sentences imposed in juvenile adjudications, see\n\nid. § 4A1.2(d); Gonzalez-Arimont, 268 F.3d at 14.\n\n          Turner premises this appeal upon our decision in United\n\nStates v. Florentino, 385 F.3d 60 (1st Cir. 2004) (involving\n\nMassachusetts’ two-tier trial system). Like Tennessee, at one time\n\nMassachusetts had a two-tier trial system, pursuant to which\n\ncriminal defendants were accorded a first-level bench trial with\n\nmore limited procedural safeguards, as well as the right to lodge\n\nan appeal for a de novo jury trial.    Unlike Tennessee, however,\n\nMassachusetts provided that the defendant’s submission of a notice\n\nof appeal served immediately and automatically to vacate the first-\n\ntier conviction for most purposes.     Id. at 63.2    In contrast,\n\nTennessee law expressly provides that the filing of a notice of\n\nappeal does not, in any sense, vacate the first-tier conviction.\n\nSee Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-159(b) (“An appeal does not suspend the\n\norder of the juvenile court.”); Anglin v. Mitchell, 596 S.W.2d 779,\n\n789-90 (Tenn. 1980).\n\n          In affirming the district court decision to consider\n\nFlorentino’s first-tier conviction under the Guidelines, we noted\n\n\n     2\n      Nevertheless, even then we noted that the Massachusetts\ncourts did not treat the first-tier conviction as a “nullity for\nall purposes.” Id.\n\n                               -5-\n\fthat notwithstanding the labels employed by the state courts – that\n\nthe notice of appeal “vacates” the first-tier conviction (viz., as\n\nif it had never been entered) – in actuality the appeal merely\n\nrendered that conviction conditionally dormant (viz., subject to\n\nreinstatement in the event the defendant, for example, withdrew or\n\nfailed to prosecute his appeal).              Florentino, 385 F.3d at 63\n\n(describing the first-tier conviction as “half asleep”).                  Turning\n\nto the Guidelines’ commentary, the Florentino panel observed that\n\nvacated   convictions   are    to    be   counted    unless     their     vacation\n\nresulted from some legal error or newly discovered evidence,\n\nwhereas all other vacated convictions should be counted unless\n\n“expunged,” viz., treated as if a nullity ab initio.                  Id. at 64.\n\nThe vacating of the Florentino first-tier conviction was neither\n\nthe result of legal error nor newly discovered evidence (but merely\n\nthe filing of a notice of appeal), and the conviction was simply\n\ndormant, rather than expunged.        Id.\n\n           Furthermore,   we    noted       that   even    if   the     Guidelines\n\ncommentary adverted primarily to actual appellate reversals and\n\nexpungements and did not anticipate the effects of an “appeal” in\n\nan   idiosyncratic   two-tier       trial    system,      see   supra    note   1,\n\nSentencing Guidelines policy plainly suggested that the Florentino\n\nfirst-tier conviction should be counted in assessing his criminal\n\nhistory. Given that the two-tier system accords defendants a right\n\nof appeal, as a counterweight to the more circumscribed procedural\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprotections prescribed in a first-tier bench trial, “it is hard to\n\nsee why a defendant who is convicted at the first tier and walks\n\naway from a lodged appeal should not be treated as ‘convicted’ for\n\nGuidelines purposes.”    Florentino, 385 F.3d at 64-65 (noting that\n\ndefendant must bear the burden to show “good reason” why his\n\nabandonment of the appeal should not be held against him).            As\n\nFlorentino’s failure to appear at his de novo trial was left wholly\n\nunexplained, the first-tier conviction was properly counted under\n\nthe Guidelines.    Id. at 65.\n\n          Turner maintains that the Tennessee first-tier proceeding\n\nis somehow less procedurally sufficient than the corresponding\n\nproceeding   in   Massachusetts,   hence   his   first-tier   conviction\n\nconstituted an inherently less reliable indicium of guilt.          The\n\nsole support offered for this contention is the state statute which\n\nprescribes that the first-tier proceeding is to be “conducted by\n\nthe court without a jury, in an informal but orderly manner.”\n\nTenn. Code. Ann. § 37-1-124(a) (emphasis added). However, the fact\n\nthat the proceeding is “informal” discloses little about the\n\nadequacy vel non of the particular procedural safeguards accorded\n\nthe defendant.\n\n          The record discloses that, after consulting with counsel,\n\nTurner voluntarily and knowingly signed an acknowledgment of his\n\nrights, including the right to remain silent, to be represented by\n\ncounsel, to review a copy of the charges against him, to present\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fevidence   in   his   own    behalf   and   to   cross-examine      the   State’s\n\nwitnesses, and to “appeal” from an adverse judgment, viz., to\n\nreceive a de novo jury trial in the circuit court.             Tenn. Code Ann.\n\n§§   37-1-121   to    129,   159.     Turner      identifies   no    additional\n\nprocedural safeguard (e.g., the right to formal discovery or to\n\nfull motion practice) which was accorded Florentino under the\n\nMassachusetts system.\n\n           By their very nature, these first-tier proceedings are\n\nadministratively streamlined, see Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104,\n\n114 (1972), and if the defendant thus has somewhat less than the\n\nusual incentive to present his full case at this preliminary stage,\n\nany such procedural limitations are fully mitigated by the right to\n\na de novo trial at the second tier.              See Justices of Boston Mun.\n\nCourt v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294, 310 (1984); Florentino, 385 F.3d at\n\n62-63.   Absent evidence of any particular and palpable procedural\n\ndeficiencies in the juvenile hearing, Turner has not distinguished\n\nhis case from Florentino in this respect.              Finally, inasmuch as\n\nTurner was represented by counsel, his argument constitutes an\n\nimpermissible collateral attack on a state court conviction based\n\nupon alleged procedural deficiencies. See United States v. Fraser,\n\n388 F.3d 371, 375 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Even if the procedures used by\n\nthe state court were somehow deficient, that would not warrant\n\ndiscounting the disposition . . . absent a claim, not made here,\n\nthat the defendant was entirely without counsel.”).\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f               Turner next contends that while Florentino willfully\n\nfailed    to    appear    at    his     de    novo   trial,   Turner’s         first-tier\n\nconviction      remained       extant    through      no   fault    of   his    own,   and\n\naccordingly it was the State which failed to follow up on his\n\ntimely appeal from the first-tier conviction.                      This contention is\n\nflawed as well.\n\n               First,    this    claim       is    entirely   based      upon    Turner's\n\ncounsel's alleged “understanding” that the State had affirmatively\n\nabandoned its efforts to impose the Rhea County sentence because,\n\nin the interim, the circuit court had affirmed the concurrent\n\nsentence on the Franklin County conviction, and thus the State\n\nwould obtain no practical benefit by pursuing the Rhea County\n\nappeal.    The record contains no support for counsel’s subjective\n\nunderstanding, however.\n\n               The State district attorney advised Turner’s counsel that\n\nhe would not decide whether to respond to the Rhea County appeal\n\nuntil after the Franklin County appeal had been concluded, but\n\nTurner's counsel never received notification that the district\n\nattorney had chosen not to respond.                    Instead, when the circuit\n\ncourt failed to docket or schedule a de novo trial, Turner’s\n\ncounsel simply assumed that the State had abandoned its efforts to\n\nmaintain the first-tier conviction.                  As the appellee, however, the\n\nState could not withdraw the appeal; rather, as the appellant, only\n\nTurner could do so.             Thus, all Turner reasonably could assume,\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fwithout further consultation with the circuit court clerk, would be\n\nthat, for some unidentified reason, the clerk had failed to docket\n\na de novo trial date.      Conceivably, such failure was due entirely\n\nto   administrative   oversight,3      yet     though      fully    aware     of   the\n\nomission,   Turner    presumably      failed    to       contact    the   clerk     to\n\ndetermine   the   status   of   his    notice       of    appeal.      See,    e.g.,\n\nChristopher v. Spooner, 640 S.W.2d 833, 836 (Tenn. App. 1982)\n\n(noting that parties should not be allowed to take advantage of a\n\nclerical oversight of which parties were fully aware). Thus, it is\n\nsimply inaccurate to suggest that Turner was faultless; as the\n\nappellant, he bore the burden to utilize all reasonable measures to\n\nprosecute his appeal.\n\n            The   Turner   default     is    more    consequential        than     the\n\nFlorentino default under the Massachusetts two-tier system, since\n\nTurner's first-tier conviction did not become dormant after the\n\nfiling of his notice of appeal, but remained in full effect.                       See\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-159(b) (“An appeal does not suspend the\n\norder of the juvenile court.”).             Consequently, Turner knew that\n\nmere filing of a notice of appeal did not undo his first-tier\n\nconviction, and that unless he could successfully prosecute an\n\n\n      3\n      Once again, insofar as the Turner contention would require us\nto speculate about the reason the appeal was not docketed, it\nrepresents an impermissible collateral attack upon the validity of\na state court conviction.    See Fraser, 388 F.3d at 375; United\nStates v. Burke, 67 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that such\ncollateral challenges “would hopelessly complicate sentencing under\nthe federal Guideline[s]”).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fappeal and win a de novo trial and acquittal, his first-tier\n\nconviction would remain fully intact and in effect.\n\n           Turner would have the court disregard this essential\n\ndifference between the Tennessee and Massachusetts systems, on the\n\nground   that   the   countability    of    a   prior   state   sentence   for\n\nGuidelines purposes constitutes a question of federal law.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2001).            However,\n\nthat may be, the manner in which \"state law treats an event in its\n\nown court system is relevant to deciding how to classify the event\n\nfor federal purposes.”      Florentino, 385 F.3d at 62.            Thus, the\n\nTurner decision to allow the first-tier conviction to remain intact\n\nbrings his case squarely within the failure-to-prosecute rule cited\n\nin Florentino.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f",

Turning to the Guidelines' commentary, the <i>Florentino</i> panel observed that vacated convictions are to be counted unless their vacation resulted from some legal error or newly discovered evidence, whereas all other vacated convictions should be counted unless \"expunged,\" <i>viz.,</i> treated as if a nullity <i>ab initio.

Given that the two-tier system accords defendants a right of appeal, as a counterweight to the more circumscribed procedural protections prescribed in a first-tier bench trial, \"it is hard to see why a defendant who is convicted at the first tier and walks away from a lodged appeal should not be treated as `convicted' for Guidelines purposes.\" <i>Florentino,</i> 385 F.3d at 64-65 (noting that defendant must bear the burden to show \"good reason\" why his abandonment of the appeal should not be held against him).

Ann. &#167; 37-1-124(a) (emphasis added). However, the fact that the proceeding is \"informal\" discloses little about the adequacy <i>vel non</i> of the particular procedural safeguards accorded the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record discloses that, after consulting with counsel, Turner voluntarily and knowingly signed an acknowledgment of his rights, including the right to remain silent, to be represented by counsel, to review a copy of the charges against him, to present evidence in his own behalf and to cross-examine the State's witnesses, and to \"appeal\" from an adverse judgment, <i>viz.,</i> to receive a <i>de novo</i> jury trial in the circuit court. Tenn.Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 37-1-121 to 129, 159. Turner identifies no additional procedural safeguard (<i>e.g.,</i> the right to formal discovery or to full motion practice) which was accorded Florentino under the Massachusetts system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By their very nature, these first-tier proceedings are administratively streamlined, <i>see Colten v.

Absent evidence of any particular and palpable procedural deficiencies in the juvenile hearing, Turner has not distinguished his case from <i>Florentino</i> in this respect. Finally, inasmuch as Turner was represented by counsel, his argument constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on a state court conviction based upon alleged procedural deficiencies. <i>See United States v. Fraser,</i> 388 F.3d 371, 375 (1st Cir.2004) (\"Even if the procedures used by the state court were somehow deficient, that would not warrant discounting the disposition ... absent a claim, not made here, that the defendant was entirely without counsel.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner next contends that while Florentino willfully failed to appear at his <i>de novo</i> trial, Turner's first-tier conviction remained extant through no fault of his own, and accordingly it was the State which failed to follow up on his timely appeal from the first-tier conviction. This contention is flawed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this claim is entirely based upon Turner's counsel's alleged \"understanding\" that the State had affirmatively abandoned its efforts to impose the Rhea County sentence because, in the interim, the circuit court had affirmed the concurrent sentence on the Franklin County conviction, and thus the State would obtain no practical benefit by pursuing the Rhea County appeal. The record contains no support for counsel's subjective understanding, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State district attorney advised Turner's counsel that he would not decide whether to respond to the Rhea County appeal until after the Franklin County appeal had been concluded, but Turner's counsel never received notification that the district attorney had chosen not to respond. Instead, when the circuit court failed to docket or schedule a <i>de novo</i> trial, Turner's counsel simply assumed that the State had abandoned its efforts to maintain the first-tier conviction. As the appellee, however, the State could not withdraw the appeal; rather, as the appellant, only Turner could do so. Thus, all Turner reasonably could assume, without further consultation with the circuit court clerk, would be that, for some unidentified reason, the clerk had failed to docket a <i>de novo</i> trial date. Conceivably, such failure was due entirely to administrative oversight,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> yet though fully aware of the omission, Turner presumably failed to contact the clerk to determine the status of his notice of appeal. <i>See, e.g., Christopher v. Spooner,</i> 640 S.W.2d 833, 836 (Tenn.App.1982) (noting that parties should not be allowed to take advantage of a clerical oversight of which parties were fully aware). Thus, it is simply inaccurate to suggest that Turner was faultless; as the appellant, he bore the burden to utilize all reasonable measures to prosecute his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Turner default is more consequential than the Florentino default under the Massachusetts two-tier system, since Turner's first-tier conviction did not become dormant after the filing of his notice of appeal, but remained in full effect. <i>See</i> Tenn.Code Ann. &#167; 37-1-159(b) (\"An appeal does not suspend the order of the juvenile court.\"). Consequently, Turner knew that mere filing of a notice of appeal did not undo his first-tier conviction, and that unless he could successfully prosecute an appeal and win a <i>de novo</i> trial and acquittal, his first-tier conviction would remain fully intact and in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner would have the court disregard this essential difference between the Tennessee and Massachusetts systems, on the ground that the countability of a prior state sentence for Guidelines purposes constitutes a question of federal law. <i>See United States v. Mateo,</i> 271 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2001). However, that may be, the manner in which \"state law treats an event in its own court system is relevant to deciding how to classify the event for federal purposes.\" <i>Florentino,</i> 385 F.3d at 62. Thus, the Turner decision to allow the first-tier conviction to remain intact brings his case squarely within the failure-to-prosecute rule cited in <i>Florentino.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the state statute utilizes the label \"appeal,\" the circuit court is not an appellate tribunal, but rather a<i>de novo</i> trial court.

Although he filed a notice of appeal from the adjudication, it was neither pursued by Turner nor by the State. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a minor living in Franklin County, Tennessee, in 1998, Turner ran away from a juvenile offender program, and was subsequently arrested and arraigned in Franklin County Juvenile Court for theft and possession of a firearm. While detained in a juvenile facility in Rhea County, Tennessee, pending trial on these charges, Turner vandalized and attempted to set fire to his detention cell. Consequently, a second delinquency petition was lodged against him in the Rhea County Juvenile Court. Meanwhile, Turner had been adjudicated delinquent on the pending theft and firearm charges in Franklin County, where he was committed to a juvenile detention facility for an indefinite term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1998, Turner appeared in Rhea County Juvenile Court for a bench trial on the pending arson charges. An attorney who had never handled a criminal delinquency case was appointed to represent him. The court-appointed counsel consulted with Turner before the bench trial commenced, and Turner executed a written statement acknowledging his various procedural rights at trial, including the right to remain silent, to be represented by counsel, to review a copy of the charges against him, to present evidence in his own behalf, to cross-examine the State's witnesses, and to \"appeal\" from any adverse judgment, <i>viz.,</i> to receive a <i>de novo</i> jury trial in the circuit court. Tenn.Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 37-1-121 to 129, 159(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following the hearing, Turner was found delinquent, beyond a reasonable doubt, then sentenced to an indeterminate commitment to a juvenile detention program, which was to run concurrently with the earlier Franklin County sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the State's two-tier trial system, a defendant may opt for a bench trial in the juvenile court, with somewhat curtailed procedural protections, after which he may opt to appeal to the circuit court for a <i>de</i> <i>novo</i> jury trial. Accordingly, Turner's counsel submitted a timely notice of appeal from the Rhea County judgment. The district attorney informed Turner's counsel that the State would decide whether to proceed with the Rhea County appeal once the circuit court had ruled upon Turner's pending appeal from the earlier Franklin County adjudication. When Turner's counsel learned that the circuit court had denied that pending appeal, he concluded that the State would not pursue the Rhea County appeal, inasmuch as the sentences imposed under both judgments were to run concurrently. For some undisclosed reason, however, the circuit court never scheduled Turner's Rhea County appeal for a <i>de novo</i> trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in juvenile detention, Turner threatened to kill President Clinton and the Clinton family. Upon reaching age 18, Turner was tried in federal district court and found guilty of that offense. Subsequently, while in custody for violating his supervised release, Turner assaulted a correctional officer, and was convicted. The presentence report recommended that the district court include the two Tennessee juvenile adjudications in its calculation of Turner's criminal history category (\"CHC\") under the Guidelines. Whereupon, Turner objected on the ground that the concurrent sentence imposed on his Rhea County conviction was neither final nor reliable, since the circuit court never acted upon his pending notice of appeal. The district court denied the objection and determined that both juvenile convictions should be considered in calculating Turner's CHC. On appeal, Turner challenges this aspect of the sentencing determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's ruling on Turner's CHC is subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See United States v.

The record contains no support for counsel's subjective understanding, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State district attorney advised Turner's counsel that he would not decide whether to respond to the Rhea County appeal until after the Franklin County appeal had been concluded, but Turner's counsel never received notification that the district attorney had chosen not to respond. Instead, when the circuit court failed to docket or schedule a <i>de novo</i> trial, Turner's counsel simply assumed that the State had abandoned its efforts to maintain the first-tier conviction. As the appellee, however, the State could not withdraw the appeal; rather, as the appellant, only Turner could do so. Thus, all Turner reasonably could assume, without further consultation with the circuit court clerk, would be that, for some unidentified reason, the clerk had failed to docket a <i>de novo</i> trial date. Conceivably, such failure was due entirely to administrative oversight,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> yet though fully aware of the omission, Turner presumably failed to contact the clerk to determine the status of his notice of appeal. <i>See, e.g., Christopher v. Spooner,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></span>, 836 (Tenn.App.1982) (noting that parties should not be allowed to take advantage of a clerical oversight of which parties were fully aware). Thus, it is simply inaccurate to suggest that Turner was faultless; as the appellant, he bore the burden to utilize all reasonable measures to prosecute his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Turner default is more consequential than the Florentino default under the Massachusetts two-tier system, since Turner's first-tier conviction did not become dormant after the filing of his notice of appeal, but remained in full effect. <i>See</i> Tenn.Code Ann. &#167; 37-1-159(b) (\"An appeal does not suspend the order of the juvenile court.\"). Consequently, Turner knew that mere filing of a notice of appeal did not undo his first-tier conviction, and that unless he could successfully prosecute an appeal and win a <i>de novo</i> trial and acquittal, his first-tier conviction would remain fully intact and in effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner would have the court disregard this essential difference between the Tennessee and Massachusetts systems, on the ground that the countability of a prior state sentence for Guidelines purposes constitutes a question of federal law. <i>See United States v. Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199671\"><a href=\"/opinion/199671/united-states-v-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2001). However, that may be, the manner in which \"state law treats an event in its own court system is relevant to deciding how to classify the event for federal purposes.\" <i>Florentino,</i> 385 F.3d at 62. Thus, the Turner decision to allow the first-tier conviction to remain intact brings his case squarely within the failure-to-prosecute rule cited in <i>Florentino.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the state statute utilizes the label \"appeal,\" the circuit court is not an appellate tribunal, but rather a<i>de novo</i> trial court. Hereinafter, we employ the term \"appeal\" exclusively in this specialized sense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Nevertheless, even then we noted that the Massachusetts courts did not treat the first-tier conviction as a \"nullity for all purposes.\"<i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Once again, insofar as the Turner contention would require us to speculate about the reason the appeal was not docketed, it represents an impermissible collateral attack upon the validity of a state court conviction<i>See Fraser,</i> 388 F.3d at 375; <i>United States v.
