This appeal arises from an\n\nadministrative decision by the Secretary of the Interior to take\n\ninto trust a 31-acre parcel of land located in Charlestown, Rhode\n\nIsland (\"the Parcel\")1 for the benefit of the Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe of Rhode Island.         Plaintiffs-appellants Donald L. Carcieri,\n\nGovernor of Rhode Island, the State of Rhode Island, and the Town\n\nof Charlestown, Rhode Island (\"the State\") brought suit against\n\ndefendants-appellees Gale A. Norton, Secretary of the United States\n\nDepartment    of     the   Interior,    and   Franklin   Keel,      Eastern   Area\n\nDirector, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior\n\n(\"the Secretary\") seeking to enjoin the decision as contrary to the\n\nIndian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. § 461 et seq., the Rhode\n\nIsland Indian Claims Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., the\n\nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, and for alleged\n\nviolations of various provisions of the United States Constitution.\n\nThe parties issued cross-motions for summary judgment and the\n\ndistrict     court    denied    the    State's      motion   and    granted      the\n\nSecretary's motion.          The State now appeals the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n           The Narragansetts were aboriginal inhabitants of what is\n\nnow Rhode Island.          See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Nat'l Indian\n\n\n\n1\n    The parcel is known as             Assessor's     Plat   117,    Lot   119   of\nCharlestown, Rhode Island.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fGaming   Comm'n,   158   F.3d   1335,   1336   (D.C.   Cir.    1998)    (citing\n\nWilliam G. McLoughlin, Rhode Island 4-5, 9-10 (1978)).                 In 1975,\n\nthe Narragansetts instituted two suits against the State of Rhode\n\nIsland, the Town of Charlestown and individual landowners to\n\nrecover 3200 acres of land in Charlestown.         Narragansett Tribe of\n\nIndians v. Southern R.I. Land Dev. Corp., 418 F. Supp. 798 (D.R.I.\n\n1976); Narragansett Tribe of Indians v. Murphy, 426 F. Supp. 132\n\n(D.R.I. 1976). The Tribe asserted that its aboriginal title to the\n\nland had not been extinguished because each of the defendants\n\ntraced his title back to an unlawful alienation of tribal land in\n\nviolation of the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 177, due to the lack of congressional approval of the sale.               See\n\nS. R.I. Land Dev. Corp., 418 F. Supp. at 802-3 (recounting the\n\nhistory of the dispute).\n\nA.   The Settlement Agreement\n\n           On February 28, 1978 the parties settled the lawsuits by\n\nentering an agreement, the terms of which were set out in a Joint\n\nMemorandum of Understanding (\"JMOU\") signed by the State, the\n\nTribe, the Town and others.         See State v. Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe, 19 F.3d 685, 689 (1st Cir. 1993); H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at\n\n25 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1948.               In the JMOU the\n\nState agreed to provide 900 acres of land to the Narragansetts, and\n\nthe parties agreed that the federal government would provide $3.5\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmillion for the acquisition of an additional 900 acres.2                   The\n\nresulting 1800 acres were to be held in trust for the benefit of\n\nthe tribe by a state-chartered entity, the Narragansett Indian Land\n\nManagement Corporation, which was created for this purpose.                The\n\nparties    further     agreed   \"[t]hat    Federal   legislation   shall    be\n\nobtained that eliminates all Indian claims of any kind, whether\n\npossessory, monetary or otherwise, involving land in Rhode Island,\n\nand effectively clears the titles of landowners in Rhode Island of\n\nany such claim.\"       JMOU para. 6; H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 25, 26;\n\nsee also 25 U.S.C. § 1708.        In addition, the parties agreed that\n\n\"except as otherwise specified in this Memorandum, all laws of the\n\nstate of Rhode Island shall be in full force and effect on the\n\nSettlement Lands, including but not limited to state and local\n\nbuilding, fire and safety codes.\"            JMOU ¶ 13; H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n\n1453, at 26; see also 25 U.S.C. § 1708.\n\n            Subsequently, both the United States Congress and the\n\nRhode Island General Assembly enacted the required implementing\n\nlegislation.     Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§   1701   et   seq.   (2000)   (effective    September   30,   1978)   (\"the\n\nSettlement Act\"); R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 37-18-1 to 37-18-15 (1997)\n\n(effective 1979).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  These federal funds were authorized and appropriated in 1978 and\nthe 900 acres of land was subsequently purchased.       25 U.S.C.\n§§ 1702(d), 1703, 1704, 1707, 1710 (1978).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           At the time of its lawsuits, the Narragansett community\n\nwas not a federally recognized tribe; rather, it was incorporated\n\nas a Rhode Island nonbusiness corporation known as the Narragansett\n\nTribe of Indians. In 1983, the Secretary formally acknowledged the\n\nNarragansett    Tribe      as   a   federally   recognized   tribe.     Final\n\nDetermination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (Feb. 2, 1983).\n\n           In 1985, the State transferred the Settlement Lands to\n\nthe   Tribe,   and   the    state-chartered     Narragansett   Indian   Land\n\nManagement Corporation that had held the land in trust on behalf of\n\nthe tribe was dissolved.            6A R.I. Gen. Laws 37-18-12 to 18-14.\n\nThen, in 1988, following application by the Tribe, the Settlement\n\nLands were taken into trust by the federal government pursuant to\n\nsection 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act (\"IRA\"),                   enacted\n\nJune 18, 1934, ch. 576, § 5, codified as 25 U.S.C. § 465 (2004).\n\nThe deed transferring the Settlement Lands to the Bureau of Indian\n\nAffairs (\"BIA\") expressly recognized that this transfer into trust\n\n\"does not alter the applicability of state law conferred by the\n\nRhode Island Indian Land Claims Settlement Act.\" In addition, this\n\ncourt has held, with some exceptions, that the Settlement Act\n\nallows State civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Settlement\n\nLands, although the Tribe has \"concurrent jurisdiction over, and\n\nexercise[s] governmental power with respect to, those lands.\"\n\nNarragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 913 (quoting Rhode Island v.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fNarragansett     Indian   Tribe,    19    F.3d   685,     689   (1st   Cir.   1994)\n\n(holding that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 2701-\n\n2721, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1166-1168, applies to the Settlement Lands)).\n\nB.   The Parcel\n\n           The 31-acre Parcel that is the subject of this dispute\n\nwas part of the 3200 acres that were claimed by the Tribe in the\n\n1976 lawsuits, but the Parcel did not become part of the 1800 acres\n\nof Settlement Lands.      Carcieri v. Norton, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167, 170\n\n(D.R.I. 2003). The Parcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but\n\nseparated from them by a town road.                Id. (citing Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe of R.I. v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d 908, 911\n\n(1st Cir. 1996)).    In 1991, the Parcel was purchased from a private\n\ndeveloper by the Narragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing Authority\n\n(the \"WHA\") for the purpose of constructing a housing complex. Id.\n\nThe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n(\"HUD\") recognized the WHA as an Indian Housing Authority and\n\nprovided   the    financing   for    the       purchase    of   the    Parcel   and\n\nconstruction of approximately fifty housing units on the site. Id.\n\nThe HUD funds were provided pursuant to the Indian Housing Act of\n\n1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437aa-ee, which was subsequently repealed by\n\nthe Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act\n\nof 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-330, 110 Stat. 4016 (codified as 25 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 4101-4243 (2004)).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f           In 1992, the WHA transferred the Parcel to the Tribe with\n\na deed restriction that the Parcel be placed in trust with the\n\nfederal government for the express purpose of providing housing for\n\ntribe   members.    Carcieri,    290    F.   Supp.    2d   at    171     (citing\n\nNarragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 911).\n\n           The Tribe and the WHA commenced construction of the\n\nhousing project without obtaining a building permit from the town\n\nor the state's approval of the individual sewage disposal systems\n\nserving the project.   Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 912.                  As\n\na result, the State of Rhode Island and Town of Charlestown sought\n\ninjunctive relief prohibiting the Narragansetts and the WHA from\n\nconstructing the housing complex without obtaining the proper\n\npermits and approvals.     Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett\n\nElec. Co., 878 F. Supp. 349 (D.R.I. 1995).             The District Court\n\nfound the proposed housing project detrimental to coastal and\n\ngroundwater   resources,   but   also   held   that    the      Parcel    was    a\n\n\"dependent Indian community\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1151\n\n(b) and therefore denied injunctive relief.            Id. at 355-57.           On\n\nappeal this court held that the land for the housing project was\n\nnot a \"dependent Indian community,\" because it lacked federal\n\nownership of the land and lacked federal action to \"set aside\" the\n\nland.   Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 914.            Thus, the Parcel\n\ncould not be considered Indian country under 18 U.S.C. § 1151, and\n\ntherefore the housing project being constructed on the site was not\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fexempt from state and local building and zoning restrictions.\n\nAccordingly, this court reversed the district court and directed\n\nthe district court to enter an order granting the injunction.   Id.\n\nat 922.\n\nC.   The Current Dispute\n\n           The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 authorizes the\n\nSecretary of the Interior to acquire lands in trust \"for the\n\npurpose of providing land for Indians.\"     25 U.S.C. § 465.    The\n\nTribe initially applied to have the United States take the 31-acre\n\nParcel into trust in 1993.   However, this application was held in\n\nabeyance while the Narragansett Elec. Co. litigation was pending.\n\nIn 1997, after the resolution of Narragansett Elec. Co. by this\n\ncourt in 1996, the Tribe submitted a second, updated application to\n\nthe Eastern Area Office of the BIA requesting trust acquisition of\n\nthe Parcel.   On March 6, 1998, the BIA informed the Tribe of its\n\ndecision to approve the Tribe’s application for trust acquisition\n\nof the Parcel.    Letter from Franklin Keel, Eastern Area Director,\n\nBIA, to Matthew Thomas, Chief Sachem, Narragansett Indian Tribe\n\n(Mar. 6, 1998).    In April 1998, the State and Town each appealed\n\nthe decision to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (the \"IBIA\").\n\nOn June 29, 2000, the IBIA affirmed the BIA's decision to take the\n\nland into trust.    Town of Charlestown v. E. Area Dir., Bureau of\n\nIndian Affairs, IBIA 98-88-A and 98-89-A, 35 IBIA 93 (2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            As the district court noted, the IBIA rejected the\n\nState's and Town's challenges to several determinations made by the\n\nBIA in accepting the Parcel into trust.\n\n            Specifically, the board concluded that the\n            Settlement Act did not prohibit the secretary\n            from acquiring lands other than the settlement\n            lands into trust for the benefit of the\n            Narragansetts.   35 IBIA 100-101.    Also, the\n            board rejected plaintiffs' argument that the\n            BIA,   either   in   all   trust   acquisition\n            proceedings, or in view of the specific\n            circumstances surrounding the tribe's trust\n            application, was required to consider the\n            possible use of the parcel for gaming purposes\n            under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"the\n            IGRA\"), 25 U.S.C. § 2701 et. seq., and to\n            impose a restriction precluding such use. 35\n            IBIA at 101-103.\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 172.        The IBIA further concluded that\n\nthe   BIA   was   not   required   to   prepare   a   federal   consistency\n\ndetermination for the proposed housing project as a prerequisite to\n\ntrust acquisition of the Parcel, and therefore the BIA did not\n\nviolate the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq.\n\n35 IBIA at 104-105.\n\n            The State then filed an action against the Secretary\n\nseeking reversal of the Secretary's decision and declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief.       In a detailed opinion, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment on behalf of the Secretary, upholding the\n\ndecision to take the Parcel into trust.\n\n            The State now appeals to this court.        The State alleges\n\nthat (1) the Secretary did not have the authority under the IRA to\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\facquire the land in trust for the benefit of the Narragansetts; (2)\n\nthe   IRA   constitutes   an   unlawful     delegation   of   congressional\n\nauthority and offends the Enclave Clause, the Admissions Clause,\n\nand the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution; (3) the Rhode Island\n\nIndian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1978 prohibits the creation of\n\nsovereign territory for the Narragansetts in Rhode Island; and (4)\n\nthe Secretary's acceptance of the Parcel into trust was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the APA\n\nand/or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\n\n                               II.   Analysis\n\n            A grant of summary judgment is appropriate when the\n\nevidence before the court shows that \"that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.               Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\"\n\nSeaboard Surety Co. v. Greenfield Middle Sch. Bldg. Comm., 370 F.3d\n\n215, 218 (1st Cir. 2004).            In ruling on a motion of summary\n\njudgment, a court must view \"the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.\" Barbour v. Dynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (citation omitted).           An issue is \"genuine\" for\n\npurposes of summary judgment if \"the evidence is such that a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\"\n\nand a \"material fact\" is one which \"might affect the outcome of the\n\nsuit under the governing law.\"        Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fF.3d 88, 90 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 447 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).   The standards are the same where,\n\nas here, both parties have moved for summary judgment. Bientkowski\n\nv. Northeastern Univ., 285 F.3d 138, 140 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\n\nCharles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720,\n\nat 335-36 (3d ed. 1998)).\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, and we may affirm the district court's decision on any\n\nsufficient ground supported by the record. Rodríguez v. Smithkline\n\nBeecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Our review of the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel\n\ninto trust is governed by § 706(2) of the Administrative Procedures\n\nAct, which provides that the reviewing court shall:\n\n          hold unlawful and set aside agency action,\n          findings, and conclusions found to be–-\n          (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n          discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n          with law;\n          (B) contrary to constitutional right, power,\n          privilege, or immunity;\n          (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction,\n          authority, or limitations, or short of\n          statutory right;\n          (D) without observance of procedure required\n          by law;\n          (E) unsupported by substantial evidence in a\n          case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this\n          title or otherwise reviewed on the record of\n          an agency hearing provided by statute; or\n          (F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent\n          that the facts are subject to trial de novo by\n          the reviewing court.\n          In making the foregoing determinations, the\n          court shall review the whole record or those\n          parts of it cited by a party, and due account\n\n                               -12-\n\f           shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial\n           error.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2).\n\nA.   The Secretary's Authority to accept the Parcel into trust\n\n           The State asserts that the Secretary lacked statutory\n\nauthority to take the Parcel into trust under the IRA, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465, because the Narragansett Indian Tribe is not entitled to the\n\nIRA's benefits. Under the IRA, \"[t]he Secretary of the Interior is\n\nauthorized, in his discretion, to acquire . . . any interest in\n\nlands, . . . including trust or otherwise restricted allotments\n\n. . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"      25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465.   The IRA defines the term \"Indian\" as:\n\n           all persons of Indian descent who are members\n           of any recognized Indian tribe now under\n           Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are\n           descendants of such members who were, on\n           June 1, 1934, residing within the present\n           boundaries of any Indian reservation, and\n           shall further include all other persons of\n           one-half or more Indian blood . . . .\n\n25 U.S.C. § 479 (emphasis added).     The State argues that the term\n\n\"now\" in § 479 should be read as meaning \"June 1934\" and not\n\n\"today.\"   Thus, the state suggests that a two-prong test must be\n\nmet for a tribe to be entitled to the benefits of § 465 of the IRA:\n\nunless the tribe was both (1) recognized and (2) under federal\n\njurisdiction in 1934, the State would have us find that the\n\nSecretary is not allowed to take the State land into trust for the\n\nbenefit of the tribe.    Since the Narragansett Tribe was neither\n\n\n                               -13-\n\ffederally recognized, nor under federal jurisdiction in June of\n\n1934 when the IRA was enacted, the State argues that the Tribe is\n\nnot entitled to the benefits of the IRA.                   We disagree, and find\n\nthat   the   Secretary's    authority        under   the    IRA   extends   to   the\n\nNarragansett Tribe, regardless of the status of its acknowledgment\n\nin 1934.\n\n             The Narragansett Indian Tribe was acknowledged by the\n\nDepartment    of    the   Interior     in    1983.       In   acknowledging      the\n\nNarragansett Tribe, the Department stated that \"the Narragansett\n\ncommunity and its predecessors have existed autonomously since\n\nfirst contact, despite undergoing many modifications.\"                        Final\n\nDetermination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177, 6178 (Feb. 10, 1983).\n\nIndeed, the government's formal acknowledgment noted that \"[t]he\n\ntribe has a documented history dating from 1614.\"                  Id.\n\n             We    find   that   the        Department      of    the    Interior's\n\nlongstanding interpretation of the term \"now\" in the statute should\n\nbe accorded particular deference.             See North Haven Bd. of Ed. v.\n\nBell, 456 U.S. 512, 522, n.12 (1982) (\"In construing a statute,\n\nthis Court normally accords great deference to the interpretation,\n\nparticularly when it is longstanding, of the agency charged with\n\nthe statute's administration.\"); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416\n\nU.S. 267, 274-75 (1974) (\"a court may accord great weight to the\n\nlongstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fcharged with its administration\"); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.\n\nFCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 (1969) (\"the construction of a statute by\n\nthose charged with its execution should be followed unless there\n\nare compelling indications that it is wrong.\").                For seventy years\n\nthe Department of the Interior has read \"now\" in Section 479 as\n\nmeaning \"today\" rather than \"1934.\"             Thus, to change this reading\n\nof the statute here would impact scores of trusts created for the\n\nbenefit of Indians over the last 70 years.\n\n           The State relies on two cases involving the unique\n\ncircumstances of the Mississippi Choctaw Indians to support its\n\nreading of the IRA, United States v. John, 437 U.S. 634, 650\n\n(1978); United States v. State Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d 633, 642 (5th\n\nCir. 1974).     Neither of these cases sufficiently supports the\n\nState's conclusion.\n\n           The Mississippi Choctaws' tribal status was extinguished\n\nin 1831 by the United States Senate's ratification of the Treaty of\n\nDancing Rabbit Creek.           Carcieri 290 F. Supp. 2d at 180 (citing\n\nState Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d at 640-43).                  After that time, the\n\nChoctaws did not maintain a tribal organization or manner of\n\nliving.   Thus, in 1934, when the IRA was enacted, \"the band was not\n\na tribe as defined by the IRA.\"           Id.    The Fifth Circuit therefore\n\nfound   that   the   IRA   of    1934   did    not   include    the   Mississippi\n\nChoctaws, and that even a 1944 Proclamation by the Department of\n\nInterior which \"purported to recognize the tribal organization of\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians,\" could not cure the Act's\n\nomission.      State Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d at 642-43.\n\n              However,    just     two   years    later,    the   Supreme   Court\n\ndisagreed with the Fifth Circuit and held in United States v. John\n\nthat the IRA of 1934 does apply to the Mississippi Choctaws.                     The\n\nSupreme Court's reasoning was as follows:\n\n              The Court of Appeals and the Mississippi\n              Supreme Court held, and the State now argues,\n              that the 1944 proclamation had no effect\n              because the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934\n              was not intended to apply to the Mississippi\n              Choctaws. Assuming for the moment that\n              authority for the proclamation can be found\n              only in the 1934 Act, we find this argument\n              unpersuasive. The 1934 Act defined \"Indians\"\n              not only as \"all persons of Indian descent who\n              are members of any recognized [in 1934] tribe\n              now under Federal jurisdiction,\" and their\n              descendants who then were residing on any\n              Indian reservation, but also as \"all other\n              persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\" 48\n              Stat. 988, 25 U.S.C. § 479 (1976 ed.). There\n              is no doubt that persons of this description\n              lived in Mississippi, and were recognized as\n              such by Congress and by the Department of the\n              Interior,   at    the   time   the   Act   was\n              passed. . . . The references to the\n              Mississippi   Choctaws   in  the   legislative\n              history of the Act . . . confirm our view that\n              the Mississippi Choctaws were not to be\n              excepted from the general operation of the\n              1934 Act.\n\nJohn, 437 U.S. at 649-50 (parenthetical in original).\n\n              In John, the Supreme Court concluded that the IRA may be\n\ninvoked   for    the     benefit   of    groups   of   Indians    that   were    not\n\nrecognized as tribes in 1934.            The Court focused on the fact that,\n\nwhile   the    Choctaws    were    not   a   federally     recognized    tribe    in\n\n                                         -16-\n\fMississippi at the time the IRA was enacted, there were individual\n\n\"persons of one-half or more Indian blood\" living in Mississippi at\n\nthe time, and both the state and federal government recognized that\n\nthe Indians were there.     Id. at 650.        This is distinctly different\n\nfrom the State's two-part test, which would require that an Indian\n\ntribe be both (1) recognized and (2) under federal jurisdiction at\n\nthe time of the Act's passage.3\n\n              While the parenthetical \"[in 1934]\" lends support to the\n\nState's assertion that \"now\" should be read as \"in 1934,\" we agree\n\nwith the district court that it does not appear that the reading of\n\nthis particular term in the IRA was before the Supreme Court for\n\nconsideration, and the Court did not give further explanation for\n\nthe inclusion of the parenthetical.\n\n              Notwithstanding   the   potential    support   found    for   the\n\nState's assertion in the Supreme Court's inclusion of \"[in 1934]\"\n\nin John, we find that Congress's recent clarification of the Indian\n\nReorganization Act makes clear that the Secretary has the authority\n\nto   extend    IRA   benefits   to    all    federally   recognized   tribes,\n\nregardless of their acknowledgment status on the date of the IRA's\n\nenactment.      In 1994, Congress enacted the Federally Recognized\n\nIndian Tribe List Act (\"List Act\"), Pub. L. No. 103-454, 108 Stat.\n\n\n\n3\n   The land at issue in John was taken into trust between 1934 and\n1944, thus, the authority for the Secretary's actions could not be\njustified on the basis of federal recognition, regardless of\nwhether \"now\" means \"in 1934\" or not.\n\n                                      -17-\n\f4791 (1994), which requires the Secretary of the Interior to keep\n\na list of all federally recognized tribes, which \"should reflect\n\nall of the federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States\n\nwhich are eligible for the special programs and services provided\n\nby   the   United   States   to   Indians      because   of   their   status   as\n\nIndians.\"     Pub. L. No. 103-454, § 103.         That statute, codified as\n\n25 U.S.C. § 479a, defines the term \"tribe\" as \"any Indian or Alaska\n\nNative tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village or community that the\n\nSecretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian\n\ntribe.\"     25 U.S.C. § 479a(2).         The House Report accompanying the\n\nList Act explains that federal recognition \"establishes tribal\n\nstatus for all federal purposes.\"              H.R. Rep. No. 103-781, at 3\n\n(1994).     Earlier the same year, Congress amended the IRA, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-263, 108 Stat. 707, to clarify that:\n\n             [d]epartments or agencies of the United States\n             shall not promulgate any regulation or make\n             any decision or determination pursuant to the\n             Act of June 18, 1934 . . . with respect to a\n             federally   recognized   Indian   tribe   that\n             classifies,   enhances,   or  diminishes   the\n             privileges and immunities available to the\n             Indian tribe relative to other federally\n             recognized tribes by virtue of their status as\n             Indian tribes.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 476(f), and that any such determination by a federal\n\nagency     that   would   have    the    effect   of     discriminating   among\n\nrecognized tribes, \"shall have no force or effect.\" 25 U.S.C. § 476\n\n(g).\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            The federal acknowledgment regulations pursuant to which\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe attained federal recognition echo these\n\nenactments. The regulations provide that \"[t]he newly acknowledged\n\ntribe shall be considered a historic tribe and shall be entitled to\n\nthe   privileges        and    immunities      available         to   other    federally\n\nrecognized       historic      tribes   by    virtue       of    their   government-to-\n\ngovernment relationship with the United States.\" 25 C.F.R. 83.12(a)\n\n(2004).\n\n            These statutory and regulatory provisions make clear that\n\nthe Secretary's IRA authority extends to the Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe regardless of the status of its acknowledgment in 1934.\n\nIndeed, these provisions preclude the Secretary from making the\n\ndetermination sought by the State, that the tribe is ineligible for\n\nthe benefits of § 465 of the IRA because it was acknowledged after\n\nthe enactment of the IRA.            Such a determination would diminish the\n\nTribe's   privileges          in   relation    to       other    federally    recognized\n\ntribes, contrary to the amended IRA's plain language.                         25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 476(f).\n\nB.    Constitutional Challenges to 25 U.S.C. § 465\n\n            The      State         raises     multiple           challenges      to     the\n\nconstitutionality of the IRA, including a charge that the authority\n\ngranted     to    the    Secretary      to     take       land    into   trust     is    an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of congressional powers and that taking\n\nState   land     into    trust      pursuant       to    the    IRA   diminishes      state\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fsovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment, the Enclave\n\nClause, and the Admissions Clause, and exceeds Congress's authority\n\nunder the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution.\n\n           1.     The Nondelegation Doctrine\n\n           The    State   contends     that    §   465    of   the    IRA   is   an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Secretary\n\nof the Interior because the only limitation it places on the\n\nSecretary's trust-taking authority is that the trust acquisition\n\nmust be \"for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"                25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465.     Thus, the State argues, Congress failed to articulate\n\nsufficient standards to guide the Secretary's trust determinations.\n\n           Article I, Section I, of the Constitution provides that\n\n\"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a\n\nCongress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and\n\nHouse of Representatives.\"       The Supreme Court has repeatedly said\n\nthat \"when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies\n\nCongress   must    'lay   down   by   legislative        act   an    intelligible\n\nprinciple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is\n\ndirected to conform.'\"      Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., 531\n\nU.S. 457, 472 (2001) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United\n\nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)).            The State contends that § 465\n\nlacks the required \"intelligible principle.\"\n\n           The statute provides that:\n\n           The Secretary of the Interior is authorized,\n           in his discretion, to acquire, through\n\n                                      -20-\n\f          purchase, relinquishment, gift, exchange, or\n          assignment, any interest in lands, water\n          rights, or surface rights to lands, within or\n          without existing reservations, including trust\n          or otherwise restricted allotments, whether\n          the allottee be living or deceased, for the\n          purpose of providing land for Indians.\n\n          For the acquisition of such lands . . ., there\n          is authorized to be appropriated, . . . a sum\n          not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one fiscal\n          year: Provided, That no part of such funds\n          shall be used to acquire additional land\n          outside of the exterior boundaries of Navajo\n          Indian Reservation for the Navajo Indians in\n          Arizona, nor in New Mexico, in the event that\n          legislation to define the exterior boundaries\n          of the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico\n          . . . becomes law.\n          . . .\n          Title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant\n          to this Act or the Act of July 28, 1955 (69\n          Stat. 392), as amended (25 U.S.C. 608 et seq.)\n          Shall be taken in the name of the United\n          States in trust for the Indian tribe or\n          individual Indian for which the land is\n          acquired, and such lands or rights shall be\n          exempt from State and local taxation.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 465.\n\n          To support its nondelegation doctrine argument, the State\n\nrelies on an Eighth Circuit decision, ultimately vacated by the\n\nSupreme Court, that found § 465 to be a standardless delegation\n\nwith so few \"boundaries,\" or \"intelligible principles,\" that \"it\n\nwould permit the Secretary to purchase the Empire State Building in\n\ntrust for a tribal chieftain as a wedding present.\"   South Dakota\n\nv. United States Dept. of Interior, 69 F.3d 878, 882 (8th Cir.\n\n1995), vacated by 519 U.S. 919 (1996).      As the district court\n\nnoted, the Supreme Court chose not to publish an opinion explaining\n\n                               -21-\n\fthe majority's reasoning for vacating the Eighth Circuit opinion.\n\nTherefore the vacated decision has no precedential value and we\n\nwill not rely on it here.\n\n           The Tenth Circuit addressed the validity of Congress'\n\ndelegation of trust acquisition authority under § 465 in United\n\nStates v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999).               In Roberts, the\n\nTenth Circuit held that Congress properly delegated authority to\n\nthe Secretary of the Interior to acquire land in trust for Indians.\n\nId. at 1137.        The Tenth Circuit found that the statute itself\n\nprovides standards for the Secretary's exercise of discretion and\n\nnoted that it had previously acknowledged that the statute places\n\nlimits on the Secretary's discretion.                  See McAlpine v. United\n\nStates, 112 F.3d 1429, 1432 n.3 (10th Cir. 1997)(citing South\n\nDakota, 69 F.3d at 887-88 (Murphy, J. dissenting)).                For example,\n\n\"the statute provides any land must be acquired for Indians as\n\ndefined   in   25   U.S.C.   §    479    and   funds     appropriated   for    the\n\nacquisitions may not be used to provide land for Navajos outside\n\ntheir   reservation     boundaries.\"           Roberts,    185   F.3d   at    1137\n\n(citations     omitted).     In    addition,      \"the    legislative   history\n\nidentifies goals of 'rehabilitating the Indian's economic life' and\n\n'developing the initiative destroyed by . . . oppression and\n\npaternalism,' of the prior allotment policy and indicates the\n\nSecretary must assure continued 'beneficial use by the Indian\n\noccupant and his heirs.'\"        Id. (citations omitted).         We agree with\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fthe district court's conclusion that the reasoning in Roberts is\n\npersuasive, and we find, for the same reasons articulated in\n\nRoberts, that § 465 is not an unconstitutional delegation of\n\nlegislative power.    Id.\n\n          2.    The Tenth Amendment and the Indian Commerce Clause\n\n          The State contends that § 465 of the IRA offends the\n\nTenth Amendment by generally encroaching on state sovereignty and\n\nthat Congress's Article I Indian Commerce Clause authority does not\n\nextend to the abrogation of state sovereignty.   We agree with the\n\nconclusion of the district court that this argument fails.\n\n          Congress' authority to regulate Indian affairs is clearly\n\nwithin the enumerated powers of the federal government.   See U.S.\n\nConst. art. I., § 8, cl. 3 (conferring upon Congress the power\n\n\"[t]o regulate commerce . . . with the Indian tribes.\"); see also\n\nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551 (1974) (noting that Congress\n\nhas plenary power \"to deal with the special problems of Indians,\"\n\nincluding the power to legislate). The Tenth Amendment reserves to\n\nthe States, or the People, those powers not delegated to the United\n\nStates by the Constitution.   The Supreme Court has interpreted the\n\nTenth Amendment to be a mirror of the enumerated powers embodied in\n\nArticle I.     New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156 (1992)\n\n(\"If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the\n\nTenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power\n\nto the States\").    Therefore, because the power to regulate Indian\n\n\n                                -23-\n\faffairs is conferred on Congress, its exercise does not offend the\n\nTenth Amendment.\n\n            3.   The Enclave Clause\n\n            The State claims that the Federal government may not\n\nacquire lands to be held in trust for the benefit of an Indian\n\ntribe unless it has secured the consent of the State pursuant to\n\nthe Enclave Clause of the Constitution.     U.S. Const. art. I, § 8,\n\ncl. 17.     The Enclave Clause provides Congress with the power to\n\nexercise    \"exclusive   legislative\"   authority   \"over   all   Places\n\npurchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which\n\nthe Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals,\n\ndock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.\"     Id.   This was intended\n\nto ensure that the \"places on which the security of the entire\n\nUnion may depend\" would not \"be in any degree dependent on a\n\nparticular member of it.\"     Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co. v. Lowe, 114\n\nU.S. 525, 530 (1885).\n\n            Indian reservations, however, are not federal enclaves,\n\nand instead represent land owned by the United States for public\n\npurposes. \"Such ownership and use without more do not withdraw the\n\nlands from the jurisdiction of the state,\" Surplus Trading Co. v.\n\nCook, 281 U.S. 647, 650 (1930), and State consent is therefore not\n\nrequired.    The Supreme Court recently confirmed that lands held in\n\ntrust for the benefit of tribes are not subject to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the United States:\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          Our cases make clear that the Indians' right\n          to make their own laws and be governed by them\n          does   not  exclude   all   state   regulatory\n          authority    on   the    reservation.    State\n          sovereignty does not end at a reservation's\n          border. Though tribes are often referred to as\n          \"sovereign\" entities, it was \"long ago\" that\n          \"the Court departed from Chief Justice\n          Marshall's view that 'the laws of [a State]\n          can   have  no   force'   within   reservation\n          boundaries.\n\nNevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353, 361 (2001) (quoting Worcester v.\n\nGeorgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 561 (1832)); see also Surplus\n\nTrading Co., 281 U.S. at 651 (holding the Indian reservation out as\n\nan example of land owned by the United States that does not\n\nconstitute a federal enclave because the civil and criminal laws\n\nstill have partial application therein).   Therefore, we find that\n\nthe Secretary's acquisition of the Parcel into trust does not\n\nviolate the Enclave Clause.\n\n          4.   The Admissions Clause\n\n          The State also contends that the trust acquisition of the\n\nParcel offends the Admissions Clause of the Constitution.     U.S.\n\nConst. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.   The Admissions Clause provides: \"New\n\nStates may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new\n\nState shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any\n\nother State; . . . or Parts of States, without the Consent of the\n\nLegislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\"\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f           The trust acquisition, however, does not amount to the\n\nestablishment of a new state within the meaning of the Admissions\n\nClause.   For purposes of the Admissions Clause, \"state\" refers to\n\na body equal in power to the existing states.      Coyle v. Smith, 221\n\nU.S. 559, 566-67 (1911) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.).\n\nThe Supreme Court, in Coyle interpreted that \"'[t]his Union' was\n\nand is a union of States, equal in power, dignity, and authority,\"\n\nCoyle, 221 U.S. at 567, and that Congress does not have the \"power\n\nto admit a new state which shall be any less a state than those\n\nwhich compose the Union.\" Id. at 568.     Since the trust acquisition\n\ndoes not confer statehood status, it does not offend the Admissions\n\nClause.\n\nC.   The Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act\n\n           We now turn to the State's argument that the Rhode Island\n\nIndian    Claims   Settlement   Act   prohibits   the   Secretary     from\n\nconverting the Parcel into an unrestricted federal trust.4             The\n\nState offers several arguments in support of its position.          First,\n\nthe State argues that allowing the Secretary to take non-Settlement\n\nLands into trust for the Tribe disrupts the special balance of\n\n\n4\n   When the Secretary takes land into trust for the use of Indians\npursuant to the IRA of 1934, the land is held under the\nsuperintendence of the Federal Government and is ordinarily exempt\nfrom certain state laws, including \"(1) state or local taxation,\nsee 25 U.S.C. § 465; (2) local zoning and regulatory requirements,\nsee 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(a); or, (3) state criminal and civil\njurisdiction, unless the tribe consents to such jurisdiction, see\n25 U.S.C. §§ 1321(a), 1322(a).\" Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v.\nU.S. Dep't of Interior, 228 F.3d 82, 85-86 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n                                  -26-\n\frights and allocation of powers between the State, the Federal\n\nGovernment, and the Tribe that were negotiated by the parties, laid\n\nout in the JMOU and then implemented through the Settlement Act.\n\nThus, the State asserts that the Settlement Act precludes the\n\nTribe,   and     any      \"successor    in   interest\"    –-   here    meaning       the\n\nSecretary      --    from     disrupting     this   allocation        by   acquiring\n\nadditional, non-settlement lands into trust and thereby removing\n\nthem from the jurisdiction and laws of the State.                      Second, the\n\nState contends that § 1707(c), as well as portions of § 1705(a)(3)\n\nand § 1712(a)(3) of the Settlement Act, eliminate the federal\n\ngovernment's ability to divest state sovereignty by acquiring land\n\ninto trust for the Tribe.              Third, the State argues that the 1976\n\nlawsuits settled the State's jurisdiction over the 3200 acres at\n\nissue in those suits, and thus the 31-acre Parcel, which was a part\n\nof the 3200 acres of contested lands, may not be accepted into\n\ntrust    by   the    Secretary.         Finally,    the   State   argues        in   the\n\nalternative that, regardless of whether the Parcel may be taken\n\ninto trust, the Settlement Act prohibits the Tribe and the Federal\n\ngovernment from making a claim that the Tribe's laws, rather than\n\nthe criminal and civil laws of the State of Rhode Island, should\n\napply on Tribal land.\n\n              The Secretary responds that the Settlement Act does not\n\nprohibit the Settlement Lands from being acquired into trust, and\n\nargues    that      the    Act   addresses    the   extinguishment         of   Indian\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\faboriginal land claims in Rhode Island without prohibiting future\n\nland transactions.            We agree that the Settlement Act does not\n\nprohibit the Parcel from being taken into trust by the Secretary,\n\nand we hold that the trust may be \"unrestricted,\" thus removing the\n\nland from the criminal and civil jurisdiction of Rhode Island.\n\n              The     issue    here       is     primarily       one     of    statutory\n\nconstruction.        Does the Settlement Act preclude the Secretary from\n\ntaking land, in addition to the Settlement Lands, into trust on\n\nbehalf   of    the    Tribe?       Does    the     Settlement      Act   prohibit      the\n\nSecretary from removing lands not included in the Settlement Lands\n\nfrom under the laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island?\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that \"statutes are to be construed\n\nliberally     in     favor    of   the    Indians    with    ambiguous        provisions\n\ninterpreted to their benefit.\"             Chickasaw Nation v. United States,\n\n534 U.S. 84, 93-94 (2001).\n\n              The    Rhode    Island      Indian    Claims       Settlement     Act,    in\n\nprovisions pertinent to these questions -- including 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1705 (Publication of findings), 25 U.S.C. § 1712 (Approval of\n\nprior transfers and extinguishment of claims and aboriginal title\n\noutside town of Charlestown), and 25 U.S.C. § 1707 (Purchase and\n\ntransfer      of    private    Settlement        Lands)     --    provides     for     the\n\nratification of various transfers of land and natural resources,\n\nextinguishment of aboriginal title, state jurisdiction over the\n\nSettlement Lands, and a limit on the duties and liabilities of the\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\ffederal government with respect to the settlement.               Specifically,\n\nthe   Settlement      Act   ratified   any    transfer   of   land   or    natural\n\nresources located anywhere in the United States made by, or on\n\nbehalf   of,    the    Narragansetts,        their   predecessors,    or    their\n\nsuccessors as congressionally approved as of the date of the\n\ntransfer.      25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(1).           The Act also provided for\n\nratification of any transfers of land or resources located within\n\nthe town of Charlestown, id., as well as anywhere else within the\n\nState of Rhode Island, 25 U.S.C. § 1712(a)(1), that were made by\n\nany Indian, Indian nation, or Indian tribe.              The Act extinguished\n\nany Indian claims of aboriginal title to all such property as of\n\nthe date of the transfer.        25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2), 1712(a)(2).\n\n            The Settlement Act also provided that:\n\n            by virtue of the approval of a transfer of\n            land or natural resources effected by this\n            section, or an extinguishment of aboriginal\n            title effected thereby, all claims against the\n            United States, any State or subdivision\n            thereof, or any other person or entity, by the\n            Indian Corporation or any other entity\n            presently or at any time in the past known as\n            the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any\n            predecessor or successor in interest, member\n            or stockholder thereof, or any other Indian,\n            Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising\n            subsequent to the transfer and based upon any\n            interest in or right involving such land or\n            natural resources (including but not limited\n            to claims for trespass damages or claims for\n            use and occupancy) shall be regarded as\n            extinguished as of the date of the transfer.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(3).        In § 1712(a)(3), the Act effected the same\n\nextinguishment of all claims by any other tribe of Indians based\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fupon any interest in, or rights involving, land or resources\n\ntransferred anywhere within Rhode Island.\n\n            1.   Whether the Settlement Act precludes trust\n                 acquisition\n\n            The State argues that § 1705 and § 1712 of the Settlement\n\nAct provide a comprehensive extinguishment of the ability of any\n\ntribe,    including    the    Narragansetts,       to     claim   territorial\n\nsovereignty anywhere in the State of Rhode Island through a two-\n\npronged   approach    of   first,    terminating    all     aboriginal   title\n\nthroughout Rhode Island, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2), 1712(a)(2), and,\n\nsecond, extinguishing any claims by any tribe, or successor in\n\ninterest, against the State based upon \"any interest in or right\n\ninvolving    land\"    in   Rhode    Island,   25   U.S.C.    §§   1705(a)(3),\n\n1712(a)(3). The State also contends that the extinguishment of the\n\nright of \"any successor in interest\" in § 1705(a)(3) and § 1712(a)\n\n(3) precludes the Secretary from making the same claim on the\n\nTribe's behalf.       These provisions, the State asserts, are the\n\nresult of the careful balance that was negotiated in the settlement\n\nof the 1976 lawsuits.      Whereas the Narragansett tribe received an\n\n1800-acre land base and locus for the exercise of its retained\n\nsovereignty over its members and internal tribal matters, see Rhode\n\nIsland v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 701 (1st Cir.\n\n1994), the State obtained the continued application of its laws and\n\njurisdiction on the Settlement Lands, 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a) (\"Except\n\nas otherwise provided in this subchapter, the Settlement Lands\n\n                                     -30-\n\fshall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of\n\nthe    State    of   Rhode       Island.\").        The    State   argues         that   the\n\nSecretary's      action     of    taking     the   Parcel     into    trust,      thereby\n\nremoving it from the jurisdiction of the State's criminal and civil\n\nlaws,    upsets      this       negotiated     and       agreed-upon       balance,      as\n\nimplemented by the Settlement Act.\n\n               These sections of the Settlement Act show that Congress\n\nintended   to     enact     a    wide-reaching       resolution      of    any    and   all\n\ncontested transfers of land by Indians qua Indians in Rhode Island.\n\nThe JMOU and Settlement Act clearly resolve all prior contested\n\nland    transfers     and       related    claims     involving       Indian      tribes,\n\nincluding the extinguishment of aboriginal title in Rhode Island.\n\n               It is not clear, however, that Congress intended to\n\npreclude the Narragansetts from ever expanding from the Settlement\n\nLands if the Tribe became federally recognized.                      Neither the JMOU\n\nnor the Settlement Act provides that lands outside the Settlement\n\nLands may not be acquired or held in trust.                  In fact, the JMOU and\n\nSettlement Act do not make direct reference to the IRA at all.                          The\n\nomission of an explicit prohibition on trust acquisition and\n\nfederal superintendence of non-Settlement lands is significant,\n\nbecause settlement acts resolving Indian claims in other states did\n\nexplicitly prohibit future trust acquisitions.                            See, e.g., 25\n\nU.S.C. § 1724(e) (precluding application of § 465 of the IRA in the\n\nMaine Settlement Act); Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal, 228 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                           -31-\n\f90 (finding that the absence of a provision analogous to the\n\nprohibition of § 465 of the IRA in the Maine Settlement Act\n\nconfirmed \"that the Settlement Act was not meant to eliminate the\n\nSecretary's power under the IRA to take land purchased without\n\nsettlement funds into trust for the benefit of the Tribe\").\n\n             The    Settlement     Act    explicitly        anticipated   that   the\n\nNarragansetts might eventually be federally acknowledged, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1707(c), and the JMOU provided that the Narragansett Tribe would\n\n\"have the same right to petition for [federal] recognition and\n\nservices as other groups.\"          JMOU para. 15, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453,\n\nat 27.   As we noted, one of the benefits of federal recognition is\n\nthe right to apply to have land taken into trust by the federal\n\ngovernment for the benefit of the tribe, pursuant to Section 5 of\n\nthe IRA.\n\n             At the time the JMOU was negotiated and the Settlement\n\nAct was enacted, the Narragansetts had not yet been acknowledged as\n\na federally recognized tribe.             Thus, they were ineligible at that\n\ntime   to   apply    for     the   benefits      of   the    IRA,   including    the\n\nacquisition of land into trust by the Secretary of the Interior for\n\ntheir use.    As we noted above, trust acquisition typically results\n\nin the removal of the land from State jurisdiction in favor of\n\ntribal jurisdiction with federal superintendence.                   Therefore, the\n\nimmediate     result    of    §    1708    was   indeed      that   the   laws   and\n\njurisdiction of the State would remain in force throughout the\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\fstate at the time of the JMOU and enactment of the Settlement Act.\n\nOnce the tribe received federal recognition in 1983, however, it\n\ngained the same benefits as other tribes, including the right to\n\napply to have land taken into trust pursuant to § 465 of the IRA.\n\n              2.    The Secretary's duties and liabilities under the\n                     Settlement Act\n\n              The Settlement Act provides that \"[u]pon the discharge of\n\nthe Secretary's duties under §§ 1704-1706, and 1707 of this title,\n\nthe United States shall have no further duties or liabilities under\n\nthis subchapter with respect to the Indian Corporation or its\n\nsuccessor, the State Corporation, or the settlement lands . . . .\"\n\n25   U.S.C.    §    1707(c).      The   State    contends      that   this    passage\n\nprohibits the federal government from divesting the State of\n\nsovereignty over the Parcel by putting the land into trust for the\n\nTribe.\n\n              However, § 1707(c) does not preclude the Secretary from\n\nacquiring     additional       lands    in   trust    for    the   benefit    of    the\n\nNarragansetts.       Again, we point out that the Narragansetts did not\n\nobtain federal acknowledgment of their tribal status until 1983.\n\nDespite the fact that the JMOU and Settlement Act both contemplated\n\nthe future acknowledgment of the Narragansett tribe by the federal\n\ngovernment, no explicit limitation was placed on the Secretary's\n\nauthority      to    accept      additional      land       into   trust     for    the\n\nNarragansetts' benefit.          Cf.    Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act,\n\n25   U.S.C.    §    1724   (e)    (\"Except      for   the     provisions     of    this\n\n                                         -33-\n\fsubchapter, the United States shall have no other authority to\n\nacquire lands or natural resources in trust for the benefit of\n\nIndians . . . in the State of Maine.\").           We therefore agree with\n\nthe district court that such a restriction cannot reasonably be\n\ninferred.    Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 184.\n\n            3.   Settlement of the 1976 Lawsuits\n\n            The State argues that the trust acquisition of the Parcel\n\nis precluded by the doctrine of res judicata because the Parcel was\n\namong the 3200 acres at issue in the 1976 lawsuits that were\n\nultimately settled by the JMOU and implementation of the Settlement\n\nAct.   The Parcel was part of the 1400 acres that remained with the\n\ndefendant property owners pursuant to the settlement.              Thus, the\n\nState contends that the Tribe relinquished its claimed interest in\n\nthe exercise of sovereignty over the 1400 acres, including the 31-\n\nacre Parcel.\n\n            This argument is without merit.        As the district court\n\nnoted,   \"the    doctrine   of   res   judicata    operates   to    bar   the\n\nrelitigation of issues that were or could have been raised in an\n\nearlier action between the same parties prescinding from the same\n\nset of operative facts.\"     Id. at 186 (quoting In re Carvalho, 335\n\nF.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2003)) (citations omitted).                  Since the\n\nfederal government was not a party to the 1976 lawsuits or the\n\nJMOU, the principles of res judicata do not apply.                 The State\n\nattempts to salvage the argument on appeal by contending that the\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fUnited States maintains a special relationship with the Tribe such\n\nthat they may be considered a legal unity.                           This argument is\n\nultimately insufficient because the fee-to-trust acquisition of the\n\nParcel    by    the      Secretary,    and    the    consequences          thereof,   are\n\ndifferent issues than the claims of aboriginal right which were\n\nlitigated in the 1976 lawsuits and resolved by the JMOU and\n\nSettlement Act.           Accordingly, even if there were a substantial\n\nidentity of the parties in the 1976 and the instant litigation,\n\nthere    would      be   no   identity   of     claims,       and    thus,    the   trust\n\nacquisition is not barred by res judicata.\n\n               4.   The State's alternative argument\n\n               Finally, the State argues that even if the Settlement Act\n\ncan be read to allow the Secretary to take the Parcel into trust\n\nfor the Narragansetts, the trust must remain subject to the State's\n\ncivil    and    criminal      jurisdiction      in    order    to    comply    with   the\n\nSettlement Act, which extinguished aboriginal title throughout\n\nRhode Island, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2); 1712(a)(2), as well as\n\nIndian claims against the State based upon \"any interest in or\n\nright    involving\"        land   in   Rhode     Island,       id.    §§     1705(a)(3);\n\n1712(a)(3).         For many of the same reasons we determined that the\n\nSettlement Act does not prohibit the Secretary from acquiring the\n\nParcel into trust, we find that the trust need not be restricted to\n\npreserve the State's jurisdiction.                   Although the Settlement Act\n\nexpressly provides that the 1800 acres of Settlement Lands must\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fremain subject to the State's jurisdiction, 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a),\n\nneither the Act nor the JMOU prohibits the Tribe from expanding on\n\nits lands or from taking advantage of the benefits associated with\n\nfederal recognition, which include the trust acquisitions and\n\nfederal superintendence.\n\n             The     State    suggests       that   the    Settlement       Act's\n\nextinguishment of all aboriginal title in 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2)\n\nand § 1712(a)(2) \"necessarily implies\" that the State's laws and\n\njurisdiction are preserved everywhere else in the State.                    While\n\nthat   may   have    been    true   before    the   Narragansett    Tribe     was\n\nrecognized by the federal government and became eligible for\n\nfederal benefits, it is no longer the case today.                  As we note\n\nabove,   the       JMOU   specifically       provided     that   although     the\n\nNarragansett Tribe would \"not receive federal recognition for\n\npurposes of eligibility for Department of the Interior services as\n\na result of congressional implementation of . . . this memorandum,\n\n[] it will have the same right to petition for such recognition and\n\nservices as other groups.\"          JMOU at para. 15;       H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n\n1453 at 27.\n\n             The State argues that the extinguishment of aboriginal\n\ntitle expressly eliminates tribal territorial sovereignty.                     To\n\nsupport this assertion, the State points to two cases.              First, the\n\nState cites Bates v. Clark, 95 U.S. 204, 207-08 (1877), for the\n\nproposition that the extinguishment of aboriginal title eliminates\n\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fIndian country.     We decline to rely on Bates, because the case\n\npredates the IRA of 1934, as well as modern Supreme Court case law\n\ndefining Indian country, and the statutory definition of \"Indian\n\ncountry\" that ratified that case law in 18 U.S.C. § 1151.5               The\n\nsecond case the State cites is a Supreme Court case reversing a\n\nNinth Circuit holding that the Native Village of Venetie was\n\n\"Indian country,\" and citing with approval the concurrence of one\n\nNinth   Circuit   judge,   who   viewed   the   broad   extinguishment   of\n\naboriginal title in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)\n\nas leaving Native Alaskans as sovereigns \"without territorial\n\n5\n    Congress defines \"Indian country\" as:\n\n      (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation\n      under the jurisdiction of the United States Government,\n      notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and,\n      including rights-of-way running through the reservation,\n      (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders\n      of the United States whether within the original or\n      subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether\n      within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all\n      Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not\n      been extinguished, including rights-of-way running\n      through the same.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1151.\n\n     At issue in this case is whether the Parcel is a \"dependent\nIndian community\" as defined in § 1151(b) of the statute.       The\nSupreme Court has held that \"a federal set-aside and a federal\nsuperintendence requirement must be satisfied for a finding of a\n'dependent Indian community.'\" Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie\nTribal Gov't, 522 U.S. 520, 530 (1998). If the Parcel may be taken\ninto unrestricted trust, it will be \"Indian country\" because (1)\nthe land will be \"set-aside\" by the Federal Government and occupied\nby an Indian community, and (2) the community will be \"dependent\"\non the Federal Government in the sense that \"the Federal Government\nand the [Narragansetts], rather than the State[], [will] exercise\nprimary jurisdiction over the land. . . .\" Id.\n\n                                   -37-\n\freach.\" Native Village of Venetie, 522 U.S. at 526.                 The situation\n\nconcerning     the   land    owned   by   the   Native    Village    of   Venetie,\n\nhowever, is different from the issue here.                 In enacting ANCSA,\n\nCongress stated that settlement of the Alaskan land claims was to\n\nbe accomplished \"without creating a reservation system or lengthy\n\nwardship or trusteeship.\"        43 U.S.C. § 1601(b).       To that end, ANCSA\n\nactually revoked the reservations that had previously been set\n\naside   for    Alaskan      natives,   including    the    Native    Village   of\n\nVenetie's reservation.         It was as a result of this revocation that\n\nthe land ceased to be Indian country, not the extinguishment of\n\naboriginal title.\n\n              Extinguishing aboriginal title merely terminates the\n\nright of Indian nations to occupy their ancestral lands.                  It is a\n\nright of occupancy and use.          See County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian\n\nNation, 470 U.S. 226, 234 (1985); Narragansett Tribe of Rhode\n\nIsland v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d 908, 914 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"Aboriginal title . . . is the right of Indian tribes to use and\n\noccupy lands they had inhabited from time immemorial.\") (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n              It is not necessary that a federally recognized tribe\n\nhave aboriginal title to land it owns in fee simple for the tribe\n\nto request that the Secretary of the Interior take land into trust\n\npursuant to § 465 of the IRA.             The Narragansetts did not assert\n\ntheir aboriginal title to the Parcel when they petitioned the\n\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fFederal Government to take the land into trust, as the State\n\nsuggests.6     Rather, they exercised their statutory privilege to\n\nmake the request, pursuant to the IRA, and the Secretary had\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine whether to grant that request.\n\n             The State incorrectly construes a recent Supreme Court\n\ndecision, City of Sherill v. Oneida Indian Nation, 544 U.S. ---,\n\n125    S.   Ct.   1478   (2005),     in    an   attempt   to   buttress    its\n\ninterpretation. City of Sherill involved an attempt by the Oneidas\n\nto    unilaterally    reassert     their    sovereignty   over   lands    they\n\npurchased in fee simple. The Oneidas argued that they had \"unified\n\nfee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over\n\nthe parcels.\"        Id. at 1481.     The Supreme Court responded that\n\n\"[t]he Oneidas long ago relinquished the reins of government and\n\ncannot regain them through open-market purchases from current\n\ntitleholders.\" Id. at 1483. The Narragansetts, on the other hand,\n\nattempted to do nothing of the sort.             Rather, the Narragansetts\n\nused the precise mechanism the Supreme Court stated that the\n\nOneidas should have used: application for trust acquisition of the\n\nland pursuant to § 465.      Id. at 20-21.\n\n             The State also claims that converting the Parcel to\n\nunrestricted trust is incompatible with the second extinguishment\n\nprong of the Settlement Act:        the extinguishment of any claims by\n\n\n6\n   Assertion of any aboriginal title by the Narragansetts would\nclearly have been impossible because the tribe's aboriginal title\nwas extinguished by the Settlement Act. 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705, 1712.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fany tribe, including the Narragansetts, or any \"successor in\n\ninterest,\" against the State or the Town based upon \"any interest\n\nin or right involving\" land in Rhode Island.          25 U.S.C. §§ 1705\n\n(a)(3); 1712(a)(3).    The State claims that converting the Parcel\n\ninto   unrestricted   trust   will   render   this   latter   prong   mere\n\nsurplusage.   We disagree.\n\n           We note two things that the State fails to mention.\n\nFirst, aboriginal title may form the basis not only of claims for\n\npossession or damages, but also for trespass or other subsidiary\n\nclaims.   See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 8.     Thus, there is no basis\n\nfor the State's surplusage argument.     Second, the full language of\n\n§ 1705(a)(3) provides that:\n\n           by virtue of the approval of a transfer of\n           land or natural resources effected by this\n           section [meaning transfers by the Narragansett\n           tribe or any predecessor or successor in\n           interest], or an extinguishment of aboriginal\n           title effected thereby, all claims against the\n           United States, any State or subdivision\n           thereof, or any other person or entity, by the\n           Indian Corporation or any other entity\n           presently or at any time in the past known as\n           the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any\n           predecessor or successor in interest, member\n           or stockholder thereof, or any other Indian,\n           Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising\n           subsequent to the transfer and based upon any\n           interest in or right involving such land or\n           natural resources (including but not limited\n           to claims for trespass damages or claims for\n           use and occupancy) shall be regarded as\n           extinguished as of the date of the transfer.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(3) (emphases added).        This language suggests\n\nthat Congress intended to extinguish all claims that could arise as\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fa result of transfers of land by the Narragansetts, many of which\n\nwere made in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, or claims that\n\nthe Narragansetts might have had by virtue of their aboriginal\n\ntitle prior to extinguishment.           In other words, the terms of the\n\nextinguishment    provisions      may     reasonably     be   interpreted      as\n\nextinguishing    Indian    land    claims       based    exclusively      on   the\n\npossessory rights that gave rise to the Narragansetts' lawsuits.\n\n           We also note that the primary purpose of the Settlement\n\nAct and the JMOU it implemented was not to preserve Rhode Island's\n\njurisdiction, but rather, it was to clear the cloud that had\n\ndeveloped on the title to thousands of acres of lands to which the\n\nNarragansett    Tribe    had   made     legal   claims    seeking    possession\n\npursuant to aboriginal title.         See H.R. Rep. 95-1453 at *6 (\"[T]he\n\npendency of the lawsuits resulted in economic hardship for the\n\nresidents of Charlestown by clouding titles to most of the land\n\nwithin   the   town.).     \"In    return     for   the   public     and   private\n\nsettlement lands under the Settlement Agreement, the Narragansetts\n\nagreed to cause their lawsuits to be dismissed with prejudice and\n\nconsented to the extinguishment by the Federal Government of all\n\nIndian claims for possession of land (and all potential damages\n\nbased on their land claims) within Rhode Island, which would clear\n\nnon-Indian title to non-settlement lands claimed by the tribe.\"\n\nId. at *7 (emphases added).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\f            Moreover, even assuming the Settlement Act's provisions\n\ncreated an ambiguity as to whether the Narragansett Tribe would be\n\neligible for the benefit of unrestricted trust acquisition of land\n\nupon federal recognition, we adhere to the canon of statutory\n\nconstruction that statutes \"are to be construed liberally in favor\n\nof the Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their\n\nbenefit.\"     See   Chickasaw   Nation,   534   U.S.   at   93-94.    \"'In\n\ndetermining [congressional] intent, we are cautioned to follow the\n\ngeneral rule that doubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor\n\nof the weak and defenseless people who are the wards of the nation,\n\ndependent upon its protection and good faith.'\"             Connecticut ex\n\nrel.

In Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal, the Second\nCircuit rejected the State of Connecticut's argument that the\nSecretary of the Interior should not be allowed to take additional,\nnon-settlement land into trust pursuant to the IRA on behalf of the\nMashantucket Pequot Tribe because it would create a \"checkerboard\"\njurisdiction. 228 F.3d at 90 (stating that \"the possibility of\nheterogeneous jurisdictional areas within the [Tribe's] lands does\nnot compel a different result\"); see also Washington v.\nConfederated Bands & Tribes of the Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U.S.\n463, 502 (1979) (\"In short, checkerboard jurisdiction is not novel\nin Indian law.\").\n\n                                  -42-\n\fD.    Whether the Secretary's acceptance of the Parcel in trust\n      violates the APA\n\n            In addition to the constitutional and other statutory\n\nchallenges to the Secretary's decision to take the Parcel into\n\ntrust, the State claims that the Secretary's action was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion under the Administrative Procedures Act.                Our review of\n\nthe Secretary's decision is governed by § 706(2)(A) of the APA,\n\nwhich provides that a court may set aside agency action only where\n\nit finds the action \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\nor otherwise not in accordance with the law.\"                 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)\n\n(A).    An agency's determination is arbitrary and capricious if the\n\nagency lacks a rational basis for making the determination or if\n\nthe    decision    was    not    based   on   consideration   of   the    relevant\n\nfactors.

We disagree with the State, and for essentially the same\n\nreasons as set forth in the district court's decision, we find that\n\nthe Secretary's decision to accept the Parcel into trust did not\n\nviolate the APA.\n\n            1.     Whether the BIA failed to conduct an independent\n                   evaluation of the Tribe's trust application\n\n            The        State   points      to     substantial       passages      in    the\n\nSecretary's       decision,       which    contain       verbatim     restatements      of\n\ninformation provided by the Narragansett Tribe in support of their\n\n1993 trust application, as evidence that the BIA failed to conduct\n\nan independent evaluation of the Tribe's 1997 application.                             The\n\nState    claims    that    the     BIA    relied    exclusively       on    the   Tribe's\n\nassertions and failed to consider other important facts that\n\noccurred between 1993 and 1997.                 Thus, the State asserts that the\n\n                                           -44-\n\fBIA made an arbitrary and capricious decision and abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            However, there is ample evidence in the administrative\n\nrecord that the BIA conducted its own, independent evaluation of\n\nthe Tribe's application and that it considered the events following\n\nthe Tribe's 1993 application.            For example, between 1993 and 1997,\n\nthe BIA required the Tribe to supplement its initial Environmental\n\nAssessment; conducted an environmental hazard survey of the subject\n\n31-acre    Parcel       (Supp.    App.    99);     required     confirmation    of\n\nconsistency with the State’s Coastal Resources Management Plan\n\n(Supp. App. 102-03); was well aware of the Narragansett Electric\n\nlitigation (Supp. App. 10-12, 13-93); was apprised of, and offered\n\nto facilitate, negotiations between the Tribe, the Town, and the\n\nState   concerning       both    environmental     and   jurisdictional     issues\n\nattendant to the Tribe's development of the Parcel (Supp. App. 1);\n\nand specifically requested that the Regional Solicitor address\n\nseveral legal and jurisdictional issues raised by the State in its\n\ncomments     to    the     BIA     on    the      Tribe's     trust   application\n\n(Supp. App. 101).        This shows that the BIA did not rely solely on\n\nthe findings of the Tribe and did conduct its own evaluation.                  We\n\nagree     with    the    district       court's     finding    that   the    BIA's\n\ndetermination was the result of its own, independent evaluation of\n\nthe 1997 application.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\f          2.   Whether the BIA properly applied the 25 C.F.R.\n               § 151.10 factors\n\n          The State claims that the BIA failed to apply the proper\n\ncriteria when it evaluated the Tribe's application for trust\n\nacquisition.   The regulations governing the BIA's evaluation of\n\napplications to have land taken in trust are laid out at 25 C.F.R.\n\n§ 151.   The factors to be considered for an \"on-reservation\"\n\nacquisition are found in § 151.10 and the factors for an \"off-\n\nreservation\" acquisition are in § 151.11.   In making the decision\n\nto accept the Parcel into trust, the BIA considered the on-\n\nreservation factors in § 151.10,8 which include:\n\n          (a) The existence of statutory authority for\n          the acquisition and any limitations contained\n          in such authority;\n          (b) The need of the individual Indian or the\n          tribe for additional land;\n          (c) The purposes for which the land will be\n          used;\n          . . .\n          (e) If the land to be acquired is in\n          unrestricted fee status, the impact on the\n          State and its political subdivisions resulting\n          from the removal of the land from the tax\n          rolls;\n\n\n\n8\n   For the purpose of 25 C.F.R. § 151, land is considered to be\n\"on-reservation\" if it is \"located within or contiguous to an\nIndian reservation,\" and \"off-reservation\" where \"the land is\nlocated outside of and noncontiguous to the tribe's reservation.\"\nThe State challenges the finding by the BIA and district court that\nthe Parcel is adjacent to Settlement Lands, yet recognizes that\nthis determination is insignificant to the application of either\nsection in this case, as the sections differ only slightly.\nCompare § 151.10 with § 151.11. As we have previously noted, the\nParcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but separated from them\nby a town road. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 911.\n\n                               -46-\n\f          (f) Jurisdictional problems and potential\n          conflicts of land use which may arise; and\n          (g) If the land to be acquired is in fee\n          status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs\n          is equipped to discharge the additional\n          responsibilities     resulting    from    the\n          acquisition of the land in trust status.\n          . . .\n\n25 C.F.R. § 151.10.\n\n          The State claims that the BIA failed to consider \"the\n\nneed of . . . the tribe for additional land,\" § 151.10(b).     The\n\nState also questions whether the BIA sufficiently scrutinized \"the\n\ntribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition\"\n\nas required by § 151.11(b).     The criteria required pursuant to\n\n§ 151.11(b) are as follows:\n\n          The location of the land relative to state\n          boundaries,   and    its   distance   from   the\n          boundaries of the tribe's reservation, shall\n          be considered as follows: as the distance\n          between the tribe's reservation and the land\n          to be acquired increases, the Secretary shall\n          give   greater    scrutiny    to  the    tribe's\n          justification of anticipated benefits from the\n          acquisition. . . .\n\n25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).\n\n          As we have noted, a reviewing court will determine only\n\n\"whether the [BIA's] decision was based on a consideration of the\n\nrelevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of\n\njudgment.\" See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416.\n\nThe fact that the BIA found the Parcel, which is across a town road\n\nfrom the Settlement Lands, to be \"contiguous\" to the Settlement\n\nLands that are currently in trust, and thus determined that it\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fshould consider the \"on-reservation\" factors enumerated in 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.10, is certainly not clear error and is within the\n\nSecretary's discretion.         It was not necessary for the BIA to\n\nconsider the factors under § 151.11, since it found § 151.10 to be\n\napplicable for this trust determination.              While the Secretary need\n\nnot consider § 151.11(b), we note that the close proximity between\n\nthe Tribe's Settlement Lands and the Parcel would not have required\n\nthe   Secretary    to   give   the   greatest    scrutiny    to   the   \"tribe's\n\njustification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\"                 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.11(b).      In sum, the record shows that the BIA complied\n\nwith § 151.10, including evaluating the Tribe's need for the\n\nadditional land, and we do not find that the Secretary has made a\n\nclear error of judgment.\n\n           3.     The NAHASDA Cooperation Agreement\n\n           At the time of the BIA's decision to acquire the Parcel\n\ninto trust, HUD was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the\n\nNative   American    Housing    Assistance      and    Self-Determination   Act\n\n(\"NAHASDA\") for any tribe's housing development unless an agreement\n\nfor local cooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had\n\nbeen entered into by the tribe and the local government where the\n\nhousing was located.       25 U.S.C. § 4111(c).          In the instant case,\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the\n\nTown.    However, § 4111(c) has now been amended to permit HUD to\n\nwaive the cooperation agreement requirement, 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c),\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fas amended, Pub. L. 106-569, Dec. 27, 2000, and the Tribe obtained\n\nsuch a waiver.\n\n          The State argues that this waiver was invalid because the\n\nState apparently did not receive notice of the Tribe's application\n\nfor a waiver until after it was granted.      On appeal, the State\n\ncontends that if the BIA accepted the waiver, the BIA has inherited\n\nthe legal error and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\nAs the district court noted, \"25 U.S.C. § 4111(c) establishes a\n\nprerequisite to HUD's award of housing grants. It does not pertain\n\nto the BIA's trust acquisition authority.\"    Carcieri, 290 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 179.     The BIA is obligated to consider the appropriate\n\nfactors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151, which includes a requirement\n\nthat the Secretary consider the \"need of the individual Indian or\n\nthe tribe for the additional land,\" and \"[t]he purposes for which\n\nthe land will be used.\"   25 C.F.R. § 151.10(b)-(c).    It is clear\n\nfrom the record that the BIA has properly considered the Tribe's\n\nneed for additional housing as well as the fact that the funding to\n\npurchase the Parcel was provided to the Tribe's Housing Authority\n\nwith the understanding that the lands would be used for housing.\n\nHowever, nothing in the § 151.10 factors requires the BIA to ensure\n\nthat a local cooperation agreement is in place for an Indian\n\nHousing project.\n\n          4.   Environmental Considerations\n\n\n\n\n                               -49-\n\f            The National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\") and its\n\nsupporting regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental\n\nQuality    (\"CEQ\")   direct    federal    agencies       to     consider     the\n\nenvironmental impacts of agency decisions.           42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-\n\n4370(e); 40 C.F.R. § 1500-1518 (2004).         The State claims that the\n\nSecretary and BIA failed to consider environmental impacts in\n\nreaching the decision to accept the Parcel into trust because no\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") was prepared.                 The State\n\nalso argues that the BIA failed to conduct its own evaluation of\n\nthe environmental impacts and instead improperly relied on an\n\nenvironmental   assessment    (\"EA\")    submitted   by    the      Narragansett\n\nTribe.    We disagree.\n\n            Federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for any\n\naction that could significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.    42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(c); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.                NEPA\n\nprovides that \"to the fullest extent possible . . . (2) all\n\nagencies of the Federal Government shall . . . (c) include in every\n\nrecommendation or report on proposals for . . . major Federal\n\nactions    significantly    affecting    the    quality       of    the    human\n\nenvironment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\n\n. . . (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 4332(2)(c).     However, in the absence of a finding that the\n\nproposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment, the BIA was not required to prepare an EIS.                    See,\n\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fe.g., Londonderry Neighborhood Coalition v. Fed. Energy Regulatory\n\nComm'n, 273 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Wyoming Outdoor\n\nCouncil v. U.S. Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 49 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\n\n             The CEQ has issued guidance for whether to prepare an\n\nEIS, which provides that \"if the agency determines on the basis of\n\nthe environmental assessment not to prepare a statement,\" then the\n\nagency should \"[p]repare a finding of no significant impact\"\n\npursuant to § 1508.13.         40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).          The applicant may\n\nprepare the EA provided that the agency \"make[s] its own evaluation\n\nof the environmental issues and take[s] responsibility for the\n\nscope and content of the environmental assessment.\"                       40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1506.5(b). In this case, the BIA followed its standard operating\n\nprocedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an EA\n\nfrom   the   Tribe     and   considering       it    along    with    supplemental\n\ninformation the BIA requested from the Tribe and information\n\ngathered independently by the BIA.                   See Externally Initiated\n\nProposals, NEPA Handbook 4.2 B (\"When the proposed Bureau action is\n\na response to an externally initiated proposal . . . the applicant\n\nwill normally be required to prepare the EA, if one is required,\n\nand    to    provide     supporting       information        and     analyses    as\n\nappropriate.)\"         After    reviewing      the    EA     and    the   requisite\n\nsupplemental    information,      the    BIA   completed      its    environmental\n\nanalysis and issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -51-\n\fThe BIA's issuance of a FONSI thus satisfied its responsibilities\n\nunder NEPA.    See 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).\n\n            Separately, the State contends that the BIA should have\n\nobtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the Costal\n\nZone Management Act (\"CZMA\") before making its trust determination.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1451-1465.     The CZMA requires state consultation on\n\nfederally permitted coastal development activities.   Specifically,\n\n§ 1456 of the CZMA provides, in relevant part:\n\n            (1)(A) Each Federal agency activity within or\n            outside the coastal zone that affects any land\n            or water use or natural resource of the\n            coastal zone shall be carried out in a manner\n            which is consistent to the maximum extent\n            practicable with the enforceable policies of\n            approved State management programs. A Federal\n            agency activity shall be subject to this\n            paragraph unless it is subject to paragraph\n            (2) or (3).\n            . . .\n            (C) Each Federal agency carrying out an\n            activity subject to paragraph (1) shall\n            provide a consistency determination to the\n            relevant State agency . . .\n            (2) Any Federal agency which shall undertake\n            any development project in the coastal zone of\n            a state shall insure that the project is, to\n            the maximum extent practicable, consistent\n            with the enforceable policies of approved\n            State management programs.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1456.   The State asserts that the BIA's failure to take\n\ndirect action to ensure the housing project was consistent with the\n\nRhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program (\"RICZMP\") before\n\nmaking its trust determination was a violation of the CZMA.      We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                -52-\n\f           The State has failed to demonstrate that a consistency\n\nreview of the Tribe's housing development was necessary at the\n\ntrust acquisition stage.      The development of the Parcel is a\n\nproject that was commenced by the Tribe, in conjunction with HUD,\n\nprior to the Tribe's application for trust acquisition.          The CRMC\n\ncorrectly recognized that the development of the Parcel was a\n\nseparate   matter   which   required    its    own   federal   consistency\n\ndetermination, and properly found that the Tribe's application for\n\ntrust status was consistent with the RICZMP.          Id.; App. Tab 5 at\n\nEx. 11.\n\n           5.   The IGRA\n\n           Finally, the State contends that the true purpose of the\n\nTribe's application for trust acquisition is the development of\n\ngambling facilities on the Parcel –- rather than development of\n\ntribal housing as the BIA found in its evaluation pursuant to 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.10(c) -- and that the BIA's failure to consider the\n\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2710-2721, in\n\nits decision was an abuse of discretion.       The State argues that the\n\nSecretary's decision to acquire the Parcel in trust should be\n\nreversed and that further inquiry into whether the Parcel would be\n\nused for gaming purposes is required.         We disagree.\n\n           There is no evidence that the Tribe intended to use the\n\nParcel for anything other than tribal housing, as determined by the\n\nBIA.   \"In fact, after the plaintiffs expressed concern over the\n\n\n                                 -53-\n\fpotential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel, the\n\ntribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a housing\n\ndevelopment and stated that it had 'no immediate plans for any\n\nfurther   future    development.'     Admin.   Rec.,   Vol.   II,   Tab   N.\"\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178.\n\n           As support for its position, the State points to an IBIA\n\ndecision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the\n\nBIA's failure to consider the impact of a potential casino, even\n\nthough the applicants denied any intention of using the property\n\nfor a casino.      Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico v. Albuquerque Area\n\nDir. Bureau of Indian Affairs, 32 IBIA 130 (1998).             However, in\n\nVillage of Ruidoso, although the Tribe denied that the application\n\nfor trust acquisition was for gaming purposes, the IBIA determined\n\nthat it was clear from the planned gaming-related uses of the\n\nproperty, and the fact that the property was given to the Tribe by\n\na company that the BIA \"apparently understood to have some gaming\n\nconnection with the Tribe,\" that the application was for gaming\n\npurposes and that the BIA's determination should have been made\n\nunder the guidelines applicable to gaming.        32 IBIA at 136, 138.\n\n           We agree with the district court that \"[a]lthough the\n\npossibility that the parcel might be used for gaming activities was\n\nraised before the BIA, the bureau's determination that the parcel\n\nwould be used to provide housing was amply supported by the record.\n\nIn view of the deferential standard of review afforded to agency\n\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fdecisions under the APA, the bureau's determination in this regard\n\nmust be sustained.\"   Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178.\n\n\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to the Secretary.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                  \"Dissenting opinion follows.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part). I agree with\n\nand join the court's opinion, except as to part II. C. 4. (\"The\n\nState's alternative argument\").                 Unlike the majority, I conclude\n\nthat, pursuant to the Settlement Act, the Secretary can only take\n\nthe parcel into a restricted trust that provides for Rhode Island's\n\ncontinued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the parcel.\n\n              In part II. C. 1. of today's opinion, we hold that the\n\nSettlement Act and the JMOU it effectuates do not fairly disclose\n\nan intent to prohibit the Secretary from taking the Settlement\n\nLands or after acquired property into trust.                    But that is not the\n\nsame as saying that the State contemplated the Secretary making\n\nthese trust acquisitions.               In any event, what the State most\n\nassuredly     did   contemplate         was    the   applicability     of   its   laws\n\nthroughout      Rhode     Island.             The    question    is   whether     this\n\nunderstanding expressed by the parties in the JMOU and by Congress\n\nin    the    Settlement    Act     should       control    in    circumstances    not\n\nnecessarily foreseen by them.9\n\n              The State's preservation of jurisdiction was bargained\n\nfor and accomplished in at least two ways.                 First, with respect to\n\nthe   1800     acres    that     were    designated       Settlement    Lands,    the\n\n\n\n9\n    In this regard, it is worth noting that the Rhode Island\nSettlement Act was the first such settlement of Indian land claims\nin an eastern state.    It is not surprising then that not every\neventuality was explicitly covered. But that should not prevent\nthe court from attempting to effectuate the purpose of the JMOU and\nits implementing legislation to the extent possible.\n\n                                          -56-\n\fapplicability of Rhode Island's laws was ensured by including a\n\nprovision in the Settlement Act that \"Settlement Lands shall be\n\nsubject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the\n\nState of Rhode Island.\"      25 U.S.C. § 1708.    We have previously held\n\nthat, pursuant to this provision, the civil and criminal laws of\n\nRhode Island apply on the Settlement Lands, even though the lands\n\nwere later taken into trust by the Secretary.             Rhode Island v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 694-95 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Second,    the    Settlement    Act    extinguishes   potential\n\n\"Indian\" claims both as to the then disputed lands and throughout\n\nRhode   Island.      25   U.S.C.   §§   1705(a)(3);    1712(a)(3).       This\n\nextinguishment of Indian claims is consistent with the parties'\n\nagreement in the JMOU that \"Federal legislation shall be obtained\n\nthat eliminates all Indian claims of any kind, whether possessory,\n\nmonetary   or   otherwise,    involving    land   in   Rhode   Island,   and\n\neffectively clears the titles of landowners in Rhode Island of any\n\nsuch claim.\"      JMOU para. 6; H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 25, 26\n\n(emphasis added).     Reflecting this intent, the pertinent language\n\nof the Settlement Act provides that \"all claims . . . based upon\n\nany interest in or right involving such land or natural resources\n\n(including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims\n\nfor use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished . . . .\"\n\n25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(3) & 1712(a)(3).        This \"all claims\" language\n\n\n\n\n                                    -57-\n\fis broad enough to include sovereignty or aboriginal title based\n\nclaims contesting the applicability of Rhode Island law.\n\n            It is not surprising that the Settlement Act does not\n\nrefer explicitly to the preservation of State jurisdiction outside\n\nof the Settlement Lands.     As sovereign, Rhode Island already had\n\njurisdiction outside of Settlement Lands, and the Settlement Act\n\nextinguished any potential competing \"Indian\" claims to that land.\n\nThe only land about which there might have been doubt was the\n\nSettlement Lands, and as to that land, State jurisdiction was\n\nexpressly   preserved.     See   25   U.S.C.   §   1708.   Rhode   Island\n\nnegotiated against the background understanding that its laws would\n\napply throughout the State, and in the only instance where the\n\nparties thought there might be a question, they added an express\n\nprovision to preserve State jurisdiction.\n\n            That the Settlement Act does not say what Rhode Island\n\nlogically presumed -- that Rhode Island law would apply throughout\n\nRhode Island -- ought not be fatal to the State's exercise of its\n\nsovereignty. In the circumstances of this case, holding that Rhode\n\nIsland is divested of jurisdiction by the Secretary taking into\n\ntrust the adjacent parcel that was part of the original disputed\n\nlands upsets the fairly expressed expectations of the parties.        It\n\nalso produces an unwarranted anomalous relationship between the\n\nSettlement Lands and the after acquired parcel.        The more sensible\n\n\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fresult is to effectuate the likely intent of the JMOU parties that\n\nRhode Island's laws apply throughout Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n\n                              -59-\n\f",

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.R.I. 1995).             The District Court\n\nfound the proposed housing project detrimental to coastal and\n\ngroundwater   resources,   but   also   held   that    the      Parcel    was    a\n\n\"dependent Indian community\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1151\n\n(b) and therefore denied injunctive relief.            Id. at 355-57.           On\n\nappeal this court held that the land for the housing project was\n\nnot a \"dependent Indian community,\" because it lacked federal\n\nownership of the land and lacked federal action to \"set aside\" the\n\nland.   Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 914.            Thus, the Parcel\n\ncould not be considered Indian country under 18 U.S.C. § 1151, and\n\ntherefore the housing project being constructed on the site was not\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fexempt from state and local building and zoning restrictions.\n\nAccordingly, this court reversed the district court and directed\n\nthe district court to enter an order granting the injunction.   Id.\n\nat 922.\n\nC.   The Current Dispute\n\n           The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 authorizes the\n\nSecretary of the Interior to acquire lands in trust \"for the\n\npurpose of providing land for Indians.\"     25 U.S.C. § 465.    The\n\nTribe initially applied to have the United States take the 31-acre\n\nParcel into trust in 1993.   However, this application was held in\n\nabeyance while the Narragansett Elec. Co. litigation was pending.\n\nIn 1997, after the resolution of Narragansett Elec. Co. by this\n\ncourt in 1996, the Tribe submitted a second, updated application to\n\nthe Eastern Area Office of the BIA requesting trust acquisition of\n\nthe Parcel.   On March 6, 1998, the BIA informed the Tribe of its\n\ndecision to approve the Tribe’s application for trust acquisition\n\nof the Parcel.    Letter from Franklin Keel, Eastern Area Director,\n\nBIA, to Matthew Thomas, Chief Sachem, Narragansett Indian Tribe\n\n(Mar. 6, 1998).    In April 1998, the State and Town each appealed\n\nthe decision to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (the \"IBIA\").\n\nOn June 29, 2000, the IBIA affirmed the BIA's decision to take the\n\nland into trust.    Town of Charlestown v. E. Area Dir., Bureau of\n\nIndian Affairs, IBIA 98-88-A and 98-89-A, 35 IBIA 93 (2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            As the district court noted, the IBIA rejected the\n\nState's and Town's challenges to several determinations made by the\n\nBIA in accepting the Parcel into trust.\n\n            Specifically, the board concluded that the\n            Settlement Act did not prohibit the secretary\n            from acquiring lands other than the settlement\n            lands into trust for the benefit of the\n            Narragansetts.   35 IBIA 100-101.    Also, the\n            board rejected plaintiffs' argument that the\n            BIA,   either   in   all   trust   acquisition\n            proceedings, or in view of the specific\n            circumstances surrounding the tribe's trust\n            application, was required to consider the\n            possible use of the parcel for gaming purposes\n            under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"the\n            IGRA\"), 25 U.S.C. § 2701 et. seq., and to\n            impose a restriction precluding such use. 35\n            IBIA at 101-103.\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 172.        The IBIA further concluded that\n\nthe   BIA   was   not   required   to   prepare   a   federal   consistency\n\ndetermination for the proposed housing project as a prerequisite to\n\ntrust acquisition of the Parcel, and therefore the BIA did not\n\nviolate the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq.\n\n35 IBIA at 104-105.\n\n            The State then filed an action against the Secretary\n\nseeking reversal of the Secretary's decision and declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief.       In a detailed opinion, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment on behalf of the Secretary, upholding the\n\ndecision to take the Parcel into trust.\n\n            The State now appeals to this court.        The State alleges\n\nthat (1) the Secretary did not have the authority under the IRA to\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\facquire the land in trust for the benefit of the Narragansetts; (2)\n\nthe   IRA   constitutes   an   unlawful     delegation   of   congressional\n\nauthority and offends the Enclave Clause, the Admissions Clause,\n\nand the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution; (3) the Rhode Island\n\nIndian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1978 prohibits the creation of\n\nsovereign territory for the Narragansetts in Rhode Island; and (4)\n\nthe Secretary's acceptance of the Parcel into trust was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the APA\n\nand/or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\n\n                               II.   Analysis\n\n            A grant of summary judgment is appropriate when the\n\nevidence before the court shows that \"that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.

The Secretary's Authority to accept the Parcel into trust\n\n           The State asserts that the Secretary lacked statutory\n\nauthority to take the Parcel into trust under the IRA, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465, because the Narragansett Indian Tribe is not entitled to the\n\nIRA's benefits. Under the IRA, \"[t]he Secretary of the Interior is\n\nauthorized, in his discretion, to acquire . . . any interest in\n\nlands, . . . including trust or otherwise restricted allotments\n\n. . . for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"      25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465.   The IRA defines the term \"Indian\" as:\n\n           all persons of Indian descent who are members\n           of any recognized Indian tribe now under\n           Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are\n           descendants of such members who were, on\n           June 1, 1934, residing within the present\n           boundaries of any Indian reservation, and\n           shall further include all other persons of\n           one-half or more Indian blood . . . .\n\n25 U.S.C. § 479 (emphasis added).     The State argues that the term\n\n\"now\" in § 479 should be read as meaning \"June 1934\" and not\n\n\"today.\"   Thus, the state suggests that a two-prong test must be\n\nmet for a tribe to be entitled to the benefits of § 465 of the IRA:\n\nunless the tribe was both (1) recognized and (2) under federal\n\njurisdiction in 1934, the State would have us find that the\n\nSecretary is not allowed to take the State land into trust for the\n\nbenefit of the tribe.    Since the Narragansett Tribe was neither\n\n\n                               -13-\n\ffederally recognized, nor under federal jurisdiction in June of\n\n1934 when the IRA was enacted, the State argues that the Tribe is\n\nnot entitled to the benefits of the IRA.                   We disagree, and find\n\nthat   the   Secretary's    authority        under   the    IRA   extends   to   the\n\nNarragansett Tribe, regardless of the status of its acknowledgment\n\nin 1934.\n\n             The Narragansett Indian Tribe was acknowledged by the\n\nDepartment    of    the   Interior     in    1983.       In   acknowledging      the\n\nNarragansett Tribe, the Department stated that \"the Narragansett\n\ncommunity and its predecessors have existed autonomously since\n\nfirst contact, despite undergoing many modifications.\"                        Final\n\nDetermination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed.

Neither of these cases sufficiently supports the\n\nState's conclusion.\n\n           The Mississippi Choctaws' tribal status was extinguished\n\nin 1831 by the United States Senate's ratification of the Treaty of\n\nDancing Rabbit Creek.           Carcieri 290 F. Supp. 2d at 180 (citing\n\nState Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d at 640-43).                  After that time, the\n\nChoctaws did not maintain a tribal organization or manner of\n\nliving.   Thus, in 1934, when the IRA was enacted, \"the band was not\n\na tribe as defined by the IRA.\"           Id.    The Fifth Circuit therefore\n\nfound   that   the   IRA   of    1934   did    not   include    the   Mississippi\n\nChoctaws, and that even a 1944 Proclamation by the Department of\n\nInterior which \"purported to recognize the tribal organization of\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians,\" could not cure the Act's\n\nomission.      State Tax Comm'n, 505 F.2d at 642-43.\n\n              However,    just     two   years    later,    the   Supreme   Court\n\ndisagreed with the Fifth Circuit and held in United States v. John\n\nthat the IRA of 1934 does apply to the Mississippi Choctaws.                     The\n\nSupreme Court's reasoning was as follows:\n\n              The Court of Appeals and the Mississippi\n              Supreme Court held, and the State now argues,\n              that the 1944 proclamation had no effect\n              because the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934\n              was not intended to apply to the Mississippi\n              Choctaws. Assuming for the moment that\n              authority for the proclamation can be found\n              only in the 1934 Act, we find this argument\n              unpersuasive. The 1934 Act defined \"Indians\"\n              not only as \"all persons of Indian descent who\n              are members of any recognized [in 1934] tribe\n              now under Federal jurisdiction,\" and their\n              descendants who then were residing on any\n              Indian reservation, but also as \"all other\n              persons of one-half or more Indian blood.\" 48\n              Stat. 988, 25 U.S.C. § 479 (1976 ed.). There\n              is no doubt that persons of this description\n              lived in Mississippi, and were recognized as\n              such by Congress and by the Department of the\n              Interior,   at    the   time   the   Act   was\n              passed. . . . The references to the\n              Mississippi   Choctaws   in  the   legislative\n              history of the Act . . . confirm our view that\n              the Mississippi Choctaws were not to be\n              excepted from the general operation of the\n              1934 Act.\n\nJohn, 437 U.S. at 649-50 (parenthetical in original).\n\n              In John, the Supreme Court concluded that the IRA may be\n\ninvoked   for    the     benefit   of    groups   of   Indians    that   were    not\n\nrecognized as tribes in 1934.            The Court focused on the fact that,\n\nwhile   the    Choctaws    were    not   a   federally     recognized    tribe    in\n\n                                         -16-\n\fMississippi at the time the IRA was enacted, there were individual\n\n\"persons of one-half or more Indian blood\" living in Mississippi at\n\nthe time, and both the state and federal government recognized that\n\nthe Indians were there.     Id. at 650.        This is distinctly different\n\nfrom the State's two-part test, which would require that an Indian\n\ntribe be both (1) recognized and (2) under federal jurisdiction at\n\nthe time of the Act's passage.3\n\n              While the parenthetical \"[in 1934]\" lends support to the\n\nState's assertion that \"now\" should be read as \"in 1934,\" we agree\n\nwith the district court that it does not appear that the reading of\n\nthis particular term in the IRA was before the Supreme Court for\n\nconsideration, and the Court did not give further explanation for\n\nthe inclusion of the parenthetical.\n\n              Notwithstanding   the   potential    support   found    for   the\n\nState's assertion in the Supreme Court's inclusion of \"[in 1934]\"\n\nin John, we find that Congress's recent clarification of the Indian\n\nReorganization Act makes clear that the Secretary has the authority\n\nto   extend    IRA   benefits   to    all    federally   recognized   tribes,\n\nregardless of their acknowledgment status on the date of the IRA's\n\nenactment.      In 1994, Congress enacted the Federally Recognized\n\nIndian Tribe List Act (\"List Act\"), Pub. L. No. 103-454, 108 Stat.\n\n\n\n3\n   The land at issue in John was taken into trust between 1934 and\n1944, thus, the authority for the Secretary's actions could not be\njustified on the basis of federal recognition, regardless of\nwhether \"now\" means \"in 1934\" or not.\n\n                                      -17-\n\f4791 (1994), which requires the Secretary of the Interior to keep\n\na list of all federally recognized tribes, which \"should reflect\n\nall of the federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States\n\nwhich are eligible for the special programs and services provided\n\nby   the   United   States   to   Indians      because   of   their   status   as\n\nIndians.\"     Pub. L. No. 103-454, § 103.         That statute, codified as\n\n25 U.S.C. § 479a, defines the term \"tribe\" as \"any Indian or Alaska\n\nNative tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village or community that the\n\nSecretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian\n\ntribe.\"     25 U.S.C. § 479a(2).         The House Report accompanying the\n\nList Act explains that federal recognition \"establishes tribal\n\nstatus for all federal purposes.\"              H.R. Rep. No. 103-781, at 3\n\n(1994).     Earlier the same year, Congress amended the IRA, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-263, 108 Stat. 707, to clarify that:\n\n             [d]epartments or agencies of the United States\n             shall not promulgate any regulation or make\n             any decision or determination pursuant to the\n             Act of June 18, 1934 . . . with respect to a\n             federally   recognized   Indian   tribe   that\n             classifies,   enhances,   or  diminishes   the\n             privileges and immunities available to the\n             Indian tribe relative to other federally\n             recognized tribes by virtue of their status as\n             Indian tribes.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 476(f), and that any such determination by a federal\n\nagency     that   would   have    the    effect   of     discriminating   among\n\nrecognized tribes, \"shall have no force or effect.\" 25 U.S.C. § 476\n\n(g).\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            The federal acknowledgment regulations pursuant to which\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe attained federal recognition echo these\n\nenactments. The regulations provide that \"[t]he newly acknowledged\n\ntribe shall be considered a historic tribe and shall be entitled to\n\nthe   privileges        and    immunities      available         to   other    federally\n\nrecognized       historic      tribes   by    virtue       of    their   government-to-\n\ngovernment relationship with the United States.\" 25 C.F.R. 83.12(a)\n\n(2004).\n\n            These statutory and regulatory provisions make clear that\n\nthe Secretary's IRA authority extends to the Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe regardless of the status of its acknowledgment in 1934.\n\nIndeed, these provisions preclude the Secretary from making the\n\ndetermination sought by the State, that the tribe is ineligible for\n\nthe benefits of § 465 of the IRA because it was acknowledged after\n\nthe enactment of the IRA.            Such a determination would diminish the\n\nTribe's   privileges          in   relation    to       other    federally    recognized\n\ntribes, contrary to the amended IRA's plain language.                         25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 476(f).\n\nB.    Constitutional Challenges to 25 U.S.C. § 465\n\n            The      State         raises     multiple           challenges      to     the\n\nconstitutionality of the IRA, including a charge that the authority\n\ngranted     to    the    Secretary      to     take       land    into   trust     is    an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of congressional powers and that taking\n\nState   land     into    trust      pursuant       to    the    IRA   diminishes      state\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fsovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment, the Enclave\n\nClause, and the Admissions Clause, and exceeds Congress's authority\n\nunder the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution.\n\n           1.     The Nondelegation Doctrine\n\n           The    State   contends     that    §   465    of   the    IRA   is   an\n\nunconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Secretary\n\nof the Interior because the only limitation it places on the\n\nSecretary's trust-taking authority is that the trust acquisition\n\nmust be \"for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"                25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 465.     Thus, the State argues, Congress failed to articulate\n\nsufficient standards to guide the Secretary's trust determinations.\n\n           Article I, Section I, of the Constitution provides that\n\n\"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a\n\nCongress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and\n\nHouse of Representatives.\"       The Supreme Court has repeatedly said\n\nthat \"when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies\n\nCongress   must    'lay   down   by   legislative        act   an    intelligible\n\nprinciple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is\n\ndirected to conform.'\"      Whitman v.

We agree with the\n\nconclusion of the district court that this argument fails.\n\n          Congress' authority to regulate Indian affairs is clearly\n\nwithin the enumerated powers of the federal government.

The Admissions Clause\n\n          The State also contends that the trust acquisition of the\n\nParcel offends the Admissions Clause of the Constitution.     U.S.\n\nConst. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.   The Admissions Clause provides: \"New\n\nStates may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new\n\nState shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any\n\nother State; . . . or Parts of States, without the Consent of the\n\nLegislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.\"\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f           The trust acquisition, however, does not amount to the\n\nestablishment of a new state within the meaning of the Admissions\n\nClause.   For purposes of the Admissions Clause, \"state\" refers to\n\na body equal in power to the existing states.      Coyle v.

Since the trust acquisition\n\ndoes not confer statehood status, it does not offend the Admissions\n\nClause.\n\nC.   The Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act\n\n           We now turn to the State's argument that the Rhode Island\n\nIndian    Claims   Settlement   Act   prohibits   the   Secretary     from\n\nconverting the Parcel into an unrestricted federal trust.4             The\n\nState offers several arguments in support of its position.          First,\n\nthe State argues that allowing the Secretary to take non-Settlement\n\nLands into trust for the Tribe disrupts the special balance of\n\n\n4\n   When the Secretary takes land into trust for the use of Indians\npursuant to the IRA of 1934, the land is held under the\nsuperintendence of the Federal Government and is ordinarily exempt\nfrom certain state laws, including \"(1) state or local taxation,\nsee 25 U.S.C. § 465; (2) local zoning and regulatory requirements,\nsee 25 C.F.R. § 1.4(a); or, (3) state criminal and civil\njurisdiction, unless the tribe consents to such jurisdiction, see\n25 U.S.C. §§ 1321(a), 1322(a).\" Connecticut ex rel.

Second, the\n\nState contends that § 1707(c), as well as portions of § 1705(a)(3)\n\nand § 1712(a)(3) of the Settlement Act, eliminate the federal\n\ngovernment's ability to divest state sovereignty by acquiring land\n\ninto trust for the Tribe.              Third, the State argues that the 1976\n\nlawsuits settled the State's jurisdiction over the 3200 acres at\n\nissue in those suits, and thus the 31-acre Parcel, which was a part\n\nof the 3200 acres of contested lands, may not be accepted into\n\ntrust    by   the    Secretary.         Finally,    the   State   argues        in   the\n\nalternative that, regardless of whether the Parcel may be taken\n\ninto trust, the Settlement Act prohibits the Tribe and the Federal\n\ngovernment from making a claim that the Tribe's laws, rather than\n\nthe criminal and civil laws of the State of Rhode Island, should\n\napply on Tribal land.\n\n              The Secretary responds that the Settlement Act does not\n\nprohibit the Settlement Lands from being acquired into trust, and\n\nargues    that      the    Act   addresses    the   extinguishment         of   Indian\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\faboriginal land claims in Rhode Island without prohibiting future\n\nland transactions.            We agree that the Settlement Act does not\n\nprohibit the Parcel from being taken into trust by the Secretary,\n\nand we hold that the trust may be \"unrestricted,\" thus removing the\n\nland from the criminal and civil jurisdiction of Rhode Island.\n\n              The     issue    here       is     primarily       one     of    statutory\n\nconstruction.        Does the Settlement Act preclude the Secretary from\n\ntaking land, in addition to the Settlement Lands, into trust on\n\nbehalf   of    the    Tribe?       Does    the     Settlement      Act   prohibit      the\n\nSecretary from removing lands not included in the Settlement Lands\n\nfrom under the laws and jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island?\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that \"statutes are to be construed\n\nliberally     in     favor    of   the    Indians    with    ambiguous        provisions\n\ninterpreted to their benefit.\"             Chickasaw Nation v.

Whether the Settlement Act precludes trust\n                 acquisition\n\n            The State argues that § 1705 and § 1712 of the Settlement\n\nAct provide a comprehensive extinguishment of the ability of any\n\ntribe,    including    the    Narragansetts,       to     claim   territorial\n\nsovereignty anywhere in the State of Rhode Island through a two-\n\npronged   approach    of   first,    terminating    all     aboriginal   title\n\nthroughout Rhode Island, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2), 1712(a)(2), and,\n\nsecond, extinguishing any claims by any tribe, or successor in\n\ninterest, against the State based upon \"any interest in or right\n\ninvolving    land\"    in   Rhode    Island,   25   U.S.C.    §§   1705(a)(3),\n\n1712(a)(3).

These provisions, the State asserts, are the\n\nresult of the careful balance that was negotiated in the settlement\n\nof the 1976 lawsuits.

The    State   argues         that   the\n\nSecretary's      action     of    taking     the   Parcel     into    trust,      thereby\n\nremoving it from the jurisdiction of the State's criminal and civil\n\nlaws,    upsets      this       negotiated     and       agreed-upon       balance,      as\n\nimplemented by the Settlement Act.\n\n               These sections of the Settlement Act show that Congress\n\nintended   to     enact     a    wide-reaching       resolution      of    any    and   all\n\ncontested transfers of land by Indians qua Indians in Rhode Island.\n\nThe JMOU and Settlement Act clearly resolve all prior contested\n\nland    transfers     and       related    claims     involving       Indian      tribes,\n\nincluding the extinguishment of aboriginal title in Rhode Island.\n\n               It is not clear, however, that Congress intended to\n\npreclude the Narragansetts from ever expanding from the Settlement\n\nLands if the Tribe became federally recognized.                      Neither the JMOU\n\nnor the Settlement Act provides that lands outside the Settlement\n\nLands may not be acquired or held in trust.                  In fact, the JMOU and\n\nSettlement Act do not make direct reference to the IRA at all.                          The\n\nomission of an explicit prohibition on trust acquisition and\n\nfederal superintendence of non-Settlement lands is significant,\n\nbecause settlement acts resolving Indian claims in other states did\n\nexplicitly prohibit future trust acquisitions.                            See, e.g., 25\n\nU.S.C. § 1724(e) (precluding application of § 465 of the IRA in the\n\nMaine Settlement Act); Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal, 228 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                           -31-\n\f90 (finding that the absence of a provision analogous to the\n\nprohibition of § 465 of the IRA in the Maine Settlement Act\n\nconfirmed \"that the Settlement Act was not meant to eliminate the\n\nSecretary's power under the IRA to take land purchased without\n\nsettlement funds into trust for the benefit of the Tribe\").\n\n             The    Settlement     Act    explicitly        anticipated   that   the\n\nNarragansetts might eventually be federally acknowledged, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1707(c), and the JMOU provided that the Narragansett Tribe would\n\n\"have the same right to petition for [federal] recognition and\n\nservices as other groups.\"          JMOU para. 15, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453,\n\nat 27.   As we noted, one of the benefits of federal recognition is\n\nthe right to apply to have land taken into trust by the federal\n\ngovernment for the benefit of the tribe, pursuant to Section 5 of\n\nthe IRA.\n\n             At the time the JMOU was negotiated and the Settlement\n\nAct was enacted, the Narragansetts had not yet been acknowledged as\n\na federally recognized tribe.             Thus, they were ineligible at that\n\ntime   to   apply    for     the   benefits      of   the    IRA,   including    the\n\nacquisition of land into trust by the Secretary of the Interior for\n\ntheir use.    As we noted above, trust acquisition typically results\n\nin the removal of the land from State jurisdiction in favor of\n\ntribal jurisdiction with federal superintendence.                   Therefore, the\n\nimmediate     result    of    §    1708    was   indeed      that   the   laws   and\n\njurisdiction of the State would remain in force throughout the\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\fstate at the time of the JMOU and enactment of the Settlement Act.\n\nOnce the tribe received federal recognition in 1983, however, it\n\ngained the same benefits as other tribes, including the right to\n\napply to have land taken into trust pursuant to § 465 of the IRA.\n\n              2.    The Secretary's duties and liabilities under the\n                     Settlement Act\n\n              The Settlement Act provides that \"[u]pon the discharge of\n\nthe Secretary's duties under §§ 1704-1706, and 1707 of this title,\n\nthe United States shall have no further duties or liabilities under\n\nthis subchapter with respect to the Indian Corporation or its\n\nsuccessor, the State Corporation, or the settlement lands . . . .\"\n\n25   U.S.C.    §    1707(c).      The   State    contends      that   this    passage\n\nprohibits the federal government from divesting the State of\n\nsovereignty over the Parcel by putting the land into trust for the\n\nTribe.\n\n              However, § 1707(c) does not preclude the Secretary from\n\nacquiring     additional       lands    in   trust    for    the   benefit    of    the\n\nNarragansetts.       Again, we point out that the Narragansetts did not\n\nobtain federal acknowledgment of their tribal status until 1983.\n\nDespite the fact that the JMOU and Settlement Act both contemplated\n\nthe future acknowledgment of the Narragansett tribe by the federal\n\ngovernment, no explicit limitation was placed on the Secretary's\n\nauthority      to    accept      additional      land       into   trust     for    the\n\nNarragansetts' benefit.          Cf.    Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act,\n\n25   U.S.C.    §    1724   (e)    (\"Except      for   the     provisions     of    this\n\n                                         -33-\n\fsubchapter, the United States shall have no other authority to\n\nacquire lands or natural resources in trust for the benefit of\n\nIndians . . . in the State of Maine.\").           We therefore agree with\n\nthe district court that such a restriction cannot reasonably be\n\ninferred.    Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 184.\n\n            3.   Settlement of the 1976 Lawsuits\n\n            The State argues that the trust acquisition of the Parcel\n\nis precluded by the doctrine of res judicata because the Parcel was\n\namong the 3200 acres at issue in the 1976 lawsuits that were\n\nultimately settled by the JMOU and implementation of the Settlement\n\nAct.   The Parcel was part of the 1400 acres that remained with the\n\ndefendant property owners pursuant to the settlement.              Thus, the\n\nState contends that the Tribe relinquished its claimed interest in\n\nthe exercise of sovereignty over the 1400 acres, including the 31-\n\nacre Parcel.\n\n            This argument is without merit.        As the district court\n\nnoted,   \"the    doctrine   of   res   judicata    operates   to    bar   the\n\nrelitigation of issues that were or could have been raised in an\n\nearlier action between the same parties prescinding from the same\n\nset of operative facts.\"     Id. at 186 (quoting In re Carvalho, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200537\"><a href=\"/opinion/200537/federal-national-v-carvalho/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st Cir. 2003)) (citations omitted).                  Since the\n\nfederal government was not a party to the 1976 lawsuits or the\n\nJMOU, the principles of res judicata do not apply.                 The State\n\nattempts to salvage the argument on appeal by contending that the\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fUnited States maintains a special relationship with the Tribe such\n\nthat they may be considered a legal unity.                           This argument is\n\nultimately insufficient because the fee-to-trust acquisition of the\n\nParcel    by    the      Secretary,    and    the    consequences          thereof,   are\n\ndifferent issues than the claims of aboriginal right which were\n\nlitigated in the 1976 lawsuits and resolved by the JMOU and\n\nSettlement Act.           Accordingly, even if there were a substantial\n\nidentity of the parties in the 1976 and the instant litigation,\n\nthere    would      be   no   identity   of     claims,       and    thus,    the   trust\n\nacquisition is not barred by res judicata.\n\n               4.   The State's alternative argument\n\n               Finally, the State argues that even if the Settlement Act\n\ncan be read to allow the Secretary to take the Parcel into trust\n\nfor the Narragansetts, the trust must remain subject to the State's\n\ncivil    and    criminal      jurisdiction      in    order    to    comply    with   the\n\nSettlement Act, which extinguished aboriginal title throughout\n\nRhode Island, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2); 1712(a)(2), as well as\n\nIndian claims against the State based upon \"any interest in or\n\nright    involving\"        land   in   Rhode     Island,       id.    §§     1705(a)(3);\n\n1712(a)(3).         For many of the same reasons we determined that the\n\nSettlement Act does not prohibit the Secretary from acquiring the\n\nParcel into trust, we find that the trust need not be restricted to\n\npreserve the State's jurisdiction.                   Although the Settlement Act\n\nexpressly provides that the 1800 acres of Settlement Lands must\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fremain subject to the State's jurisdiction, 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a),\n\nneither the Act nor the JMOU prohibits the Tribe from expanding on\n\nits lands or from taking advantage of the benefits associated with\n\nfederal recognition, which include the trust acquisitions and\n\nfederal superintendence.\n\n             The     State    suggests       that   the    Settlement       Act's\n\nextinguishment of all aboriginal title in 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(2)\n\nand § 1712(a)(2) \"necessarily implies\" that the State's laws and\n\njurisdiction are preserved everywhere else in the State.                    While\n\nthat   may   have    been    true   before    the   Narragansett    Tribe     was\n\nrecognized by the federal government and became eligible for\n\nfederal benefits, it is no longer the case today.                  As we note\n\nabove,   the       JMOU   specifically       provided     that   although     the\n\nNarragansett Tribe would \"not receive federal recognition for\n\npurposes of eligibility for Department of the Interior services as\n\na result of congressional implementation of . . . this memorandum,\n\n[] it will have the same right to petition for such recognition and\n\nservices as other groups.\"          JMOU at para. 15;       H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n\n1453 at 27.\n\n             The State argues that the extinguishment of aboriginal\n\ntitle expressly eliminates tribal territorial sovereignty.                     To\n\nsupport this assertion, the State points to two cases.              First, the\n\nState cites Bates v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89584\"><a href=\"/opinion/89584/bates-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207-08 (1877), for the\n\nproposition that the extinguishment of aboriginal title eliminates\n\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fIndian country.     We decline to rely on Bates, because the case\n\npredates the IRA of 1934, as well as modern Supreme Court case law\n\ndefining Indian country, and the statutory definition of \"Indian\n\ncountry\" that ratified that case law in 18 U.S.C. § 1151.5               The\n\nsecond case the State cites is a Supreme Court case reversing a\n\nNinth Circuit holding that the Native Village of Venetie was\n\n\"Indian country,\" and citing with approval the concurrence of one\n\nNinth   Circuit   judge,   who   viewed   the   broad   extinguishment   of\n\naboriginal title in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA)\n\nas leaving Native Alaskans as sovereigns \"without territorial\n\n5\n    Congress defines \"Indian country\" as:\n\n      (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation\n      under the jurisdiction of the United States Government,\n      notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and,\n      including rights-of-way running through the reservation,\n      (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders\n      of the United States whether within the original or\n      subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether\n      within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all\n      Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not\n      been extinguished, including rights-of-way running\n      through the same.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1151.\n\n     At issue in this case is whether the Parcel is a \"dependent\nIndian community\" as defined in § 1151(b) of the statute.       The\nSupreme Court has held that \"a federal set-aside and a federal\nsuperintendence requirement must be satisfied for a finding of a\n'dependent Indian community.'\" Alaska v.

If the Parcel may be taken\ninto unrestricted trust, it will be \"Indian country\" because (1)\nthe land will be \"set-aside\" by the Federal Government and occupied\nby an Indian community, and (2) the community will be \"dependent\"\non the Federal Government in the sense that \"the Federal Government\nand the [Narragansetts], rather than the State[], [will] exercise\nprimary jurisdiction over the land. . . .\" Id.\n\n                                   -37-\n\freach.\" Native Village of Venetie, 522 U.S. at 526.                 The situation\n\nconcerning     the   land    owned   by   the   Native    Village    of   Venetie,\n\nhowever, is different from the issue here.                 In enacting ANCSA,\n\nCongress stated that settlement of the Alaskan land claims was to\n\nbe accomplished \"without creating a reservation system or lengthy\n\nwardship or trusteeship.\"        43 U.S.C. § 1601(b).       To that end, ANCSA\n\nactually revoked the reservations that had previously been set\n\naside   for    Alaskan      natives,   including    the    Native    Village   of\n\nVenetie's reservation.         It was as a result of this revocation that\n\nthe land ceased to be Indian country, not the extinguishment of\n\naboriginal title.\n\n              Extinguishing aboriginal title merely terminates the\n\nright of Indian nations to occupy their ancestral lands.                  It is a\n\nright of occupancy and use.          See County of Oneida v.

The Narragansetts did not assert\n\ntheir aboriginal title to the Parcel when they petitioned the\n\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fFederal Government to take the land into trust, as the State\n\nsuggests.6     Rather, they exercised their statutory privilege to\n\nmake the request, pursuant to the IRA, and the Secretary had\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine whether to grant that request.\n\n             The State incorrectly construes a recent Supreme Court\n\ndecision, City of Sherill v. Oneida Indian Nation, 544 U.S. ---,\n\n125    S.   Ct.   1478   (2005),     in    an   attempt   to   buttress    its\n\ninterpretation. City of Sherill involved an attempt by the Oneidas\n\nto    unilaterally    reassert     their    sovereignty   over   lands    they\n\npurchased in fee simple. The Oneidas argued that they had \"unified\n\nfee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over\n\nthe parcels.\"        Id. at 1481.     The Supreme Court responded that\n\n\"[t]he Oneidas long ago relinquished the reins of government and\n\ncannot regain them through open-market purchases from current\n\ntitleholders.\" Id. at 1483. The Narragansetts, on the other hand,\n\nattempted to do nothing of the sort.             Rather, the Narragansetts\n\nused the precise mechanism the Supreme Court stated that the\n\nOneidas should have used: application for trust acquisition of the\n\nland pursuant to § 465.      Id. at 20-21.\n\n             The State also claims that converting the Parcel to\n\nunrestricted trust is incompatible with the second extinguishment\n\nprong of the Settlement Act:        the extinguishment of any claims by\n\n\n6\n   Assertion of any aboriginal title by the Narragansetts would\nclearly have been impossible because the tribe's aboriginal title\nwas extinguished by the Settlement Act. 25 U.S.C. §§ 1705, 1712.\n\n                                     -39-\n\fany tribe, including the Narragansetts, or any \"successor in\n\ninterest,\" against the State or the Town based upon \"any interest\n\nin or right involving\" land in Rhode Island.          25 U.S.C. §§ 1705\n\n(a)(3); 1712(a)(3).    The State claims that converting the Parcel\n\ninto   unrestricted   trust   will   render   this   latter   prong   mere\n\nsurplusage.   We disagree.\n\n           We note two things that the State fails to mention.\n\nFirst, aboriginal title may form the basis not only of claims for\n\npossession or damages, but also for trespass or other subsidiary\n\nclaims.   See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 8.     Thus, there is no basis\n\nfor the State's surplusage argument.     Second, the full language of\n\n§ 1705(a)(3) provides that:\n\n           by virtue of the approval of a transfer of\n           land or natural resources effected by this\n           section [meaning transfers by the Narragansett\n           tribe or any predecessor or successor in\n           interest], or an extinguishment of aboriginal\n           title effected thereby, all claims against the\n           United States, any State or subdivision\n           thereof, or any other person or entity, by the\n           Indian Corporation or any other entity\n           presently or at any time in the past known as\n           the Narragansett Tribe of Indians, or any\n           predecessor or successor in interest, member\n           or stockholder thereof, or any other Indian,\n           Indian nation, or tribe of Indians, arising\n           subsequent to the transfer and based upon any\n           interest in or right involving such land or\n           natural resources (including but not limited\n           to claims for trespass damages or claims for\n           use and occupancy) shall be regarded as\n           extinguished as of the date of the transfer.\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1705(a)(3) (emphases added).        This language suggests\n\nthat Congress intended to extinguish all claims that could arise as\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\fa result of transfers of land by the Narragansetts, many of which\n\nwere made in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, or claims that\n\nthe Narragansetts might have had by virtue of their aboriginal\n\ntitle prior to extinguishment.

We disagree with the State, and for essentially the same\n\nreasons as set forth in the district court's decision, we find that\n\nthe Secretary's decision to accept the Parcel into trust did not\n\nviolate the APA.\n\n            1.     Whether the BIA failed to conduct an independent\n                   evaluation of the Tribe's trust application\n\n            The        State   points      to     substantial       passages      in    the\n\nSecretary's       decision,       which    contain       verbatim     restatements      of\n\ninformation provided by the Narragansett Tribe in support of their\n\n1993 trust application, as evidence that the BIA failed to conduct\n\nan independent evaluation of the Tribe's 1997 application.                             The\n\nState    claims    that    the     BIA    relied    exclusively       on    the   Tribe's\n\nassertions and failed to consider other important facts that\n\noccurred between 1993 and 1997.                 Thus, the State asserts that the\n\n                                           -44-\n\fBIA made an arbitrary and capricious decision and abused its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            However, there is ample evidence in the administrative\n\nrecord that the BIA conducted its own, independent evaluation of\n\nthe Tribe's application and that it considered the events following\n\nthe Tribe's 1993 application.            For example, between 1993 and 1997,\n\nthe BIA required the Tribe to supplement its initial Environmental\n\nAssessment; conducted an environmental hazard survey of the subject\n\n31-acre    Parcel       (Supp.    App.    99);     required     confirmation    of\n\nconsistency with the State’s Coastal Resources Management Plan\n\n(Supp. App. 102-03); was well aware of the Narragansett Electric\n\nlitigation (Supp. App. 10-12, 13-93); was apprised of, and offered\n\nto facilitate, negotiations between the Tribe, the Town, and the\n\nState   concerning       both    environmental     and   jurisdictional     issues\n\nattendant to the Tribe's development of the Parcel (Supp. App. 1);\n\nand specifically requested that the Regional Solicitor address\n\nseveral legal and jurisdictional issues raised by the State in its\n\ncomments     to    the     BIA     on    the      Tribe's     trust   application\n\n(Supp. App. 101).        This shows that the BIA did not rely solely on\n\nthe findings of the Tribe and did conduct its own evaluation.                  We\n\nagree     with    the    district       court's     finding    that   the    BIA's\n\ndetermination was the result of its own, independent evaluation of\n\nthe 1997 application.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\f          2.   Whether the BIA properly applied the 25 C.F.R.\n               § 151.10 factors\n\n          The State claims that the BIA failed to apply the proper\n\ncriteria when it evaluated the Tribe's application for trust\n\nacquisition.   The regulations governing the BIA's evaluation of\n\napplications to have land taken in trust are laid out at 25 C.F.R.\n\n§ 151.   The factors to be considered for an \"on-reservation\"\n\nacquisition are found in § 151.10 and the factors for an \"off-\n\nreservation\" acquisition are in § 151.11.   In making the decision\n\nto accept the Parcel into trust, the BIA considered the on-\n\nreservation factors in § 151.10,8 which include:\n\n          (a) The existence of statutory authority for\n          the acquisition and any limitations contained\n          in such authority;\n          (b) The need of the individual Indian or the\n          tribe for additional land;\n          (c) The purposes for which the land will be\n          used;\n          . . .\n          (e) If the land to be acquired is in\n          unrestricted fee status, the impact on the\n          State and its political subdivisions resulting\n          from the removal of the land from the tax\n          rolls;\n\n\n\n8\n   For the purpose of 25 C.F.R. § 151, land is considered to be\n\"on-reservation\" if it is \"located within or contiguous to an\nIndian reservation,\" and \"off-reservation\" where \"the land is\nlocated outside of and noncontiguous to the tribe's reservation.\"\nThe State challenges the finding by the BIA and district court that\nthe Parcel is adjacent to Settlement Lands, yet recognizes that\nthis determination is insignificant to the application of either\nsection in this case, as the sections differ only slightly.\nCompare § 151.10 with § 151.11. As we have previously noted, the\nParcel is adjacent to the Settlement Lands, but separated from them\nby a town road. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 911.\n\n                               -46-\n\f          (f) Jurisdictional problems and potential\n          conflicts of land use which may arise; and\n          (g) If the land to be acquired is in fee\n          status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs\n          is equipped to discharge the additional\n          responsibilities     resulting    from    the\n          acquisition of the land in trust status.\n          . . .\n\n25 C.F.R. § 151.10.\n\n          The State claims that the BIA failed to consider \"the\n\nneed of . . . the tribe for additional land,\" § 151.10(b).     The\n\nState also questions whether the BIA sufficiently scrutinized \"the\n\ntribe's justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition\"\n\nas required by § 151.11(b).     The criteria required pursuant to\n\n§ 151.11(b) are as follows:\n\n          The location of the land relative to state\n          boundaries,   and    its   distance   from   the\n          boundaries of the tribe's reservation, shall\n          be considered as follows: as the distance\n          between the tribe's reservation and the land\n          to be acquired increases, the Secretary shall\n          give   greater    scrutiny    to  the    tribe's\n          justification of anticipated benefits from the\n          acquisition. . . .\n\n25 C.F.R. § 151.11(b).\n\n          As we have noted, a reviewing court will determine only\n\n\"whether the [BIA's] decision was based on a consideration of the\n\nrelevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of\n\njudgment.\" See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416.\n\nThe fact that the BIA found the Parcel, which is across a town road\n\nfrom the Settlement Lands, to be \"contiguous\" to the Settlement\n\nLands that are currently in trust, and thus determined that it\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fshould consider the \"on-reservation\" factors enumerated in 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.10, is certainly not clear error and is within the\n\nSecretary's discretion.         It was not necessary for the BIA to\n\nconsider the factors under § 151.11, since it found § 151.10 to be\n\napplicable for this trust determination.              While the Secretary need\n\nnot consider § 151.11(b), we note that the close proximity between\n\nthe Tribe's Settlement Lands and the Parcel would not have required\n\nthe   Secretary    to   give   the   greatest    scrutiny    to   the   \"tribe's\n\njustification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\"                 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.11(b).      In sum, the record shows that the BIA complied\n\nwith § 151.10, including evaluating the Tribe's need for the\n\nadditional land, and we do not find that the Secretary has made a\n\nclear error of judgment.\n\n           3.     The NAHASDA Cooperation Agreement\n\n           At the time of the BIA's decision to acquire the Parcel\n\ninto trust, HUD was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the\n\nNative   American    Housing    Assistance      and    Self-Determination   Act\n\n(\"NAHASDA\") for any tribe's housing development unless an agreement\n\nfor local cooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had\n\nbeen entered into by the tribe and the local government where the\n\nhousing was located.       25 U.S.C. § 4111(c).          In the instant case,\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the\n\nTown.    However, § 4111(c) has now been amended to permit HUD to\n\nwaive the cooperation agreement requirement, 25 U.S.C. § 4111(c),\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fas amended, Pub. L. 106-569, Dec. 27, 2000, and the Tribe obtained\n\nsuch a waiver.\n\n          The State argues that this waiver was invalid because the\n\nState apparently did not receive notice of the Tribe's application\n\nfor a waiver until after it was granted.      On appeal, the State\n\ncontends that if the BIA accepted the waiver, the BIA has inherited\n\nthe legal error and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\n\nAs the district court noted, \"25 U.S.C. § 4111(c) establishes a\n\nprerequisite to HUD's award of housing grants. It does not pertain\n\nto the BIA's trust acquisition authority.\"    Carcieri, 290 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 179.     The BIA is obligated to consider the appropriate\n\nfactors enumerated in 25 C.F.R. § 151, which includes a requirement\n\nthat the Secretary consider the \"need of the individual Indian or\n\nthe tribe for the additional land,\" and \"[t]he purposes for which\n\nthe land will be used.\"   25 C.F.R. § 151.10(b)-(c).    It is clear\n\nfrom the record that the BIA has properly considered the Tribe's\n\nneed for additional housing as well as the fact that the funding to\n\npurchase the Parcel was provided to the Tribe's Housing Authority\n\nwith the understanding that the lands would be used for housing.\n\nHowever, nothing in the § 151.10 factors requires the BIA to ensure\n\nthat a local cooperation agreement is in place for an Indian\n\nHousing project.\n\n          4.   Environmental Considerations\n\n\n\n\n                               -49-\n\f            The National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\") and its\n\nsupporting regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental\n\nQuality    (\"CEQ\")   direct    federal    agencies       to     consider     the\n\nenvironmental impacts of agency decisions.           42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-\n\n4370(e); 40 C.F.R. § 1500-1518 (2004).         The State claims that the\n\nSecretary and BIA failed to consider environmental impacts in\n\nreaching the decision to accept the Parcel into trust because no\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") was prepared.                 The State\n\nalso argues that the BIA failed to conduct its own evaluation of\n\nthe environmental impacts and instead improperly relied on an\n\nenvironmental   assessment    (\"EA\")    submitted   by    the      Narragansett\n\nTribe.    We disagree.\n\n            Federal agencies are required to prepare an EIS for any\n\naction that could significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.    42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(c); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27.                NEPA\n\nprovides that \"to the fullest extent possible . . . (2) all\n\nagencies of the Federal Government shall . . . (c) include in every\n\nrecommendation or report on proposals for . . . major Federal\n\nactions    significantly    affecting    the    quality       of    the    human\n\nenvironment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\n\n. . . (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 4332(2)(c).     However, in the absence of a finding that the\n\nproposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human\n\nenvironment, the BIA was not required to prepare an EIS.

The applicant may\n\nprepare the EA provided that the agency \"make[s] its own evaluation\n\nof the environmental issues and take[s] responsibility for the\n\nscope and content of the environmental assessment.\"                       40 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1506.5(b). In this case, the BIA followed its standard operating\n\nprocedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an EA\n\nfrom   the   Tribe     and   considering       it    along    with    supplemental\n\ninformation the BIA requested from the Tribe and information\n\ngathered independently by the BIA.                   See Externally Initiated\n\nProposals, NEPA Handbook 4.2 B (\"When the proposed Bureau action is\n\na response to an externally initiated proposal . . . the applicant\n\nwill normally be required to prepare the EA, if one is required,\n\nand    to    provide     supporting       information        and     analyses    as\n\nappropriate.)\"         After    reviewing      the    EA     and    the   requisite\n\nsupplemental    information,      the    BIA   completed      its    environmental\n\nanalysis and issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -51-\n\fThe BIA's issuance of a FONSI thus satisfied its responsibilities\n\nunder NEPA.    See 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(e).\n\n            Separately, the State contends that the BIA should have\n\nobtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the Costal\n\nZone Management Act (\"CZMA\") before making its trust determination.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1451-1465.     The CZMA requires state consultation on\n\nfederally permitted coastal development activities.   Specifically,\n\n§ 1456 of the CZMA provides, in relevant part:\n\n            (1)(A) Each Federal agency activity within or\n            outside the coastal zone that affects any land\n            or water use or natural resource of the\n            coastal zone shall be carried out in a manner\n            which is consistent to the maximum extent\n            practicable with the enforceable policies of\n            approved State management programs. A Federal\n            agency activity shall be subject to this\n            paragraph unless it is subject to paragraph\n            (2) or (3).\n            . . .\n            (C) Each Federal agency carrying out an\n            activity subject to paragraph (1) shall\n            provide a consistency determination to the\n            relevant State agency . . .\n            (2) Any Federal agency which shall undertake\n            any development project in the coastal zone of\n            a state shall insure that the project is, to\n            the maximum extent practicable, consistent\n            with the enforceable policies of approved\n            State management programs.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1456.   The State asserts that the BIA's failure to take\n\ndirect action to ensure the housing project was consistent with the\n\nRhode Island Coastal Zone Management Program (\"RICZMP\") before\n\nmaking its trust determination was a violation of the CZMA.      We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                -52-\n\f           The State has failed to demonstrate that a consistency\n\nreview of the Tribe's housing development was necessary at the\n\ntrust acquisition stage.      The development of the Parcel is a\n\nproject that was commenced by the Tribe, in conjunction with HUD,\n\nprior to the Tribe's application for trust acquisition.          The CRMC\n\ncorrectly recognized that the development of the Parcel was a\n\nseparate   matter   which   required    its    own   federal   consistency\n\ndetermination, and properly found that the Tribe's application for\n\ntrust status was consistent with the RICZMP.          Id.; App. Tab 5 at\n\nEx. 11.\n\n           5.   The IGRA\n\n           Finally, the State contends that the true purpose of the\n\nTribe's application for trust acquisition is the development of\n\ngambling facilities on the Parcel –- rather than development of\n\ntribal housing as the BIA found in its evaluation pursuant to 25\n\nC.F.R. § 151.10(c) -- and that the BIA's failure to consider the\n\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"), 25 U.S.C. §§ 2710-2721, in\n\nits decision was an abuse of discretion.       The State argues that the\n\nSecretary's decision to acquire the Parcel in trust should be\n\nreversed and that further inquiry into whether the Parcel would be\n\nused for gaming purposes is required.         We disagree.\n\n           There is no evidence that the Tribe intended to use the\n\nParcel for anything other than tribal housing, as determined by the\n\nBIA.   \"In fact, after the plaintiffs expressed concern over the\n\n\n                                 -53-\n\fpotential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel, the\n\ntribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a housing\n\ndevelopment and stated that it had 'no immediate plans for any\n\nfurther   future    development.'     Admin.   Rec.,   Vol.   II,   Tab   N.\"\n\nCarcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178.\n\n           As support for its position, the State points to an IBIA\n\ndecision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the\n\nBIA's failure to consider the impact of a potential casino, even\n\nthough the applicants denied any intention of using the property\n\nfor a casino.      Village of Ruidoso, New Mexico v. Albuquerque Area\n\nDir. Bureau of Indian Affairs, 32 IBIA 130 (1998).             However, in\n\nVillage of Ruidoso, although the Tribe denied that the application\n\nfor trust acquisition was for gaming purposes, the IBIA determined\n\nthat it was clear from the planned gaming-related uses of the\n\nproperty, and the fact that the property was given to the Tribe by\n\na company that the BIA \"apparently understood to have some gaming\n\nconnection with the Tribe,\" that the application was for gaming\n\npurposes and that the BIA's determination should have been made\n\nunder the guidelines applicable to gaming.        32 IBIA at 136, 138.\n\n           We agree with the district court that \"[a]lthough the\n\npossibility that the parcel might be used for gaming activities was\n\nraised before the BIA, the bureau's determination that the parcel\n\nwould be used to provide housing was amply supported by the record.\n\nIn view of the deferential standard of review afforded to agency\n\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fdecisions under the APA, the bureau's determination in this regard\n\nmust be sustained.\"   Carcieri, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 178.\n\n\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to the Secretary.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                  \"Dissenting opinion follows.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part). I agree with\n\nand join the court's opinion, except as to part II. C. 4. (\"The\n\nState's alternative argument\").                 Unlike the majority, I conclude\n\nthat, pursuant to the Settlement Act, the Secretary can only take\n\nthe parcel into a restricted trust that provides for Rhode Island's\n\ncontinued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the parcel.\n\n              In part II. C. 1. of today's opinion, we hold that the\n\nSettlement Act and the JMOU it effectuates do not fairly disclose\n\nan intent to prohibit the Secretary from taking the Settlement\n\nLands or after acquired property into trust.                    But that is not the\n\nsame as saying that the State contemplated the Secretary making\n\nthese trust acquisitions.               In any event, what the State most\n\nassuredly     did   contemplate         was    the   applicability     of   its   laws\n\nthroughout      Rhode     Island.             The    question    is   whether     this\n\nunderstanding expressed by the parties in the JMOU and by Congress\n\nin    the    Settlement    Act     should       control    in    circumstances    not\n\nnecessarily foreseen by them.9\n\n              The State's preservation of jurisdiction was bargained\n\nfor and accomplished in at least two ways.                 First, with respect to\n\nthe   1800     acres    that     were    designated       Settlement    Lands,    the\n\n\n\n9\n    In this regard, it is worth noting that the Rhode Island\nSettlement Act was the first such settlement of Indian land claims\nin an eastern state.    It is not surprising then that not every\neventuality was explicitly covered. But that should not prevent\nthe court from attempting to effectuate the purpose of the JMOU and\nits implementing legislation to the extent possible.\n\n                                          -56-\n\fapplicability of Rhode Island's laws was ensured by including a\n\nprovision in the Settlement Act that \"Settlement Lands shall be\n\nsubject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the\n\nState of Rhode Island.\"      25 U.S.C. § 1708.    We have previously held\n\nthat, pursuant to this provision, the civil and criminal laws of\n\nRhode Island apply on the Settlement Lands, even though the lands\n\nwere later taken into trust by the Secretary.             Rhode Island v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694-95 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Second,    the    Settlement    Act    extinguishes   potential\n\n\"Indian\" claims both as to the then disputed lands and throughout\n\nRhode   Island.      25   U.S.C.   §§   1705(a)(3);    1712(a)(3).       This\n\nextinguishment of Indian claims is consistent with the parties'\n\nagreement in the JMOU that \"Federal legislation shall be obtained\n\nthat eliminates all Indian claims of any kind, whether possessory,\n\nmonetary   or   otherwise,    involving    land   in   Rhode   Island,   and\n\neffectively clears the titles of landowners in Rhode Island of any\n\nsuch claim.\"      JMOU para. 6; H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 25, 26\n\n(emphasis added).     Reflecting this intent, the pertinent language\n\nof the Settlement Act provides that \"all claims . . . based upon\n\nany interest in or right involving such land or natural resources\n\n(including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims\n\nfor use and occupancy) shall be regarded as extinguished . . . .\"\n\n25 U.S.C. §§ 1705(a)(3) & 1712(a)(3).        This \"all claims\" language\n\n\n\n\n                                    -57-\n\fis broad enough to include sovereignty or aboriginal title based\n\nclaims contesting the applicability of Rhode Island law.\n\n            It is not surprising that the Settlement Act does not\n\nrefer explicitly to the preservation of State jurisdiction outside\n\nof the Settlement Lands.     As sovereign, Rhode Island already had\n\njurisdiction outside of Settlement Lands, and the Settlement Act\n\nextinguished any potential competing \"Indian\" claims to that land.\n\nThe only land about which there might have been doubt was the\n\nSettlement Lands, and as to that land, State jurisdiction was\n\nexpressly   preserved.     See   25   U.S.C.   §   1708.   Rhode   Island\n\nnegotiated against the background understanding that its laws would\n\napply throughout the State, and in the only instance where the\n\nparties thought there might be a question, they added an express\n\nprovision to preserve State jurisdiction.\n\n            That the Settlement Act does not say what Rhode Island\n\nlogically presumed -- that Rhode Island law would apply throughout\n\nRhode Island -- ought not be fatal to the State's exercise of its\n\nsovereignty. In the circumstances of this case, holding that Rhode\n\nIsland is divested of jurisdiction by the Secretary taking into\n\ntrust the adjacent parcel that was part of the original disputed\n\nlands upsets the fairly expressed expectations of the parties.        It\n\nalso produces an unwarranted anomalous relationship between the\n\nSettlement Lands and the after acquired parcel.        The more sensible\n\n\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fresult is to effectuate the likely intent of the JMOU parties that\n\nRhode Island's laws apply throughout Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n\n                              -59-\n\f</pre>",
