William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Brooks R. Magratten, with whom Michael J. Daly and Pierce\nAtwood LLP were on brief, for appellant/cross-appellee.\n     Charles S. Beal, with whom Jonathan E. Pincince and Beal Law,\nLLC were on brief, for appellees/cross-appellants.\n\n\n                           April 20, 2011\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.     Both parties appeal from grants of\n\nsummary judgment in this dispute concerning the benefit eligibility\n\nlanguage of a long-term disability benefit plan regulated by the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).           Plaintiffs D&H\n\nTherapy Associates, LLC (D&H), and Robin Dolan appeal from a grant\n\nof summary judgment against their claims that Dolan was eligible\n\nfor and entitled to benefits under the plan or, in the alternative,\n\ndamages for fraud in the inducement.       Defendant Boston Mutual Life\n\nInsurance Company (Boston Mutual), in turn, appeals from entry of\n\nsummary judgment against its counterclaim that it is entitled to\n\nreimbursement for payments already made to Dolan, which it says\n\nwere mistaken.\n\n            D&H obtained an ERISA plan from Boston Mutual in 2000.\n\nUnder the plan, employees who suffer specified reductions in\n\nmonthly earnings due to long-term disability are eligible for\n\nbenefits.   Dolan is both a part-owner and an employee of D&H.            In\n\n2001, she became physically unable to continue some of her tasks as\n\nan   employee,   which   prompted   a   reduction   in   her   monthly   W-2\n\nearnings.    In 2002, she began receiving benefits under the plan.\n\nAfter a 2006 audit, however, Boston Mutual terminated the benefits\n\nand demanded Dolan return past payments.         It told Dolan that she\n\nhad failed to account for her non-salary income, including earnings\n\nfrom her ownership stake in D&H.          With those ownership earnings\n\nincluded, Boston Mutual stated, Dolan's monthly earnings had been\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhigher than her pre-disability monthly earnings since 2002, and so\n\nshe was not and had never been eligible for payments.\n\n           After Dolan filed unsuccessful administrative appeals\n\nwith Boston Mutual's third-party claims administrator, she and D&H\n\ninitiated this litigation against Boston Mutual.        Except as needed\n\nwe refer to both plaintiffs as Dolan. Dolan challenges her benefit\n\ntermination on two grounds.          First, she argues that the plan\n\ndefines \"earnings\" as W-2 income such that non-salary income is not\n\nrelevant to eligibility determinations.         Second, she argues that\n\nBoston Mutual should be estopped from construing the plan otherwise\n\nbecause it represented to D&H at the time of purchase that the plan\n\ndefined \"earnings\" as W-2 income. In the alternative, Dolan claims\n\nthat Boston Mutual's representations fraudulently induced D&H to\n\nforego renewing its preexisting insurance policy.          Boston Mutual\n\ncounterclaims that under the plan it is entitled to reimbursement\n\nof the $163,661.57 it paid to Dolan.\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment to each party\n\non the claims brought by the other.        As to Dolan's claims, it held\n\nthat Boston Mutual's construction of the plan's language was within\n\nits   discretion   as   the   plan   administrator   and   that   Dolan's\n\nfraudulent inducement claim was preempted by ERISA.         As to Boston\n\nMutual's counterclaim, it held that the reimbursement sought did\n\nnot qualify as appropriate equitable relief under ERISA.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            We hold that Boston Mutual abused its discretion when it\n\ndetermined that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits under\n\nthe plan.    This holding requires entry of judgment for Dolan on\n\nboth her wrongful denial of benefits claim and on Boston Mutual's\n\ncounterclaim for recoupment of past payments.                   Accordingly, we\n\nreverse the district court's entry of judgment for Boston Mutual on\n\nDolan's denial of benefits claim and affirm for Dolan on Boston\n\nMutual's    counterclaim.      We   need      not    reach    Dolan's   equitable\n\nestoppel argument or her fraud in the inducement claim.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            Dolan and her partner Kim Havunen each hold a half\n\nownership    stake    in    D&H,    a    firm       that     provides   physical,\n\noccupational, and speech therapy services at several clinics in\n\nRhode Island.1       At all times relevant to this suit, Dolan and\n\nHavunen were also employees of the firm.                   Dolan served as the\n\ndirector of clinical services and as a physical therapist, while\n\nHavunen served as the director of business operations.                  Like other\n\nemployees of the firm, Dolan and Havunen drew salary based on the\n\nnumber of hours they worked.        Their salaries were not influenced,\n\nat least directly, by their ownership stakes in D&H.\n\n\n\n     1\n          D&H has been a limited liability company since 2004, when\nit transferred its status from a partnership.        A predecessor\nentity, Professional Rehabilitation Network (PRN), purchased the\ntwo long-term disability insurance policies described in this\ndispute. For ease of exposition, we refer to the present limited\nliability company and its predecessor entities collectively as D&H.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fA.         D&H's Acquisition of the Boston Mutual Plan\n\n           In 1997, D&H obtained a long-term disability insurance\n\npolicy from Guarantee Life Insurance Company (Guarantee Life). D&H\n\nobtained the policy with the help of an insurance agent, Benefit\n\nServices, Inc. (Benefit Services).          Havunen led the efforts to\n\nobtain this policy.     She testified that she explained to a Benefit\n\nServices representative that D&H wanted a policy that would protect\n\nW-2   earnings   such   that   the   principals   of   the   firm   would   be\n\ninsulated against loss of the salary form of their income. Havunen\n\nunderstood the Guarantee Life policy to reflect this request.\n\nAccording to Havunen, the policy defined protected earnings for\n\nprincipals as W-2 earnings.\n\n           In 2000, the Guarantee Life policy was expiring.           As D&H\n\nconsidered whether to renew the policy, the same Benefit Services\n\nrepresentative who had assisted D&H with the Guarantee Life policy\n\ncontacted Havunen.      The representative, Maureen Baker, informed\n\nHavunen that she had received a quote from a different insurance\n\nprovider at a better rate.       Havunen testified that she told Baker\n\nthat D&H would only consider switching to the new policy if the\n\npolicy protected W-2 earnings in the same manner as she understood\n\nthe Guarantee Life policy did. Havunen testified further that when\n\nBaker identified the quote in question as belonging to Boston\n\nMutual, Havunen reiterated this requirement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          To ensure that the Boston Mutual policy would meet these\n\nspecifications, Havunen testified, she and Baker met with a Boston\n\nMutual agent, Thomas Liszanckie. Havunen testified that Liszanckie\n\nassured her that the Boston Mutual policy would contain the same\n\ndefinitions of \"earnings\" and \"income\" as the Guarantee Life\n\npolicy.   She testified as well that Liszanckie brought a written\n\n\"Group Insurance Proposal,\" which he said contained the requested\n\nprotection for W-2 income.           Havunen testified that Liszanckie\n\nidentified    the    last   page   of    the   proposal   as   ensuring   this\n\nprotection.         That    page   includes     the   following   statement:\n\n\"Definition of Earnings: Basic Annual Earnings shall mean the\n\nInsured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported\n\nby the Group Policyholder on form W-2.\"\n\n          Havunen testified that, based on Liszanckie's statements\n\nand the proposal's definition of earnings, D&H did not renew the\n\nGuarantee Life policy and instead purchased the Boston Mutual\n\npolicy.   When Havunen received the final language of the policy,\n\nshe expressed some concern to Baker about the policy's terms\n\nrelating to \"any other income from employment,\" which might be\n\nconstrued to include income other than W-2 income.             Baker, Havunen\n\ntestified, assured her that this language only referred to other\n\nincome that may be included in W-2 earnings, like bonuses and\n\ncommissions.    Havunen did not contest the final policy language.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fShe testified that D&H would not have signed on to the policy if\n\nnot for Liszanckie and Baker's representations.\n\n           Boston Mutual disputes Havunen's testimony concerning her\n\nconversations with Baker, the content of the Guarantee Life policy,\n\nand her interactions with Liszanckie. Baker testified that, in her\n\ndiscussions with Havunen about both the Guarantee Life policy and\n\nthe Boston Mutual policy, Havunen told her that she wanted to\n\nprotect the K-1 income of D&H's principals, not their W-2 income.\n\nBaker also speculated that a portion of the Guarantee Life policy\n\nnot   present   in   the   record   defined   earnings   for   principals\n\ndifferently from that of other employees and included non-salary\n\nincome.2   Liszanckie testified that while he occasionally dropped\n\noff insurance forms to customers before they signed an insurance\n\npolicy, he rarely met with the customers and he could not recall\n\nwhether he met with Havunen and Baker.\n\nB.         The Terms of the Boston Mutual Plan\n\n           Having reviewed these disputed facts concerning D&H's\n\ndecision to obtain the Boston Mutual policy, we turn to the plan\n\nlanguage that governs that policy.        There is no dispute that the\n\npolicy, unlike the Guarantee Life policy, is governed by ERISA. We\n\n\n      2\n          Baker testified that the policy laid out different\nbenefit schedules for principals and all other employees.       She\nacknowledged that a portion of the policy defined earnings as W-2\nearnings, but speculated that this portion only applied to non-\nprincipal employees and that a portion of the policy not present in\nthe record gave a separate definition of earnings that applied to\nprincipals.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdivide       discussion        of    the    plan's    contents         between    provisions\n\nconcerning      benefit          eligibility,       provisions         concerning       benefit\n\ncalculation, and provisions concerning overpayment of claims.\n\n               As to benefit eligibility, principals and all other\n\nemployees are eligible for benefits if they suffer a specified loss\n\nin earnings due to disability. This applies when these individuals\n\n\"are    not    able       to     perform    some     or   all     of    the   material      and\n\nsubstantial duties of [their] regular occupation\" and \"have at\n\nleast    a    20%    loss      in   [their]    pre-disability           earnings.\"         This\n\nlitigation does not concern what rises to an inability to perform\n\noccupational duties.\n\n               It concerns, instead, what it means to have a 20% loss in\n\npre-disability            earnings     as    defined      by     the    plan.      For     both\n\nprincipals          and    all      other    employees,        the     plan     gives     these\n\ndefinitions concerning earnings: \"Pre-disability earnings means\n\nyour monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just\n\nprior to the date disability begins.                      Basic annual Earnings shall\n\nmean the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as\n\nreported       by    the       Group   Policyholder         on    form    W-2,     excluding\n\ncommissions.\"             If an individual has earnings for less than a\n\ncalendar year, the plan provides that \"Basic Annual Earnings shall\n\nbe determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month\n\nworked and annualizing the result.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\f          The plan lists a series of circumstances that justify\n\nbenefit termination.    These include when an individual is \"no\n\nlonger disabled,\" has \"reached the end of the maximum payment\n\nduration,\" or has \"current earnings [that] exceed 80% of [his or\n\nher] pre-disability earnings.\"    Benefits will also be terminated\n\nwhen an individual is \"able to increase [his or her] current\n\nearnings by increasing the number of hours [he or she] work[s] or\n\nthe number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his or her] regular\n\noccupation but . . . do[es] not do so.\"    The plan emphasizes, in\n\nbolded all-capital letters, that if an individual is \"disabled and\n\nworking, earning more than 80% of [his or her] pre-disability\n\nearnings, no payment will be made.\"\n\n          As to benefit calculation, the plan specifies that the\n\nmaximum monthly payment is $6,000 and the minimum monthly payment\n\nis $100 or 10%, presumably of monthly pre-disability earnings.   It\n\nincludes two formulas for benefit calculation.   The first applies\n\nto individuals \"earning less than 20% of [their] pre-disability\n\nearnings,\" whether they are currently working or not.   The second\n\napplies to individuals working and \"earning between 20% and 80% of\n\n[their] pre-disability earnings.\"      The plan makes no express\n\nprovision for how to calculate benefit payments for individuals who\n\nare not working but are nonetheless earning between 20% and 80% of\n\ntheir pre-disability earnings.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            The specifics of the two formulas are as follows.                       Under\n\nthe first, monthly payments are figured by taking the lesser of (a)\n\n$6,000    and     (b)   60%   of   \"pre-disability         earnings,\"         and   then\n\nsubtracting \"any other income amounts except any income [the\n\nindividual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment.\"\n\nUnder the second, benefits are initially the lesser of (a) $6,000,\n\n(b) 100% of \"pre-disability earnings\" minus \"any other income\n\namounts   including      current    income      [the     individual]      earn[s]      or\n\nreceive[s] from any form of employment,\" and (c) 60% of \"pre-\n\ndisability earnings.\"         After 24 months, additional payments under\n\nthis formula are determined by taking the lesser of (a) $6,000, and\n\n(b) 60% of \"pre-disability income,\" and then subtracting 50% of\n\n\"any income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of\n\nemployment\" and 100% of \"any other income amounts.\"\n\n            The     policy    defines     \"other       income    amounts\"      in     six\n\ncategories.     All the categories except for one pertain to benefits\n\nand awards an individual either receives or is eligible to receive\n\nunder specified laws or employer insurance plans.                       The remaining\n\ncategory, particularly important for our purposes, states that\n\n\"other income amounts\" includes \"any income you earn or receive\n\nfrom any form of employment.\"\n\n            As to overpayment, the plan provides, \"We have the right\n\nto   recover    overpayments       due   to     fraud;    an    error    we    make   in\n\nprocessing your claim; [or] your receipt of other income amounts.\"\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fIt also states, \"If we determine that we overpaid your claim, then\n\nwe require you repay us in full.     We will determine the method by\n\nwhich you will repay us.\"\n\nC.         The Dispute Under the Boston Mutual Plan\n\n           In February 2001, shortly after D&H obtained the Boston\n\nMutual policy, Dolan underwent orthopedic surgery.            When she\n\nreturned to work in August 2001, she worked fewer hours and\n\nreceived less salary.     In January 2002, Boston Mutual approved\n\nDolan's claim under the policy and began dispensing benefits.\n\nThese benefits continued until 2006, when Boston Mutual's third-\n\nparty   claims   administrator,   Disability   Reinsurance   Management\n\nServices (DRMS), conducted an audit.\n\n           Based on the audit, DRMS concluded that Dolan's benefit\n\npayments had not properly taken account of business profits she\n\nreceived as a principal of D&H and another entity, Associated\n\nProfessional Management, Inc.      With those profits included, DRMS\n\ncalculated Dolan's pre-disability monthly earnings to be $5,833.33\n\nand her post-disability monthly earnings in 2002 to be $7,670.67.\n\nIn an August 2006 letter, Boston Mutual informed Dolan of the audit\n\nand asserted its right under the policy to recover overpayments due\n\nto \"fraud or error.\"    Dolan, through her attorney, contested this\n\nfinding.   She argued that this business income fell outside the\n\ndefinition of \"earnings\" relevant for determining eligibility under\n\nthe policy.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            Notwithstanding Dolan's objections, by an October 2006\n\nletter Boston Mutual discontinued her benefits and reasserted its\n\ndemand that she repay past benefits.                  The letter stated that the\n\nbenefits Dolan had received since January 2002 had resulted in an\n\noverpayment of $145,958.32.             Dolan twice appealed the termination\n\ndetermination, and in each case DRMS denied the appeal.                     In her\n\nappeals,    Dolan       argued   that    she    had    disclosed   her   ownership\n\ninterests at all relevant times and that the intention of D&H and\n\nits principals in purchasing the policy had been to protect W-2\n\nearnings.        She did not submit evidence that Boston Mutual had\n\nrepresented to D&H that the policy would protect W-2 earnings in\n\nthis fashion.       After DRMS denied these appeals, Dolan filed this\n\nlawsuit.\n\n            In the district court, Dolan challenged her benefit\n\ntermination under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132.    She argued that (1) the plain language of the plan renders\n\nnon-salary income irrelevant for benefit eligibility, and (2)\n\nBoston Mutual should be equitably estopped from asserting otherwise\n\ngiven Liszanckie's representations to Havunen. In the alternative,\n\nDolan argued that D&H was fraudulently induced to purchase the\n\nBoston Mutual plan and sought damages in tort under state law.                    As\n\na remedy for fraudulent inducement, Dolan argued that she was\n\nentitled    to    the    benefits   she    would       have   received   under   the\n\nGuarantee Life policy had D&H renewed it.                     Dolan also asserted\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fstate law contract claims, but later conceded that these claims are\n\npreempted by ERISA.\n\n               Boston Mutual counterclaimed, demanding reimbursement\n\nunder the plan for $163,661.57 in overpaid benefits.3          The parties\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment on Dolan's claims and Boston\n\nMutual's counterclaim.\n\n               Three arguments Boston Mutual made before the district\n\ncourt    are    relevant   on   appeal.     First,   it   argued   that   its\n\ndetermination that Dolan had not been eligible for benefits was\n\nreasonable and within the discretion afforded to certain plan\n\nadministrators under ERISA.         Second, it argued that the district\n\ncourt could not consider four affidavits Dolan submitted concerning\n\npurported misrepresentations because they had not been part of the\n\nadministrative record.4          Third, it argued that ERISA preempts\n\nDolan's state claim for fraud in the inducement.\n\n               Initially, the district court granted Boston Mutual's\n\nmotion for summary judgment on Dolan's claims but denied both\n\nparties'       motions   for    summary   judgment   on   Boston   Mutual's\n\ncounterclaim.       Boston Mutual moved for reconsideration of the\n\n\n     3\n          The counterclaim originally sought $145,958.32 in\noverpaid benefits.   Boston Mutual subsequently recalculated the\namount of the overpayment.\n     4\n          These affidavits include Havunen's testimony concerning\nthe circumstances surrounding D&H's decision to purchase the Boston\nMutual policy, as well as some of Liszanckie's testimony. They\nalso include Dolan's testimony concerning her disabling condition\nand interactions with Boston Mutual.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdenial of summary judgment as to its counterclaim in light of a\n\nSupreme Court decision, Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services,\n\nInc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006), on permissible relief under ERISA that\n\nthe   district    court    had    not     considered.       Dolan    moved   for\n\nreconsideration of her claims in light of a recent decision of this\n\ncourt, Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, 566 F.3d 1\n\n(1st Cir. 2009), concerning conflicts of interest in certain\n\ndiscretionary decisions by ERISA plan administrators.\n\n           The    district   court      reaffirmed   its    grant    of   summary\n\njudgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's claims.              On reconsideration,\n\nhowever, it granted Dolan's motion for summary judgment on Boston\n\nMutual's counterclaim.       In the two decisions, the district court\n\nheld (1) Boston Mutual's eligibility determination was reasonable\n\nand thus entitled to deference under ERISA, (2) ERISA preempts\n\nDolan's   claim    for    fraud   in    the    inducement    under   29    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1144(a), and (3) Boston Mutual's claim for reimbursement for\n\noverpaid benefits is not \"appropriate equitable relief\" under 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).      The district court did not expressly address\n\nDolan's equitable estoppel argument.              It also did not address\n\nBoston Mutual's motion to strike the four contested affidavits, as\n\nthe motion was deemed moot in light of the court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for Boston Mutual.\n\n           In the present cross-appeals, Dolan appeals the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual on her claims\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fand Boston Mutual appeals the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment for Dolan on its counterclaim.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            We review the district court's grants of summary judgment\n\nde novo.    Sch. Union No. 37 v. United Nat'l Ins. Co., 617 F.3d 554,\n\n558-59 (1st Cir. 2010).     In the typical case, we will reverse a\n\ngrant of summary judgment only if, making all factual inferences in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party, a rational factfinder could resolve\n\nthe legal issue for either side.    Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance\n\nCo. of Boston, 592 F.3d 215, 223-24 (1st Cir. 2010).    The presence\n\nof cross-motions does not alter this general standard.    When there\n\nare cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider\n\neach motion separately, drawing all inferences in favor of each\n\nnon-moving party in turn.    Merchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S.\n\nFid. & Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            Cases that concern benefit determinations under an ERISA\n\nplan, however, are not typical cases when it comes to summary\n\njudgment.    When an ERISA plan gives an administrator discretionary\n\nauthority to determine eligibility for benefits or construe the\n\nplan's terms, the district court must uphold the administrator's\n\ndecision unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\"5    Cusson, 592 F.3d at 224 (quoting Gannon v. Metro.\n\n\n     5\n          We have noted that \"[f]or purposes of reviewing benefit\ndeterminations by an ERISA plan administrator, the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard is functionally equivalent to the abuse of\n\n                                 -15-\n\fLife Ins. Co., 360 F.3d 211, 213 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).          In such cases, \"summary judgment is\n\nsimply a vehicle for deciding the issue\" and \"the non-moving party\n\nis not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\"                  Id.\n\n(quoting Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510, 517\n\n(1st Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The parties agree that the plan at issue here affords\n\nBoston   Mutual   authority   to    determine   benefit   eligibility   and\n\nconstrue its terms.      Accordingly, the district court reviewed\n\nBoston Mutual's benefit determinations for abuse of discretion.\n\nOur de novo review of the district court's grants of summary\n\njudgment as they relate to benefit determinations must look to\n\nwhether the district court erred in finding that Boston Mutual's\n\ndeterminations were within its discretion.         Our de novo review of\n\nthe district court's grants of summary judgment as they relate to\n\nother issues must employ the non-deferential review typically\n\nemployed on summary judgment.        See Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 517.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           We address in concert the two benefit determinations\n\nrelevant to this appeal, as both rest on the same stated rationale.\n\nBoston Mutual terminated Dolan's benefits because it deemed Dolan\n\n\n\ndiscretion standard.\"     Wright v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Grp.\nBenefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 74 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005). We describe\nthe relevant standard of review for these benefit determinations as\n\"abuse of discretion\" review.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fineligible for benefits under the plan, and it demanded recoupment\n\nof past payments made to Dolan because it deemed that Dolan had\n\nnever been eligible for benefits under the plan.      It has been\n\nBoston Mutual's position that Dolan has never been eligible for\n\nbenefits because her post-disability earnings have always exceeded\n\nher pre-disability earnings as defined by the plan.   There are no\n\ndisputed facts concerning Dolan's income. The parties only dispute\n\nhow to interpret the plan's terms and thereby determine Dolan's\n\neligibility for benefits in light of her income.\n\n          This interpretive dispute centers on four constructions\n\npresent in the plan: \"earnings,\" \"basic annual earnings,\" \"pre-\n\ndisability earnings,\" and \"current earnings.\"    Dolan argues that\n\nthe plan's definition of \"basic annual earnings\" defines \"earnings\"\n\nas W-2 income and that a reasonable reading of the plan demands a\n\nconsistent application of this definition, irrespective of the\n\ntemporal periods \"pre-disability\" and \"current.\"      It has been\n\nBoston Mutual's position that when the term \"earnings\" precedes the\n\nterms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic annual\" it refers to monthly W-2\n\nincome, but when the term \"earnings\" is used alone or combined with\n\nthe term \"current\" it refers to all income that derives from\n\nemployment, including ownership income.6\n\n\n     6\n          Specifically, Boston Mutual argues that S corporation\n\"pass through\" income paid to working shareholders falls within the\ndefinition of \"earnings\" when the term is used in isolation or in\nconjunction with the term \"current.\" It argues that this view is\nconsistent with case law concerning the earnings subject to federal\n\n                               -17-\n\fA.          Existing Circuit Law\n\n            In this circuit, we have held that an ERISA benefit\n\ndetermination is within the discretion of the plan administrator so\n\nlong as it is \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\"\n\nWright v. R.R. Donnelly & Sons Grp. Benefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 74\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213).            We have\n\nemphasized that our review of whether a plan administrator abused\n\nits discretion does not require that we determine either the \"best\n\nreading\" of the ERISA plan or how we would read the plan de novo.\n\nStamp v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 84, 94 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Lennon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 504 F.3d 617, 624 (6th\n\nCir. 2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have also noted\n\nthat the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply to review of\n\nan ERISA plan construction advanced by an administrator given\n\nauthority to construe the plan.     Id. at 93 (citing Morton v. Smith,\n\n91 F.3d 867, 871 n.1 (7th Cir. 1996)).\n\n            Challenges to benefit determinations in this circuit have\n\ntypically    involved   the   application   of   contested   facts   to\n\nuncontested plan terms.   In Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11 (1st\n\nCir. 2002), for example, we noted that the relevant plan terms were\n\n\n\nemployment taxes. See Nu-Look Design, Inc. v. C.I.R., 356 F.3d\n290, 291 (3d Cir. 2004); Joseph Radtke, S.C. v. United States, 895\nF.2d 1196, 1197 (7th Cir. 1990); Spicer Accounting, Inc. v. United\nStates, 918 F.2d 90, 93 (9th Cir. 1990). Boston Mutual has not\nargued that any other type of non-salary income deriving from\nemployment falls into these two definitions of \"earnings.\"\n\n                                   -18-\n\f\"clear and unambiguous\" but that, \"[a]s in many such instances,\"\n\nthe \"devil is in the details\" of applying the facts to those terms.\n\nId. at 18.    Most often, plaintiffs have challenged the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence underlying an ERISA plan administrator's factual\n\nconclusions.    See, e.g., Cusson, 592 F.3d at 229-30; Orndorf, 404\n\nF.3d at 518.    They have also challenged benefit determinations on\n\nthe grounds that the ERISA plan administrator improperly credited\n\ncertain evidence.    See, e.g., Medina v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 588\n\nF.3d 41, 45-47 (1st Cir. 2009); Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of\n\nAm., 426 F.3d 20, 30 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             We are aware of only two cases decided in this circuit\n\nconcerning purely interpretive questions like the one raised in\n\nthis appeal.     Understandably, neither of these cases articulate\n\ngeneral guidelines as to when a plan administrator's construction\n\nis sufficiently lacking in reason that it rises to the level of an\n\nabuse of discretion.     In the more recent case, Coffin v. Bowater\n\nInc., 501 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 2007), we upheld a plan administrator's\n\nconstruction because we found its construction \"significantly more\n\npersuasive\" than that offered by the plaintiffs.   Id. at 96.   In so\n\nholding, the court did not need to reach the more difficult\n\nquestion of when a plan administrator's construction will be\n\nsufficiently reasonable to warrant deference even though it is only\n\nas persuasive or less persuasive than the interpretation offered by\n\nthe plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f            In an earlier case, Kolling v. American Power Conversion\n\nCorp., 347 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2003), we held it within a plan\n\nadministrator's      discretion        to   \"reasonably\"    construe   the   term\n\n\"employee,\" which was circularly defined by the plan as \"Employee\n\nof the Employer.\"     Id. at 14. (citing Trombetta v. Cragin Fed. Bank\n\nfor Sav. Emp. Stock Ownership Plan, 102 F.3d 1435, 1439-40 (7th\n\nCir. 1996)).      We held that the plan administrator had \"permissibly\n\nlooked\" to the insurance company's \"intention in defining the\n\nPlan's scope\" and that the evidence supported its determination\n\nregarding that intention.            Id.    We also held that the insurance\n\ncompany had consistently applied its definition of \"employee\" in\n\nthe past.   Id.    We did not address when these indicators or others\n\nmight require a holding that a plan construction was unreasonable.\n\n            The Supreme Court has not spoken directly to how courts\n\nshould assess whether an administrator's construction of a plan\n\nterm is so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\nIn Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101 (1989), the\n\nCourt noted that \"ERISA abounds with the language and terminology\n\nof trust law,\" id. at 110, and that given this, it had held that\n\ncourts must develop a \"federal common law of rights and obligations\n\nunder ERISA-regulated plans,\" id. (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nDedeaux,    481    U.S.   41,   56     (1987))    (internal   quotation      marks\n\nomitted).      The    Court     held    that     \"[t]rust   principles   make   a\n\ndeferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fdiscretionary powers,\" and that when a trustee is given such power\n\n\"to construe disputed or doubtful terms . . . the trustee's\n\ninterpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.\"           Id. at 111.\n\n              The Court has not given precise content to this standard.\n\nIt has held that courts must consider conflicts of interest that\n\nmay   arise    when   an   administrator,    like   Boston   Mutual,   \"both\n\ndetermines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays\n\nbenefits out of its own pocket.\"           Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn,\n\n554 U.S. 105, 108 (2008); see also Conkright v. Frommert, 130 S.\n\nCt. 1640, 1647 (2010).      In Glenn, the Court noted that courts \"will\n\noften take account of several different considerations of which a\n\nconflict of interest is one.\"       Glenn, 554 U.S. at 117.      It did not\n\nidentify other relevant factors, however, and \"warned against\n\ncreating formulas that will 'falsif[y] the actual process of\n\njudging' or serve as 'instrument[s] of futile casuistry.'\"             Id. at\n\n119 (quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd.,\n\n340 U.S. 474, 489 (1951)) (alterations in original).\n\nB.            Law Beyond This Circuit\n\n              In the absence of clear guidance from either this court\n\nor the Supreme Court, we look to the law of other circuits.              The\n\ncircuit courts have articulated the abuse of discretion standard\n\nafforded to ERISA plan administrators under Bruch in various ways.\n\nJayne E. Zanglein & Susan J. Stabile, ERISA Litigation 550 (3d ed.\n\n2008).   We do not delve into how the circuits have formulated this\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fstandard for all cases in which an ERISA plan administrator has\n\npower   to   make   benefit    determinations.       Rather,    we    limit   our\n\nattention to the question of when an ERISA plan administrator,\n\nacting pursuant to a grant of power to construe the plan's terms,\n\nconstrues the plan in a manner that is unreasonable and thus abuses\n\nits discretion.\n\n             At   the   outset,   we   note   that   \"[i]t     is    notoriously\n\ndifficult to venture a general definition of the term 'abuse of\n\ndiscretion,' and none is canonical; indeed, the term has different\n\nmeanings in different legal contexts.\"           Evans v. Eaton Corp. Long\n\nTerm Disability Plan, 514 F.3d 315, 321-22 (4th Cir. 2008).                   As\n\nJudge Wilkinson wrote in Evans, the standard \"draws a line--or\n\nrather demarcates a region--between the unsupportable and the\n\nmerely mistaken, between the legal error, disorder of reason,\n\nsevere lapse of judgment, and procedural failure that a reviewing\n\ncourt may always correct, and the simple disagreement that, on this\n\nstandard, it may not.\"        Id. at 322 (citing Harry T. Edwards & Linda\n\nElliott, Federal Standards of Review 68 (2007)).             It goes without\n\nsaying that terms like \"reasonable,\" which underlie the standard\n\nhere, are similarly difficult to define precisely.\n\n             It also bears emphasis that this standard of review,\n\nwhich concerns a fiduciary element of the role of an ERISA plan\n\nadministrator, must reflect the relevant principles of trust law,\n\nrather than the law of contracts.         Matthews v. Sears Pension Plan,\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\f144 F.3d 461, 465 (7th Cir. 1998); see also Bruch, 489 U.S. at 111.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has held, trust law \"can ask judges to\n\ndetermine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often\n\ncase-specific,        factors,    reaching    a   result       by   weighing    all\n\ntogether.\"     Glenn, 554 U.S. at 117.        In this context, our analysis\n\nmust   weigh    the    values    advanced    by   ERISA   in    empowering     plan\n\nadministrators as fiduciaries, cf. Evans, 514 F.3d at 323, with the\n\ndangers policed by the statute arising from breach of fiduciary\n\nduty, cf. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 141\n\nn.8 (1985).\n\n           In their review of ERISA plan constructions like the one\n\npresented in this case, courts beyond this circuit have looked to\n\nthe language and purpose of the plan.                In some circuits, the\n\nanalysis has been conducted with reference to the consistency of an\n\nadministrator's construction with the \"plain meaning\" of the plan.\n\nSee Boyd v. Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Players Ret. Plan, 410 F.3d\n\n1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2005); Wagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan--\n\nNon Bargained Program, 407 F.3d 395, 404 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Pagan v.\n\nNYNEX Pension Plan, 52 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 1995); Fuller v. CBT\n\nCorp., 905 F.2d 1055, 1060 (7th Cir. 1990).                These circuits have\n\nnot defined how courts should determine whether an interpretation\n\ndoes not accord with an ERISA plan's plain meaning.\n\n           At    least    four    circuits   have   advanced        more   specific\n\nstandards. The Fifth Circuit has split the inquiry into two steps,\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\feach of which contains three guiding factors, while the Third,\n\nFourth,   and   Eighth     circuits    have        listed       a    general         set    of\n\nguidelines.\n\n           The Fifth Circuit first asks whether an administrator's\n\ninterpretation is \"legally correct.\"                Chacko v. Sabre, Inc., 473\n\nF.3d 604, 611 (5th Cir. 2006).              In so doing, it considers \"(1)\n\nwhether   the   administrator         has        given    the        plan        a   uniform\n\nconstruction; (2) whether the interpretation is consistent with a\n\nfair reading of the plan; and (3) any unanticipated costs resulting\n\nfrom   different   interpretations          of    the    plan.\"            Id.       If    the\n\ninterpretation is \"legally correct,\" it must stand; if it is not,\n\nthe court considers three factors to determine if it is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion: \"(1) the internal consistency of the plan under the\n\nadministrator's    interpretation,          (2)     any    relevant          regulations\n\nformulated by the appropriate administrative agencies, and (3) the\n\nfactual background of the determination and any inferences of lack\n\nof good faith.\"    Gosselink v. Am. Tel. & Tel., Inc., 272 F.3d 722\n\n(5th Cir. 2001).\n\n           The Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits each employs a\n\nmulti-factor    test     to   determine      whether        a       plan    construction\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.              The Third and Eighth circuits\n\neach considers the following five factors:\n\n           (1) whether the administrator's language is\n           contrary to the clear language of the plan;\n           (2) whether the interpretation conflicts with\n           the substantive or procedural requirements of\n\n                                      -24-\n\f            ERISA; (3) whether the interpretation renders\n            any language of the plan meaningless or\n            internally inconsistent; (4) whether the\n            interpretation is consistent with the goals of\n            the plan; and (5) whether the administrator\n            has consistently followed the interpretation.\n\nManning v. Am. Republic Ins. Co., 604 F.3d 1030, 1041-42 (8th Cir.\n\n2010); see also Howley v. Mellon Fin. Corp., 625 F.3d 788, 795 (3d\n\nCir. 2010).      The Fourth Circuit's \"non-exhaustive\" list of factors\n\nincludes these five factors as well as \"whether the decisionmaking\n\nprocess    was   reasoned    and   principled,\"     \"any   external   standard\n\nrelevant to the exercise of discretion,\" and \"the fiduciary's\n\nmotives and any conflict of interest it may have.\"            Carden v. Aetna\n\nLife Ins. Co., 559 F.3d 256, 261 (4th Cir. 2009).\n\nC.          Boston Mutual's Construction of the Plan\n\n            Although these standards are instructive, we do not adopt\n\nthem or any specific guiding factors.            With all due deference to\n\nBoston    Mutual's    role   as    a   fiduciary,   it   is   clear   that   its\n\nconstruction of the ERISA plan at issue stretches beyond the bounds\n\nof reasonableness.      This is so for a number of reasons, which are\n\nspecific to the particular case at hand.\n\n            As an initial matter, Boston Mutual's construction of the\n\nterm \"earnings\" cannot be applied consistently within its own\n\naccount of the plan's meaning.                It has been Boston Mutual's\n\nposition that the term \"earnings\" refers to W-2 income when it is\n\nused in conjunction with the terms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic\n\nannual.\"    It has also been Boston Mutual's position that the term\n\n                                       -25-\n\f\"earnings\" refers to all income deriving from employment when it is\n\nused alone or with the term \"current.\" Yet the plan's express\n\ndefinitions   of   \"pre-disability   earnings\"   and     \"basic   annual\n\nearnings\" cannot support both of these positions at once.\n\n          The plan expressly defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as\n\nwell as \"Basic annual Earnings\" with reference to the unaccompanied\n\nterm \"earnings.\"    The plan defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as\n\n\"your monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just\n\nprior to the date disability begins.\"        (Emphasis added.)       It\n\ndefines \"Basic annual Earnings,\" in turn, as \"the Insured Person's\n\nearnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group\n\nPolicyholder on form W-2, excluding commissions. If the person has\n\nearnings for less than a calendar year, Basic Annual Earnings shall\n\nbe determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month\n\nworked and annualizing the result.\"    (Emphasis added.)\n\n          If Boston Mutual's definition of the unaccompanied term\n\n\"earnings\" were applied to that unaccompanied term as used within\n\nthe plan's stated definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and\n\n\"basic annual earnings,\" the term \"earnings\" would have to refer to\n\nboth W-2 income and non-salary income when used in conjunction with\n\nthe terms \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual.\"         If, on the other\n\nhand, one accepts Boston Mutual's definition of \"earnings\" as used\n\nin conjunction with \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual,\" then the\n\ndefinition of the unaccompanied term \"earnings\" as used within the\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fplan's definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual\n\nearnings\" would have to refer only to salary income.\n\n          Boston Mutual attempts to counter this contradiction by\n\ninvoking the broader structure of the plan.       It argues that \"the\n\nclear import\" of the plan \"is to reduce and potentially eliminate\n\nbenefit payments once the claimant earns enough money from other\n\nsources of income.\" In support of this claim, Boston Mutual points\n\nin particular to the plan's provision that benefits may be limited\n\nby a participant's receipt of \"other income amounts,\" a term the\n\nplan defines, inter alia, as \"[a]ny income you earn or receive from\n\nany form of employment.\"     Boston Mutual argues that its various\n\nconstructions   of    the   term   \"earnings,\"   notwithstanding   the\n\ndefinitions at the beginning of the plan, are consistent with the\n\nplan's effort to take account of income from employment.\n\n          Specifically, Boston Mutual relies on language concerning\n\nbenefit termination.    The plan states that if an employee covered\n\nby the plan is \"disabled and working, earning more than 80% of [his\n\nor her] pre-disability earnings, no payment will be made,\" and\n\npayments will stop \"the date [the covered employee's] current\n\nearnings exceed 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.)    Boston Mutual argues that these provisions only\n\nallow payment of benefits when the sum of a covered employee's W-2\n\nincome and non-salary income from employment is at least 20% less\n\nthan that individual's pre-disability W-2 income.        The benefit\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fformula, which sets payment amounts for those \"earning\" at least\n\n20%   less     than     their    \"pre-disability          earnings,\"    mirrors      this\n\nrequirement under Boston Mutual's construction.\n\n               This argument elides clear divisions within the plan's\n\nstructure that distinguish between questions of benefit calculation\n\nand questions of benefit eligibility.                  The plan employs the term\n\n\"earnings,\"       in    combination     with      various    other     terms,   in   its\n\nprovisions governing whether a payment can be made. In addition to\n\nthe provisions upon which Boston Mutual relies, the plan limits\n\neligibility       for    benefits     in   its      definition   of    disability     to\n\nindividuals who have \"at least a 20% loss in [their] pre-disability\n\nearnings.\" The plan employs the term \"income,\" by contrast, in its\n\nprovisions       governing      the   size     of    payments    due    to   qualified\n\nindividuals.       These provisions might plausibly reduce the size of\n\na benefit payment to zero,7 but they are distinct from provisions\n\nconcerning who is qualified to receive a payment.\n\n               Not only do \"earnings\" and \"income\" occupy different\n\ndomains of the plan; Boston Mutual has also construed these terms\n\nquite       differently.        Depending    on     the    context,    Boston   Mutual\n\nconstrues \"earnings\" to mean either W-2 income or both W-2 income\n\n\n\n        7\n          The plan identifies a \"minimum payment\" amount, which\nmight be read to ensure a baseline payment for individuals that\nmeet benefit eligibility requirements but would receive a payment\nof zero under the benefit calculation formula. Neither party has\ninvoked this provision, however, and we need not address it\nfurther.\n\n                                           -28-\n\fand non-salary income deriving from employment.8           As expressly\n\ndefined within the plan, \"other income amounts\" extend beyond both\n\nof these definitions of earnings.         In its definition of \"other\n\nincome amounts,\" the plan includes \"any income you earn or receive\n\nfrom any form of employment.\"         It also includes a variety of\n\nbenefits and awards received under employment plans and government\n\nprograms. For example, the plan lists Social Security benefits due\n\nto disability or retirement, benefits received under workers'\n\ncompensation, and sick leave benefits.\n\n              Boston Mutual's interpretation also renders meaningless\n\nthe only provision in the plan that appears to define \"earnings\" in\n\na substantive way.     The plan defines \"Basic annual Earnings\" with\n\nreference to W-2 earnings; elsewhere, the plan is silent as to what\n\ncounts   as    earnings.   The   plan's   express   definition   of   \"pre-\n\ndisability earnings\" does not mention W-2 earnings, and Boston\n\nMutual has not explicitly explained why it has construed the term\n\n\"earnings\" to mean W-2 income when it is used with the term \"pre-\n\ndisability.\"9     Under Boston Mutual's construction of the plan, the\n\n\n     8\n          Boston Mutual cites a series of dictionary definitions\nfor the proposition that its definition of \"earnings\" when the term\nis either unaccompanied or accompanied by the term \"current\" falls\nwithin ordinary usage. Although some of the dictionary definitions\nrefer to \"earnings\" as all income deriving from labor and capital,\nBoston Mutual does not assert that its definition of \"earnings\"\nstretches this broadly.\n     9\n          The most logical textual source for this construction of\nthe term \"earnings\" when used with the term \"pre-disability\" is the\ndefinition of \"Basic annual Earnings.\"      The plan defines \"pre-\n\n                                   -29-\n\fdefinition of \"Basic annual Earnings\" is only relevant to that\n\nparticular phrase.    Yet the phrase does not appear once in the plan\n\noutside the provisions that define it.\n\n           Boston Mutual makes a further structural argument that\n\nits construction avoids a difficulty that would arise if the plan\n\nwere construed to define \"earnings\" as W-2 income.         It argues that\n\nif earnings were construed in that manner, principals like Dolan\n\ncould inflate their benefit payments by reclassifying their W-2\n\nincome as non-salary income.         The plan expressly avoids this\n\npurported difficulty, however. It provides that an individual will\n\nno longer receive benefits if he or she is \"able to increase [his\n\nor her] current earnings by increasing the number of hours [he or\n\nshe] work[s] or the number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his\n\nor her] regular occupation but . . . does not do so.\"                This\n\nprovision would allow Boston Mutual to terminate the benefits of\n\nindividuals who attempted to increase their benefits in this\n\nfashion.\n\n           It   is   also   instructive   that   Boston   Mutual,   though\n\nindisputably in possession of all of Dolan's tax forms at all times\n\nrelevant to this suit, did not advance its present construction of\n\nthe plan until more than four years after it began paying Dolan\n\n\n\ndisability earnings\" with reference to the insured's \"monthly rate\nof earnings,\" however, not \"basic annual earnings.\" Thus, this\nconstruction would suggest that \"Basic annual Earnings\" defines\n\"earnings\" generally, which is not Boston Mutual's position.\n\n                                  -30-\n\fbenefits.       Boston Mutual does not dispute that Dolan's tax forms\n\nmade    clear    that   she   was    a   principal    of   D&H   and   Associated\n\nProfessional      Management,       Inc.,   and    received   income    in   these\n\ncapacities.       When Dolan filed her initial claim for benefits,\n\nBoston Mutual apparently did not consider this other income stream\n\nto preclude eligibility.10\n\n            If Boston Mutual wanted to offer a plan that determined\n\nbenefit eligibility by comparing pre-disability W-2 income with\n\npost-disability income deriving from employment, it could have\n\ndrafted a plan that made this clear.                   Boston Mutual may not\n\ntransform an existing plan to achieve this end by construing it in\n\na fashion contrary to its terms.                In light of the foregoing, we\n\nhold that Boston Mutual's construction of the plan was unreasonable\n\nand, therefore, that its determination that Dolan has never been\n\neligible for benefits constituted an abuse of discretion.11\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          We do not reach Boston Mutual's argument that we may not\nconsider the contents of the four contested affidavits, which\ncontain additional factual claims concerning the consistency of\nBoston Mutual's construction of the plan. The contents of these\naffidavits are not necessary to our holding.\n       11\n          We have considered the arguments as to whether Boston\nMutual   has   taken   adequate   measures   to   \"insulate   [its]\ndecisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects\nof structural conflicts\" of interest, Denmark v. Liberty Life\nAssurance Co. of Boston, 566 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2009), and they do\nnot alter our conclusion.\n\n                                         -31-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n          Our holding that Boston Mutual abused its discretion in\n\ndetermining   that   Dolan   has   never   been   eligible   for   benefits\n\nrequires an entry of judgment for Dolan on both her wrongful denial\n\nof benefits claim and Boston Mutual's counterclaim for recoupment\n\nof past payments.     We affirm the entry of judgment for Dolan on\n\nBoston Mutual's counterclaim on the different ground that Boston\n\nMutual's determination that it overpaid benefits was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   We reverse the district court's entry of judgment for\n\nBoston Mutual on Dolan's wrongful denial of benefits claim and\n\nremand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment\n\nfor Dolan, subject to the provisos in this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f",

Pincince and Beal Law, LLC were on brief, for appellees/cross-appellants.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Both parties appeal from grants of summary judgment in this dispute concerning the benefit eligibility language of a long-term disability benefit plan regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Plaintiffs D &amp; H Therapy Associates, LLC (D &amp; H), and Robin Dolan appeal from a grant of summary judgment against their claims that Dolan was eligible for and entitled to benefits under the plan or, in the alternative, damages for fraud in the inducement. Defendant Boston Mutual Life Insurance Company (Boston Mutual), in turn, appeals from entry of summary judgment against its counterclaim that it is entitled to reimbursement for payments already made to Dolan, which it says were mistaken.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> D &amp; H obtained an ERISA plan from Boston Mutual in 2000. Under the plan, employees who suffer specified reductions in monthly earnings due to long-term disability are eligible for benefits. Dolan is both a part-owner and an employee of D &amp; H. In 2001, she became physically unable to continue some of her tasks as an employee, which prompted a reduction in her monthly W-2 earnings. In 2002, she began receiving benefits under the plan. After a 2006 audit, however, Boston Mutual terminated the benefits and demanded Dolan return past payments. It told Dolan that she had failed to account for her non-salary income, including earnings from her ownership stake in D &amp; H. With those ownership earnings included, Boston Mutual stated, Dolan's monthly earnings had been higher than her pre-disability monthly earnings since 2002, and so she was not and had never been eligible for payments.</p>\n<p>After Dolan filed unsuccessful administrative appeals with Boston Mutual's third-party claims administrator, she and D &amp; H initiated this litigation against Boston Mutual. Except as needed we refer to both plaintiffs as Dolan. Dolan challenges her benefit termination on two grounds. First, she argues that the plan defines \"earnings\" as W-2 income such that non-salary income is not relevant to eligibility determinations. Second, she argues that Boston Mutual should be estopped from construing the plan otherwise because it represented to D &amp; H at the time of purchase that the plan defined \"earnings\" as W-2 income. In the alternative, Dolan claims that Boston Mutual's representations fraudulently induced D &amp; H to forego renewing its preexisting insurance policy. Boston Mutual counterclaims that under the plan it is entitled to reimbursement of the $163,661.57 it paid to Dolan.</p>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment to each party on the claims brought by the other. As to Dolan's claims, it held that Boston Mutual's construction of the plan's language was within its discretion as the plan administrator and that Dolan's fraudulent inducement claim was preempted by ERISA. As to Boston Mutual's counterclaim, it held that the reimbursement sought did not qualify as appropriate equitable relief under ERISA.</p>\n<p>We hold that Boston Mutual abused its discretion when it determined that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits under the plan. This holding requires entry of judgment for Dolan on both her wrongful denial of benefits claim and on Boston Mutual's counterclaim for recoupment of past payments. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's entry of judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's denial of benefits claim and affirm for Dolan on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. We need not reach Dolan's equitable estoppel argument or her fraud in the inducement claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Dolan and her partner Kim Havunen each hold a half ownership stake in D &amp; H, a firm that provides physical, occupational, and speech therapy services at several clinics in Rhode Island.<sup>[1]</sup> At all times relevant to this suit, Dolan and Havunen were also employees of the firm. Dolan served as the director of clinical services and as a physical therapist, while Havunen served as the director of business operations. Like other employees of the firm, Dolan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> and Havunen drew salary based on the number of hours they worked. Their salaries were not influenced, at least directly, by their ownership stakes in D &amp; H.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>D &amp; H's Acquisition of the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1997, D &amp; H obtained a long-term disability insurance policy from Guarantee Life Insurance Company (Guarantee Life). D &amp; H obtained the policy with the help of an insurance agent, Benefit Services, Inc. (Benefit Services). Havunen led the efforts to obtain this policy. She testified that she explained to a Benefit Services representative that D &amp; H wanted a policy that would protect W-2 earnings such that the principals of the firm would be insulated against loss of the salary form of their income. Havunen understood the Guarantee Life policy to reflect this request. According to Havunen, the policy defined protected earnings for principals as W-2 earnings.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Guarantee Life policy was expiring. As D &amp; H considered whether to renew the policy, the same Benefit Services representative who had assisted D &amp; H with the Guarantee Life policy contacted Havunen. The representative, Maureen Baker, informed Havunen that she had received a quote from a different insurance provider at a better rate. Havunen testified that she told Baker that D &amp; H would only consider switching to the new policy if the policy protected W-2 earnings in the same manner as she understood the Guarantee Life policy did. Havunen testified further that when Baker identified the quote in question as belonging to Boston Mutual, Havunen reiterated this requirement.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the Boston Mutual policy would meet these specifications, Havunen testified, she and Baker met with a Boston Mutual agent, Thomas Liszanckie. Havunen testified that Liszanckie assured her that the Boston Mutual policy would contain the same definitions of \"earnings\" and \"income\" as the Guarantee Life policy. She testified as well that Liszanckie brought a written \"Group Insurance Proposal,\" which he said contained the requested protection for W-2 income. Havunen testified that Liszanckie identified the last page of the proposal as ensuring this protection. That page includes the following statement: \"Definition of Earnings: Basic Annual Earnings shall mean the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2.\"</p>\n<p>Havunen testified that, based on Liszanckie's statements and the proposal's definition of earnings, D &amp; H did not renew the Guarantee Life policy and instead purchased the Boston Mutual policy. When Havunen received the final language of the policy, she expressed some concern to Baker about the policy's terms relating to \"any other income from employment,\" which might be construed to include income other than W-2 income. Baker, Havunen testified, assured her that this language only referred to other income that may be included in W-2 earnings, like bonuses and commissions. Havunen did not contest the final policy language. She testified that D &amp; H would not have signed on to the policy if not for Liszanckie and Baker's representations.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual disputes Havunen's testimony concerning her conversations with Baker, the content of the Guarantee Life policy, and her interactions with Liszanckie. Baker testified that, in her discussions with Havunen about both the Guarantee Life policy and the Boston Mutual policy, Havunen told her that she wanted to protect the K-1 income of D &amp; H's principals, not their W-2 income. Baker also speculated that a portion of the Guarantee Life <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> policy not present in the record defined earnings for principals differently from that of other employees and included non-salary income.<sup>[2]</sup> Liszanckie testified that while he occasionally dropped off insurance forms to customers before they signed an insurance policy, he rarely met with the customers and he could not recall whether he met with Havunen and Baker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Terms of the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having reviewed these disputed facts concerning D &amp; H's decision to obtain the Boston Mutual policy, we turn to the plan language that governs that policy. There is no dispute that the policy, unlike the Guarantee Life policy, is governed by ERISA. We divide discussion of the plan's contents between provisions concerning benefit eligibility, provisions concerning benefit calculation, and provisions concerning overpayment of claims.</p>\n<p>As to benefit eligibility, principals and all other employees are eligible for benefits if they suffer a specified loss in earnings due to disability. This applies when these individuals \"are not able to perform some or all of the material and substantial duties of [their] regular occupation\" and \"have at least a 20% loss in [their] pre-disability earnings.\" This litigation does not concern what rises to an inability to perform occupational duties.</p>\n<p>It concerns, instead, what it means to have a 20% loss in pre-disability earnings as defined by the plan. For both principals and all other employees, the plan gives these definitions concerning earnings: \"Pre-disability earnings means your monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins. Basic annual Earnings shall mean the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2, excluding commissions.\" If an individual has earnings for less than a calendar year, the plan provides that \"Basic Annual Earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month worked and annualizing the result.\"</p>\n<p>The plan lists a series of circumstances that justify benefit termination. These include when an individual is \"no longer disabled,\" has \"reached the end of the maximum payment duration,\" or has \"current earnings [that] exceed 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings.\" Benefits will also be terminated when an individual is \"able to increase [his or her] current earnings by increasing the number of hours [he or she] work[s] or the number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his or her] regular occupation but . . . do[es] not do so.\" The plan emphasizes, in bolded all-capital letters, that if an individual is \"disabled and working, earning more than 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings, no payment will be made.\"</p>\n<p>As to benefit calculation, the plan specifies that the maximum monthly payment is $6,000 and the minimum monthly payment is $100 or 10%, presumably of monthly pre-disability earnings. It includes two formulas for benefit calculation. The first applies to individuals \"earning less than 20% of [their] pre-disability earnings,\" whether they are currently working or not. The second applies to individuals working and \"earning between 20% and 80% of [their] pre-disability earnings.\" The plan makes no express provision for how to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> calculate benefit payments for individuals who are not working but are nonetheless earning between 20% and 80% of their pre-disability earnings.</p>\n<p>The specifics of the two formulas are as follows. Under the first, monthly payments are figured by taking the lesser of (a) $6,000 and (b) 60% of \"pre-disability earnings,\" and then subtracting \"any other income amounts except any income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment.\" Under the second, benefits are initially the lesser of (a) $6,000, (b) 100% of \"pre-disability earnings\" minus \"any other income amounts including current income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment,\" and (c) 60% of \"pre-disability earnings.\" After 24 months, additional payments under this formula are determined by taking the lesser of (a) $6,000, and (b) 60% of \"pre-disability income,\" and then subtracting 50% of \"any income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment\" and 100% of \"any other income amounts.\"</p>\n<p>The policy defines \"other income amounts\" in six categories. All the categories except for one pertain to benefits and awards an individual either receives or is eligible to receive under specified laws or employer insurance plans. The remaining category, particularly important for our purposes, states that \"other income amounts\" includes \"any income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\"</p>\n<p>As to overpayment, the plan provides, \"We have the right to recover overpayments due to fraud; an error we make in processing your claim; [or] your receipt of other income amounts.\" It also states, \"If we determine that we overpaid your claim, then we require you repay us in full. We will determine the method by which you will repay us.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Dispute Under the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In February 2001, shortly after D &amp; H obtained the Boston Mutual policy, Dolan underwent orthopedic surgery. When she returned to work in August 2001, she worked fewer hours and received less salary. In January 2002, Boston Mutual approved Dolan's claim under the policy and began dispensing benefits. These benefits continued until 2006, when Boston Mutual's third-party claims administrator, Disability Reinsurance Management Services (DRMS), conducted an audit.</p>\n<p>Based on the audit, DRMS concluded that Dolan's benefit payments had not properly taken account of business profits she received as a principal of D &amp; H and another entity, Associated Professional Management, Inc. With those profits included, DRMS calculated Dolan's pre-disability monthly earnings to be $5,833.33 and her post-disability monthly earnings in 2002 to be $7,670.67. In an August 2006 letter, Boston Mutual informed Dolan of the audit and asserted its right under the policy to recover overpayments due to \"fraud or error.\" Dolan, through her attorney, contested this finding. She argued that this business income fell outside the definition of \"earnings\" relevant for determining eligibility under the policy.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding Dolan's objections, by an October 2006 letter Boston Mutual discontinued her benefits and reasserted its demand that she repay past benefits. The letter stated that the benefits Dolan had received since January 2002 had resulted in an overpayment of $145,958.32. Dolan twice appealed the termination determination, and in each case DRMS denied the appeal. In her appeals, Dolan argued that she had disclosed her ownership interests at all relevant times and that the intention of D &amp; H and its principals in purchasing the policy had been to protect W-2 earnings. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> She did not submit evidence that Boston Mutual had represented to D &amp; H that the policy would protect W-2 earnings in this fashion. After DRMS denied these appeals, Dolan filed this lawsuit.</p>\n<p>In the district court, Dolan challenged her benefit termination under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. § 1132. She argued that (1) the plain language of the plan renders non-salary income irrelevant for benefit eligibility, and (2) Boston Mutual should be equitably estopped from asserting otherwise given Liszanckie's representations to Havunen. In the alternative, Dolan argued that D &amp; H was fraudulently induced to purchase the Boston Mutual plan and sought damages in tort under state law. As a remedy for fraudulent inducement, Dolan argued that she was entitled to the benefits she would have received under the Guarantee Life policy had D &amp; H renewed it. Dolan also asserted state law contract claims, but later conceded that these claims are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual counterclaimed, demanding reimbursement under the plan for $163,661.57 in overpaid benefits.<sup>[3]</sup> The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on Dolan's claims and Boston Mutual's counterclaim.</p>\n<p>Three arguments Boston Mutual made before the district court are relevant on appeal. First, it argued that its determination that Dolan had not been eligible for benefits was reasonable and within the discretion afforded to certain plan administrators under ERISA. Second, it argued that the district court could not consider four affidavits Dolan submitted concerning purported misrepresentations because they had not been part of the administrative record.<sup>[4]</sup> Third, it argued that ERISA preempts Dolan's state claim for fraud in the inducement.</p>\n<p>Initially, the district court granted Boston Mutual's motion for summary judgment on Dolan's claims but denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. Boston Mutual moved for reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment as to its counterclaim in light of a Supreme Court decision, <i>Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 356, 126 S.Ct. 1869, 164 L.Ed.2d 612 (2006), on permissible relief under ERISA that the district court had not considered. Dolan moved for reconsideration of her claims in light of a recent decision of this court, <i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> 566 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2009), concerning conflicts of interest in certain discretionary decisions by ERISA plan administrators.</p>\n<p>The district court reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's claims. On reconsideration, however, it granted Dolan's motion for summary judgment on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. In the two decisions, the district court held (1) Boston Mutual's eligibility determination was reasonable and thus entitled to deference under ERISA, (2) ERISA preempts Dolan's claim for fraud in the inducement under 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), and (3) Boston Mutual's claim for reimbursement for overpaid benefits is not \"appropriate equitable relief\" under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). The district court did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> not expressly address Dolan's equitable estoppel argument. It also did not address Boston Mutual's motion to strike the four contested affidavits, as the motion was deemed moot in light of the court's grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p>In the present cross-appeals, Dolan appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual on her claims and Boston Mutual appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Dolan on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grants of summary judgment de novo. <i>Sch. Union No. 37 v. United Nat'l Ins. Co.,</i> 617 F.3d 554, 558-59 (1st Cir.2010). In the typical case, we will reverse a grant of summary judgment only if, making all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party, a rational factfinder could resolve the legal issue for either side. <i>Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> 592 F.3d 215, 223-24 (1st Cir.2010). The presence of cross-motions does not alter this general standard. When there are cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider each motion separately, drawing all inferences in favor of each non-moving party in turn. <i>Merchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 143 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Cases that concern benefit determinations under an ERISA plan, however, are not typical cases when it comes to summary judgment. When an ERISA plan gives an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or construe the plan's terms, the district court must uphold the administrator's decision unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cusson,</i> 592 F.3d at 224 (quoting <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 360 F.3d 211, 213 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In such cases, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue\" and \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The parties agree that the plan at issue here affords Boston Mutual authority to determine benefit eligibility and construe its terms. Accordingly, the district court reviewed Boston Mutual's benefit determinations for abuse of discretion. Our de novo review of the district court's grants of summary judgment as they relate to benefit determinations must look to whether the district court erred in finding that Boston Mutual's determinations were within its discretion. Our de novo review of the district court's grants of summary judgment as they relate to other issues must employ the non-deferential review typically employed on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 517.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We address in concert the two benefit determinations relevant to this appeal, as both rest on the same stated rationale. Boston Mutual terminated Dolan's benefits because it deemed Dolan ineligible for benefits under the plan, and it demanded recoupment of past payments made to Dolan because it deemed that Dolan had never <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> been eligible for benefits under the plan. It has been Boston Mutual's position that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits because her post-disability earnings have always exceeded her pre-disability earnings as defined by the plan. There are no disputed facts concerning Dolan's income. The parties only dispute how to interpret the plan's terms and thereby determine Dolan's eligibility for benefits in light of her income.</p>\n<p>This interpretive dispute centers on four constructions present in the plan: \"earnings,\" \"basic annual earnings,\" \"pre-disability earnings,\" and \"current earnings.\" Dolan argues that the plan's definition of \"basic annual earnings\" defines \"earnings\" as W-2 income and that a reasonable reading of the plan demands a consistent application of this definition, irrespective of the temporal periods \"pre-disability\" and \"current.\" It has been Boston Mutual's position that when the term \"earnings\" precedes the terms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic annual\" it refers to monthly W-2 income, but when the term \"earnings\" is used alone or combined with the term \"current\" it refers to all income that derives from employment, including ownership income.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Existing Circuit Law</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In this circuit, we have held that an ERISA benefit determination is within the discretion of the plan administrator so long as it is \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Grp. Benefits Plan,</i> 402 F.3d 67, 74 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213). We have emphasized that our review of whether a plan administrator abused its discretion does not require that we determine either the \"best reading\" of the ERISA plan or how we would read the plan de novo. <i>Stamp v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 531 F.3d 84, 94 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Lennon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 504 F.3d 617, 624 (6th Cir.2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have also noted that the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply to review of an ERISA plan construction advanced by an administrator given authority to construe the plan. <i>Id.</i> at 93 (citing <i>Morton v. Smith,</i> 91 F.3d 867, 871 n. 1 (7th Cir. 1996)).</p>\n<p>Challenges to benefit determinations in this circuit have typically involved the application of contested facts to uncontested plan terms. In <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.2002), for example, we noted that the relevant plan terms were \"clear and unambiguous\" but that, \"[a]s in many such instances,\" the \"devil is in the details\" of applying the facts to those terms. <i>Id.</i> at 18. Most often, plaintiffs have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence underlying an ERISA plan administrator's factual conclusions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cusson,</i> 592 F.3d at 229-30; <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 518. They have also challenged benefit determinations on the grounds that the ERISA plan administrator improperly credited certain evidence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Medina v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 588 F.3d 41, 45-47 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 426 F.3d 20, 30 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> We are aware of only two cases decided in this circuit concerning purely interpretive questions like the one raised in this appeal. Understandably, neither of these cases articulate general guidelines as to when a plan administrator's construction is sufficiently lacking in reason that it rises to the level of an abuse of discretion. In the more recent case, <i>Coffin v. Bowater Inc.,</i> 501 F.3d 80 (1st Cir.2007), we upheld a plan administrator's construction because we found its construction \"significantly more persuasive\" than that offered by the plaintiffs. <i>Id.</i> at 96. In so holding, the court did not need to reach the more difficult question of when a plan administrator's construction will be sufficiently reasonable to warrant deference even though it is only as persuasive or less persuasive than the interpretation offered by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>In an earlier case, <i>Kolling v. American Power Conversion Corp.,</i> 347 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.2003), we held it within a plan administrator's discretion to \"reasonably\" construe the term \"employee,\" which was circularly defined by the plan as \"Employee of the Employer.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14. (citing <i>Trombetta v. Cragin Fed. Bank for Sav. Emp. Stock Ownership Plan,</i> 102 F.3d 1435, 1439-40 (7th Cir.1996)). We held that the plan administrator had \"permissibly looked\" to the insurance company's \"intention in defining the Plan's scope\" and that the evidence supported its determination regarding that intention. <i>Id.</i> We also held that the insurance company had consistently applied its definition of \"employee\" in the past. <i>Id.</i> We did not address when these indicators or others might require a holding that a plan construction was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has not spoken directly to how courts should assess whether an administrator's construction of a plan term is so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion. In <i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), the Court noted that \"ERISA abounds with the language and terminology of trust law,\" <i>id.</i> at 110, 109 S.Ct. 948, and that given this, it had held that courts must develop a \"federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,</i> 481 U.S. 41, 56, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that \"[t]rust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee exercises discretionary powers,\" and that when a trustee is given such power \"to construe disputed or doubtful terms . . . the trustee's interpretation will not be disturbed if reasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 111, 109 S.Ct. 948.</p>\n<p>The Court has not given precise content to this standard. It has held that courts must consider conflicts of interest that may arise when an administrator, like Boston Mutual, \"both determines whether an employee is eligible for benefits and pays benefits out of its own pocket.\" <i>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn,</i> 554 U.S. 105, 108, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008); <i>see also </i><i>Conkright v. Frommert,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1640, 1647, 176 L.Ed.2d 469 (2010). In <i>Glenn,</i> the Court noted that courts \"will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.\" <i>Glenn,</i> 554 U.S. at 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343. It did not identify other relevant factors, however, and \"warned against creating formulas that will `falsif[y] the actual process of judging' or serve as `instrument[s] of futile casuistry.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 119, 128 S.Ct. 2343 (quoting <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd.,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 489, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Law Beyond This Circuit</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In the absence of clear guidance from either this court or the Supreme Court, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> look to the law of other circuits. The circuit courts have articulated the abuse of discretion standard afforded to ERISA plan administrators under <i>Bruch</i> in various ways. Jayne E. Zanglein &amp; Susan J. Stabile, <i>ERISA Litigation</i> 550 (3d ed.2008). We do not delve into how the circuits have formulated this standard for all cases in which an ERISA plan administrator has power to make benefit determinations. Rather, we limit our attention to the question of when an ERISA plan administrator, acting pursuant to a grant of power to construe the plan's terms, construes the plan in a manner that is unreasonable and thus abuses its discretion.</p>\n<p>At the outset, we note that \"[i]t is notoriously difficult to venture a general definition of the term `abuse of discretion,' and none is canonical; indeed, the term has different meanings in different legal contexts.\" <i>Evans v. Eaton Corp. Long Term Disability Plan,</i> 514 F.3d 315, 321-22 (4th Cir.2008). As Judge Wilkinson wrote in <i>Evans,</i> the standard \"draws a lineor rather demarcates a regionbetween the unsupportable and the merely mistaken, between the legal error, disorder of reason, severe lapse of judgment, and procedural failure that a reviewing court may always correct, and the simple disagreement that, on this standard, it may not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 322 (citing Harry T. Edwards &amp; Linda Elliott, <i>Federal Standards of Review</i> 68 (2007)). It goes without saying that terms like \"reasonable,\" which underlie the standard here, are similarly difficult to define precisely.</p>\n<p>It also bears emphasis that this standard of review, which concerns a fiduciary element of the role of an ERISA plan administrator, must reflect the relevant principles of trust law, rather than the law of contracts. <i>Mathews v. Sears Pension Plan,</i> 144 F.3d 461, 465 (7th Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. at 111, 109 S.Ct. 948. As the Supreme Court has held, trust law \"can ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.\" <i>Glenn,</i> 554 U.S. at 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343. In this context, our analysis must weigh the values advanced by ERISA in empowering plan administrators as fiduciaries, <i>cf. </i><i>Evans,</i> 514 F.3d at 323, with the dangers policed by the statute arising from breach of fiduciary duty, <i>cf. </i><i>Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,</i> 473 U.S. 134, 141 n. 8, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985).</p>\n<p>In their review of ERISA plan constructions like the one presented in this case, courts beyond this circuit have looked to the language and purpose of the plan. In some circuits, the analysis has been conducted with reference to the consistency of an administrator's construction with the \"plain meaning\" of the plan. <i>See </i><i>Boyd v. Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Players Ret. Plan,</i> 410 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2005); <i>Wagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan Non Bargained Program,</i> 407 F.3d 395, 404 (D.C.Cir.2005); <i>Pagan v. NYNEX Pension Plan,</i> 52 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 1995); <i>Fuller v. CBT Corp.,</i> 905 F.2d 1055, 1060 (7th Cir.1990). These circuits have not defined how courts should determine whether an interpretation does not accord with an ERISA plan's plain meaning.</p>\n<p>At least four circuits have advanced more specific standards. The Fifth Circuit has split the inquiry into two steps, each of which contains three guiding factors, while the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits have listed a general set of guidelines.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit first asks whether an administrator's interpretation is \"legally correct.\" <i>Chacko v. Sabre, Inc.,</i> 473 F.3d 604, 611 (5th Cir.2006). In so doing, it considers \"(1) whether the administrator has given the plan a uniform construction; (2) whether the interpretation is consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> with a fair reading of the plan; and (3) any unanticipated costs resulting from different interpretations of the plan.\" <i>Id.</i> If the interpretation is \"legally correct,\" it must stand; if it is not, the court considers three factors to determine if it is an abuse of discretion: \"(1) the internal consistency of the plan under the administrator's interpretation, (2) any relevant regulations formulated by the appropriate administrative agencies, and (3) the factual background of the determination and any inferences of lack of good faith.\" <i>Gosselink v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel., Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 722 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits each employs a multi-factor test to determine whether a plan construction constitutes an abuse of discretion. The Third and Eighth circuits each considers the following five factors:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) whether the administrator's language is contrary to the clear language of the plan; (2) whether the interpretation conflicts with the substantive or procedural requirements of ERISA; (3) whether the interpretation renders any language of the plan meaningless or internally inconsistent; (4) whether the interpretation is consistent with the goals of the plan; and (5) whether the administrator has consistently followed the interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Manning v. Am. Republic Ins. Co.,</i> 604 F.3d 1030, 1041-42 (8th Cir.2010); <i>see also </i><i>Howley v. Mellon Fin. Corp.,</i> 625 F.3d 788, 795 (3d Cir.2010). The Fourth Circuit's \"non-exhaustive\" list of factors includes these five factors as well as \"whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled,\" \"any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion,\" and \"the fiduciary's motives and any conflict of interest it may have.\" <i>Carden v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,</i> 559 F.3d 256, 261 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Boston Mutual's Construction of the Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although these standards are instructive, we do not adopt them or any specific guiding factors. With all due deference to Boston Mutual's role as a fiduciary, it is clear that its construction of the ERISA plan at issue stretches beyond the bounds of reasonableness. This is so for a number of reasons, which are specific to the particular case at hand.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Boston Mutual's construction of the term \"earnings\" cannot be applied consistently within its own account of the plan's meaning. It has been Boston Mutual's position that the term \"earnings\" refers to W-2 income when it is used in conjunction with the terms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic annual.\" It has also been Boston Mutual's position that the term \"earnings\" refers to all income deriving from employment when it is used alone or with the term \"current.\" Yet the plan's express definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings\" cannot support both of these positions at once.</p>\n<p>The plan expressly defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as well as \"Basic annual Earnings\" with reference to the unaccompanied term \"earnings.\" The plan defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as \"your monthly rate of <i>earnings</i> from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins.\" (Emphasis added.) It defines \"Basic annual Earnings,\" in turn, as \"the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2, excluding commissions. If the person has earnings for less than a calendar year, Basic Annual Earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly <i>earnings</i> for each month worked and annualizing the result.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>If Boston Mutual's definition of the unaccompanied term \"earnings\" were applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> to that unaccompanied term as used <i>within</i> the plan's stated definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings,\" the term \"earnings\" would have to refer to both W-2 income and non-salary income when used in conjunction with the terms \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual.\" If, on the other hand, one accepts Boston Mutual's definition of \"earnings\" as used in conjunction with \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual,\" then the definition of the unaccompanied term \"earnings\" as used <i>within</i> the plan's definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings\" would have to refer only to salary income.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual attempts to counter this contradiction by invoking the broader structure of the plan. It argues that \"the clear import\" of the plan \"is to reduce and potentially eliminate benefit payments once the claimant earns enough money from other sources of income.\" In support of this claim, Boston Mutual points in particular to the plan's provision that benefits may be limited by a participant's receipt of \"other income amounts,\" a term the plan defines, inter alia, as \"[a]ny income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\" Boston Mutual argues that its various constructions of the term \"earnings,\" notwithstanding the definitions at the beginning of the plan, are consistent with the plan's effort to take account of income from employment.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Boston Mutual relies on language concerning benefit termination. The plan states that if an employee covered by the plan is \"disabled and working, <i>earning</i> more than 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings, no payment will be made,\" and payments will stop \"the date [the covered employee's] <i>current earnings</i> exceed 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings.\" (Emphasis added.) Boston Mutual argues that these provisions only allow payment of benefits when the sum of a covered employee's W-2 income and non-salary income from employment is at least 20% less than that individual's pre-disability W-2 income. The benefit formula, which sets payment amounts for those \"earning\" at least 20% less than their \"pre-disability earnings,\" mirrors this requirement under Boston Mutual's construction.</p>\n<p>This argument elides clear divisions within the plan's structure that distinguish between questions of benefit calculation and questions of benefit eligibility. The plan employs the term \"earnings,\" in combination with various other terms, in its provisions governing whether a payment can be made. In addition to the provisions upon which Boston Mutual relies, the plan limits eligibility for benefits in its definition of disability to individuals who have \"at least a 20% loss in [their] pre-disability earnings.\" The plan employs the term \"income,\" by contrast, in its provisions governing the size of payments due to qualified individuals. These provisions might plausibly reduce the size of a benefit payment to zero,<sup>[7]</sup> but they are distinct from provisions concerning who is qualified to receive a payment.</p>\n<p>Not only do \"earnings\" and \"income\" occupy different domains of the plan; Boston Mutual has also construed these terms quite differently. Depending on the context, Boston Mutual construes \"earnings\" to mean either W-2 income or both W-2 income and non-salary income deriving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> from employment.<sup>[8]</sup> As expressly defined within the plan, \"other income amounts\" extend beyond both of these definitions of earnings. In its definition of \"other income amounts,\" the plan includes \"any income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\" It also includes a variety of benefits and awards received under employment plans and government programs. For example, the plan lists Social Security benefits due to disability or retirement, benefits received under workers' compensation, and sick leave benefits.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual's interpretation also renders meaningless the only provision in the plan that appears to define \"earnings\" in a substantive way. The plan defines \"Basic annual Earnings\" with reference to W-2 earnings; elsewhere, the plan is silent as to what counts as earnings. The plan's express definition of \"pre-disability earnings\" does not mention W-2 earnings, and Boston Mutual has not explicitly explained why it has construed the term \"earnings\" to mean W-2 income when it is used with the term \"pre-disability.\"<sup>[9]</sup> Under Boston Mutual's construction of the plan, the definition of \"Basic annual Earnings\" is only relevant to that particular phrase. Yet the phrase does not appear once in the plan outside the provisions that define it.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual makes a further structural argument that its construction avoids a difficulty that would arise if the plan were construed to define \"earnings\" as W-2 income. It argues that if earnings were construed in that manner, principals like Dolan could inflate their benefit payments by reclassifying their W-2 income as non-salary income. The plan expressly avoids this purported difficulty, however. It provides that an individual will no longer receive benefits if he or she is \"able to increase [his or her] current earnings by increasing the number of hours [he or she] work[s] or the number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his or her] regular occupation but . . . does not do so.\" This provision would allow Boston Mutual to terminate the benefits of individuals who attempted to increase their benefits in this fashion.</p>\n<p>It is also instructive that Boston Mutual, though indisputably in possession of all of Dolan's tax forms at all times relevant to this suit, did not advance its present construction of the plan until more than four years after it began paying Dolan benefits. Boston Mutual does not dispute that Dolan's tax forms made clear that she was a principal of D &amp; H and Associated Professional Management, Inc., and received income in these capacities. When Dolan filed her initial claim for benefits, Boston Mutual apparently did not consider this other income stream to preclude eligibility.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> If Boston Mutual wanted to offer a plan that determined benefit eligibility by comparing pre-disability W-2 income with post-disability income deriving from employment, it could have drafted a plan that made this clear. Boston Mutual may not transform an existing plan to achieve this end by construing it in a fashion contrary to its terms. In light of the foregoing, we hold that Boston Mutual's construction of the plan was unreasonable and, therefore, that its determination that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits constituted an abuse of discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Our holding that Boston Mutual abused its discretion in determining that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits requires an entry of judgment for Dolan on both her wrongful denial of benefits claim and Boston Mutual's counterclaim for recoupment of past payments. We <i>affirm</i> the entry of judgment for Dolan on Boston Mutual's counterclaim on the different ground that Boston Mutual's determination that it overpaid benefits was an abuse of discretion. We <i>reverse</i> the district court's entry of judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's wrongful denial of benefits claim and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for Dolan, subject to the provisos in this opinion.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  D &amp; H has been a limited liability company since 2004, when it transferred its status from a partnership. A predecessor entity, Professional Rehabilitation Network (PRN), purchased the two long-term disability insurance policies described in this dispute. For ease of exposition, we refer to the present limited liability company and its predecessor entities collectively as D &amp; H.</p>\n<p>[2]  Baker testified that the policy laid out different benefit schedules for principals and all other employees. She acknowledged that a portion of the policy defined earnings as W-2 earnings, but speculated that this portion only applied to non-principal employees and that a portion of the policy not present in the record gave a separate definition of earnings that applied to principals.</p>\n<p>[3]  The counterclaim originally sought $145,958.32 in overpaid benefits. Boston Mutual subsequently recalculated the amount of the overpayment.</p>\n<p>[4]  These affidavits include Havunen's testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding D &amp; H's decision to purchase the Boston Mutual policy, as well as some of Liszanckie's testimony. They also include Dolan's testimony concerning her disabling condition and interactions with Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p>[5]  We have noted that \"[f]or purposes of reviewing benefit determinations by an ERISA plan administrator, the arbitrary and capricious standard is functionally equivalent to the abuse of discretion standard.\" <i>Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Grp. Benefits Plan,</i> 402 F.3d 67, 74 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005). We describe the relevant standard of review for these benefit determinations as \"abuse of discretion\" review.</p>\n<p>[6]  Specifically, Boston Mutual argues that S corporation \"pass through\" income paid to working shareholders falls within the definition of \"earnings\" when the term is used in isolation or in conjunction with the term \"current.\" It argues that this view is consistent with case law concerning the earnings subject to federal employment taxes. <i>See </i><i>NuLook Design, Inc. v. C.I.R.,</i> 356 F.3d 290, 291 (3d Cir.2004); <i>Joseph Radtke, S.C. v. United States,</i> 895 F.2d 1196, 1197 (7th Cir. 1990); <i>Spicer Accounting, Inc. v. United States,</i> 918 F.2d 90, 93 (9th Cir. 1990). Boston Mutual has not argued that any other type of non-salary income deriving from employment falls into these two definitions of \"earnings.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The plan identifies a \"minimum payment\" amount, which might be read to ensure a baseline payment for individuals that meet benefit eligibility requirements but would receive a payment of zero under the benefit calculation formula. Neither party has invoked this provision, however, and we need not address it further.</p>\n<p>[8]  Boston Mutual cites a series of dictionary definitions for the proposition that its definition of \"earnings\" when the term is either unaccompanied or accompanied by the term \"current\" falls within ordinary usage. Although some of the dictionary definitions refer to \"earnings\" as all income deriving from labor and capital, Boston Mutual does not assert that its definition of \"earnings\" stretches this broadly.</p>\n<p>[9]  The most logical textual source for this construction of the term \"earnings\" when used with the term \"pre-disability\" is the definition of \"Basic annual Earnings.\" The plan defines \"pre-disability earnings\" with reference to the insured's \"monthly rate of earnings,\" however, not \"basic annual earnings.\" Thus, this construction would suggest that \"Basic annual Earnings\" defines \"earnings\" generally, which is not Boston Mutual's position.</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not reach Boston Mutual's argument that we may not consider the contents of the four contested affidavits, which contain additional factual claims concerning the consistency of Boston Mutual's construction of the plan. The contents of these affidavits are not necessary to our holding.</p>\n<p>[11]  We have considered the arguments as to whether Boston Mutual has taken adequate measures to \"insulate [its] decisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects of structural conflicts\" of interest, <i>Denmark v.

Plaintiffs D &amp; H Therapy Associates, LLC (D &amp; H), and Robin Dolan appeal from a grant of summary judgment against their claims that Dolan was eligible for and entitled to benefits under the plan or, in the alternative, damages for fraud in the inducement. Defendant Boston Mutual Life Insurance Company (Boston Mutual), in turn, appeals from entry of summary judgment against its counterclaim that it is entitled to reimbursement for payments already made to Dolan, which it says were mistaken.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> D &amp; H obtained an ERISA plan from Boston Mutual in 2000. Under the plan, employees who suffer specified reductions in monthly earnings due to long-term disability are eligible for benefits. Dolan is both a part-owner and an employee of D &amp; H. In 2001, she became physically unable to continue some of her tasks as an employee, which prompted a reduction in her monthly W-2 earnings. In 2002, she began receiving benefits under the plan. After a 2006 audit, however, Boston Mutual terminated the benefits and demanded Dolan return past payments. It told Dolan that she had failed to account for her non-salary income, including earnings from her ownership stake in D &amp; H. With those ownership earnings included, Boston Mutual stated, Dolan's monthly earnings had been higher than her pre-disability monthly earnings since 2002, and so she was not and had never been eligible for payments.</p>\n<p>After Dolan filed unsuccessful administrative appeals with Boston Mutual's third-party claims administrator, she and D &amp; H initiated this litigation against Boston Mutual. Except as needed we refer to both plaintiffs as Dolan. Dolan challenges her benefit termination on two grounds. First, she argues that the plan defines \"earnings\" as W-2 income such that non-salary income is not relevant to eligibility determinations. Second, she argues that Boston Mutual should be estopped from construing the plan otherwise because it represented to D &amp; H at the time of purchase that the plan defined \"earnings\" as W-2 income. In the alternative, Dolan claims that Boston Mutual's representations fraudulently induced D &amp; H to forego renewing its preexisting insurance policy. Boston Mutual counterclaims that under the plan it is entitled to reimbursement of the $163,661.57 it paid to Dolan.</p>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment to each party on the claims brought by the other. As to Dolan's claims, it held that Boston Mutual's construction of the plan's language was within its discretion as the plan administrator and that Dolan's fraudulent inducement claim was preempted by ERISA. As to Boston Mutual's counterclaim, it held that the reimbursement sought did not qualify as appropriate equitable relief under ERISA.</p>\n<p>We hold that Boston Mutual abused its discretion when it determined that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits under the plan. This holding requires entry of judgment for Dolan on both her wrongful denial of benefits claim and on Boston Mutual's counterclaim for recoupment of past payments. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's entry of judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's denial of benefits claim and affirm for Dolan on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. We need not reach Dolan's equitable estoppel argument or her fraud in the inducement claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Dolan and her partner Kim Havunen each hold a half ownership stake in D &amp; H, a firm that provides physical, occupational, and speech therapy services at several clinics in Rhode Island.<sup>[1]</sup> At all times relevant to this suit, Dolan and Havunen were also employees of the firm. Dolan served as the director of clinical services and as a physical therapist, while Havunen served as the director of business operations. Like other employees of the firm, Dolan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> and Havunen drew salary based on the number of hours they worked. Their salaries were not influenced, at least directly, by their ownership stakes in D &amp; H.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>D &amp; H's Acquisition of the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1997, D &amp; H obtained a long-term disability insurance policy from Guarantee Life Insurance Company (Guarantee Life). D &amp; H obtained the policy with the help of an insurance agent, Benefit Services, Inc. (Benefit Services). Havunen led the efforts to obtain this policy. She testified that she explained to a Benefit Services representative that D &amp; H wanted a policy that would protect W-2 earnings such that the principals of the firm would be insulated against loss of the salary form of their income. Havunen understood the Guarantee Life policy to reflect this request. According to Havunen, the policy defined protected earnings for principals as W-2 earnings.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Guarantee Life policy was expiring. As D &amp; H considered whether to renew the policy, the same Benefit Services representative who had assisted D &amp; H with the Guarantee Life policy contacted Havunen. The representative, Maureen Baker, informed Havunen that she had received a quote from a different insurance provider at a better rate. Havunen testified that she told Baker that D &amp; H would only consider switching to the new policy if the policy protected W-2 earnings in the same manner as she understood the Guarantee Life policy did. Havunen testified further that when Baker identified the quote in question as belonging to Boston Mutual, Havunen reiterated this requirement.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the Boston Mutual policy would meet these specifications, Havunen testified, she and Baker met with a Boston Mutual agent, Thomas Liszanckie. Havunen testified that Liszanckie assured her that the Boston Mutual policy would contain the same definitions of \"earnings\" and \"income\" as the Guarantee Life policy. She testified as well that Liszanckie brought a written \"Group Insurance Proposal,\" which he said contained the requested protection for W-2 income. Havunen testified that Liszanckie identified the last page of the proposal as ensuring this protection. That page includes the following statement: \"Definition of Earnings: Basic Annual Earnings shall mean the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2.\"</p>\n<p>Havunen testified that, based on Liszanckie's statements and the proposal's definition of earnings, D &amp; H did not renew the Guarantee Life policy and instead purchased the Boston Mutual policy. When Havunen received the final language of the policy, she expressed some concern to Baker about the policy's terms relating to \"any other income from employment,\" which might be construed to include income other than W-2 income. Baker, Havunen testified, assured her that this language only referred to other income that may be included in W-2 earnings, like bonuses and commissions. Havunen did not contest the final policy language. She testified that D &amp; H would not have signed on to the policy if not for Liszanckie and Baker's representations.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual disputes Havunen's testimony concerning her conversations with Baker, the content of the Guarantee Life policy, and her interactions with Liszanckie. Baker testified that, in her discussions with Havunen about both the Guarantee Life policy and the Boston Mutual policy, Havunen told her that she wanted to protect the K-1 income of D &amp; H's principals, not their W-2 income. Baker also speculated that a portion of the Guarantee Life <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> policy not present in the record defined earnings for principals differently from that of other employees and included non-salary income.<sup>[2]</sup> Liszanckie testified that while he occasionally dropped off insurance forms to customers before they signed an insurance policy, he rarely met with the customers and he could not recall whether he met with Havunen and Baker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Terms of the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having reviewed these disputed facts concerning D &amp; H's decision to obtain the Boston Mutual policy, we turn to the plan language that governs that policy. There is no dispute that the policy, unlike the Guarantee Life policy, is governed by ERISA. We divide discussion of the plan's contents between provisions concerning benefit eligibility, provisions concerning benefit calculation, and provisions concerning overpayment of claims.</p>\n<p>As to benefit eligibility, principals and all other employees are eligible for benefits if they suffer a specified loss in earnings due to disability. This applies when these individuals \"are not able to perform some or all of the material and substantial duties of [their] regular occupation\" and \"have at least a 20% loss in [their] pre-disability earnings.\" This litigation does not concern what rises to an inability to perform occupational duties.</p>\n<p>It concerns, instead, what it means to have a 20% loss in pre-disability earnings as defined by the plan. For both principals and all other employees, the plan gives these definitions concerning earnings: \"Pre-disability earnings means your monthly rate of earnings from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins. Basic annual Earnings shall mean the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2, excluding commissions.\" If an individual has earnings for less than a calendar year, the plan provides that \"Basic Annual Earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly earnings for each month worked and annualizing the result.\"</p>\n<p>The plan lists a series of circumstances that justify benefit termination. These include when an individual is \"no longer disabled,\" has \"reached the end of the maximum payment duration,\" or has \"current earnings [that] exceed 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings.\" Benefits will also be terminated when an individual is \"able to increase [his or her] current earnings by increasing the number of hours [he or she] work[s] or the number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his or her] regular occupation but . . . do[es] not do so.\" The plan emphasizes, in bolded all-capital letters, that if an individual is \"disabled and working, earning more than 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings, no payment will be made.\"</p>\n<p>As to benefit calculation, the plan specifies that the maximum monthly payment is $6,000 and the minimum monthly payment is $100 or 10%, presumably of monthly pre-disability earnings. It includes two formulas for benefit calculation. The first applies to individuals \"earning less than 20% of [their] pre-disability earnings,\" whether they are currently working or not. The second applies to individuals working and \"earning between 20% and 80% of [their] pre-disability earnings.\" The plan makes no express provision for how to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> calculate benefit payments for individuals who are not working but are nonetheless earning between 20% and 80% of their pre-disability earnings.</p>\n<p>The specifics of the two formulas are as follows. Under the first, monthly payments are figured by taking the lesser of (a) $6,000 and (b) 60% of \"pre-disability earnings,\" and then subtracting \"any other income amounts except any income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment.\" Under the second, benefits are initially the lesser of (a) $6,000, (b) 100% of \"pre-disability earnings\" minus \"any other income amounts including current income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment,\" and (c) 60% of \"pre-disability earnings.\" After 24 months, additional payments under this formula are determined by taking the lesser of (a) $6,000, and (b) 60% of \"pre-disability income,\" and then subtracting 50% of \"any income [the individual] earn[s] or receive[s] from any form of employment\" and 100% of \"any other income amounts.\"</p>\n<p>The policy defines \"other income amounts\" in six categories. All the categories except for one pertain to benefits and awards an individual either receives or is eligible to receive under specified laws or employer insurance plans. The remaining category, particularly important for our purposes, states that \"other income amounts\" includes \"any income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\"</p>\n<p>As to overpayment, the plan provides, \"We have the right to recover overpayments due to fraud; an error we make in processing your claim; [or] your receipt of other income amounts.\" It also states, \"If we determine that we overpaid your claim, then we require you repay us in full. We will determine the method by which you will repay us.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Dispute Under the Boston Mutual Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In February 2001, shortly after D &amp; H obtained the Boston Mutual policy, Dolan underwent orthopedic surgery. When she returned to work in August 2001, she worked fewer hours and received less salary. In January 2002, Boston Mutual approved Dolan's claim under the policy and began dispensing benefits. These benefits continued until 2006, when Boston Mutual's third-party claims administrator, Disability Reinsurance Management Services (DRMS), conducted an audit.</p>\n<p>Based on the audit, DRMS concluded that Dolan's benefit payments had not properly taken account of business profits she received as a principal of D &amp; H and another entity, Associated Professional Management, Inc. With those profits included, DRMS calculated Dolan's pre-disability monthly earnings to be $5,833.33 and her post-disability monthly earnings in 2002 to be $7,670.67. In an August 2006 letter, Boston Mutual informed Dolan of the audit and asserted its right under the policy to recover overpayments due to \"fraud or error.\" Dolan, through her attorney, contested this finding. She argued that this business income fell outside the definition of \"earnings\" relevant for determining eligibility under the policy.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding Dolan's objections, by an October 2006 letter Boston Mutual discontinued her benefits and reasserted its demand that she repay past benefits. The letter stated that the benefits Dolan had received since January 2002 had resulted in an overpayment of $145,958.32. Dolan twice appealed the termination determination, and in each case DRMS denied the appeal. In her appeals, Dolan argued that she had disclosed her ownership interests at all relevant times and that the intention of D &amp; H and its principals in purchasing the policy had been to protect W-2 earnings. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> She did not submit evidence that Boston Mutual had represented to D &amp; H that the policy would protect W-2 earnings in this fashion. After DRMS denied these appeals, Dolan filed this lawsuit.</p>\n<p>In the district court, Dolan challenged her benefit termination under ERISA's civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. § 1132. She argued that (1) the plain language of the plan renders non-salary income irrelevant for benefit eligibility, and (2) Boston Mutual should be equitably estopped from asserting otherwise given Liszanckie's representations to Havunen. In the alternative, Dolan argued that D &amp; H was fraudulently induced to purchase the Boston Mutual plan and sought damages in tort under state law. As a remedy for fraudulent inducement, Dolan argued that she was entitled to the benefits she would have received under the Guarantee Life policy had D &amp; H renewed it. Dolan also asserted state law contract claims, but later conceded that these claims are preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual counterclaimed, demanding reimbursement under the plan for $163,661.57 in overpaid benefits.<sup>[3]</sup> The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on Dolan's claims and Boston Mutual's counterclaim.</p>\n<p>Three arguments Boston Mutual made before the district court are relevant on appeal. First, it argued that its determination that Dolan had not been eligible for benefits was reasonable and within the discretion afforded to certain plan administrators under ERISA. Second, it argued that the district court could not consider four affidavits Dolan submitted concerning purported misrepresentations because they had not been part of the administrative record.<sup>[4]</sup> Third, it argued that ERISA preempts Dolan's state claim for fraud in the inducement.</p>\n<p>Initially, the district court granted Boston Mutual's motion for summary judgment on Dolan's claims but denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. Boston Mutual moved for reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment as to its counterclaim in light of a Supreme Court decision, <i>Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1869</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145657\"><a href=\"/opinion/145657/sereboff-v-mid-atlantic-medical-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span> (2006), on permissible relief under ERISA that the district court had not considered. Dolan moved for reconsideration of her claims in light of a recent decision of this court, <i>Denmark v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span> (1st Cir.2009), concerning conflicts of interest in certain discretionary decisions by ERISA plan administrators.</p>\n<p>The district court reaffirmed its grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's claims. On reconsideration, however, it granted Dolan's motion for summary judgment on Boston Mutual's counterclaim. In the two decisions, the district court held (1) Boston Mutual's eligibility determination was reasonable and thus entitled to deference under ERISA, (2) ERISA preempts Dolan's claim for fraud in the inducement under 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), and (3) Boston Mutual's claim for reimbursement for overpaid benefits is not \"appropriate equitable relief\" under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). The district court did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> not expressly address Dolan's equitable estoppel argument. It also did not address Boston Mutual's motion to strike the four contested affidavits, as the motion was deemed moot in light of the court's grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p>In the present cross-appeals, Dolan appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Boston Mutual on her claims and Boston Mutual appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment for Dolan on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's grants of summary judgment de novo. <i>Sch. Union No. 37 v. United Nat'l Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"173722\"><a href=\"/opinion/173722/school-union-no-37-v-united-nat-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 558-59 (1st Cir.2010). In the typical case, we will reverse a grant of summary judgment only if, making all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party, a rational factfinder could resolve the legal issue for either side. <i>Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204172\"><a href=\"/opinion/204172/cusson-v-liberty-life-assur-co-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 223-24 (1st Cir.2010). The presence of cross-motions does not alter this general standard. When there are cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider each motion separately, drawing all inferences in favor of each non-moving party in turn. <i>Merchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197929\"><a href=\"/opinion/197929/merchants-insurance-v-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Cases that concern benefit determinations under an ERISA plan, however, are not typical cases when it comes to summary judgment. When an ERISA plan gives an administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or construe the plan's terms, the district court must uphold the administrator's decision unless it is \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cusson,</i> 592 F.3d at 224 (quoting <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200864\"><a href=\"/opinion/200864/gannon-v-metropolitan-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 213 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In such cases, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue\" and \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201537\"><a href=\"/opinion/201537/orndorf-v-paul-revere-life-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The parties agree that the plan at issue here affords Boston Mutual authority to determine benefit eligibility and construe its terms. Accordingly, the district court reviewed Boston Mutual's benefit determinations for abuse of discretion. Our de novo review of the district court's grants of summary judgment as they relate to benefit determinations must look to whether the district court erred in finding that Boston Mutual's determinations were within its discretion. Our de novo review of the district court's grants of summary judgment as they relate to other issues must employ the non-deferential review typically employed on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 517.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We address in concert the two benefit determinations relevant to this appeal, as both rest on the same stated rationale. Boston Mutual terminated Dolan's benefits because it deemed Dolan ineligible for benefits under the plan, and it demanded recoupment of past payments made to Dolan because it deemed that Dolan had never <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> been eligible for benefits under the plan. It has been Boston Mutual's position that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits because her post-disability earnings have always exceeded her pre-disability earnings as defined by the plan. There are no disputed facts concerning Dolan's income. The parties only dispute how to interpret the plan's terms and thereby determine Dolan's eligibility for benefits in light of her income.</p>\n<p>This interpretive dispute centers on four constructions present in the plan: \"earnings,\" \"basic annual earnings,\" \"pre-disability earnings,\" and \"current earnings.\" Dolan argues that the plan's definition of \"basic annual earnings\" defines \"earnings\" as W-2 income and that a reasonable reading of the plan demands a consistent application of this definition, irrespective of the temporal periods \"pre-disability\" and \"current.\" It has been Boston Mutual's position that when the term \"earnings\" precedes the terms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic annual\" it refers to monthly W-2 income, but when the term \"earnings\" is used alone or combined with the term \"current\" it refers to all income that derives from employment, including ownership income.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Existing Circuit Law</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In this circuit, we have held that an ERISA benefit determination is within the discretion of the plan administrator so long as it is \"reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Grp. Benefits Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201501\"><a href=\"/opinion/201501/wright-v-donnelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213). We have emphasized that our review of whether a plan administrator abused its discretion does not require that we determine either the \"best reading\" of the ERISA plan or how we would read the plan de novo. <i>Stamp v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203356\"><a href=\"/opinion/203356/stamp-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Lennon v.

We have also noted that the doctrine of contra proferentem does not apply to review of an ERISA plan construction advanced by an administrator given authority to construe the plan. <i>Id.</i> at 93 (citing <i>Morton v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723800\"><a href=\"/opinion/723800/pens-plan-guide-p-23923x-michael-k-morton-v-edward-m-smith-ronald/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 871 n. 1 (7th Cir. 1996)).</p>\n<p>Challenges to benefit determinations in this circuit have typically involved the application of contested facts to uncontested plan terms. In <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200246\"><a href=\"/opinion/200246/leahy-v-raytheon-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002), for example, we noted that the relevant plan terms were \"clear and unambiguous\" but that, \"[a]s in many such instances,\" the \"devil is in the details\" of applying the facts to those terms. <i>Id.</i> at 18. Most often, plaintiffs have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence underlying an ERISA plan administrator's factual conclusions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cusson,</i> 592 F.3d at 229-30; <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 518. They have also challenged benefit determinations on the grounds that the ERISA plan administrator improperly credited certain evidence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Medina v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></span>, 45-47 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Buffonge v.

Understandably, neither of these cases articulate general guidelines as to when a plan administrator's construction is sufficiently lacking in reason that it rises to the level of an abuse of discretion. In the more recent case, <i>Coffin v. Bowater Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202928\"><a href=\"/opinion/202928/coffin-v-bowater-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2007), we upheld a plan administrator's construction because we found its construction \"significantly more persuasive\" than that offered by the plaintiffs. <i>Id.</i> at 96. In so holding, the court did not need to reach the more difficult question of when a plan administrator's construction will be sufficiently reasonable to warrant deference even though it is only as persuasive or less persuasive than the interpretation offered by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>In an earlier case, <i>Kolling v. American Power Conversion Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200694\"><a href=\"/opinion/200694/kolling-v-american-power-conv/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), we held it within a plan administrator's discretion to \"reasonably\" construe the term \"employee,\" which was circularly defined by the plan as \"Employee of the Employer.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.

The circuit courts have articulated the abuse of discretion standard afforded to ERISA plan administrators under <i>Bruch</i> in various ways. Jayne E. Zanglein &amp; Susan J. Stabile, <i>ERISA Litigation</i> 550 (3d ed.2008). We do not delve into how the circuits have formulated this standard for all cases in which an ERISA plan administrator has power to make benefit determinations. Rather, we limit our attention to the question of when an ERISA plan administrator, acting pursuant to a grant of power to construe the plan's terms, construes the plan in a manner that is unreasonable and thus abuses its discretion.</p>\n<p>At the outset, we note that \"[i]t is notoriously difficult to venture a general definition of the term `abuse of discretion,' and none is canonical; indeed, the term has different meanings in different legal contexts.\" <i>Evans v. Eaton Corp. Long Term Disability Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1024738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1024738/evans-v-eaton-corp-long-term-disability-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 321-22 (4th Cir.2008). As Judge Wilkinson wrote in <i>Evans,</i> the standard \"draws a lineor rather demarcates a regionbetween the unsupportable and the merely mistaken, between the legal error, disorder of reason, severe lapse of judgment, and procedural failure that a reviewing court may always correct, and the simple disagreement that, on this standard, it may not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 322 (citing Harry T. Edwards &amp; Linda Elliott, <i>Federal Standards of Review</i> 68 (2007)). It goes without saying that terms like \"reasonable,\" which underlie the standard here, are similarly difficult to define precisely.</p>\n<p>It also bears emphasis that this standard of review, which concerns a fiduciary element of the role of an ERISA plan administrator, must reflect the relevant principles of trust law, rather than the law of contracts. <i>Mathews v. Sears Pension Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754511\"><a href=\"/opinion/754511/edward-h-mathews-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 465 (7th Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. at 111, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>. As the Supreme Court has held, trust law \"can ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.\" <i>Glenn,</i> 554 U.S. at 117, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145788\"><a href=\"/opinion/145788/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-glenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2343</span></a></span>. In this context, our analysis must weigh the values advanced by ERISA in empowering plan administrators as fiduciaries, <i>cf. </i><i>Evans,</i> 514 F.3d at 323, with the dangers policed by the statute arising from breach of fiduciary duty, <i>cf. </i><i>Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 141 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In some circuits, the analysis has been conducted with reference to the consistency of an administrator's construction with the \"plain meaning\" of the plan. <i>See </i><i>Boyd v.

These circuits have not defined how courts should determine whether an interpretation does not accord with an ERISA plan's plain meaning.</p>\n<p>At least four circuits have advanced more specific standards. The Fifth Circuit has split the inquiry into two steps, each of which contains three guiding factors, while the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits have listed a general set of guidelines.</p>\n<p>The Fifth Circuit first asks whether an administrator's interpretation is \"legally correct.\" <i>Chacko v. Sabre, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"47619\"><a href=\"/opinion/47619/chacko-v-sabre-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 611 (5th Cir.2006). In so doing, it considers \"(1) whether the administrator has given the plan a uniform construction; (2) whether the interpretation is consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> with a fair reading of the plan; and (3) any unanticipated costs resulting from different interpretations of the plan.\" <i>Id.</i> If the interpretation is \"legally correct,\" it must stand; if it is not, the court considers three factors to determine if it is an abuse of discretion: \"(1) the internal consistency of the plan under the administrator's interpretation, (2) any relevant regulations formulated by the appropriate administrative agencies, and (3) the factual background of the determination and any inferences of lack of good faith.\" <i>Gosselink v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"25529\"><a href=\"/opinion/25529/gosselink-v-att-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span> (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits each employs a multi-factor test to determine whether a plan construction constitutes an abuse of discretion. The Third and Eighth circuits each considers the following five factors:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) whether the administrator's language is contrary to the clear language of the plan; (2) whether the interpretation conflicts with the substantive or procedural requirements of ERISA; (3) whether the interpretation renders any language of the plan meaningless or internally inconsistent; (4) whether the interpretation is consistent with the goals of the plan; and (5) whether the administrator has consistently followed the interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Manning v.

The Fourth Circuit's \"non-exhaustive\" list of factors includes these five factors as well as \"whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled,\" \"any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion,\" and \"the fiduciary's motives and any conflict of interest it may have.\" <i>Carden v. Aetna Life Ins.

With all due deference to Boston Mutual's role as a fiduciary, it is clear that its construction of the ERISA plan at issue stretches beyond the bounds of reasonableness. This is so for a number of reasons, which are specific to the particular case at hand.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Boston Mutual's construction of the term \"earnings\" cannot be applied consistently within its own account of the plan's meaning. It has been Boston Mutual's position that the term \"earnings\" refers to W-2 income when it is used in conjunction with the terms \"pre-disability\" or \"basic annual.\" It has also been Boston Mutual's position that the term \"earnings\" refers to all income deriving from employment when it is used alone or with the term \"current.\" Yet the plan's express definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings\" cannot support both of these positions at once.</p>\n<p>The plan expressly defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as well as \"Basic annual Earnings\" with reference to the unaccompanied term \"earnings.\" The plan defines \"pre-disability earnings\" as \"your monthly rate of <i>earnings</i> from the employer in effect just prior to the date disability begins.\" (Emphasis added.) It defines \"Basic annual Earnings,\" in turn, as \"the Insured Person's earnings for the prior calendar year as reported by the Group Policyholder on form W-2, excluding commissions. If the person has earnings for less than a calendar year, Basic Annual Earnings shall be determined by averaging the monthly <i>earnings</i> for each month worked and annualizing the result.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>If Boston Mutual's definition of the unaccompanied term \"earnings\" were applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> to that unaccompanied term as used <i>within</i> the plan's stated definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings,\" the term \"earnings\" would have to refer to both W-2 income and non-salary income when used in conjunction with the terms \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual.\" If, on the other hand, one accepts Boston Mutual's definition of \"earnings\" as used in conjunction with \"pre-disability\" and \"basic annual,\" then the definition of the unaccompanied term \"earnings\" as used <i>within</i> the plan's definitions of \"pre-disability earnings\" and \"basic annual earnings\" would have to refer only to salary income.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual attempts to counter this contradiction by invoking the broader structure of the plan. It argues that \"the clear import\" of the plan \"is to reduce and potentially eliminate benefit payments once the claimant earns enough money from other sources of income.\" In support of this claim, Boston Mutual points in particular to the plan's provision that benefits may be limited by a participant's receipt of \"other income amounts,\" a term the plan defines, inter alia, as \"[a]ny income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\" Boston Mutual argues that its various constructions of the term \"earnings,\" notwithstanding the definitions at the beginning of the plan, are consistent with the plan's effort to take account of income from employment.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Boston Mutual relies on language concerning benefit termination. The plan states that if an employee covered by the plan is \"disabled and working, <i>earning</i> more than 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings, no payment will be made,\" and payments will stop \"the date [the covered employee's] <i>current earnings</i> exceed 80% of [his or her] pre-disability earnings.\" (Emphasis added.) Boston Mutual argues that these provisions only allow payment of benefits when the sum of a covered employee's W-2 income and non-salary income from employment is at least 20% less than that individual's pre-disability W-2 income. The benefit formula, which sets payment amounts for those \"earning\" at least 20% less than their \"pre-disability earnings,\" mirrors this requirement under Boston Mutual's construction.</p>\n<p>This argument elides clear divisions within the plan's structure that distinguish between questions of benefit calculation and questions of benefit eligibility. The plan employs the term \"earnings,\" in combination with various other terms, in its provisions governing whether a payment can be made. In addition to the provisions upon which Boston Mutual relies, the plan limits eligibility for benefits in its definition of disability to individuals who have \"at least a 20% loss in [their] pre-disability earnings.\" The plan employs the term \"income,\" by contrast, in its provisions governing the size of payments due to qualified individuals. These provisions might plausibly reduce the size of a benefit payment to zero,<sup>[7]</sup> but they are distinct from provisions concerning who is qualified to receive a payment.</p>\n<p>Not only do \"earnings\" and \"income\" occupy different domains of the plan; Boston Mutual has also construed these terms quite differently. Depending on the context, Boston Mutual construes \"earnings\" to mean either W-2 income or both W-2 income and non-salary income deriving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> from employment.<sup>[8]</sup> As expressly defined within the plan, \"other income amounts\" extend beyond both of these definitions of earnings. In its definition of \"other income amounts,\" the plan includes \"any income you earn or receive from any form of employment.\" It also includes a variety of benefits and awards received under employment plans and government programs. For example, the plan lists Social Security benefits due to disability or retirement, benefits received under workers' compensation, and sick leave benefits.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual's interpretation also renders meaningless the only provision in the plan that appears to define \"earnings\" in a substantive way. The plan defines \"Basic annual Earnings\" with reference to W-2 earnings; elsewhere, the plan is silent as to what counts as earnings. The plan's express definition of \"pre-disability earnings\" does not mention W-2 earnings, and Boston Mutual has not explicitly explained why it has construed the term \"earnings\" to mean W-2 income when it is used with the term \"pre-disability.\"<sup>[9]</sup> Under Boston Mutual's construction of the plan, the definition of \"Basic annual Earnings\" is only relevant to that particular phrase. Yet the phrase does not appear once in the plan outside the provisions that define it.</p>\n<p>Boston Mutual makes a further structural argument that its construction avoids a difficulty that would arise if the plan were construed to define \"earnings\" as W-2 income. It argues that if earnings were construed in that manner, principals like Dolan could inflate their benefit payments by reclassifying their W-2 income as non-salary income. The plan expressly avoids this purported difficulty, however. It provides that an individual will no longer receive benefits if he or she is \"able to increase [his or her] current earnings by increasing the number of hours [he or she] work[s] or the number of duties [he or she] perform[s] in [his or her] regular occupation but . . . does not do so.\" This provision would allow Boston Mutual to terminate the benefits of individuals who attempted to increase their benefits in this fashion.</p>\n<p>It is also instructive that Boston Mutual, though indisputably in possession of all of Dolan's tax forms at all times relevant to this suit, did not advance its present construction of the plan until more than four years after it began paying Dolan benefits. Boston Mutual does not dispute that Dolan's tax forms made clear that she was a principal of D &amp; H and Associated Professional Management, Inc., and received income in these capacities. When Dolan filed her initial claim for benefits, Boston Mutual apparently did not consider this other income stream to preclude eligibility.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> If Boston Mutual wanted to offer a plan that determined benefit eligibility by comparing pre-disability W-2 income with post-disability income deriving from employment, it could have drafted a plan that made this clear. Boston Mutual may not transform an existing plan to achieve this end by construing it in a fashion contrary to its terms. In light of the foregoing, we hold that Boston Mutual's construction of the plan was unreasonable and, therefore, that its determination that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits constituted an abuse of discretion.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>Our holding that Boston Mutual abused its discretion in determining that Dolan has never been eligible for benefits requires an entry of judgment for Dolan on both her wrongful denial of benefits claim and Boston Mutual's counterclaim for recoupment of past payments. We <i>affirm</i> the entry of judgment for Dolan on Boston Mutual's counterclaim on the different ground that Boston Mutual's determination that it overpaid benefits was an abuse of discretion. We <i>reverse</i> the district court's entry of judgment for Boston Mutual on Dolan's wrongful denial of benefits claim and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for Dolan, subject to the provisos in this opinion.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  D &amp; H has been a limited liability company since 2004, when it transferred its status from a partnership. A predecessor entity, Professional Rehabilitation Network (PRN), purchased the two long-term disability insurance policies described in this dispute. For ease of exposition, we refer to the present limited liability company and its predecessor entities collectively as D &amp; H.</p>\n<p>[2]  Baker testified that the policy laid out different benefit schedules for principals and all other employees. She acknowledged that a portion of the policy defined earnings as W-2 earnings, but speculated that this portion only applied to non-principal employees and that a portion of the policy not present in the record gave a separate definition of earnings that applied to principals.</p>\n<p>[3]  The counterclaim originally sought $145,958.32 in overpaid benefits. Boston Mutual subsequently recalculated the amount of the overpayment.</p>\n<p>[4]  These affidavits include Havunen's testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding D &amp; H's decision to purchase the Boston Mutual policy, as well as some of Liszanckie's testimony. They also include Dolan's testimony concerning her disabling condition and interactions with Boston Mutual.</p>\n<p>[5]  We have noted that \"[f]or purposes of reviewing benefit determinations by an ERISA plan administrator, the arbitrary and capricious standard is functionally equivalent to the abuse of discretion standard.\" <i>Wright v.

Boston Mutual has not argued that any other type of non-salary income deriving from employment falls into these two definitions of \"earnings.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  The plan identifies a \"minimum payment\" amount, which might be read to ensure a baseline payment for individuals that meet benefit eligibility requirements but would receive a payment of zero under the benefit calculation formula. Neither party has invoked this provision, however, and we need not address it further.</p>\n<p>[8]  Boston Mutual cites a series of dictionary definitions for the proposition that its definition of \"earnings\" when the term is either unaccompanied or accompanied by the term \"current\" falls within ordinary usage. Although some of the dictionary definitions refer to \"earnings\" as all income deriving from labor and capital, Boston Mutual does not assert that its definition of \"earnings\" stretches this broadly.</p>\n<p>[9]  The most logical textual source for this construction of the term \"earnings\" when used with the term \"pre-disability\" is the definition of \"Basic annual Earnings.\" The plan defines \"pre-disability earnings\" with reference to the insured's \"monthly rate of earnings,\" however, not \"basic annual earnings.\" Thus, this construction would suggest that \"Basic annual Earnings\" defines \"earnings\" generally, which is not Boston Mutual's position.</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not reach Boston Mutual's argument that we may not consider the contents of the four contested affidavits, which contain additional factual claims concerning the consistency of Boston Mutual's construction of the plan. The contents of these affidavits are not necessary to our holding.</p>\n<p>[11]  We have considered the arguments as to whether Boston Mutual has taken adequate measures to \"insulate [its] decisionmaking process against the potentially pernicious effects of structural conflicts\" of interest, <i>Denmark v.
