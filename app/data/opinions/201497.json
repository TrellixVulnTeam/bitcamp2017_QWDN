Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n            Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeannette López de Victoria, with whom Pinto-Lugo, Oliveras &\nOrtiz, PSC was on brief, for appellants.\n     Ramon L. Walker Merino, with whom Walker Merino Law Office was\non brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                          March 23, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       The question presented is whether\n\na regional diagnostic and treatment center which treats only\n\nambulatory patients and has an emergency room independent of a\n\nhospital is subject to the requirements of the Emergency Medical\n\nTreatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd.\n\n           The district court, ruling on a suit by the parents of a\n\nfour-month old baby girl who died after being seen in the emergency\n\nroom of a Diagnostic and Treatment Center (\"Centro de Diagnóstico\n\ny Tratamiento\") (\"CDT\") in Corozal, Puerto Rico, held that an\n\nEMTALA suit was actionable.        We accepted the district court's\n\ncertification of this dispositive issue of law for interlocutory\n\nappeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).          We reverse, and order\n\ndismissal of the suit.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           The plaintiffs, a married couple, had a daughter, Lilliam\n\nDiaz   Rodriguez,   who   was   born   on   October   10,   2000,   with   a\n\ncombination of congenital cardiovascular defects which made her\n\nprone to cyanosis.\n\n           Lilliam vomited twice on March 3, 2001, and was taken by\n\nher mother to the emergency ward at the Corozal CDT at 9:00 PM for\n\nrespiratory difficulties.       The emergency ward doctor at the CDT\n\ndecided to transfer the child to the Pediatric Hospital at the\n\nPuerto Rico Medical Center and inserted an endotracheal tube in\n\nLilliam.   At 2:00 AM the next morning the child was transported to\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe Puerto Rico Medical Center with generalized cyanosis, and\n\nLilliam died sometime after arriving there.\n\n          The plaintiffs filed a federal suit for damages against\n\nCorporacion     de    Servicios    Integrales     de   Salud   del   Area    de\n\nBarranquitas, Corozal, Naranjito y Orocovis (\"Corporacion\"), the\n\nowner of the Corozal CDT, and American International Insurance\n\nCompany of Puerto Rico (\"AIICO\"), Corporacion's insurer.1                   The\n\nplaintiffs asserted federal subject matter jurisdiction by alleging\n\nthat the defendants violated EMTALA by failing to provide the child\n\nwith an \"appropriate medical screening examination\" so as to detect\n\nher emergency condition and by failing to stabilize the child's\n\ncondition properly before transferring her.                See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1395dd(a)-(c).       The complaint also alleged a Puerto Rico law claim\n\nof medical malpractice by the defendants, and invoked the federal\n\ncourt's supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n          The    defendants       moved    for   summary   judgment.        The\n\ndefendants, inter alia, denied the existence of federal subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, contending that EMTALA does not apply to the\n\nallegations in the complaint because the Corozal CDT is not a\n\n\"hospital\" within the meaning of EMTALA.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiffs also named Aeromed Services, Inc., which\nprovided the ambulance transportation from the Corozal CDT to the\nPuerto Rico Medical Center, as a defendant.       Aeromed is not\ninvolved in this appeal.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          The district court denied the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on May 9, 2003.             In its Opinion and Order, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that \"the provisions of EMTALA apply to\n\nCDTs in Puerto Rico that offer twenty-four hour emergency room\n\nservices, and that consequently, Plaintiffs have a colorable claim\n\nunder said statute.\"\n\n          The   defendants      then    sought     to    certify   the     district\n\ncourt's order for interlocutory appeal.                After initially denying\n\nthe   motion,    the     district      court     ultimately      certified      the\n\njurisdictional issue of whether the provisions of EMTALA are\n\napplicable to CDTs for consideration before this court.                    Pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), this court allowed the interlocutory appeal\n\nafter both appellants and appellees stipulated that the following\n\nfacts are not disputed:\n\n          1. The Corozal CDT is licensed under Puerto\n          Rico law to operate as a diagnostic and\n          treatment center.\n          2. The Corozal CDT provides 24-hour emergency\n          room services.\n          3.   The Corozal CDT has executed a Medicare\n          Provider \"Part B\" agreement.\n          4.   The Corozal CDT is not a hospital-based\n          facility nor is it attached to a hospital.\n          5.    The Corozal CDT is not an inpatient\n          facility.\n\n                                       II.\n\n          We    review    de   novo    the     grant    or   denial   of   summary\n\njudgment, Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v. Rapier Invs., Ltd., 197\n\nF.3d 18, 20 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999), as well as pure issues of law,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fRational Software Corp. v. Sterling Corp., 393 F.3d 276, 276 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            In 1986 Congress enacted EMTALA in large part to solve\n\nthe problem of \"dumping\" of uninsured patients -- the problem of\n\nhospital emergency rooms refusing to treat or transferring indigent\n\npatients    to   public   hospitals    without   first   assessing    and/or\n\nstabilizing the patient's condition.             See Correa v. Hosp. San\n\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1189 (1st Cir. 1995). EMTALA imposed some\n\nlimited substantive requirements on emergency rooms of hospitals\n\nparticipating in the federal Medicare program. Specifically EMTALA\n\nrequires (1) that \"a participating hospital afford an appropriate\n\nmedical screening to all persons who come to its emergency room\n\nseeking medical assistance,\" and (2) \"if an emergency medical\n\ncondition    exists,   the   participating   hospital     must    render    the\n\nservices that are necessary to stabilize the patient's condition .\n\n.   .   unless   transferring   the   patient    to   another    facility    is\n\nmedically indicated and can be accomplished with relative safety.\"\n\nId. at 1190; 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a)-(c).\n\n            EMTALA created a private cause of action for damages for\n\nviolations of the Act against \"participating hospitals.\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395dd(d)(2)(A). Congress conditioned those hospitals' continued\n\nparticipation in the federal Medicare program on acceptance of the\n\nduties imposed by EMTALA, \"[n]eeding a carrot to make health-care\n\nproviders more receptive to the stick.\"          Correa, 69 F.3d at 1189.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f              The question of law posed by this case is whether a CDT,\n\ndefined by Puerto Rico law as \"an independent facility . . . which\n\nprovides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of\n\nambulatory patients under the professional supervision of persons\n\nlicensed to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto\n\nRico,\" 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 331a(A)(4),2 qualifies as \"a hospital\n\nthat has a hospital emergency department\" under EMTALA, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§   1995dd(a).3      It   is   undisputed   that   the   Corazal   CDT   is   an\n\n\n      2\n      The full definition of a CDT is \"an independent facility or\none operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides\ncommunity services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory\npatients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to\npractice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico.\" 24 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 331a(A)(4). There is no dispute over the fact that the\nCorozal facility is not operated in conjunction with a hospital.\n      3\n          In relevant part, EMTALA provides:\n\n              In the case of a hospital that has a hospital\n              emergency   department,   if  any   individual\n              (whether or not eligible for benefits under\n              this subchapter) comes to the emergency\n              department and a request is made on the\n              individual's   behalf   for   examination   or\n              treatment for a medical condition, the\n              hospital must provide for an appropriate\n              medical screening examination within the\n              capability   of   the   hospital's   emergency\n              department,   including   ancillary   services\n              routinely    available   to    the   emergency\n              department, to determine whether or not an\n              emergency   medical   condition   (within  the\n              meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section)\n              exists.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a). The enforcement provision is limited to\n\"participating hospital[s].\"       Id. § 1395dd(d)(2)(A).         A\n\"participating hospital\" is in turn defined as \"a hospital that has\nentered into a [Medicare] provider agreement under section 1395cc\n\n                                      -6-\n\findependent facility and is not attached to a hospital.             CDTs are\n\n\"unique\" to Puerto Rico and are \"limited health facilities that\n\noffer only outpatient services such as dentistry, X-ray, and\n\nlaboratory services.\"\n\n          It is clear that EMTALA does not apply to all health care\n\nfacilities;    it   applies    only   to    participating   hospitals   with\n\nemergency departments.4       Further, the screening requirement under\n\n\nof this title.\"   Id. § 1395dd(e)(2). The plaintiffs' reliance on\nthis definition to establish that the CDT is a hospital is\nmisplaced.   The existence of a Medicare provider agreement is\nrelevant to whether a facility is \"participating\" for EMTALA\npurposes, not to whether a facility is a hospital. Revisions to\nsection 1395cc, which defines the Medicare provider agreements, are\nnot relevant to the issues in this case.\n     4\n      The plaintiffs attempted at oral argument to bolster their\nargument by pointing to amendments to an EMTALA regulation, 42\nC.F.R. § 489.24. The regulation was amended after the filing of\nthis suit and the issuance of the district court's order. See 68\nFed. Reg. 53222, 53262 (Sept. 9, 2003). It now includes a\ndefinition for \"dedicated emergency department\":\n\n          Dedicated emergency department means any\n          department or facility of the hospital,\n          regardless of whether it is located on or off\n          the main hospital campus, that meets at least\n          one of the following requirements:\n\n           (1) It is licensed by the State in which it\n          is located under applicable State law as an\n          emergency room or emergency department;\n\n           (2) It is held out to the public (by name,\n          posted signs, advertising, or other means) as\n          a place that provides care for emergency\n          medical conditions on an urgent basis without\n          requiring a previously scheduled appointment;\n          or\n\n              (3)   During    the   calendar   year   immediately\n\n                                      -7-\n\fEMTALA only applies to patients seeking treatment at the emergency\n\nroom, not elsewhere in a hospital.   See Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek, 175\n\nF.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir. 1999); Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977\n\nF.2d 872, 884 (4th Cir. 1992).   It follows that if the Corozal CDT\n\nis not a \"hospital,\" EMTALA cannot apply to it.\n\n          As an amendment to the Social Security Act, EMTALA\n\nincorporates the Act's definition of a \"hospital.\"   See Jackson v.\n\nEast Bay Hosp., 246 F.3d 1248, 1260 (9th Cir. 2001); cf. Correa, 69\n\nF.3d at 1196 (looking to the Social Security Act's definition of\n\n\"state law\" as the term is used in EMTALA).     That definition of\n\n\"hospital\" set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1395x includes, in relevant\n\npart:\n\n          (e) Hospital. The term \"hospital\" . . . means\n          an institution which -\n          (1)    is primarily engaged in providing, by\n                 or under the supervision of physicians,\n                 to inpatients (A) diagnostic services\n\n\n          preceding the calendar year in which a\n          determination under this section is being\n          made, based on a representative sample of\n          patient visits that occurred during that\n          calendar year, it provides at least one-third\n          of all of its outpatient visits for the\n          treatment of emergency medical conditions on\n          an urgent basis without requiring a previously\n          scheduled appointment.\n\n42 C.F.R. § 489.24(b). The plaintiffs argue that this definition\nmeans that the emergency room need not be a part of the hospital,\nbut can be \"off campus.\" The amended regulation is irrelevant to\nthe issue, and in any case this argument misconstrues the\nregulation. The \"dedicated emergency department\" may be physically\nlocated off campus from the main hospital building, but it still\nmust be a part of a hospital.\n\n                          -8-\n\f                     and therapeutic services for medical\n                     diagnosis, treatment, and care of\n                     injured, disabled, or sick persons, or\n                     (B) rehabilitation services for the\n                     rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or\n                     sick persons;\n           . . .\n           (7)       [and,] in the case of an institution in\n                     any State in which State or applicable\n                     local law provides for the licensing of\n                     hospitals, (A) is licensed pursuant to\n                     such law or (B) is approved, by the\n                     agency of such State or locality\n                     responsible for licensing hospitals, as\n                     meeting the standards established for\n                     such licensing . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e).     The Corozal CDT plainly does not meet these\n\nrequirements, for at least two reasons. First, it is not primarily\n\nengaged in providing diagnostic and therapeutic or rehabilitation\n\nservices to inpatients, as required by subsection (e)(1).        The CDT\n\nis engaged entirely in outpatient, ambulatory care.\n\n           Second, even if the requirement of subsection (e)(1) were\n\nmet, the other requirements of subsection (e)(7) must be met as\n\nwell.    Puerto Rico law does not license or characterize CDTs as\n\nhospitals.   Indeed, Puerto Rico law clearly distinguishes between\n\nhospitals and diagnostic and treatment centers.         Compare 24 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 331a(A)(1) (defining a \"hospital\" as \"an institution\n\nwhich renders services to the community providing medical and/or\n\nsurgical diagnosis and/or treatment for illnesses or injuries\n\nand/or   obstetric    treatment   to   hospitalized   patients   .   .   .\"\n\n(emphasis added)), with 24 P.R. Laws. Ann. § 331a(A)(4) (defining\n\na CDT as \"an independent facility or one operated in conjunction\n\n                                   -9-\n\fwith a hospital which provides community services for the diagnosis\n\nand   treatment    of   ambulatory   patients    under   the   professional\n\nsupervision of persons licensed to practice medicine, surgery or\n\ndentistry in Puerto Rico\" (emphasis added)).                 Even if a CDT\n\nprovides emergency services, that does not make it an emergency\n\nroom of a participating hospital.\n\n           The    district   court     recognized     that   \"under   normal\n\ncircumstances, the Court would agree that a clinic, which is really\n\nwhat a CDT is more akin to, does not fall under the auspices of\n\nEMTALA.\"   As a result, the district court found:\n\n           [T]his case hinges not on the literal wording\n           of the statute, but rather on the end result -\n           - that the services provided by Defendant are\n           the types of services that this law is clearly\n           geared to cover. The statute is clear in the\n           nature of the services it pertains to: it\n           applies to emergency rooms, a facility that\n           has traditionally provided 24-hour services\n           identical to the one in the case at bar.\n\nThe district court found it would be \"unconscionable\" not to extend\n\nEMTALA to cover CDTs with 24-hour emergency services because that\n\nwould have   the    effect   of   \"excluding    the   poor   population   who\n\nprimarily rely on CDT services from the reaches of this all\n\nimportant law.\"    So, it concluded, the spirit of EMTALA, if not its\n\nletter, was meant to cover the action against the defendants.\n\n           The district court erred. Federal courts are not free to\n\nignore the letter of the law in favor of the \"spirit\" of a law.\n\n\"[C]ourts interpret statutes primarily through detailed analysis of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconcrete statutory language, not by reference to abstract notions\n\nof generalized legislative intent.\"              Lopez-Soto, 175 F.3d at 176.\n\n\"[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it\n\nmeans and means what it says there.\"                 Connecticut Nat'l Bank v.\n\nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992).             There is no legal ambiguity\n\nabout the language Congress used in EMTALA -- EMTALA requires the\n\nemergency room be of a participating hospital. There is no factual\n\nissue about whether the defendant is an emergency room of a\n\nhospital -- it is not.        The fact that the CDT receives Medicare\n\nfunds does not make it an emergency room of a hospital.\n\n             Congress attempted to solve one problem -- to stop the\n\ndumping of indigent patients by hospital emergency rooms -- and\n\nchose language to effectuate its ends.            That type of problem is not\n\npresented by the facts of this case.              It is up to Congress, if it\n\nso wishes, to extend the protection of EMTALA to other situations.\n\nIt has not chosen to do so.\n\n             The denial of summary judgment to the defendants is\n\nreversed   and   the     federal   claims      are    ordered   dismissed   with\n\nprejudice.       There    being    no    basis    for    federal   jurisdiction\n\notherwise, the district court is directed to dismiss the Puerto\n\nRican law claims without prejudice.

Sterling Corp.,</i> 393 F.3d 276, 276 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986 Congress enacted EMTALA in large part to solve the problem of \"dumping\" of uninsured patients &#8212; the problem of hospital emergency rooms refusing to treat or transferring indigent patients to public hospitals without first assessing and/or stabilizing the patient's condition. <i>See Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1189 (1st Cir.1995). EMTALA imposed some limited substantive requirements on emergency rooms of hospitals participating in the federal Medicare program. Specifically EMTALA requires (1) that \"a participating hospital afford an appropriate medical screening to all persons who come to its emergency room seeking medical assistance,\" and (2) \"if an emergency medical condition exists, the participating hospital must render the services that are necessary to stabilize the patient's condition ... unless transferring the patient to another facility is medically indicated and can be accomplished with relative safety.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1190; 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a)-(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EMTALA created a private cause of action for damages for violations of the Act against \"participating hospitals.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(d)(2)(A). Congress conditioned those hospitals' continued participation in the federal Medicare program on acceptance of the duties imposed by EMTALA, \"[n]eeding a carrot to make health-care providers more receptive to the stick.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of law posed by this case is whether a CDT, defined by Puerto Rico law as \"an independent facility ... which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory patients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico,\" 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(4),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> qualifies as \"a hospital that has a hospital emergency department\" under EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It is undisputed that the Corazal CDT is an independent facility and is not attached to a hospital. CDTs are \"unique\" to Puerto Rico and are \"limited health facilities that offer only outpatient services such as dentistry, X-ray, and laboratory services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that EMTALA does not apply to all health care facilities; it applies only to participating hospitals with emergency departments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Further, the screening requirement under EMTALA only applies to patients seeking treatment at the emergency room, not elsewhere in a hospital. <i>See Lopez-Soto v. Hawayek,</i> 175 F.3d 170, 173 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am.,</i> 977 F.2d 872, 884 (4th Cir.1992). It follows that if the Corozal CDT is not a \"hospital,\" EMTALA cannot apply to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an amendment to the Social Security Act, EMTALA incorporates the Act's definition of a \"hospital.\" <i>See Jackson v. East Bay Hosp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1248, 1260 (9th Cir.2001); <i>cf. Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1196 (looking to the Social Security Act's definition of \"state law\" as the term is used in EMTALA). That definition of \"hospital\" set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x includes, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) Hospital. The term \"hospital\" ... means an institution which &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) [and,] in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(e). The Corozal CDT plainly does not meet these requirements, for at least two reasons. First, it is not primarily engaged in providing diagnostic and therapeutic or rehabilitation services to <i>inpatients,</i> as required by subsection (e)(1). The CDT is engaged entirely in outpatient, ambulatory care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the requirement of subsection (e)(1) were met, the other requirements of subsection (e)(7) must be met as well. Puerto Rico law does not license or characterize CDTs as hospitals. Indeed, Puerto Rico law clearly distinguishes between hospitals and diagnostic and treatment centers. <i>Compare</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(1) (defining a \"hospital\" as \"an institution which renders services to the community providing medical and/or surgical diagnosis and/or treatment for illnesses or injuries and/or obstetric treatment to <i>hospitalized patients</i> ...\" (emphasis added)), <i>with</i> 24 P.R. Laws. Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(4) (defining a CDT as \"an independent facility or one operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of <i>ambulatory patients</i> under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico\" (emphasis added)). Even if a CDT provides emergency services, that does not make it an emergency room of a participating <i>hospital.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court recognized that \"under normal circumstances, the Court would agree that a clinic, which is really what a CDT is more akin to, does not fall under the auspices of EMTALA.\" As a result, the district court found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his case hinges not on the literal wording of the statute, but rather on the end result &#8212; that the services provided by Defendant are the types of services that this law is clearly geared to cover. The statute is clear in the <i>nature</i> of the services it pertains to: it applies to emergency rooms, a facility that has traditionally provided 24-hour services identical to the one in the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found it would be \"unconscionable\" not to extend EMTALA to cover CDTs with 24-hour emergency services because that would have the effect of \"excluding the poor population who primarily rely on CDT services from the reaches of this all important law.\" So, it concluded, the spirit of EMTALA, if not its letter, was meant to cover the action against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred. Federal courts are not free to ignore the letter of the law in favor of the \"spirit\" of a law. \"[C]ourts interpret statutes primarily through detailed analysis of concrete statutory language, not by reference to abstract notions of generalized legislative intent.\" <i>Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 176. \"[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means what it says there.\" <i>Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). There is no legal ambiguity about the language Congress used in EMTALA &#8212; EMTALA requires the emergency room be of a participating <i>hospital.</i> There is no factual issue about whether the defendant is an emergency room of a hospital-it is not. The fact that the CDT receives Medicare funds does not make it an emergency room of a hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress attempted to solve one problem &#8212; to stop the dumping of indigent patients by hospital emergency rooms &#8212; and chose language to effectuate its ends. That type of problem is not presented by the facts of this case. It is up to Congress, if it so wishes, to extend the protection of EMTALA to other situations. It has not chosen to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of summary judgment to the defendants is <i>reversed</i> and the federal claims are ordered dismissed with prejudice. There being no basis for federal jurisdiction otherwise, the district court is directed to dismiss the Puerto Rican law claims without prejudice. No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs also named Aeromed Services, Inc., which provided the ambulance transportation from the Corozal CDT to the Puerto Rico Medical Center, as a defendant. Aeromed is not involved in this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The full definition of a CDT is \"an independent facility or one operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of ambulatory patients under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico.\" 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(4). There is no dispute over the fact that the Corozal facility is not operated in conjunction with a hospital</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, EMTALA provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter) comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). The enforcement provision is limited to \"participating hospital[s].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395dd(d)(2)(A). A \"participating hospital\" is in turn defined as \"a hospital that has entered into a [Medicare] provider agreement under section 1395cc of this title.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395dd(e)(2). The plaintiffs' reliance on this definition to establish that the CDT is a hospital is misplaced. The existence of a Medicare provider agreement is relevant to whether a facility is \"participating\" for EMTALA purposes, not to whether a facility is a hospital. Revisions to section 1395cc, which defines the Medicare provider agreements, are not relevant to the issues in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs attempted at oral argument to bolster their argument by pointing to amendments to an EMTALA regulation, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 489.24. The regulation was amended after the filing of this suit and the issuance of the district court's order<i>See</i> 68 Fed.Reg. 53222, 53262 (Sept. 9, 2003). It now includes a definition for \"dedicated emergency department\":</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Dedicated emergency department means any department or facility of the hospital, regardless of whether it is located on or off the main hospital campus, that meets at least one of the following requirements:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) It is licensed by the State in which it is located under applicable State law as an emergency room or emergency department;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) It is held out to the public (by name, posted signs, advertising, or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) During the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a determination under this section is being made, based on a representative sample of patient visits that occurred during that calendar year, it provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">42</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> C.F.R. &#167; 489.24(b). The plaintiffs argue that this definition means that the emergency room need not be a part of the hospital, but can be \"off campus.\" The amended regulation is irrelevant to the issue, and in any case this argument misconstrues the regulation. The \"dedicated emergency department\" may be physically located off campus from the main hospital building, but it still must be a part of a hospital</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

EMTALA imposed some limited substantive requirements on emergency rooms of hospitals participating in the federal Medicare program. Specifically EMTALA requires (1) that \"a participating hospital afford an appropriate medical screening to all persons who come to its emergency room seeking medical assistance,\" and (2) \"if an emergency medical condition exists, the participating hospital must render the services that are necessary to stabilize the patient's condition ... unless transferring the patient to another facility is medically indicated and can be accomplished with relative safety.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1190; 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a)-(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EMTALA created a private cause of action for damages for violations of the Act against \"participating hospitals.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(d)(2)(A).

Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1196 (looking to the Social Security Act's definition of \"state law\" as the term is used in EMTALA). That definition of \"hospital\" set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x includes, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) Hospital. The term \"hospital\" ... means an institution which &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) [and,] in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(e). The Corozal CDT plainly does not meet these requirements, for at least two reasons. First, it is not primarily engaged in providing diagnostic and therapeutic or rehabilitation services to <i>inpatients,</i> as required by subsection (e)(1). The CDT is engaged entirely in outpatient, ambulatory care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the requirement of subsection (e)(1) were met, the other requirements of subsection (e)(7) must be met as well. Puerto Rico law does not license or characterize CDTs as hospitals. Indeed, Puerto Rico law clearly distinguishes between hospitals and diagnostic and treatment centers. <i>Compare</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(1) (defining a \"hospital\" as \"an institution which renders services to the community providing medical and/or surgical diagnosis and/or treatment for illnesses or injuries and/or obstetric treatment to <i>hospitalized patients</i> ...\" (emphasis added)), <i>with</i> 24 P.R. Laws. Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(4) (defining a CDT as \"an independent facility or one operated in conjunction with a hospital which provides community services for the diagnosis and treatment of <i>ambulatory patients</i> under the professional supervision of persons licensed to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry in Puerto Rico\" (emphasis added)). Even if a CDT provides emergency services, that does not make it an emergency room of a participating <i>hospital.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court recognized that \"under normal circumstances, the Court would agree that a clinic, which is really what a CDT is more akin to, does not fall under the auspices of EMTALA.\" As a result, the district court found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his case hinges not on the literal wording of the statute, but rather on the end result &#8212; that the services provided by Defendant are the types of services that this law is clearly geared to cover. The statute is clear in the <i>nature</i> of the services it pertains to: it applies to emergency rooms, a facility that has traditionally provided 24-hour services identical to the one in the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found it would be \"unconscionable\" not to extend EMTALA to cover CDTs with 24-hour emergency services because that would have the effect of \"excluding the poor population who primarily rely on CDT services from the reaches of this all important law.\" So, it concluded, the spirit of EMTALA, if not its letter, was meant to cover the action against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred. Federal courts are not free to ignore the letter of the law in favor of the \"spirit\" of a law. \"[C]ourts interpret statutes primarily through detailed analysis of concrete statutory language, not by reference to abstract notions of generalized legislative intent.\" <i>Lopez-Soto,</i> 175 F.3d at 176. \"[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means what it says there.\" <i>Connecticut Nat'l Bank v.

There is no legal ambiguity about the language Congress used in EMTALA &#8212; EMTALA requires the emergency room be of a participating <i>hospital.</i> There is no factual issue about whether the defendant is an emergency room of a hospital-it is not. The fact that the CDT receives Medicare funds does not make it an emergency room of a hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress attempted to solve one problem &#8212; to stop the dumping of indigent patients by hospital emergency rooms &#8212; and chose language to effectuate its ends. That type of problem is not presented by the facts of this case. It is up to Congress, if it so wishes, to extend the protection of EMTALA to other situations. It has not chosen to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of summary judgment to the defendants is <i>reversed</i> and the federal claims are ordered dismissed with prejudice. There being no basis for federal jurisdiction otherwise, the district court is directed to dismiss the Puerto Rican law claims without prejudice.

Laws Ann. &#167; 331a(A)(4). There is no dispute over the fact that the Corozal facility is not operated in conjunction with a hospital</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, EMTALA provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter) comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). The enforcement provision is limited to \"participating hospital[s].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395dd(d)(2)(A). A \"participating hospital\" is in turn defined as \"a hospital that has entered into a [Medicare] provider agreement under section 1395cc of this title.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395dd(e)(2). The plaintiffs' reliance on this definition to establish that the CDT is a hospital is misplaced. The existence of a Medicare provider agreement is relevant to whether a facility is \"participating\" for EMTALA purposes, not to whether a facility is a hospital. Revisions to section 1395cc, which defines the Medicare provider agreements, are not relevant to the issues in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs attempted at oral argument to bolster their argument by pointing to amendments to an EMTALA regulation, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 489.24. The regulation was amended after the filing of this suit and the issuance of the district court's order<i>See</i> 68 Fed.Reg. 53222, 53262 (Sept. 9, 2003). It now includes a definition for \"dedicated emergency department\":</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Dedicated emergency department means any department or facility of the hospital, regardless of whether it is located on or off the main hospital campus, that meets at least one of the following requirements:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) It is licensed by the State in which it is located under applicable State law as an emergency room or emergency department;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) It is held out to the public (by name, posted signs, advertising, or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment; or</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(3) During the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a determination under this section is being made, based on a representative sample of patient visits that occurred during that calendar year, it provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">42</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> C.F.R. &#167; 489.24(b). The plaintiffs argue that this definition means that the emergency room need not be a part of the hospital, but can be \"off campus.\" The amended regulation is irrelevant to the issue, and in any case this argument misconstrues the regulation. The \"dedicated emergency department\" may be physically located off campus from the main hospital building, but it still must be a part of a hospital</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
