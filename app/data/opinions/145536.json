Joseph    Georges   Anacassus\n\n(\"Anacassus\"), a native and citizen of Haiti, petitions for review\n\nof a Board of Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\") decision affirming an\n\nimmigration judge's (\"IJ\") denial of his application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture   (\"CAT\").      Anacassus    contends      that   the   record   shows\n\nsufficient evidence to establish past persecution and/or a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, and that the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding otherwise.          After careful consideration, we\n\nfind that the BIA's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nWe deny the petition for review.\n\n                             I.    Background1\n\n           Anacassus    attempted    to    enter    the   United    States   on\n\nApril 15, 2003.      He arrived at Miami International Airport with a\n\nfraudulent passport and visa. Immigration authorities detained and\n\ninterviewed him regarding his attempted entry.            Anacassus told the\n\ninterviewing official that he sought political asylum and feared\n\npersecution if he should return to Haiti.          The immigration officer\n\nreferred Anacassus to an asylum officer, who determined that\n\nAnacassus had established a credible fear of persecution and\n\nreferred his application to an immigration judge.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    These facts are drawn from Anacassus's testimony before the IJ.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            The   Department     of    Homeland      Security   (\"DHS\")    served\n\nAnacassus with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\")2 and removal proceedings\n\ncommenced.    Anacassus appeared before the Miami Immigration Court\n\nand   conceded    removability,       but   sought    asylum,   withholding    of\n\nremoval, and relief under the CAT.            After successfully moving for\n\na change of venue to Boston, Massachusetts, Anacassus testified\n\nbefore the immigration judge in support of his asylum application.\n\n            Anacassus testified that he had suffered persecution at\n\nthe hands of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's\n\npolitical party, Lavalas, due to his membership in the opposition\n\nparty, the Movement for National Development (\"MDN\")3.                 Lavalas had\n\na militant wing, the Chimere Lavalas, which Anacassus stated often\n\nviolently    disrupted    MDN    meetings     by   physically      attacking   MDN\n\nmembers and throwing rocks or bottles in the air.               Anacassus was a\n\nregional leader in MDN who assisted in the organization of bi-\n\nweekly meetings.        He claimed that his role in the MDN garnered\n\nLavalas'    attention    when,    on   November      17,   2002,   a   previously\n\nrecorded speech was aired on television. In this speech, Anacassus\n\ndiscussed political problems in Haiti, including human rights\n\n\n2\n     The NTA charged Anacassus with removability under the\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") for attempting to procure\nadmission   to  the   United   States   via   fraud   or   material\nmisrepresentations, INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)\n(i), and for seeking admission without valid entry documents, INA\n§ 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n3\n   The acronym reflects the political party's name in French, the\nMouvement pour La Developement National.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fviolations.   When Anacassus attended an anti-Lavalas demonstration\n\non December 3, 2002, weeks after the speech, he was attacked by\n\nChimere Lavalas members.\n\n            According to Anacassus, Chimere Lavalas members beat him\n\nat the demonstration, hitting him on the forehead, nose, and cheek\n\nwith batons and leaving scars on his face and wrists.               Fifteen\n\nminutes after arriving, police officers took demonstrators who had\n\nbeen beaten, including Anacassus (although Anacassus later stated\n\nhe was the only demonstrator beaten), to a police station for\n\nprotection from further attack.          Afterwards, the police, with\n\nChimere Lavalas members following close behind, took Anacassus to\n\nhis home.\n\n            Anacassus called MDN and informed them of the attack at\n\nthe   demonstration.    MDN    broadcast   the   news    to   various   radio\n\nstations later that day.      Meanwhile, a doctor treated Anacassus at\n\nhis home for his injuries.        At approximately 9:00 p.m., while\n\nAnacassus was resting in bed, he heard a banging on the front door\n\nand a voice asking his mother where he was.         His mother told the\n\nvisitor that he was not at home while Anacassus slipped out the\n\nback window. Anacassus later stated that before escaping, he heard\n\nhis mother being beaten.\n\n            Anacassus testified that he first ran to his friend's\n\nhouse, then to his sister's.      On calling home, he learned that his\n\ngirlfriend and son were \"severely beaten.\"              When asked why his\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fasylum application failed to mention his son's beating or injuries,\n\nAnacassus stated he did not learn about it until February 2003.          On\n\nbeing reminded that his asylum application had been filed after\n\nFebruary 2003, Anacassus changed his explanation, stating that he\n\nchose not to include his son's beating because he had not witnessed\n\nit.    Anacassus had no explanation, however, as to why his October\n\n2004 affidavit stated that he heard his son being thrown against a\n\nwall the night he escaped through the window.\n\n            The day after the demonstration and alleged attack at\n\nAnacassus's home, Anacassus's mother, girlfriend, and son moved to\n\na     different    location;   Anacassus   remained     at   his   sister's.\n\nAnacassus testified that, on the same day as the move, his mother\n\ntook his son to a hospital for treatment.             Anacassus offered no\n\nmedical records to support this testimony.       However, other medical\n\nrecords showed his son receiving hospital treatment seven months\n\nafter the alleged December 2002 treatment.        When asked about this\n\ndiscrepancy, Anacassus clarified that his son did not go to the\n\nhospital the day after the alleged attacks; rather, he went to an\n\n\"herb doctor.\"\n\n            Anacassus remained in contact with his mother while he\n\nwas in hiding.      She told him that Chimere Lavalas members came to\n\nher new address on repeated occasions and made threats against\n\nAnacassus.        Because he feared for his life, Anacassus sought\n\nassistance from his friend, Symbert, in obtaining a passport and\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fvisa.    Anacassus testified that he never suspected that either the\n\npassport or visa that Symbert gave him were invalid when he\n\npresented them to immigration authorities at the Miami airport on\n\nApril 15, 2003.\n\n            The    IJ   denied   Anacassus's    application    for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief and ordered his removal to\n\nHaiti.    The IJ found that Anacassus failed to meet his burden of\n\nproof    with   credible   testimony   and     failed   to   establish   past\n\npersecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, or that he\n\nmore likely than not would be tortured on returning to Haiti.\n\n            The    IJ   found    Anacassus's    testimony    regarding    his\n\ninvolvement in MDN and the political tensions between MDN and\n\nChimere Lavalas –- including Chimere Lavalas disruption of MDN\n\nmeetings and the December 2002 attack at the demonstration –-\n\n\"generally credible.\" However, the IJ concluded that this \"single,\n\nisolated event,\" even if considered with the Chimere Lavalas's\n\nharassment of MDN meetings, was not sufficient to constitute past\n\npersecution.      The IJ found that it also did not establish a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution because, according to at least\n\none of Anacassus's accounts, Haitian police intervened to protect\n\nhim at the demonstration, indicating that the \"authorities in Haiti\n\nare willing and able to protect\" Anacassus.\n\n            The IJ did not find Anacassus's testimony as to the\n\nalleged Chimere Lavalas attack at his home, including the alleged\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbeating of his wife and son, credible.                 The IJ's credibility\n\nfinding turned on inconsistencies in Anacassus's testimony, asylum\n\napplication,    airport     interview,     and   credible    fear   interview.\n\nSpecifically,    the   IJ   noted   the    omission    of   any   statement   in\n\nAnacassus's asylum application, airport interview, and credible\n\nfear interview referencing the attack on his wife or son.             This was\n\nin contrast to his affidavit, which described their beatings as if\n\nhe had been present, and to his testimony, which provided that he\n\nlearned about the attacks by telephone \"either a few hours or a few\n\nmonths after they occurred.\"              The IJ noted that \"[Anacassus]\n\nappears to have added details to his claim over time in order to\n\nembellish it.\"    Further, the IJ stated that \"there is no reliable\n\ndocumentary evidence that Chimere Lavalas members appeared at\n\n[Anacassus's] home, attacked his family, or continue to pursue\n\nhim.\"     Because of inconsistencies in his accounts and a lack of\n\nsupporting evidence, the IJ determined that Anacassus could not\n\nshow past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nThe IJ concluded that, as Anacassus could not meet the \"well-\n\nfounded fear\" asylum standard, he also could not meet the higher,\n\n\"more likely than not\" standard for withholding of removal or CAT\n\nrelief.    Thus, the IJ denied his withholding of removal and CAT\n\nclaims.\n\n            Anacassus appealed to the BIA.            He challenged the IJ's\n\nadverse credibility finding, claiming the inconsistencies on which\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe IJ focused were not relevant to his asylum claim; argued that\n\nthe IJ failed to consider Anacassus's testimony that he was the\n\nonly person attacked at the demonstration; and argued that the\n\npolice did not protect him at the demonstration, but conspired with\n\nthe Chimere Lavalas as to the demonstration and home attack.       The\n\nBIA upheld the lack of credibility finding as to Anacassus's\n\naccount of the home attack, noting that the inconsistencies in\n\nAnacassus's account went to the heart of his asylum claim.           It\n\nrejected Anacassus's claim that the IJ failed to consider he was\n\nthe only one hurt at the demonstration, citing inconsistencies in\n\nhis testimony where he referenced other demonstrators' beatings.\n\nLastly, it noted that Anacassus admitted to receiving police\n\nprotection at the demonstration.    The BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling\n\nthat Anacassus failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, as well as the IJ's\n\ndetermination   as   to   withholding   and   CAT   relief.   Anacassus\n\npetitioned this court for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                             II. Discussion4\n\n          A. Standard of Review\n\n          We review de novo the BIA's legal rulings, but defer to\n\nits \"findings of fact and the determination as to whether the facts\n\nsupport a claim of persecution.\"      Jorgi v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 53, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).      The BIA's fact-bound determinations, including\n\ncredibility findings, will be upheld, provided that they are\n\nsupported \"by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole,\" Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that no\n\n\"reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary,\"   Rasiah   v.   Holder,   589   F.3d   1,   4   (1st   Cir.   2009)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Where \"the BIA adopts the IJ's\n\nopinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we\n\nhave authority to review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions.\"              Decky\n\nv. Holder, 587 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Following the tragic earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12,\n2010, the United States government issued a rule designating Haiti\nfor temporary protected status (\"TPS\") for a period of eighteen\nmonths. Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 75\nFed. Reg. 3476 (Jan. 21, 2010). Anacassus may fulfill the criteria\nfor TPS. However, Anacassus's TPS eligibility is not before us,\nand so we do not address the possible effect of the TPS statute on\nhis removal status.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            B. Asylum\n\n            Anacassus's essential claim on appeal is that the IJ and\n\nBIA improperly denied his application for asylum.5             To establish\n\neligibility for asylum, Anacassus bears the burden of proving that\n\nhe is a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act.             See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); see also Weng v. Holder, 593 F.3d 66, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).        To qualify as a refugee, Anacassus must show\n\n\"either that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded\n\nfear   of   future   persecution   on   the   basis   of   'race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.'\" Decky, 587 F.3d at 110 (quoting Journal v. Kiesler, 507\n\nF.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007)).       \"A showing of past persecution gives\n\nrise to a presumption of future persecution unless rebutted.\"\n\nJorgi, 514 F.3d 53 at 57 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).\n\n                     1. Past Persecution\n\n            Persecution \"'encompasses more than threats to life or\n\nfreedom, but less than mere harassment or annoyance.'\"                Sok v.\n\n\n5\n   Because Anacassus's arguments on appeal focus entirely on his\nasylum claim, and he develops no arguments to support either his\nclaim for withholding of removal or his claim for relief under the\nCAT, we deem these claims abandoned. See Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,\n427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005); Topalli v. Gonzales, 417\nF.3d 128, 131 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[Petitioner's] challenge is to\nthe BIA's dismissal of his appeal as a whole, but he offers no\narguments with respect to his claims for withholding of removal or\nprotection under the CAT. He has therefore waived any challenge to\nthe BIA's denial of these claims.\"); see also Usman v. Holder, 566\nF.3d 262, 268 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"An argument that the petitioner is\nentitled to asylum does not properly raise the issue of withholding\nof removal.\").\n\n                                    -10-\n\fMukasey, 526 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Aguilar-Solís v.\n\nI.N.S., 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir. 1999)).          Further, it \"does not\n\ninclude all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust,\n\nor even unlawful or unconstitutional.\"        Sharari v. Gonzáles, 407\n\nF.3d 467, 474 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Fatin v. I.N.S., 12 F.3d\n\n1233, 1240 (3d Cir. 1993)).       To establish past persecution, \"the\n\ntotality of a petitioner's experiences [must] add up to more than\n\nmere    discomfiture,     unpleasantness,     harassment,        or   unfair\n\ntreatment.\"    Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120.\n\n             \"In determining whether alleged incidents rise to the\n\nlevel   of   persecution,   one   important   factor     is    whether   'the\n\nmistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of\n\na series of isolated incidents.'\"      Journal, 507 F.3d at 12 (citing\n\nBocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005)).                  Here,\n\nAnacassus'    credible   testimony6   provided   a    single    incident   of\n\npersonal violence, specifically, the beating at the anti-Lavalas\n\npolitical demonstration.     The IJ also found Anacassus's testimony\n\nconcerning \"the level and type of his involvement with the MDN\n\n[and] the harassment . . . MDN members endured at their meetings\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n   \"'Because the immigration judge is in the best position to\nevaluate   an   alien's   testimony,   his   or   her   credibility\ndeterminations are to be given much weight.'\" Syed v. Ashcroft, 389\nF.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Estrada v. I.N.S., 775 F.2d\n1018, 1021 (9th Cir. 1985)).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fto be \"generally credible.\"7         Although the IJ found that tensions\n\nexisted   between    the    respective       political        parties   at   issue,\n\nAnacassus's argument on appeal is limited to his beating at the\n\ndemonstration, and does not address the general harassment by\n\nLavalas members at the MDN meetings.           Thus, on this appeal, we only\n\naddress the attack Anacassus suffered at the demonstration. The IJ\n\nfound, and the BIA affirmed, that the beating constituted a single,\n\nisolated incident that was not sufficient to rise to the level of\n\npersecution. Our case law does not compel the opposite conclusion.\n\nSee Khan v. Mukasey, 549 F.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"The record\n\nsupports a conclusion that Khan's [single incident of alleged]\n\nmistreatment was an isolated event,\" supporting a finding of no\n\npersecution);    Journal,    507     F.3d    at   12    (no    persecution    where\n\npetitioner \"alleged only one incident of violence in which he was\n\nstruck on the head and arms\"); see also Attia, 477 F.3d at 24 (\"two\n\naltercations    in   a   nine-year    period      and   a     general   climate   of\n\ndiscrimination\" not sufficient to establish past persecution);\n\nNelson v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir. 2000) (no past\n\n\n\n7\n    Here, Anacassus sets forth no arguments nor raises any\nchallenges to the IJ and/or BIA's determination that Anacassus's\ntestimony regarding the Chimere Lavalas attack at his home and\nagainst his family members was not credible.      Because \"[i]t is\nwell-established that 'issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived,'\" we deem any challenge to the IJ and BIA's credibility\ndeterminations as to the home attack waived. Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d\nat 120 n.3 (citing United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990)).\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpersecution     where     petitioner    physically       abused       during   three\n\nincidents of solitary confinement and victim of surveillance,\n\nharassment, and stops and searches).\n\n              We note that although the full extent of Anacassus's\n\ninjuries from the attack are unclear -- with Anacassus claiming\n\nthat a doctor made an undocumented visit to treat his injuries\n\nfollowing the attack and that any scars from the beating were\n\nhealed by his sister's \"good soap\" -- \"isolated beatings, even when\n\nrather severe, do not establish systematic mistreatment needed to\n\nshow persecution.\"        Wiratama v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).      Thus, in light of our case law, we are compelled to\n\nconclude that Anacassus's single, isolated beating does not rise to\n\nthe   level    of   persecution.       See    Decky,    587    F.3d    at    111   (no\n\npersecution where, during 1998 riots, ethnic Chinese Indonesian was\n\nphysically     beaten,    his   motorcycle     was     set    on   fire,     and   his\n\npersecutors chanted at him, \"kill Chinese\"); Khan, 549 F.3d at 575-\n\n77    (no   persecution    where   petitioner        arrested      for      attending\n\npolitical demonstration, detained for ten days, and submitted to\n\nbeatings with wooden sticks and electrical shocks); see also\n\nTopalli, 417 F.3d at 132 (no persecution where petitioner arrested\n\non multiple occasions over two year period, submitted to detentions\n\nlasting less than 24 hours, and suffered beatings that did not\n\nrequire hospitalization).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            Furthermore,    Anacassus's      past   persecution   claim    is\n\n\"doubly deficient.\" Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     Persecution requires a showing of mistreatment that has\n\n\"some connection to government action or inaction,\" Harutyunyan v.\n\nGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 2005); that is, \"the harm\n\nsuffered    [must   be]   the   direct   result     of   government   action,\n\ngovernment-supported      action,   or   government's      unwillingness   or\n\ninability to control private conduct.\"               Sok, 526 F.3d at 53\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Anacassus testified that\n\npolice at the demonstration arrested him to protect him from the\n\nattacks; that they placed him in a car and brought him to the\n\npolice station to remove him from the crowds; and that they\n\nsubsequently escorted him home.            Furthermore, in his appellate\n\nbrief, Anacassus stated that \"he would have been killed on the spot\n\nwere it not for the timely intervention of the Haitian police.\"\n\nBecause Anacassus fails to show that the alleged persecutors at the\n\ndemonstration, Lavalas, were \"in league with the government or\n\n[were] not controllable by the government,\" Silva v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005), his petition also lacks the \"necessary\n\nlink between persecution and governmental action or inaction\" so as\n\n\"to establish the well-founded fear of persecution required for\n\nasylum.\" Burbiene v. Holder, 568 F.3d 251, 255-56 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f                  2. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n           Because we affirm the BIA's finding that Anacassus failed\n\nto establish past persecution, he is not entitled to the rebuttable\n\npresumption that his fear of future persecution is well-founded.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i); Decky, 587 F.3d at 110.                  Thus,\n\nAnacassus bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution through both subjective and objective factors, that is,\n\nhe \"must demonstrate not only that [he] harbors a genuine fear of\n\nfuture   persecution    but    also    that   [his]   fear   is    objectively\n\nreasonable.\"    Negeya v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 78, 82-83 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). Anacassus has not met this burden. Anacassus's only argument\n\nto support his claim of future persecution is that, because the\n\nrecord shows past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption of\n\nfuture persecution.      However, substantial evidence supports the\n\nagency's   conclusion    that    Anacassus's       only   credible,    alleged\n\nincident   of   persecution      was    insufficient      for     purposes   of\n\nestablishing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution if he should return to Haiti.                    Limani v.\n\nMukasey, 538 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n           Because substantial evidence in the record supports the\n\nBIA's holding, Anacassus's petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f",

Anacassus contends that the record shows sufficient evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to establish past persecution and/or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that the BIA abused its discretion in finding otherwise. After careful consideration, we find that the BIA's decision is supported by substantial evidence. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>Anacassus attempted to enter the United States on April 15, 2003. He arrived at Miami International Airport with a fraudulent passport and visa. Immigration authorities detained and interviewed him regarding his attempted entry. Anacassus told the interviewing official that he sought political asylum and feared persecution if he should return to Haiti. The immigration officer referred Anacassus to an asylum officer, who determined that Anacassus had established a credible fear of persecution and referred his application to an immigration judge.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served Anacassus with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\")<sup>[2]</sup> and removal proceedings commenced. Anacassus appeared before the Miami Immigration Court and conceded removability, but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. After successfully moving for a change of venue to Boston, Massachusetts, Anacassus testified before the immigration judge in support of his asylum application.</p>\n<p>Anacassus testified that he had suffered persecution at the hands of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's political party, Lavalas, due to his membership in the opposition party, the Movement for National Development (\"MDN\")<sup>[3]</sup>. Lavalas had a militant wing, the Chimere Lavalas, which Anacassus stated often violently disrupted MDN meetings by physically attacking MDN members and throwing rocks or bottles in the air. Anacassus was a regional leader in MDN who assisted in the organization of bi-weekly meetings. He claimed that his role in the MDN garnered Lavalas' attention when, on November 17, 2002, a previously recorded speech was aired on television. In this speech, Anacassus discussed political problems in Haiti, including human rights violations. When Anacassus attended an anti-Lavalas demonstration on December 3, 2002, weeks after the speech, he was attacked by Chimere Lavalas members.</p>\n<p>According to Anacassus, Chimere Lavalas members beat him at the demonstration, hitting him on the forehead, nose, and cheek with batons and leaving scars on his face and wrists. Fifteen minutes after arriving, police officers took demonstrators who had been beaten, including Anacassus (although Anacassus later stated he was the only demonstrator beaten), to a police station for protection from further attack. Afterwards, the police, with Chimere Lavalas members following close behind, took Anacassus to his home.</p>\n<p>Anacassus called MDN and informed them of the attack at the demonstration. MDN broadcast the news to various radio stations later that day. Meanwhile, a doctor treated Anacassus at his home for his injuries. At approximately 9:00 p.m., while Anacassus was resting in bed, he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> heard a banging on the front door and a voice asking his mother where he was. His mother told the visitor that he was not at home while Anacassus slipped out the back window. Anacassus later stated that before escaping, he heard his mother being beaten.</p>\n<p>Anacassus testified that he first ran to his friend's house, then to his sister's. On calling home, he learned that his girlfriend and son were \"severely beaten.\" When asked why his asylum application failed to mention his son's beating or injuries, Anacassus stated he did not learn about it until February 2003. On being reminded that his asylum application had been filed after February 2003, Anacassus changed his explanation, stating that he chose not to include his son's beating because he had not witnessed it. Anacassus had no explanation, however, as to why his October 2004 affidavit stated that he heard his son being thrown against a wall the night he escaped through the window.</p>\n<p>The day after the demonstration and alleged attack at Anacassus's home, Anacassus's mother, girlfriend, and son moved to a different location; Anacassus remained at his sister's. Anacassus testified that, on the same day as the move, his mother took his son to a hospital for treatment. Anacassus offered no medical records to support this testimony. However, other medical records showed his son receiving hospital treatment seven months after the alleged December 2002 treatment. When asked about this discrepancy, Anacassus clarified that his son did not go to the hospital the day after the alleged attacks; rather, he went to an \"herb doctor.\"</p>\n<p>Anacassus remained in contact with his mother while he was in hiding. She told him that Chimere Lavalas members came to her new address on repeated occasions and made threats against Anacassus. Because he feared for his life, Anacassus sought assistance from his friend, Symbert, in obtaining a passport and visa. Anacassus testified that he never suspected that either the passport or visa that Symbert gave him were invalid when he presented them to immigration authorities at the Miami airport on April 15, 2003.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Anacassus's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief and ordered his removal to Haiti. The IJ found that Anacassus failed to meet his burden of proof with credible testimony and failed to establish past persecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, or that he more likely than not would be tortured on returning to Haiti.</p>\n<p>The IJ found Anacassus's testimony regarding his involvement in MDN and the political tensions between MDN and Chimere Lavalas  including Chimere Lavalas disruption of MDN meetings and the December 2002 attack at the demonstration \"generally credible.\" However, the IJ concluded that this \"single, isolated event,\" even if considered with the Chimere Lavalas's harassment of MDN meetings, was not sufficient to constitute past persecution. The IJ found that it also did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because, according to at least one of Anacassus's accounts, Haitian police intervened to protect him at the demonstration, indicating that the \"authorities in Haiti are willing and able to protect\" Anacassus.</p>\n<p>The IJ did not find Anacassus's testimony as to the alleged Chimere Lavalas attack at his home, including the alleged beating of his wife and son, credible. The IJ's credibility finding turned on inconsistencies in Anacassus's testimony, asylum application, airport interview, and credible fear interview. Specifically, the IJ noted the omission of any statement in Anacassus's asylum application, airport interview, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> and credible fear interview referencing the attack on his wife or son. This was in contrast to his affidavit, which described their beatings as if he had been present, and to his testimony, which provided that he learned about the attacks by telephone \"either a few hours or a few months after they occurred.\" The IJ noted that \"[Anacassus] appears to have added details to his claim over time in order to embellish it.\" Further, the IJ stated that \"there is no reliable documentary evidence that Chimere Lavalas members appeared at [Anacassus's] home, attacked his family, or continue to pursue him.\" Because of inconsistencies in his accounts and a lack of supporting evidence, the IJ determined that Anacassus could not show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ concluded that, as Anacassus could not meet the \"well-founded fear\" asylum standard, he also could not meet the higher, \"more likely than not\" standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief. Thus, the IJ denied his withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p>Anacassus appealed to the BIA. He challenged the IJ's adverse credibility finding, claiming the inconsistencies on which the IJ focused were not relevant to his asylum claim; argued that the IJ failed to consider Anacassus's testimony that he was the only person attacked at the demonstration; and argued that the police did not protect him at the demonstration, but conspired with the Chimere Lavalas as to the demonstration and home attack. The BIA upheld the lack of credibility finding as to Anacassus's account of the home attack, noting that the inconsistencies in Anacassus's account went to the heart of his asylum claim. It rejected Anacassus's claim that the IJ failed to consider he was the only one hurt at the demonstration, citing inconsistencies in his testimony where he referenced other demonstrators' beatings. Lastly, it noted that Anacassus admitted to receiving police protection at the demonstration. The BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling that Anacassus failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as well as the IJ's determination as to withholding and CAT relief. Anacassus petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i><sup>[4]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the BIA's legal rulings, but defer to its \"findings of fact and the determination as to whether the facts support a claim of persecution.\" <i>Jorgji v. Mukasey,</i> 514 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.2008). The BIA's fact-bound determinations, including credibility findings, will be upheld, provided that they are supported \"by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" <i>Attia v. Gonzales,</i> 477 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that no \"reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\" <i>Rasiah v. Holder,</i> 589 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where \"the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions.\" <i>Decky v. Holder,</i> 587 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> B. Asylum</h2>\n<p>Anacassus's essential claim on appeal is that the IJ and BIA improperly denied his application for asylum.<sup>[5]</sup> To establish eligibility for asylum, Anacassus bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also </i><i>Weng v. Holder,</i> 593 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir.2010). To qualify as a refugee, Anacassus must show \"either that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of `race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\" <i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 110 (quoting <i>Journal v. Keisler,</i> 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007)). \"A showing of past persecution gives rise to a presumption of future persecution unless rebutted.\" <i>Jorgji,</i> 514 F.3d 53 at 57 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>Persecution \"`encompasses more than threats to life or freedom, but less than mere harassment or annoyance.'\" <i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> 526 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solís v. I.N.S.,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir.1999)). Further, it \"does not include all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\" <i>Sharari v. Gonzáles,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 474 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Fatin v. I.N.S.,</i> 12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)). To establish past persecution, \"the totality of a petitioner's experiences [must] add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\" <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p>\"In determining whether alleged incidents rise to the level of persecution, one important factor is whether `the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.'\" <i>Journal,</i> 507 F.3d at 12 (citing <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir.2005)). Here, Anacassus' credible testimony<sup>[6]</sup> provided a single incident of personal violence, specifically, the beating at the anti-Lavalas political demonstration. The IJ also found Anacassus's testimony concerning \"the level and type of his involvement with the MDN [and] the harassment. . . MDN members endured at their meetings\" to be \"generally credible.\"<sup>[7]</sup> Although the IJ found that tensions existed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> between the respective political parties at issue, Anacassus's argument on appeal is limited to his beating at the demonstration, and does not address the general harassment by Lavalas members at the MDN meetings. Thus, on this appeal, we only address the attack Anacassus suffered at the demonstration. The IJ found, and the BIA affirmed, that the beating constituted a single, isolated incident that was not sufficient to rise to the level of persecution. Our case law does not compel the opposite conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Khan v. Mukasey,</i> 549 F.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir.2008) (\"The record supports a conclusion that Khan's [single incident of alleged] mistreatment was an isolated event,\" supporting a finding of no persecution); <i>Journal,</i> 507 F.3d at 12 (no persecution where petitioner \"alleged only one incident of violence in which he was struck on the head and arms\"); <i>see also </i><i>Attia,</i> 477 F.3d at 24 (\"two altercations in a nine-year period and a general climate of discrimination\" not sufficient to establish past persecution); <i>Nelson v. I.N.S.,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir.2000) (no past persecution where petitioner physically abused during three incidents of solitary confinement and victim of surveillance, harassment, and stops and searches).</p>\n<p>We note that although the full extent of Anacassus's injuries from the attack are unclear  with Anacassus claiming that a doctor made an undocumented visit to treat his injuries following the attack and that any scars from the beating were healed by his sister's \"good soap\"  \"isolated beatings, even when rather severe, do not establish systematic mistreatment needed to show persecution.\" <i>Wiratama v. Mukasey,</i> 538 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2008). Thus, in light of our case law, we are compelled to conclude that Anacassus's single, isolated beating does not rise to the level of persecution. <i>See </i><i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 111 (no persecution where, during 1998 riots, ethnic Chinese Indonesian was physically beaten, his motorcycle was set on fire, and his persecutors chanted at him, \"kill Chinese\"); <i>Khan,</i> 549 F.3d at 575-77 (no persecution where petitioner arrested for attending political demonstration, detained for ten days, and submitted to beatings with wooden sticks and electrical shocks); <i>see also </i><i>Topalli,</i> 417 F.3d at 132 (no persecution where petitioner arrested on multiple occasions over two year period, submitted to detentions lasting less than 24 hours, and suffered beatings that did not require hospitalization).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Anacassus's past persecution claim is \"doubly deficient.\" <i>Orelien v. Gonzales,</i> 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.2006). Persecution requires a showing of mistreatment that has \"some connection to government action or inaction,\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir.2005); that is, \"the harm suffered [must be] the direct result of government action, government-supported action, or government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct.\" <i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Anacassus testified that police at the demonstration arrested him to <i>protect</i> him from the attacks; that they placed him in a car and brought him to the police station to remove him from the crowds; and that they subsequently escorted him home. Furthermore, in his appellate brief, Anacassus stated that \"he would have been killed on the spot were it not for the timely intervention of the Haitian police.\" Because Anacassus fails to show that the alleged persecutors at the demonstration, Lavalas, were \"in league with the government or [were] not controllable by the government,\" <i>Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2005), his petition also lacks the \"necessary link between persecution and governmental action or inaction\" so as \"to establish the well-founded fear of persecution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> required for asylum.\" <i>Burbiene v. Holder,</i> 568 F.3d 251, 255-56 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</h2>\n<p>Because we affirm the BIA's finding that Anacassus failed to establish past persecution, he is not entitled to the rebuttable presumption that his fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i); <i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 110. Thus, Anacassus bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution through both subjective and objective factors, that is, he \"must demonstrate not only that [he] harbors a genuine fear of future persecution but also that [his] fear is objectively reasonable.\" <i>Negeya v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 78, 82-83 (1st Cir.2005). Anacassus has not met this burden. Anacassus's only argument to support his claim of future persecution is that, because the record shows past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption of future persecution. However, substantial evidence supports the agency's conclusion that Anacassus's only credible, alleged incident of persecution was insufficient for purposes of establishing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if he should return to Haiti. <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> 538 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA's holding, Anacassus's petition for review is <i>DENIED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These facts are drawn from Anacassus's testimony before the IJ.</p>\n<p>[2]  The NTA charged Anacassus with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") for attempting to procure admission to the United States via fraud or material misrepresentations, INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), and for seeking admission without valid entry documents, INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p>[3]  The acronym reflects the political party's name in French, the Mouvement pour La Developement National.</p>\n<p>[4]  Following the tragic earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, the United States government issued a rule designating Haiti for temporary protected status (\"TPS\") for a period of eighteen months. Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 75 Fed. Reg. 3476 (Jan. 21, 2010). Anacassus may fulfill the criteria for TPS. However, Anacassus's TPS eligibility is not before us, and so we do not address the possible effect of the TPS statute on his removal status.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because Anacassus's arguments on appeal focus entirely on his asylum claim, and he develops no arguments to support either his claim for withholding of removal or his claim for relief under the CAT, we deem these claims abandoned. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 128, 131 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[Petitioner's] challenge is to the BIA's dismissal of his appeal as a whole, but he offers no arguments with respect to his claims for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. He has therefore waived any challenge to the BIA's denial of these claims.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Usman v. Holder,</i> 566 F.3d 262, 268 (1st Cir.2009) (\"An argument that the petitioner is entitled to asylum does not properly raise the issue of withholding of removal.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  \"`Because the immigration judge is in the best position to evaluate an alien's testimony, his or her credibility determinations are to be given much weight.'\" <i>Syed v. Ashcroft,</i> 389 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Estrada v. I.N.S.,</i> 775 F.2d 1018, 1021 (9th Cir. 1985)).</p>\n<p>[7]  Here, Anacassus sets forth no arguments nor raises any challenges to the IJ and/or BIA's determination that Anacassus's testimony regarding the Chimere Lavalas attack at his home and against his family members was not credible. Because \"[i]t is well-established that `issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived,'\" we deem any challenge to the IJ and BIA's credibility determinations as to the home attack waived. <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 120 n. 3 (citing <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n\n</div>",

Anacassus contends that the record shows sufficient evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> to establish past persecution and/or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that the BIA abused its discretion in finding otherwise. After careful consideration, we find that the BIA's decision is supported by substantial evidence. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i><sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p>Anacassus attempted to enter the United States on April 15, 2003. He arrived at Miami International Airport with a fraudulent passport and visa. Immigration authorities detained and interviewed him regarding his attempted entry. Anacassus told the interviewing official that he sought political asylum and feared persecution if he should return to Haiti. The immigration officer referred Anacassus to an asylum officer, who determined that Anacassus had established a credible fear of persecution and referred his application to an immigration judge.</p>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served Anacassus with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\")<sup>[2]</sup> and removal proceedings commenced. Anacassus appeared before the Miami Immigration Court and conceded removability, but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. After successfully moving for a change of venue to Boston, Massachusetts, Anacassus testified before the immigration judge in support of his asylum application.</p>\n<p>Anacassus testified that he had suffered persecution at the hands of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's political party, Lavalas, due to his membership in the opposition party, the Movement for National Development (\"MDN\")<sup>[3]</sup>. Lavalas had a militant wing, the Chimere Lavalas, which Anacassus stated often violently disrupted MDN meetings by physically attacking MDN members and throwing rocks or bottles in the air. Anacassus was a regional leader in MDN who assisted in the organization of bi-weekly meetings. He claimed that his role in the MDN garnered Lavalas' attention when, on November 17, 2002, a previously recorded speech was aired on television. In this speech, Anacassus discussed political problems in Haiti, including human rights violations. When Anacassus attended an anti-Lavalas demonstration on December 3, 2002, weeks after the speech, he was attacked by Chimere Lavalas members.</p>\n<p>According to Anacassus, Chimere Lavalas members beat him at the demonstration, hitting him on the forehead, nose, and cheek with batons and leaving scars on his face and wrists. Fifteen minutes after arriving, police officers took demonstrators who had been beaten, including Anacassus (although Anacassus later stated he was the only demonstrator beaten), to a police station for protection from further attack. Afterwards, the police, with Chimere Lavalas members following close behind, took Anacassus to his home.</p>\n<p>Anacassus called MDN and informed them of the attack at the demonstration. MDN broadcast the news to various radio stations later that day. Meanwhile, a doctor treated Anacassus at his home for his injuries. At approximately 9:00 p.m., while Anacassus was resting in bed, he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> heard a banging on the front door and a voice asking his mother where he was. His mother told the visitor that he was not at home while Anacassus slipped out the back window. Anacassus later stated that before escaping, he heard his mother being beaten.</p>\n<p>Anacassus testified that he first ran to his friend's house, then to his sister's. On calling home, he learned that his girlfriend and son were \"severely beaten.\" When asked why his asylum application failed to mention his son's beating or injuries, Anacassus stated he did not learn about it until February 2003. On being reminded that his asylum application had been filed after February 2003, Anacassus changed his explanation, stating that he chose not to include his son's beating because he had not witnessed it. Anacassus had no explanation, however, as to why his October 2004 affidavit stated that he heard his son being thrown against a wall the night he escaped through the window.</p>\n<p>The day after the demonstration and alleged attack at Anacassus's home, Anacassus's mother, girlfriend, and son moved to a different location; Anacassus remained at his sister's. Anacassus testified that, on the same day as the move, his mother took his son to a hospital for treatment. Anacassus offered no medical records to support this testimony. However, other medical records showed his son receiving hospital treatment seven months after the alleged December 2002 treatment. When asked about this discrepancy, Anacassus clarified that his son did not go to the hospital the day after the alleged attacks; rather, he went to an \"herb doctor.\"</p>\n<p>Anacassus remained in contact with his mother while he was in hiding. She told him that Chimere Lavalas members came to her new address on repeated occasions and made threats against Anacassus. Because he feared for his life, Anacassus sought assistance from his friend, Symbert, in obtaining a passport and visa. Anacassus testified that he never suspected that either the passport or visa that Symbert gave him were invalid when he presented them to immigration authorities at the Miami airport on April 15, 2003.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied Anacassus's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief and ordered his removal to Haiti. The IJ found that Anacassus failed to meet his burden of proof with credible testimony and failed to establish past persecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, or that he more likely than not would be tortured on returning to Haiti.</p>\n<p>The IJ found Anacassus's testimony regarding his involvement in MDN and the political tensions between MDN and Chimere Lavalas  including Chimere Lavalas disruption of MDN meetings and the December 2002 attack at the demonstration \"generally credible.\" However, the IJ concluded that this \"single, isolated event,\" even if considered with the Chimere Lavalas's harassment of MDN meetings, was not sufficient to constitute past persecution. The IJ found that it also did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because, according to at least one of Anacassus's accounts, Haitian police intervened to protect him at the demonstration, indicating that the \"authorities in Haiti are willing and able to protect\" Anacassus.</p>\n<p>The IJ did not find Anacassus's testimony as to the alleged Chimere Lavalas attack at his home, including the alleged beating of his wife and son, credible. The IJ's credibility finding turned on inconsistencies in Anacassus's testimony, asylum application, airport interview, and credible fear interview. Specifically, the IJ noted the omission of any statement in Anacassus's asylum application, airport interview, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> and credible fear interview referencing the attack on his wife or son. This was in contrast to his affidavit, which described their beatings as if he had been present, and to his testimony, which provided that he learned about the attacks by telephone \"either a few hours or a few months after they occurred.\" The IJ noted that \"[Anacassus] appears to have added details to his claim over time in order to embellish it.\" Further, the IJ stated that \"there is no reliable documentary evidence that Chimere Lavalas members appeared at [Anacassus's] home, attacked his family, or continue to pursue him.\" Because of inconsistencies in his accounts and a lack of supporting evidence, the IJ determined that Anacassus could not show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ concluded that, as Anacassus could not meet the \"well-founded fear\" asylum standard, he also could not meet the higher, \"more likely than not\" standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief. Thus, the IJ denied his withholding of removal and CAT claims.</p>\n<p>Anacassus appealed to the BIA. He challenged the IJ's adverse credibility finding, claiming the inconsistencies on which the IJ focused were not relevant to his asylum claim; argued that the IJ failed to consider Anacassus's testimony that he was the only person attacked at the demonstration; and argued that the police did not protect him at the demonstration, but conspired with the Chimere Lavalas as to the demonstration and home attack. The BIA upheld the lack of credibility finding as to Anacassus's account of the home attack, noting that the inconsistencies in Anacassus's account went to the heart of his asylum claim. It rejected Anacassus's claim that the IJ failed to consider he was the only one hurt at the demonstration, citing inconsistencies in his testimony where he referenced other demonstrators' beatings. Lastly, it noted that Anacassus admitted to receiving police protection at the demonstration. The BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling that Anacassus failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as well as the IJ's determination as to withholding and CAT relief. Anacassus petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i><sup>[4]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the BIA's legal rulings, but defer to its \"findings of fact and the determination as to whether the facts support a claim of persecution.\" <i>Jorgji v.

The BIA's fact-bound determinations, including credibility findings, will be upheld, provided that they are supported \"by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" <i>Attia v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202639\"><a href=\"/opinion/202639/attia-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that no \"reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\" <i>Rasiah v.

Asylum</h2>\n<p>Anacassus's essential claim on appeal is that the IJ and BIA improperly denied his application for asylum.<sup>[5]</sup> To establish eligibility for asylum, Anacassus bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also </i><i>Weng v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204154\"><a href=\"/opinion/204154/weng-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2010). To qualify as a refugee, Anacassus must show \"either that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of `race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.'\" <i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 110 (quoting <i>Journal v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202996\"><a href=\"/opinion/202996/journal-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2007)). \"A showing of past persecution gives rise to a presumption of future persecution unless rebutted.\" <i>Jorgji,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386154/jorgji-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span> at 57 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>Persecution \"`encompasses more than threats to life or freedom, but less than mere harassment or annoyance.'\" <i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203303\"><a href=\"/opinion/203303/sok-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solís v.

Further, it \"does not include all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\" <i>Sharari v. Gonzáles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 474 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Fatin v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659860\"><a href=\"/opinion/659860/parastoo-fatin-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span>, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)). To establish past persecution, \"the totality of a petitioner's experiences [must] add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\" <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p>\"In determining whether alleged incidents rise to the level of persecution, one important factor is whether `the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.'\" <i>Journal,</i> 507 F.3d at 12 (citing <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2005)). Here, Anacassus' credible testimony<sup>[6]</sup> provided a single incident of personal violence, specifically, the beating at the anti-Lavalas political demonstration. The IJ also found Anacassus's testimony concerning \"the level and type of his involvement with the MDN [and] the harassment. . . MDN members endured at their meetings\" to be \"generally credible.\"<sup>[7]</sup> Although the IJ found that tensions existed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> between the respective political parties at issue, Anacassus's argument on appeal is limited to his beating at the demonstration, and does not address the general harassment by Lavalas members at the MDN meetings. Thus, on this appeal, we only address the attack Anacassus suffered at the demonstration. The IJ found, and the BIA affirmed, that the beating constituted a single, isolated incident that was not sufficient to rise to the level of persecution. Our case law does not compel the opposite conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Khan v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203580\"><a href=\"/opinion/203580/khan-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir.2008) (\"The record supports a conclusion that Khan's [single incident of alleged] mistreatment was an isolated event,\" supporting a finding of no persecution); <i>Journal,</i> 507 F.3d at 12 (no persecution where petitioner \"alleged only one incident of violence in which he was struck on the head and arms\"); <i>see also </i><i>Attia,</i> 477 F.3d at 24 (\"two altercations in a nine-year period and a general climate of discrimination\" not sufficient to establish past persecution); <i>Nelson v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir.2000) (no past persecution where petitioner physically abused during three incidents of solitary confinement and victim of surveillance, harassment, and stops and searches).</p>\n<p>We note that although the full extent of Anacassus's injuries from the attack are unclear  with Anacassus claiming that a doctor made an undocumented visit to treat his injuries following the attack and that any scars from the beating were healed by his sister's \"good soap\"  \"isolated beatings, even when rather severe, do not establish systematic mistreatment needed to show persecution.\" <i>Wiratama v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203377\"><a href=\"/opinion/203377/wiratama-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2008). Thus, in light of our case law, we are compelled to conclude that Anacassus's single, isolated beating does not rise to the level of persecution. <i>See </i><i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 111 (no persecution where, during 1998 riots, ethnic Chinese Indonesian was physically beaten, his motorcycle was set on fire, and his persecutors chanted at him, \"kill Chinese\"); <i>Khan,</i> 549 F.3d at 575-77 (no persecution where petitioner arrested for attending political demonstration, detained for ten days, and submitted to beatings with wooden sticks and electrical shocks); <i>see also </i><i>Topalli,</i> 417 F.3d at 132 (no persecution where petitioner arrested on multiple occasions over two year period, submitted to detentions lasting less than 24 hours, and suffered beatings that did not require hospitalization).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Anacassus's past persecution claim is \"doubly deficient.\" <i>Orelien v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2006). Persecution requires a showing of mistreatment that has \"some connection to government action or inaction,\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2005); that is, \"the harm suffered [must be] the direct result of government action, government-supported action, or government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct.\" <i>Sok,</i> 526 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Anacassus testified that police at the demonstration arrested him to <i>protect</i> him from the attacks; that they placed him in a car and brought him to the police station to remove him from the crowds; and that they subsequently escorted him home. Furthermore, in his appellate brief, Anacassus stated that \"he would have been killed on the spot were it not for the timely intervention of the Haitian police.\" Because Anacassus fails to show that the alleged persecutors at the demonstration, Lavalas, were \"in league with the government or [were] not controllable by the government,\" <i>Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2005), his petition also lacks the \"necessary link between persecution and governmental action or inaction\" so as \"to establish the well-founded fear of persecution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> required for asylum.\" <i>Burbiene v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203847\"><a href=\"/opinion/203847/burbiene-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 255-56 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</h2>\n<p>Because we affirm the BIA's finding that Anacassus failed to establish past persecution, he is not entitled to the rebuttable presumption that his fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i); <i>Decky,</i> 587 F.3d at 110. Thus, Anacassus bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution through both subjective and objective factors, that is, he \"must demonstrate not only that [he] harbors a genuine fear of future persecution but also that [his] fear is objectively reasonable.\" <i>Negeya v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201729\"><a href=\"/opinion/201729/negeya-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 82-83 (1st Cir.2005). Anacassus has not met this burden. Anacassus's only argument to support his claim of future persecution is that, because the record shows past persecution, he is entitled to a presumption of future persecution. However, substantial evidence supports the agency's conclusion that Anacassus's only credible, alleged incident of persecution was insufficient for purposes of establishing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if he should return to Haiti. <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203442\"><a href=\"/opinion/203442/limani-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA's holding, Anacassus's petition for review is <i>DENIED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These facts are drawn from Anacassus's testimony before the IJ.</p>\n<p>[2]  The NTA charged Anacassus with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") for attempting to procure admission to the United States via fraud or material misrepresentations, INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), and for seeking admission without valid entry documents, INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p>[3]  The acronym reflects the political party's name in French, the Mouvement pour La Developement National.</p>\n<p>[4]  Following the tragic earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, the United States government issued a rule designating Haiti for temporary protected status (\"TPS\") for a period of eighteen months. Designation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, 75 Fed. Reg. 3476 (Jan. 21, 2010). Anacassus may fulfill the criteria for TPS. However, Anacassus's TPS eligibility is not before us, and so we do not address the possible effect of the TPS statute on his removal status.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because Anacassus's arguments on appeal focus entirely on his asylum claim, and he develops no arguments to support either his claim for withholding of removal or his claim for relief under the CAT, we deem these claims abandoned. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Topalli v.

Because \"[i]t is well-established that `issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived,'\" we deem any challenge to the IJ and BIA's credibility determinations as to the home attack waived. <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 120 n. 3 (citing <i>United States v.
