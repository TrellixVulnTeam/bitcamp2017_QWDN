William G. Young, U.S. Chief District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Boudin, Chief Circuit Judge,\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 and Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Theodore B. Heinrich, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n    Randolph M. Gioia was on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                             June 15, 2005\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the    Tenth    Circuit    Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f             BALDOCK, Senior Circuit Judge. We address a single issue\n\nin this appeal:      Whether, during an initial pat-down for weapons,\n\nan officer’s insertion of his index finger into the instep of a\n\nsuspect’s    “mid-top”     sneaker    exceeded     the    proper     scope    of   a\n\nprotective search.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             The   relevant   facts    are   undisputed.        Boston       police\n\nofficers witnessed Defendant speaking with suspected gang members\n\non a street in Boston known for gang violence.                 Moments later,\n\nduring an investigatory stop (the legality of which Defendant does\n\nnot challenge), Defendant identified himself to police officers as\n\nKeith Barboza. Officer Robert Fratalia recognized Defendant’s name\n\nbased   on    police    intelligence    as   that    of    a   gang-affiliated\n\nindividual    who   routinely   carried      a   firearm.       Based    on     his\n\nknowledge,     Officer    Fratalia     commenced    a     pat-down    search       of\n\nDefendant. A pat-down of Defendant’s outer clothing, including his\n\nshoes, was unremarkable.         Officer Fratalia next ran his index\n\nfinger between Defendant’s ankle (the record is unclear as to which\n\nankle) and the inside of Defendant’s mid-top sneaker.                    Officer\n\nFratalia did so as a result of a past experience in which he\n\ndiscovered a handgun concealed in the shoe of a suspect already in\n\ncustody.     Officer Fratalia felt a hard metal object between the\n\nsole of Defendant’s shoe and his foot which the officer believed to\n\nbe a firearm.          A search of Defendant’s shoe uncovered a .25\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fcaliber,    semi-automatic   pistol   loaded   with   eight   rounds   of\n\nammunition.\n\n            Defendant was indicted for being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).            Following the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of his motion to suppress, Defendant\n\nentered a conditional guilty plea.      The district court sentenced\n\nDefendant to seventy months imprisonment and he appealed.              Our\n\njurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review the district\n\ncourt’s determination that Officer Fratalia acted reasonably when\n\nhe inserted his index finger into the instep of Defendant’s sneaker\n\nde novo.     See United States v. Sargent, 319 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).     Applying this standard, we affirm.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             The Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to\n\ntake unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.             The\n\npurpose of a protective search in the absence of probable cause is\n\nnot to discover evidence of a crime, but to neutralize the threat\n\nof physical harm to police officers and others.       See United States\n\nv. Nee, 261 F.3d 79, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2001).       To determine whether\n\na protective search of a person violated the Fourth Amendment\n\n(i.e., was objectively unreasonable) in the absence of probable\n\ncause, a court asks whether the officer’s actions were reasonably\n\nrelated in scope to the circumstances that justified the initial\n\nlawful detention.     See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1968).\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f“Limited searches of a person for weapons are constitutionally\n\npermissible adjuncts to a Terry stop if ‘a reasonably prudent man\n\nin the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his\n\nsafety or that of others was in danger.’”                Nee, 261 F.3d at 83\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 27).                    Necessarily\n\nthen, courts develop the limitations which the Fourth Amendment\n\nplaces     upon    protective       searches    “in    the   concrete    factual\n\ncircumstances of individual cases.”             Terry, 392 U.S. at 29.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            Defendant      argues    Officer    Fratalia’s   concern    about   a\n\nweapon hidden in his shoe was unreasonable and did not justify\n\nextending the search beyond a pat-down of his outer clothing.\n\nAccording to Defendant, his weapon posed no danger to the officers\n\nbecause it was not “readily accessible.”                 To be sure, Officer\n\nFratalia acknowledged at the suppression hearing that Defendant\n\nwould have had to remove his shoe to access the weapon.                       The\n\nproblem with Defendant’s argument is that when Officer Fratalia\n\nplaced his finger into the instep of Defendant’s mid-top sneaker,\n\nhe did not know the weapon was “inaccessible.”                      What Officer\n\nFratalia     did    know    based     upon     the    surrounding     facts   and\n\ncircumstances, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, was that\n\nDefendant might well be armed.           See id. at 21. Officer Fratalia’s\n\nbelief was objectively reasonable.             See id.   As the Supreme Court\n\nexplained in Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), a case\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fextending the lawful scope of a protective search to a vehicle’s\n\npassenger compartment:\n\n            When the officer has a reasonable belief “that\n            the individual whose suspicious behavior he is\n            investigating at close range is armed and\n            presently dangerous to the officer or to\n            others, it would appear to be clearly\n            unreasonable to deny the officer the power to\n            take necessary measures to determine whether\n            the person is in fact carrying a weapon . . .\n            .”\n\nId. at 1047 (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 24).\n\n            Officer     Fratalia’s    minimally   intrusive      search   of\n\nDefendant’s sneaker for the purpose of locating a concealed weapon\n\nwas not unreasonable merely because Defendant might have been\n\nfractionally delayed in employing it against the officers or\n\nothers.    As the district court noted, Defendant might have placed\n\nthe   weapon   in   the   side   of   his   sneaker,    making   it   readily\n\naccessible.    Moreover, Defendant could have fled from the officers\n\nand, in so doing, retrieved the weapon from his shoe.            See id. at\n\n1051.     In addition, if Officer Fratalia had not placed Defendant\n\nunder arrest, Defendant would have been free to go, providing him\n\nonce again with ready access to his weapon.            See id. at 1052.   We\n\nhold under the totality of the circumstances of this case that\n\nOfficer Fratalia’s insertion of his index finger into the instep of\n\nthe Defendants mid-top sneaker did not exceed the proper scope of\n\nhis protective search.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",

The problem with Defendant's argument is that when Officer Fratalia placed his finger into the instep of Defendant's mid-top sneaker, he did <i>not</i> know the weapon was \"inaccessible.\" What Officer Fratalia did know based upon the surrounding facts and circumstances, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, was that Defendant might well be armed. <i>See id.</i> at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the district court noted, Defendant might have placed the weapon in the side of his sneaker, making it readily accessible. Moreover, Defendant could have fled from the officers and, in so doing, retrieved the weapon from his shoe. <i>See id.</i> at 1051. In addition, if Officer Fratalia had not placed Defendant under arrest, Defendant would have been free to go, providing him once again with ready access to his weapon. <i>See id.</i> at 1052. We hold under the totality of the circumstances of this case that Officer Fratalia's insertion of his index finger into the instep of the Defendants mid-top sneaker did not exceed the proper scope of his protective search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
