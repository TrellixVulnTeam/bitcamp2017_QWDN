Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Smith,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro-Lang, for appellant.\n     Dina Ávila, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division, and\nGermán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 26, 2008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.      A jury convicted Edwin Colón-\n\nDíaz (\"Colón\") on five counts of drug offenses under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.               He appeals these\n\nconvictions, claiming that the district court committed a number of\n\nerrors that, in the aggregate, constituted reversible error under\n\nthe cumulative error doctrine articulated in United States v.\n\nSepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir. 1993).          After thoroughly\n\nreviewing the record and considering the parties' arguments, we\n\naffirm Colón's convictions.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n           We   consider   only   those   facts    relevant   to   Colón's\n\narguments on appeal, relating them \"as the jury could have found\n\nthem, drawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the\n\njury's verdict.\"    United States v. Milkiewicz, 470 F.3d 390, 392\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   Colón lived in Building 47 of the Vista Hermosa\n\nhousing project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he ran a small\n\ngrocery   store.    The    Drug   Enforcement     Administration   (\"DEA\")\n\nassembled a task force to investigate Colón as the suspected owner\n\nof a drug-selling location in front of Building 47 known as the\n\n\"yellow point\" for the yellow markings on the packaging in which\n\ncertain drugs were sold.     In particular, crack cocaine was sold in\n\nsmall plastic vials sealed with yellow caps.         These vials of crack\n\nwere called \"yellow caps.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           As part of the investigation, the DEA sent an informant,\n\nWanda Romero, to the yellow point to buy yellow caps.             The seller\n\nat the yellow point on this occasion was José Otero-Cruz (\"Otero\"),\n\nalias \"Bebo,\" Colón's stepson. Romero and Otero had a conversation\n\nin which Otero informed her that he had yellow caps belonging to\n\nColón, and Romero returned later with DEA-furnished money and\n\nbought the yellow caps from Otero.            Again on DEA instructions,\n\nRomero went to the yellow point with Puerto Rico police officer and\n\nundercover DEA task-force member Janet López; Romero and López had\n\na hidden audio-recording device.        This time, the seller was Víctor\n\nDíaz, alias \"Ne,\" who sold Romero and López drugs.              Colón's name\n\nwas not mentioned during this transaction.\n\n           Over the course of the investigation, federal agents\n\ngathered a considerable quantum of additional evidence that would\n\nlater be presented at trial, including:         (1) a video showing Colón\n\nin close proximity to the yellow point; (2) witnesses who said they\n\nsaw Colón near the yellow point and that Colón appeared concerned\n\nwith the goings-on there; (3) the testimony of Colón's friend and\n\nfellow drug trafficker, Jesús Rivera-Santiago (\"Rivera\"), that\n\nColón   owned   the   yellow   point;   (4)   the   testimony    of   Colón's\n\ncoconspirator Rafael Soto-Torres (\"Soto\") that Colón owned the\n\nyellow point and that Soto sold drugs at the yellow point on behalf\n\nof Colón; (5) evidence that a search of Colón's store turned up\n\npolice scanners and surveillance cameras that were located both\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\finside and outside the store, but no food or other goods on the\n\nshelves; (6) evidence that a search of an apartment belonging to\n\nColón yielded a large amount of drugs, drug paraphernalia, cash, a\n\ncash counting machine, a police scanner, and some weapons; and\n\n(7) that Colón had made down payments of thousands of dollars on a\n\nnumber of expensive homes, sometimes in cash, even though he only\n\nregistered a monthly income of $100.\n\n          Colón was eventually arrested and charged with conspiracy\n\nto possess with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base,\n\nand marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846; and\n\nwith aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute\n\nheroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana within 1,000 feet of\n\nan elementary school or park, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\nand 18 U.S.C. § 2.   A jury convicted Colón on all counts, and the\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to twenty years' imprisonment.     On\n\nappeal, Colón challenges a number of evidentiary rulings made at\n\ntrial.   He also complains of the Government's alleged destruction\n\nof certain \"rough notes\" taken during several interviews with a\n\ngovernment informant who testified at trial.      We detail these\n\nchallenges, and the trial procedure giving rise to them, in the\n\nrelevant parts of the discussion that follows.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n          Colón argues that three sets of purported errors, taken\n\ntogether, justify reversal of his convictions under the cumulative\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\ferror doctrine.      See Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1196.                 None of his\n\narguments withstands scrutiny.            We consider them in turn.\n\n           A.   Limiting Instructions for the Romero, López, and\n           Pérez Testimony Naming Colón as the Yellow Point's Owner\n\n           Colón's     first   assignment          of   error   is     that     three\n\ngovernment witnesses -- Romero, López, and DEA task force member\n\nPedro Pérez -- gave highly prejudicial hearsay testimony naming him\n\nas the yellow point's owner, and that the district court's limiting\n\ninstructions to the jury failed to cure the infirmity. Evidentiary\n\nrulings,   including    whether      to    admit    evidence    over    a     hearsay\n\nobjection, are ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.                      See\n\nUnited States v. García, 452 F.3d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 2006); United\n\nStates v. Washington, 434 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2006).                  However, we\n\nreview Colón's challenge to the Romero, López, and Pérez limiting\n\ninstructions only for plain error because Colón did not object to\n\nthem when they were given at trial.            See United States v. Marino,\n\n277 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir. 2002); see also United States v. de la\n\nCruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 996 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"The 'plain error'\n\nstandard requires the reviewing court to ask: (1) whether there is\n\nan error; (2) whether the error is 'plain,' a term synonymous with\n\n'clear'    or   'obvious';     and    (3)    whether      the   error       affected\n\nsubstantial rights.\" (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n734 (1993))).\n\n           While an out-of-court statement may be hearsay if offered\n\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted, it is nonhearsay if\n\n                                      -5-\n\foffered for some other purpose, including when offered \"only for\n\ncontext.\"   United States v. Bailey, 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        Where a given statement\n\npotentially qualifies as both hearsay and nonhearsay, the district\n\ncourt may admit it if it is relevant, and if the probative value of\n\nits intended nonhearsay use is not substantially outweighed by the\n\nrisk of the jury considering it for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted.   See Fed. R. Evid. 403; see also United States v. Mazza,\n\n792 F.2d 1210, 1215 (1st Cir. 1986).     If so requested by a party,\n\nhowever, the district court must instruct the jury not to consider\n\nthe statement for its truth.     See United States v. Linwood, 142\n\nF.3d 418, 425 (7th Cir. 1998) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 105).\n\n            After reviewing the record, it is clear that the district\n\ncourt adopted the proper procedure with respect to the impugned\n\nRomero and López testimony.    Romero testified that federal agents\n\nasked her to go and purchase drugs from \"[Colón]'s yellow point.\"\n\nColón timely objected that this statement was hearsay and requested\n\na limiting instruction.    The district court instructed the jury as\n\nfollows:\n\n            [Y]ou may not take that answer for its\n            veracity, that it was [Colón]'s yellow point.\n            You can only consider that answer for the fact\n            that those were the instructions provided to\n            . . . the witness [Romero]. But, again, you\n            may not take that, that it was [Colón]'s\n            yellow point, for the veracity that in fact\n            that was [Colón]'s yellow point.\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fColón explicitly approved of this instruction in advance during a\n\nsidebar conference, and did not object when the court announced it\n\nto the jury.\n\n             For her part, López testified regarding what she and her\n\nsupervisor said to Romero before proceeding to the yellow point to\n\npurchase drugs from Víctor Díaz:                \"[A]fter going over the job that\n\nwas going to be carried out, we told [Romero] that we were going to\n\ngo over to the housing project to buy drugs at a point of somebody\n\ncalled [Colón].\"       Colón again objected on hearsay grounds, and the\n\ndistrict     court   instructed         the     jury      as    follows:       \"The    Court\n\ninstructs     the    jury        that   they        are   not     to    take   that    into\n\nconsideration, other than they were told that it was [Colón],\n\nperiod. Not to take it for the truth, but that was the instruction\n\nthat   was   provided       to    them.\"        Colón      did    not   object    to   this\n\ninstruction.\n\n             Both these pieces of testimony lent themselves to at\n\nleast two nonhearsay purposes:                they described directions from one\n\nperson to another, and they demonstrated why Romero -- accompanied\n\nby López the second time -- went to the yellow point.                          See Bailey,\n\n270 F.3d at 87 (\"directions from one individual to another . . . do\n\nnot    constitute     hearsay,\"         and    nonhearsay         includes      statements\n\n\"'offered to . . . supply a motive for the listener's action'\"\n\n(citing United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 6 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n1999))).      On     Colón's       request,         the   court    issued      unequivocal\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\finstructions that the jury was not to consider the evidence as\n\nproof that Colón was the yellow point's owner.1            We find no plain\n\nerror here.\n\n           Colón's challenge to the Pérez testimony is similarly\n\nfruitless.    Pérez testified that \"on and off in the year 2002, the\n\nspecial   investigation   unit   .    .    .   targeted   the    .   .    .   drug\n\nt[r]afficking organization led by Mr. Edwin Colón Díaz.\"                 Like the\n\nRomero and López testimony, this testimony could readily be taken\n\nfor a nonhearsay purpose:    it provided background and context for\n\nunderstanding the investigative steps of the task force, and an\n\nexplanation for why the task force focused its efforts on Colón, as\n\nopposed to someone else. See United States v. Castellini, 392 F.3d\n\n35, 52 (1st Cir. 2004); see also United States v. Collins, 996 F.2d\n\n950, 953 (8th Cir. 1993) (out-of-court statement \"not hearsay if\n\noffered for the purpose of explaining why an investigation was\n\nundertaken\").     Colón   made   a   hearsay     objection      to   the      Pérez\n\n\n\n\n1\n    At oral argument, Colón made much of the district court's\nwording of the first part of the López instruction, that the jury\nwas \"not to take that into consideration, other than they were told\nthat it was [Colón], period.\" Colón argued that, through these\nwords, the court actually directed the jury to take the testimony\nas proof that Colón was indeed the owner of the yellow point. This\nis a clear misreading of the instruction.       The district court\ninstructed the jury only to consider the fact that López and her\nsupervisor told Romero they were going to Colón's yellow point, not\nthat the yellow point truly belonged to Colón. In any event, the\ncourt immediately dispelled any possible confusion in the next\nsentence of the instruction.\n\n                                     -8-\n\ftestimony, and the district court issued an instruction to which\n\nColón did not object:\n\n          I am advising the jury that this is an\n          investigation that [Pérez] undertook. It is\n          not a statement for the truth. The only truth\n          is that that was the investigation, but . . .\n          whether or not the investigation is truthful\n          or untruthful or correct or incorrect, that's\n          the jury who will determine that.\n\nThis instruction expressly directed the jury not to consider\n\nwhether the task force's focus on Colón as the leader of the\n\norganization was well placed.        It was not plainly erroneous.\n\n          In sum, the district court committed no plain error in\n\nthe procedure surrounding the admission of these three pieces of\n\ntestimony,   nor   in   its   respective   limiting   instructions.      We\n\naccordingly turn to Colón's next assignment of error.\n\n          B. Alleged Hearsay Testimony that Colón Was the Provider\n          of the Yellow Caps\n\n          Colón    argues     that   Romero's   testimony   regarding   her\n\nconversation with Otero the first time she went to buy drugs at the\n\nyellow point also contained damaging hearsay naming Colón as the\n\nyellow point's owner. The relevant portion of the trial transcript\n\nis as follows:\n\n          Q. So after you see [Otero] with this bag of\n          yellow cap crack, what did you ask him or what\n          did you proceed to do with [Otero]?\n\n          A.   I asked him whether he could get me a\n          package of those yellow caps.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f          Q. MR. BAUZÁ2 [Counsel for Colón]: Objection,\n          hearsay.\n\n          THE COURT: She's asking him.    Up to now it's\n          not hearsay.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.   What was [Otero]'s response?\n\n          MR. BAUZÁ:   Now, objection. . . . I have an\n          objection,   Your Honor, as to [Otero]'s\n          response.\n\n          . . .\n\n          MR. GIL [Assistant U.S. Attorney]:      Co-\n          conspirator statement, it's an exception to\n          the hearsay rule.\n\n          THE COURT:   But let me see how it all comes\n          out. . . .\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.   So how did [Otero] respond?\n\n          A. He asked me, \"Do you want some of these\n          yellow caps? Listen, I have them. These are\n          the best and they're [Colón]'s.\"\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.   What did you ask . . . [Otero ?]\n\n          . . .\n\n          A.   I told him that I needed some of those\n          yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]. And he\n          told me, look, I have them, look at the\n          package. These are the best that come, and he\n          had the yellow ones.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Mr. Bauzá was Colón's counsel at trial and Mr. Castro-Lang was\nhis counsel on appeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\fOn appeal, Colón characterizes as impermissible hearsay Romero's\n\ntestimony that she told Otero \"she needed some of those yellow caps\n\nthat belonged to [Colón]\" (\"Romero statement\"); and her testimony\n\non Otero's response:       \"Do you want some of these yellow caps?\n\n.   .   .   These   are   the   best    and    they're   [Colón]'s\"   (\"Otero\n\nstatement\").\n\n            We begin by addressing Colón's challenge to the admission\n\nof the Otero statement.         Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E)\n\nclassifies as nonhearsay those statements made \"by a coconspirator\n\nof a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n\nAs nonhearsay, such statements, if admitted, may be considered for\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted.        See Castellini, 392 F.3d at 50.\n\nTo admit a coconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), four\n\nelements must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nFirst, a conspiracy must have existed, and second, the defendant\n\nmust have been a member of it.         United States v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83,\n\n93 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d\n\n632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980)).        Third, the declarant must also have\n\nbeen a member of the conspiracy.              Id.   Fourth, the declarant's\n\nstatement must have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nId.3\n\n\n3\n   It is immaterial that the other person in the conversation,\nRomero, was not a coconspirator but a government informant. Piper,\n298 F.3d at 53 (\"[S]tatements made [by a coconspirator declarant]\nin the course of a discussion between [him] and a third party who\nis a stranger to the conspiracy are admissible under Rule\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            In order to preserve an objection to the admission of a\n\ncoconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the defendant must\n\nask the district court to make, at the close of the evidence, what\n\nis known as a Petrozziello determination.      See United States v.\n\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977).      There, the district\n\ncourt asks whether it is \"'more likely than not that the declarant\n\nand the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and that the\n\nstatement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.'\"    Castellini, 392\n\nF.3d at 50 (quoting Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23).    To preserve a\n\nchallenge to the result of this determination, the defendant must\n\nobject.    See United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Preserved challenges are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Hernández, 497 F.3d 71, 82 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nUnpreserved challenges are reviewed for plain error.    Flemmi, 402\n\nF.3d at 94.\n\n            As the passage quoted above indicates, Colón objected\n\nanticipatorily to the Otero statement.     Although he did not give\n\nthe reason for his objection, the Government assumed it was on\n\nhearsay grounds, and responded that the statement fell within the\n\ncoconspirator exemption.    The district court allowed the testimony\n\n\n\n\n801(d)(2)(E), provided that they meet the Rule's foundational\nrequirements[,] . . . regardless of whether the third party is a\ntipster, an informant, an undercover officer, or a mere\nacquaintance.\").\n\n                                 -12-\n\fwith a caveat:      \"Let's see how it all comes out.\"          At the end of\n\ntrial, the district court made the Petrozziello determination:\n\n          [T]he   United    States  has   proven   by  a\n          preponderance    of   the  evidence    that  a\n          conspiracy under the statutory violations set\n          forth in Count 1 existed [that is, knowing and\n          intentional    possession   with   intent   to\n          distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and\n          marijuana],       that    the     declarants/\n          coconspirators, Rafael Soto Torres, Wanda\n          Romero, Ketsy Cardona, and Jesús Santiago\n          Rivera's statements are declarations that are\n          authorized and admissible pursuant to Federal\n          Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E).\n\n          . . .\n\n          Some of them were co-conspirator statements,\n          classic co-conspirators, 801(d)(2)(E), others\n          were statements that were attributed to the\n          Defendant and the Court was satisfied . . .\n          that the statements were made during the\n          conspiracy   and   in  furtherance   of   the\n          conspiracy.\n\nAt this point, Colón requested the district court to reconsider the\n\nportion of the Petrozziello determination that deemed the Otero\n\nstatement as having been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. He\n\naccepted, however, that the Otero statement was made during the\n\nconspiracy.      After a lengthy explanation, the district court\n\nreaffirmed    its   ruling   that   the    Otero   statement   was   made   in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy because Otero \"was trying to induce\n\n[Romero] to buy the best quality, which was the quality of the\n\ndrugs which were owned by Edwin Colón.\"             Colón made no further\n\nobjection.\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            On appeal, Colón now challenges the entire Petrozziello\n\ndetermination.    In making this determination, the district court\n\nfound explicitly that the first element under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) had\n\nbeen fulfilled: a conspiracy existed as charged in the indictment.\n\nThe court also found that certain purported hearsay statements\n\nduring Romero's testimony were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E);\n\nin rejecting Colón's request to reconsider, the court clarified\n\nthat among these was the Otero statement.        The district court then\n\nmade an express finding that the Otero statement also satisfied the\n\nfourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) element because it was made in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy.       Although the district court did not make\n\nexplicit findings on the second and third elements -- that Colón\n\nand Otero were both members of the conspiracy -- such       findings are\n\nclearly implied in the court's rulings on the first and fourth\n\nelements.\n\n            At trial, Colón only objected to the district court's\n\nruling on the fourth element, and indeed appears to have accepted\n\nthat the other Rule 801(d)(2)(E) requirements were fulfilled.           We\n\naccordingly review the district court's finding on the fourth\n\nelement   for   abuse   of   discretion,   and   the   remainder   of   the\n\nPetrozziello determination for plain error.        See Flemmi, 402 F.3d\n\nat 94.\n\n            The first, second, and fourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) elements\n\nare easily satisfied, under either standard of review.        At least a\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fpreponderance of the evidence in the record, and most notably the\n\ntestimony of Soto, shows that a conspiracy existed and that Colón\n\nwas a member of it.            The district court also correctly determined\n\nthat the fourth element was satisfied:                Otero's puffery about how\n\nthe yellow caps were Colón's and were \"the best\" sought directly to\n\npromote the conspiracy's goal -- the sale of drugs -- and to\n\nengender confidence on the part of the buyer Romero.                      See Piper,\n\n298   F.3d     at    54   (a    statement    is   made   \"in   furtherance       of\"    a\n\nconspiracy if it \"tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as\n\nopposed      to     thwarting    its   purpose\"     (quoting     United    States      v.\n\nFlores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 330 (1st Cir. 1995))); cf. United\n\nStates    v.      Roldán-Zapata,       916   F.2d   795,   803    (2d     Cir.   1990)\n\n(statement made in furtherance of conspiracy where declarant told\n\npotential drug buyer defendant's role and identity to \"reassur[e]\n\nhim to proceed with the transaction in the presence of someone with\n\nwhom he was not familiar\"); United States v. McGuire, 608 F.2d\n\n1028, 1032-33 (5th Cir. 1979) (statement made in furtherance of\n\nconspiracy where declarant told potential buyer that defendant's\n\nbrother in Peru could get him cocaine, which amounted to \"puffing\"\n\naimed at obtaining buyer's confidence).\n\n               With respect to the third element, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court did not plainly err in finding Otero to be a member\n\nof the conspiracy.         Nonhearsay evidence presented at trial made it\n\nplausible that Otero was involved in the conspiracy to traffic\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fdrugs. Specifically, Romero testified that she personally observed\n\nOtero, a person she had known since childhood, selling crack\n\ncocaine at a location that, according to other witnesses including\n\nSoto and Rivera, was Colón's drug point.4        In this circuit,\n\n\"[w]here the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a\n\nfactual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court\n\nto make, the error cannot be 'clear' or 'obvious' unless the\n\ndesired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the\n\nrecord below.\"   De la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d at 996 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Olivier-Díaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993)).     Colón's\n\ndesired factual finding, which he neglected to ask the district\n\ncourt to make, was that Otero was not a member of the conspiracy.\n\nAs noted above, this is not the only finding rationally supported\n\nby the record below; Colón failed to produce any evidence to refute\n\nOtero's role in the conspiracy.   No plain error occurred here.\n\n          We now turn to Colón's challenge to the admission of the\n\nRomero statement.   We find his arguments unavailing because that\n\nstatement constituted a \"reciprocal and integrated utterance\" that\n\nmerely served to put the Otero statement \"into perspective and make\n\n[it] intelligible to the jury.\" Id. at n.8 (internal citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Romero's request for \"some of those\n\nyellow caps that belonged to [Colón]\" gave context to Otero's\n\n\n4\n     Otero was originally charged in the indictment as a\ncoconspirator along with Colón, Soto, and others. He subsequently\npled guilty. Cf. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d at 996.\n\n                                -16-\n\fresponse that he had some of Colón's yellow caps to sell her.\n\nFurthermore, nothing in the Romero statement exposed the jury to\n\nany information not already contained in the Otero statement which,\n\nas determined above, was itself admissible under the coconspirator\n\nexemption in Rule 801(d)(2)(E).                  Cf. United States v. Zizzo, 120\n\nF.3d 1338, 1348 (7th Cir. 1997) (no error to admit portions of\n\nnonconspirator           declarant's           conversations       with     defendant's\n\ncoconspirators, where coconspirators' statements had been admitted\n\nunder Rule 801(d)(2)(E), because nonconspirator's remarks \"were not\n\nadmitted       for    their     truth    but    rather    to    give   context       to    the\n\nconspirators' ends of the conversations\"); United States v. Catano,\n\n65   F.3d      219,    225    (1st      Cir.    1995)    (DEA    informant's         end    of\n\nconversation with defendant not hearsay, where defendant's end of\n\nconversation admissible as nonhearsay admission of a party under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), because informant's utterances were\n\n\"reasonably          required    to     place     [defendant's]        admissions         into\n\ncontext\"       and    \"make     them    intelligible       to   the    jury\"    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); United States v. Walter, 434 F.3d 30, 34\n\n(1st    Cir.    2006)     (same).        In     these    circumstances,        the   Romero\n\nstatement was not hearsay, and it was not error to admit it.\n\nSee de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d at 996 n.8; Catano, 65 F.3d at\n\n225.5\n\n\n5\n   In contrast to the testimony described earlier in this opinion,\nColón did not request an instruction that the jury not consider the\nRomero statement for the truth of Colón's ownership of the yellow\n\n                                               -17-\n\f            We therefore turn to Colón's third and final assignment\n\nof error.\n\n            C.   The Purported Jencks Act Violation\n\n            The Jencks Act obliges the Government to hand over, upon\n\nrequest, prior statements of a government witness relating to the\n\nwitness's trial testimony, whether such statements are exculpatory\n\nor not.   See United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b)).         A \"statement\" for\n\npurposes of the Jencks Act includes any written statement made,\n\nadopted, or approved by the witness.     18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).\n\n            Several months before trial, Colón sent the Government a\n\nletter requesting what he termed Jencks material:     \"copies of any\n\nconfessions and/or statements which may be of [an] incriminating\n\nnature to Defendant.\"       On cross-examination at trial, Romero\n\ntestified that federal agents had interviewed her more than twenty\n\ntimes; in such interviews, an agent wrote down what Romero said,\n\nand Romero read what had been written and agreed with it.        The\n\ndistrict court found that Romero had thereby adopted these \"rough\n\nnotes\" -- thus making them producible under the Jencks Act -- and\n\nasked the Government if it had the notes. The Government responded\n\nthat it did not have them at trial that day, and Colón proceeded to\n\ncross-examine Romero without the rough notes, apparently reserving\n\n\ncaps. The district court did not commit plain error in not giving\nsuch an instruction. Cf. United States v. Tornabene, 687 F.2d 312,\n317 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Fed. R. Evid. 105.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthe right to ask more questions once the rough notes had been given\n\nto him.\n\n           Four days later, the Government announced that the rough\n\nnotes no longer existed \"because the agent at the time prepared the\n\nDEA-6 report and destroyed their notes.          And they discussed with\n\n[Romero] the DEA-6 report, which she has.\"6             In response to a\n\nquestion by the district court, the Government clarified that the\n\nrough notes had been destroyed. The district court did not inquire\n\nfurther,   and   counsel   for   Colón   did   not   comment   or   raise   an\n\nobjection.   In its brief, the Government asserts that what Romero\n\nactually adopted was the DEA-6 reports, not the rough notes, but at\n\noral argument the Government recanted and submitted that Romero\n\ncould not have adopted the DEA-6 reports either, because she does\n\nnot understand English.7    The Government argues that there are only\n\ntwo federal agents who interviewed Romero and could possibly have\n\ntaken these notes.     The first, Pedro Pérez, testified on cross-\n\nexamination that, while he wrote up DEA-6 reports of the Romero\n\ninterviews, he did not take any notes while interviewing her, and\n\ndoes not recall any other agents taking notes.           The second agent,\n\n\n6\n   Although the Government here appears to be speaking of a single\nDEA-6 report, shortly thereafter it referred to the \"6s,\" and other\nsubmissions and evidence in the record suggest that more than one\nDEA-6 report was created.\n7\n  We cannot examine the contents of the DEA-6 reports because they\nwere not introduced at trial. See Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d at 56\n(noting that a court cannot review evidence for first time on\nappeal).\n\n                                   -19-\n\fLuis Batiz, testified prior to Romero and was not re-called by\n\nColón    to   testify      regarding   the   rough    notes.   The    Government\n\nconcludes that Romero was simply confused when she testified to\n\nhaving adopted notes taken during her interviews.\n\n              In order to prevail on an alleged violation of the Jencks\n\nAct, a defendant must show that he was prejudiced as a result of\n\nthe Government's nondisclosure of a qualifying statement.                United\n\nStates v. Duval, 496 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 2007).                 Colón claims\n\nthat he may well have suffered prejudice because, if the rough\n\nnotes failed to reflect Romero's conversation with Otero in which\n\nOtero stated that the yellow caps were Colón's, Colón could have\n\nused the notes as a powerful tool to impeach Romero's credibility.\n\nColón asserts that he is not blindly speculating that the Otero\n\nstatement would be absent:             the audio recording of Romero and\n\nLópez's subsequent trip to the yellow point reveals no mention of\n\nColón's name; according to Colón, this suggests Romero was lying\n\nwhen she testified that Otero mentioned Colón's name.\n\n              While   we    ordinarily    review     determinations   under   the\n\nJencks Act for abuse of discretion, Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d\n\nat 55, here we review for plain error because Colón failed to\n\nobject at trial to the Government's nondisclosure of the rough\n\nnotes.    See United States v. Schier, 438 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.\n\n2006). Lacking sufficient information in the record, we are not in\n\na position to determine a number of critical questions, including:\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\f(1) whether there were any rough notes taken at all; (2) if so,\n\nwhether Romero adopted them; and (3) whether the rough notes or the\n\nDEA-6 reports contained any mention of Otero telling Romero the\n\nyellow caps were Colón's.        When confronted with uncertainties of\n\nthis type in the past, we have sometimes remanded the case to the\n\ndistrict court to clarify the record.      See, e.g., Rosario-Peralta,\n\n175 F.3d at 56-57; United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1199 (1st\n\nCir. 1994); United States v. del Toro Soto, 676 F.2d 13, 16-17 (1st\n\nCir. 1982).\n\n             Nevertheless, in light of other evidence presented at\n\ntrial, and since the standard of review is plain error, we need not\n\ngo so far.    Even assuming the rough notes or the DEA-6 reports made\n\nno mention of Otero's statement to Romero, there was a considerable\n\namount of other evidence presented to the jury establishing Colón\n\nas the provider of drugs sold at the yellow point and that crack\n\nsold there came in vials with yellow caps.        The evidence linking\n\nColón to the yellow point included, perhaps most importantly, the\n\ntestimony of Colón's coconspirator Soto and that of Colón's friend\n\nRivera.   Cf. United States v. Richards, 241 F.3d 335, 343 (3d Cir.\n\n2001) (no plain error despite Jencks Act violation because, inter\n\nalia, there was \"separate reliable evidence\" of defendant's guilt).\n\nOn the facts of this case we cannot say that, even if the Jencks\n\nAct were violated, Colón was prejudiced or that the violation\n\n\"'seriously     impaired   the     fairness,   integrity,   or   public\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\freputation'\" of the trial.   United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)).   Thus once again, no plain error occurred.8\n\n          D.   Applicability of the Cumulative Error Doctrine\n\n          Colón argues that, in the aggregate, the three sets of\n\npurported errors complained of in this appeal necessitate a new\n\ntrial because they \"impugn[ed] the fairness of the proceedings and\n\nthus undermine[d] the trustworthiness of the verdict.\"        United\n\nStates v. Williams, 146 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir. 1998); see also\n\nSepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1195-96 (\"Individual errors, insufficient in\n\nthemselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have a\n\nmore debilitating effect.\").   In light of what we have said above,\n\nthis argument necessarily fails.    Cf. Flemmi, 402 F.3d at 95 n.23\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the\n\ndefendant's]   individual    complaints   resulted   in   substantial\n\n\n\n8\n   Although this outcome is dictated on the specific facts of this\ncase, we take the opportunity to remind the Government that we do\nnot take Jencks Act violations lightly. If the rough notes existed\nin the first place, it would have been much wiser for the\nGovernment to have preserved them, considering the likelihood that\nthe notes would be requested at a later time and the possibility of\nsanctions for contravening the Act. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 3500(d). As\nin United States v. Lieberman, 608 F.2d 889, 897 n.13 (1st Cir.\n1979), we need not decide today whether government agents always\nhave a Jencks Act duty to preserve rough interview notes where such\nnotes are subsequently incorporated into a more formal report. See\nUnited States v. Melo, 411 F. Supp. 2d 17, 21-24 (D. Mass. 2006)\n(discussing the split in our sister circuits on this question).\nThe Government should bear in mind that this remains an open\nquestion in our circuit, and should accordingly err on the side of\ncaution.\n\n                                -22-\n\fprejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the\n\nfinal contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative\n\nerror.\" (quoting United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1322 (1st\n\nCir. 1994))).\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For   the   reasons   discussed   above,   we   affirm   Colón's\n\nconvictions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

He appeals these convictions, claiming that the district court committed a number of errors that, in the aggregate, constituted reversible error under the cumulative error doctrine articulated in <i>United States v. Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir.1993). After thoroughly reviewing the record and considering the parties' arguments, we affirm Colón's convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We consider only those facts relevant to Colón's arguments on appeal, relating them \"as the jury could have found them, drawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the jury's verdict.\" <i>United States v. Milkiewicz,</i> 470 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir.2006). Colón lived in Building 47 of the Vista Hermosa housing project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he ran a small grocery store. The Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") assembled a task force to investigate Colón as the suspected owner of a drug-selling location in front of Building 47 known as the \"yellow point\" for the yellow markings on the packaging in which certain drugs were sold. In particular, crack cocaine was sold in small plastic vials sealed with yellow caps. These vials of crack were called \"yellow caps.\"</p>\n<p>As part of the investigation, the DEA sent an informant, Wanda Romero, to the yellow point to buy yellow caps. The seller at the yellow point on this occasion was José Otero-Cruz (\"Otero\"), alias \"Bebo,\" Colón's stepson. Romero and Otero had a conversation in which Otero informed her that he had yellow caps belonging to Colón, and Romero returned later with DEAfurnished money and bought the yellow caps from Otero. Again on DEA instructions, Romero went to the yellow point with Puerto Rico police officer and undercover DEA task-force member Janet López; Romero and López had a hidden audio-recording device. This time, the seller was Víctor Díaz, alias \"Ne,\" who sold Romero and López drugs. Colón's name was not mentioned during this transaction.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the investigation, federal agents gathered a considerable quantum of additional evidence that would later be presented at trial, including: (1) a video showing Colón in close proximity to the yellow point; (2) witnesses who said they saw Colón near the yellow point and that Colón appeared concerned with the goingson there; (3) the testimony of Colón's friend and fellow drug trafficker, Jesus Rivera-Santiago (\"Rivera\"), that Colón owned the yellow point; (4) the testimony of Colón's coconspirator Rafael Soto-Torres (\"Soto\") that Colón owned the yellow point and that Soto sold drugs at the yellow point on behalf of Colón; (5) evidence that a search of Colón's store turned up police scanners and surveillance cameras that were located both inside and outside the store, but no food or other goods on the shelves; (6) evidence that a search of an apartment belonging to Colón yielded a large amount of drugs, drug paraphernalia, cash, a cash counting machine, a police scanner, and some weapons; and (7) that Colón had made down payments of thousands of dollars on a number of expensive homes, sometimes in cash, even though he only registered a monthly income of $100.</p>\n<p>Colón was eventually arrested and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846; and with aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana within 1,000 feet of an elementary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> school or park, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. A jury convicted Colón on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to twenty years' imprisonment. On appeal, Colón challenges a number of evidentiary rulings made at trial. He also complains of the Government's alleged destruction of certain \"rough notes\" taken during several interviews with a government informant who testified at trial. We detail these challenges, and the trial procedure giving rise to them, in the relevant parts of the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Colón argues that three sets of purported errors, taken together, justify reversal of his convictions under the cumulative error doctrine. <i>See </i><i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1196. None of his arguments withstands scrutiny. We consider them in turn.</p>\n<p>A. Limiting Instructions for the Romero, López, and Péerez Testimony Naming Colón as the Yellow Point's Owner</p>\n<p>Colón's first assignment of error is that three government witnesses  Romero, López, and DEA task force member Pedro Pérez  gave highly prejudicial hearsay testimony naming him as the yellow point's owner, and that the district court's limiting instructions to the jury failed to cure the infirmity. Evidentiary rulings, including whether to admit evidence over a hearsay objection, are ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García,</i> 452 F.3d 36, 38 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Washington,</i> 434 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2006). However, we review Colón's challenge to the Romero, López, and Pérez limiting instructions only for plain error because Colón did not object to them when they were given at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d 986, 996 (1st Cir.1995) (\"The `plain error' standard requires the reviewing court to ask: (1) whether there is an error; (2) whether the error is `plain,' a term synonymous with `clear' or `obvious'; and (3) whether the error affected substantial rights.\" (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993))).</p>\n<p>While an out-of-court statement may be hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, it is nonhearsay if offered for some other purpose, including when offered \"only for context.\" <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a given statement potentially qualifies as both hearsay and nonhearsay, the district court may admit it if it is relevant, and if the probative value of its intended nonhearsay use is not substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury considering it for the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Mazza,</i> 792 F.2d 1210, 1215 (1st Cir.1986). If so requested by a party, however, the district court must instruct the jury not to Consider the statement for its truth. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Linwood,</i> 142 F.3d 418, 425 (7th Cir.1998) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 105).</p>\n<p>After reviewing the record, it is clear that the district court adopted the proper procedure with respect to the impugned Romero and López testimony. Romero testified that federal agents asked her to go and purchase drugs from \"[Colón]'s yellow point.\" Colón timely objected that this statement was hearsay and requested a limiting instruction. The district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[Y]ou may not take that answer for its veracity, that it was [Colón]'s yellow point. You can only consider that answer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> for the fact that those were the instructions provided to . . . the witness [Romero]. But, again, you may not take that, that it was [Colón]'s yellow point, for the veracity that in fact that was [Colón]'s yellow point.</blockquote>\n<p>Colón explicitly approved of this instruction in advance during a sidebar conference, and did not object when the court announced it to the jury.</p>\n<p>For her part, López testified regarding what she and her supervisor said to Romero before proceeding to the yellow point to purchase drugs from Víctor Díaz: \"[A]fter going over the job that was going to be carried out, we told [Romero] that we were going to go over to the housing project to buy drugs at a point of somebody called [Colón].\" Colón again objected on hearsay grounds, and the district court instructed the jury as follows: \"The Court instructs the jury that they are not to take that into consideration, other than they were told that it was [Colón], period. Not to take it for the truth, but that was the instruction that was provided to them.\" Colón did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p>Both these pieces of testimony lent themselves to at least two nonhearsay purposes: they described directions from one person to another, and they demonstrated why Romero  accompanied by López the second time  went to the yellow point. <i>See </i><i>Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d at 87 (\"directions from one individual to another . . . do not constitute hearsay,\" and nonhearsay includes statements \"`offered to . . . supply a motive for the listener's action'\" (citing <i>United States v. Murphy,</i> 193 F.3d 1, 6 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999))). On Colón's request, the court issued unequivocal instructions that the jury was not to consider the evidence as proof that Colón was the yellow point's owner.<sup>[1]</sup> We find no plain error here.</p>\n<p>Colón's challenge to the Pérez testimony is similarly fruitless. Pérez testified that \"on and off in the year 2002, the special investigation unit . . . targeted the . . . drug t[r]afficking organization led by Mr. Edwin Colón Díaz.\" Like the Romero and López testimony, this testimony could readily be taken for a nonhearsay purpose: it provided background and context for understanding the investigative steps of the task force, and an explanation for why the task force focused its efforts on Colón, as opposed to someone else. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Castellini</i> 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Collins,</i> 996 F.2d 950, 953 (8th Cir.1993) (out-of-court statement \"not hearsay if offered for the purpose of explaining why an investigation was undertaken\"). Colón made a hearsay objection to the Pérez testimony, and the district court issued an instruction to which Colón did not object:</p>\n<blockquote>I am advising the jury that this is an investigation that [Pérez] undertook. It is not a statement for the truth. The only truth is that that was the investigation, but . . . whether or not the investigation is truthful or untruthful or correct or incorrect, that's the jury who will determine that.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> This instruction expressly directed the jury not to consider whether the task force's focus on Colón as the leader of the organization was well placed. It was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court committed no plain error in the procedure surrounding the admission of these three pieces of testimony, nor in its respective limiting instructions. We accordingly turn to Colón's next assignment of error.</p>\n<p>B. Alleged Hearsay Testimony that Colón Was the Provider of the Yellow Caps</p>\n<p>Colón argues that Romero's testimony regarding her conversation with Otero the first time she went to buy drugs at the yellow point also contained damaging hearsay naming Colón as the yellow point's owner. The relevant portion of the trial transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So after you see [Otero] with this bag of yellow cap crack, what did you ask him or what did you proceed to do with [Otero]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I asked him whether he could get me a package of those yellow caps. Q. MR. BAUZÁ<sup>[2]</sup> [Counsel for Colón]: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: She's asking him. Up to now it's not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What was [Otero]'s response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BAUZÁ: Now, objection. . . . I have an objection, Your Honor, as to [Otero]'s response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. GIL [Assistant U.S. Attorney]: Coconspirator statement, it's an exception to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: But let me see how it all comes out. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So how did [Otero] respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He asked me, \"Do you want some of these yellow caps? Listen, I have them. These are the best and they're [Colón]'s.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What did you ask . . . [Otero ?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I told him that I needed some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]. And he told me, look, I have them, look at the package. These are the best that come, and he had the yellow ones.</blockquote>\n<p>On appeal, Colón characterizes as impermissible hearsay Romero's testimony that she told Otero \"she needed some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]\" (\"Romero statement\"); and her testimony on Otero's response: \"Do you want some of these yellow caps? . . . These are the best and they're [Colón]'s\" (\"Otero statement\").</p>\n<p>We begin by addressing Colón's challenge to the admission of the Otero statement. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) classifies as nonhearsay those statements made \"by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" As nonhearsay, such statements, if admitted, may be considered for the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d at 50. To admit a coconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), four elements must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence. First, a conspiracy must have existed, and second, the defendant must have been a member of it. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980)). Third, the declarant must also have been a member of the conspiracy. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> <i>Id.</i> Fourth, the declarant's statement must have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>Id.</i><sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In order to preserve an objection to the admission of a coconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the defendant must ask the district court to make, at the close of the evidence, what is known as a <i>Petrozziello</i> determination. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir.1977). There, the district court asks whether it is \"`more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.'\" <i>Castellini</i> 392 F.3d at 50 (quoting <i>Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d at 23). To preserve a challenge to the result of this determination, the defendant must object. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Flemmi</i> 402 F.3d 79, 94 (1st Cir.2005). Preserved challenges are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rivera-Hernández,</i> 497 F.3d 71, 82 (1st Cir.2007). Unpreserved challenges are reviewed for plain error. <i>Flemmi</i> 402 F.3d at 94.</p>\n<p>As the passage quoted above indicates, Colón objected anticipatorily to the Otero statement. Although he did not give the reason for his objection, the Government assumed it was on hearsay grounds, and responded that the statement fell within the coconspirator exemption. The district court allowed the testimony with a caveat: \"Let's see how it all comes out.\" At the end of trial, the district court made the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he United States has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy under the statutory violations set forth in Count 1 existed [that is, knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana], that the declarants/coconspirators, Rafael Soto Torres, Wanda Romero, Ketsy Cardona, and Jesús Santiago Rivera's statements are declarations that are authorized and admissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Some of them were co-conspirator statements, classic co-conspirators, 801(d)(2)(E), others were statements that were attributed to the Defendant and the Court was satisfied . . . that the statements were made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, Colón requested the district court to reconsider the portion of the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination that deemed the Otero statement as having been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. He accepted, however, that the Otero statement was made during the conspiracy. After a lengthy explanation, the district court reaffirmed its ruling that the Otero statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy because Otero \"was trying to induce [Romero] to buy the best quality, which was the quality of the drugs which were owned by Edwin Colón.\" Colón made no further objection.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Colón now challenges the entire <i>Petrozziello</i> determination. In making this determination, the district court found explicitly that the first element under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) had been fulfilled: a conspiracy existed as charged in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> indictment. The court also found that certain purported hearsay statements during Romero's testimony were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E); in rejecting Colón's request to reconsider, the court clarified that among these was the Otero statement. The district court then made an express finding that the Otero statement also satisfied the fourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) element because it was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Although the district court did not make explicit findings on the second and third elements  that Colón and Otero were both members of the conspiracy  such findings are clearly implied in the court's rulings on the first and fourth elements.</p>\n<p>At trial, Colón only objected to the district court's ruling on the fourth element, and indeed appears to have accepted that the other Rule 801(d)(2)(E) requirements were fulfilled. We accordingly review the district court's finding on the fourth element for abuse of discretion, and the remainder of the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination for plain error. <i>See </i><i>Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d at 94.</p>\n<p>The first, second, and fourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) elements are easily satisfied, under either standard of review. At least a preponderance of the evidence in the record, and most notably the testimony of Soto, shows that a conspiracy existed and that Colón was a member of it. The district court also correctly determined that the fourth element was satisfied: Otero's puffery about how the yellow caps were Colón's and were \"the best\" sought directly to promote the conspiracy's goal  the sale of drugs  and to engender confidence on the part of the buyer Romero. <i>See Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 54 (a statement is made \"in furtherance of a conspiracy if it \"tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose\" (quoting <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 330 (1st Cir.1995))); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Roldán-Zapata,</i> 916 F.2d 795, 803 (2d Cir.1990) (statement made in furtherance of conspiracy where declarant told potential drug buyer defendant's role and identity to \"reassur[e] him to proceed with the transaction in the presence of someone with whom he was not familiar\"); <i>United States v. McGuire,</i> 608 F.2d 1028, 1032-33 (5th Cir.1979) (statement made in furtherance of conspiracy where declarant told potential buyer that defendant's brother in Peru could get him cocaine, which amounted to \"puffing\" aimed at obtaining buyer's confidence).</p>\n<p>With respect to the third element, we hold that the district court did not plainly err in finding Otero to be a member of the conspiracy. Nonhearsay evidence presented at trial made it plausible that Otero was involved in the conspiracy to traffic drugs. Specifically, Romero testified that she personally observed Otero, a person she had known since childhood, selling crack cocaine at a location that, according to other witnesses including Soto and Rivera, was Colón's drug point.<sup>[4]</sup> In this circuit, \"[w]here the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be `clear' or `obvious' unless the <i>desired</i> factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.\" <i>de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996 (quoting <i>United States v. Olivier-Díaz,</i> 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993)). Colón's desired factual finding, which he neglected to ask the district court to make, was that Otero was not a member of the conspiracy. As noted above, this is not the only finding rationally <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> supported by the record below; Colón failed to produce any evidence to refute Otero's role in the conspiracy. No plain error occurred here.</p>\n<p>We now turn to Colón's challenge to the admission of the Romero statement. We find his arguments unavailing because that statement constituted a \"reciprocal and integrated utterance\" that merely served to put the Otero statement \"into perspective and make [it] intelligible to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 996 n. 8 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Romero's request for \"some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]\" gave context to Otero's response that he had some of Colón's yellow caps to sell her. Furthermore, nothing in the Romero statement exposed the jury to any information not already contained in the Otero statement which, as determined above, was itself admissible under the coconspirator exemption in Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zizzo,</i> 120 F.3d 1338, 1348 (7th Cir.1997) (no error to admit portions of nonconspirator declarant's conversations with defendant's coconspirators, where coconspirators' statements had been admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), because nonconspirator's remarks \"were not admitted for their truth but rather to give <i>context</i> to the conspirators' ends of the conversations\"); <i>United States v. Catano,</i> 65 F.3d 219, 225 (1st Cir.1995) (DEA informant's end of conversation with defendant not hearsay, where defendant's end of conversation admissible as nonhearsay admission of a party under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), because informant's utterances were \"reasonably required to place [defendant's] admissions into context\" and \"make them intelligible to the jury\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (same). In these circumstances, the Romero statement was not hearsay, and it was not error to admit it. <i>See de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996 n. 8; <i>Catano,</i> 65 F.3d at 225.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We therefore turn to Colón's third and final assignment of error.</p>\n<p>C. The Purported Jencks Act Violation</p>\n<p>The Jencks Act obliges the Government to hand over, upon request, prior statements of a government witness relating to the witness's trial testimony, whether such statements are exculpatory or not. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir.1999) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b)). A \"statement\" for purposes of the Jencks Act includes any written statement made, adopted, or approved by the witness. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).</p>\n<p>Several months before trial, Colón sent the Government a letter requesting what he termed Jencks material: \"copies of any confessions and/or statements which may be of [an] incriminating nature to Defendant.\" On cross-examination at trial, Romero testified that federal agents had interviewed her more than twenty times; in such interviews, an agent wrote down what Romero said, and Romero read what had been written and agreed with it. The district court found that Romero had thereby adopted these \"rough notes\"  thus making them producible under the Jencks Act  and asked the Government if it had the notes. The Government responded that it did not have them at trial that day, and Colón proceeded to cross-examine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> Romero without the rough notes, apparently reserving the right to ask more questions once the rough notes had been given to him.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the Government announced that the rough notes no longer existed \"because the agent at the time prepared the DEA-6 report and destroyed their notes. And they discussed with [Romero] the DEA-6 report, which she has.\"<sup>[6]</sup> In response to a question by the district court, the Government clarified that the rough notes had been destroyed. The district court did not inquire further, and counsel for Colón did not comment or raise an objection. In its brief, the Government asserts that what Romero actually adopted was the DEA-6 reports, not the rough notes, but at oral argument the Government recanted and submitted that Romero could not have adopted the DEA-6 reports either, because she does not understand English.<sup>[7]</sup> The Government argues that there are only two federal agents who interviewed Romero and could possibly have taken these notes. The first, Pedro Pérez, testified on cross-examination that, while he wrote up DEA-6 reports of the Romero interviews, he did not take any notes while interviewing her, and does not recall any other agents taking notes. The second agent, Luis Batiz, testified prior to Romero and was not re-called by Colón to testify regarding the rough notes. The Government concludes that Romero was simply confused when she testified to having adopted notes taken, during her interviews.</p>\n<p>In order to prevail on an alleged violation of the Jencks Act, a defendant must show that he was prejudiced as a result of the Government's nondisclosure of a qualifying statement. <i>United States v. Duval,</i> 496 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir.2007). Colón claims that he may well have suffered prejudice because, if the rough notes failed to reflect Romero's conversation with Otero in which Otero stated that the yellow caps were Colón's, Colón could have used the notes as a powerful tool to impeach Romero's credibility. Colón asserts that he is not blindly speculating that the Otero statement would be absent: the audio recording of Romero and López's subsequent trip to the yellow point reveals no mention of Colón's name; according to Colón, this suggests Romero was lying when she testified that Otero mentioned Colón's name.</p>\n<p>While we ordinarily review determinations under the Jencks Act for abuse of discretion, <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 55, here we review for plain error because Colón failed to object at trial to the Government's nondisclosure of the rough notes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Schier,</i> 438 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). Lacking sufficient information in the record, we are not in a position to determine a number of critical questions, including: (1) whether there were any rough notes taken at all; (2) if so, whether Romero adopted them; and (3) whether the rough notes or the DEA-6 reports contained any mention of Otero telling Romero the yellow caps were Colón's. When confronted with uncertainties of this type in the past, we have sometimes remanded the case to the district court to clarify the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 56-57; <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> <i>States v. Neal,</i> 36 F.3d 1190, 1199 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Del Tom Soto,</i> 676 F.2d 13, 16-17 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in light of other evidence presented at trial, and since the standard of review is plain error, we need not go so far. Even assuming the rough notes or the DEA-6 reports made no mention of Otero's statement to Romero, there was a considerable amount of other evidence presented to the jury establishing Colón as the provider of drugs sold at the yellow point and that crack sold there came in vials with yellow caps. The evidence linking Colón to the yellow point included, perhaps most importantly, the testimony of Colón's coconspirator Soto and that of Colón's friend Rivera. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Richards,</i> 241 F.3d 335, 343 (3d Cir.2001) (no plain error despite Jencks Act violation because, <i>inter alia,</i> there was \"separate reliable evidence\" of defendant's guilt). On the facts of this case we cannot say that, even if the Jencks Act were violated, Colón was prejudiced or that the violation \"`seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation'\" of the trial. <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.2003)). Thus once again, no plain error occurred.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>D. Applicability of the Cumulative Error Doctrine</p>\n<p>Colón argues that, in the aggregate, the three sets of purported errors complained of in this appeal necessitate a new trial because they \"impugn[ed] the fairness of the proceedings and thus undermine[d] the trustworthiness of the verdict.\" <i>Williams v. Drake,</i> 146 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1195-96 (\"Individual errors, insufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\"). In light of what we have said above, this argument necessarily fails. <i>Cf. Flemmi</i> 402 F.3d at 95 n. 23 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the defendant's] individual complaints resulted in substantial prejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the final contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative error.\" (quoting <i>United States v. DeMasi</i> 40 F.3d 1306, 1322 (1st Cir.1994))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, we affirm Colón's convictions.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At oral argument, Colón made much of the district court's wording of the first part of the López instruction, that the jury was \"not to take that into consideration, other than they were told that it was [Colón], period.\" Colón argued that, through these words, the court actually directed the jury to take the testimony as proof that Colón was indeed the owner of the yellow point. This is a clear misreading of the instruction. The district court instructed the jury only to consider the fact that López and her supervisor <i>told</i> Romero they were going to Colón's yellow point, not that the yellow point truly belonged to Colón. In any event, the court immediately dispelled any possible confusion in the next sentence of the instruction.</p>\n<p>[2]  Mr. Bauza was Colón's counsel at trial and Mr. Castro-Lang was his counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is immaterial that the other person in the conversation, Romero, was not a coconspirator but a government informant. <i>Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 53 (\"[S]tatements made [by a coconspirator declarant] in the course of a discussion between [him] and a third party who is a stranger to the conspiracy are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), provided that they meet the Rule's foundational requirements[,] . . . regardless of whether the third party is a tipster, an informant, an undercover officer, or a mere acquaintance.\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Otero was originally charged in the indictment as a coconspirator along with Colón, Soto, and others. He subsequently pled guilty. <i>Cf. de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996.</p>\n<p>[5]  In contrast to the testimony described earlier in this opinion, Colón did not request an instruction that the jury not consider the Romero statement for the truth of Colón's ownership of the yellow caps. The district court did not commit plain error in not giving such an instruction. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Tornabene,</i> 687 F.2d 312, 317 (9th Cir.1982); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 105.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although the Government here appears to be speaking of a single DEA-6 report, shortly thereafter it referred to the \"6s,\" and other submissions and evidence in the record suggest that more than one DEA-6 report was created.</p>\n<p>[7]  We cannot examine the contents of the DEA-6 reports because they were not introduced at trial. <i>See </i><i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 56 (noting that a court cannot review evidence for first time on appeal).</p>\n<p>[8]  Although this outcome is dictated on the specific facts of this case, we take the opportunity to remind the Government that we do not take Jencks Act violations lightly. If the rough notes existed in the first place, it would have been much wiser for the Government to have preserved them, considering the likelihood that the notes would be requested at a later time and the possibility of sanctions for contravening the Act. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C.A. § 3500(d). As in <i>United States v. Lieberman,</i> 608 F.2d 889, 897 n. 13 (1st Cir.1979), we need not decide today whether government agents always have a Jencks Act duty to preserve rough interview notes where such notes are subsequently incorporated into a more formal report. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Melo,</i> 411 F.Supp.2d 17, 21-24 (D.Mass.2006) (discussing the split in our sister circuits on this question). The Government should bear in mind that this remains an open question in our circuit, and should accordingly err on the side of caution.</p>\n\n</div>",

He appeals these convictions, claiming that the district court committed a number of errors that, in the aggregate, constituted reversible error under the cumulative error doctrine articulated in <i>United States v. Sepúlveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir.1993). After thoroughly reviewing the record and considering the parties' arguments, we affirm Colón's convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We consider only those facts relevant to Colón's arguments on appeal, relating them \"as the jury could have found them, drawing all inferences in the light most consistent with the jury's verdict.\" <i>United States v. Milkiewicz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202533\"><a href=\"/opinion/202533/united-states-v-milkiewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 392 (1st Cir.2006). Colón lived in Building 47 of the Vista Hermosa housing project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he ran a small grocery store. The Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") assembled a task force to investigate Colón as the suspected owner of a drug-selling location in front of Building 47 known as the \"yellow point\" for the yellow markings on the packaging in which certain drugs were sold. In particular, crack cocaine was sold in small plastic vials sealed with yellow caps. These vials of crack were called \"yellow caps.\"</p>\n<p>As part of the investigation, the DEA sent an informant, Wanda Romero, to the yellow point to buy yellow caps. The seller at the yellow point on this occasion was José Otero-Cruz (\"Otero\"), alias \"Bebo,\" Colón's stepson. Romero and Otero had a conversation in which Otero informed her that he had yellow caps belonging to Colón, and Romero returned later with DEAfurnished money and bought the yellow caps from Otero. Again on DEA instructions, Romero went to the yellow point with Puerto Rico police officer and undercover DEA task-force member Janet López; Romero and López had a hidden audio-recording device. This time, the seller was Víctor Díaz, alias \"Ne,\" who sold Romero and López drugs. Colón's name was not mentioned during this transaction.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the investigation, federal agents gathered a considerable quantum of additional evidence that would later be presented at trial, including: (1) a video showing Colón in close proximity to the yellow point; (2) witnesses who said they saw Colón near the yellow point and that Colón appeared concerned with the goingson there; (3) the testimony of Colón's friend and fellow drug trafficker, Jesus Rivera-Santiago (\"Rivera\"), that Colón owned the yellow point; (4) the testimony of Colón's coconspirator Rafael Soto-Torres (\"Soto\") that Colón owned the yellow point and that Soto sold drugs at the yellow point on behalf of Colón; (5) evidence that a search of Colón's store turned up police scanners and surveillance cameras that were located both inside and outside the store, but no food or other goods on the shelves; (6) evidence that a search of an apartment belonging to Colón yielded a large amount of drugs, drug paraphernalia, cash, a cash counting machine, a police scanner, and some weapons; and (7) that Colón had made down payments of thousands of dollars on a number of expensive homes, sometimes in cash, even though he only registered a monthly income of $100.</p>\n<p>Colón was eventually arrested and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846; and with aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana within 1,000 feet of an elementary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> school or park, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. A jury convicted Colón on all counts, and the district court sentenced him to twenty years' imprisonment. On appeal, Colón challenges a number of evidentiary rulings made at trial. He also complains of the Government's alleged destruction of certain \"rough notes\" taken during several interviews with a government informant who testified at trial. We detail these challenges, and the trial procedure giving rise to them, in the relevant parts of the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Colón argues that three sets of purported errors, taken together, justify reversal of his convictions under the cumulative error doctrine. <i>See </i><i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1196. None of his arguments withstands scrutiny. We consider them in turn.</p>\n<p>A. Limiting Instructions for the Romero, López, and Péerez Testimony Naming Colón as the Yellow Point's Owner</p>\n<p>Colón's first assignment of error is that three government witnesses  Romero, López, and DEA task force member Pedro Pérez  gave highly prejudicial hearsay testimony naming him as the yellow point's owner, and that the district court's limiting instructions to the jury failed to cure the infirmity. Evidentiary rulings, including whether to admit evidence over a hearsay objection, are ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. García,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202283\"><a href=\"/opinion/202283/united-states-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

However, we review Colón's challenge to the Romero, López, and Pérez limiting instructions only for plain error because Colón did not object to them when they were given at trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199664\"><a href=\"/opinion/199664/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where a given statement potentially qualifies as both hearsay and nonhearsay, the district court may admit it if it is relevant, and if the probative value of its intended nonhearsay use is not substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury considering it for the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Mazza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471592\"><a href=\"/opinion/471592/united-states-v-antonio-j-mazza-united-states-of-america-v-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span>, 1215 (1st Cir.1986). If so requested by a party, however, the district court must instruct the jury not to Consider the statement for its truth. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Linwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753752\"><a href=\"/opinion/753752/united-states-v-vetta-linwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 425 (7th Cir.1998) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 105).</p>\n<p>After reviewing the record, it is clear that the district court adopted the proper procedure with respect to the impugned Romero and López testimony. Romero testified that federal agents asked her to go and purchase drugs from \"[Colón]'s yellow point.\" Colón timely objected that this statement was hearsay and requested a limiting instruction. The district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[Y]ou may not take that answer for its veracity, that it was [Colón]'s yellow point. You can only consider that answer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> for the fact that those were the instructions provided to . . . the witness [Romero]. But, again, you may not take that, that it was [Colón]'s yellow point, for the veracity that in fact that was [Colón]'s yellow point.</blockquote>\n<p>Colón explicitly approved of this instruction in advance during a sidebar conference, and did not object when the court announced it to the jury.</p>\n<p>For her part, López testified regarding what she and her supervisor said to Romero before proceeding to the yellow point to purchase drugs from Víctor Díaz: \"[A]fter going over the job that was going to be carried out, we told [Romero] that we were going to go over to the housing project to buy drugs at a point of somebody called [Colón].\" Colón again objected on hearsay grounds, and the district court instructed the jury as follows: \"The Court instructs the jury that they are not to take that into consideration, other than they were told that it was [Colón], period. Not to take it for the truth, but that was the instruction that was provided to them.\" Colón did not object to this instruction.</p>\n<p>Both these pieces of testimony lent themselves to at least two nonhearsay purposes: they described directions from one person to another, and they demonstrated why Romero  accompanied by López the second time  went to the yellow point. <i>See </i><i>Bailey,</i> 270 F.3d at 87 (\"directions from one individual to another . . . do not constitute hearsay,\" and nonhearsay includes statements \"`offered to . . . supply a motive for the listener's action'\" (citing <i>United States v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198658\"><a href=\"/opinion/198658/united-states-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999))). On Colón's request, the court issued unequivocal instructions that the jury was not to consider the evidence as proof that Colón was the yellow point's owner.<sup>[1]</sup> We find no plain error here.</p>\n<p>Colón's challenge to the Pérez testimony is similarly fruitless. Pérez testified that \"on and off in the year 2002, the special investigation unit . . . targeted the . . . drug t[r]afficking organization led by Mr. Edwin Colón Díaz.\" Like the Romero and López testimony, this testimony could readily be taken for a nonhearsay purpose: it provided background and context for understanding the investigative steps of the task force, and an explanation for why the task force focused its efforts on Colón, as opposed to someone else. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Castellini</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201449\"><a href=\"/opinion/201449/united-states-v-castellini/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Colón made a hearsay objection to the Pérez testimony, and the district court issued an instruction to which Colón did not object:</p>\n<blockquote>I am advising the jury that this is an investigation that [Pérez] undertook. It is not a statement for the truth. The only truth is that that was the investigation, but . . . whether or not the investigation is truthful or untruthful or correct or incorrect, that's the jury who will determine that.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> This instruction expressly directed the jury not to consider whether the task force's focus on Colón as the leader of the organization was well placed. It was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court committed no plain error in the procedure surrounding the admission of these three pieces of testimony, nor in its respective limiting instructions. We accordingly turn to Colón's next assignment of error.</p>\n<p>B. Alleged Hearsay Testimony that Colón Was the Provider of the Yellow Caps</p>\n<p>Colón argues that Romero's testimony regarding her conversation with Otero the first time she went to buy drugs at the yellow point also contained damaging hearsay naming Colón as the yellow point's owner. The relevant portion of the trial transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. So after you see [Otero] with this bag of yellow cap crack, what did you ask him or what did you proceed to do with [Otero]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I asked him whether he could get me a package of those yellow caps. Q. MR. BAUZÁ<sup>[2]</sup> [Counsel for Colón]: Objection, hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: She's asking him. Up to now it's not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What was [Otero]'s response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. BAUZÁ: Now, objection. . . . I have an objection, Your Honor, as to [Otero]'s response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>MR. GIL [Assistant U.S. Attorney]: Coconspirator statement, it's an exception to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: But let me see how it all comes out. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. So how did [Otero] respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. He asked me, \"Do you want some of these yellow caps? Listen, I have them. These are the best and they're [Colón]'s.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. What did you ask . . . [Otero ?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. I told him that I needed some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]. And he told me, look, I have them, look at the package. These are the best that come, and he had the yellow ones.</blockquote>\n<p>On appeal, Colón characterizes as impermissible hearsay Romero's testimony that she told Otero \"she needed some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]\" (\"Romero statement\"); and her testimony on Otero's response: \"Do you want some of these yellow caps? . . . These are the best and they're [Colón]'s\" (\"Otero statement\").</p>\n<p>We begin by addressing Colón's challenge to the admission of the Otero statement. Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) classifies as nonhearsay those statements made \"by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" As nonhearsay, such statements, if admitted, may be considered for the truth of the matter asserted. <i>See </i><i>Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d at 50. To admit a coconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), four elements must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence. First, a conspiracy must have existed, and second, the defendant must have been a member of it. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 638 (1st Cir.1980)). Third, the declarant must also have been a member of the conspiracy. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> <i>Id.</i> Fourth, the declarant's statement must have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>Id.</i><sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In order to preserve an objection to the admission of a coconspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the defendant must ask the district court to make, at the close of the evidence, what is known as a <i>Petrozziello</i> determination. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Petrozziello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1977). There, the district court asks whether it is \"`more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy . . . and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.'\" <i>Castellini</i> 392 F.3d at 50 (quoting <i>Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d at 23). To preserve a challenge to the result of this determination, the defendant must object. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Flemmi</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201500\"><a href=\"/opinion/201500/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2005). Preserved challenges are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rivera-Hernández,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2007). Unpreserved challenges are reviewed for plain error. <i>Flemmi</i> 402 F.3d at 94.</p>\n<p>As the passage quoted above indicates, Colón objected anticipatorily to the Otero statement. Although he did not give the reason for his objection, the Government assumed it was on hearsay grounds, and responded that the statement fell within the coconspirator exemption. The district court allowed the testimony with a caveat: \"Let's see how it all comes out.\" At the end of trial, the district court made the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he United States has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy under the statutory violations set forth in Count 1 existed [that is, knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana], that the declarants/coconspirators, Rafael Soto Torres, Wanda Romero, Ketsy Cardona, and Jesús Santiago Rivera's statements are declarations that are authorized and admissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Some of them were co-conspirator statements, classic co-conspirators, 801(d)(2)(E), others were statements that were attributed to the Defendant and the Court was satisfied . . . that the statements were made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, Colón requested the district court to reconsider the portion of the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination that deemed the Otero statement as having been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. He accepted, however, that the Otero statement was made during the conspiracy. After a lengthy explanation, the district court reaffirmed its ruling that the Otero statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy because Otero \"was trying to induce [Romero] to buy the best quality, which was the quality of the drugs which were owned by Edwin Colón.\" Colón made no further objection.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Colón now challenges the entire <i>Petrozziello</i> determination. In making this determination, the district court found explicitly that the first element under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) had been fulfilled: a conspiracy existed as charged in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> indictment. The court also found that certain purported hearsay statements during Romero's testimony were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E); in rejecting Colón's request to reconsider, the court clarified that among these was the Otero statement. The district court then made an express finding that the Otero statement also satisfied the fourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) element because it was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Although the district court did not make explicit findings on the second and third elements  that Colón and Otero were both members of the conspiracy  such findings are clearly implied in the court's rulings on the first and fourth elements.</p>\n<p>At trial, Colón only objected to the district court's ruling on the fourth element, and indeed appears to have accepted that the other Rule 801(d)(2)(E) requirements were fulfilled. We accordingly review the district court's finding on the fourth element for abuse of discretion, and the remainder of the <i>Petrozziello</i> determination for plain error. <i>See </i><i>Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d at 94.</p>\n<p>The first, second, and fourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) elements are easily satisfied, under either standard of review. At least a preponderance of the evidence in the record, and most notably the testimony of Soto, shows that a conspiracy existed and that Colón was a member of it. The district court also correctly determined that the fourth element was satisfied: Otero's puffery about how the yellow caps were Colón's and were \"the best\" sought directly to promote the conspiracy's goal  the sale of drugs  and to engender confidence on the part of the buyer Romero. <i>See Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 54 (a statement is made \"in furtherance of a conspiracy if it \"tends to advance the objects of the conspiracy as opposed to thwarting its purpose\" (quoting <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 330 (1st Cir.1995))); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v.

Nonhearsay evidence presented at trial made it plausible that Otero was involved in the conspiracy to traffic drugs. Specifically, Romero testified that she personally observed Otero, a person she had known since childhood, selling crack cocaine at a location that, according to other witnesses including Soto and Rivera, was Colón's drug point.<sup>[4]</sup> In this circuit, \"[w]here the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be `clear' or `obvious' unless the <i>desired</i> factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.\" <i>de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996 (quoting <i>United States v.

Colón's desired factual finding, which he neglected to ask the district court to make, was that Otero was not a member of the conspiracy. As noted above, this is not the only finding rationally <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> supported by the record below; Colón failed to produce any evidence to refute Otero's role in the conspiracy. No plain error occurred here.</p>\n<p>We now turn to Colón's challenge to the admission of the Romero statement. We find his arguments unavailing because that statement constituted a \"reciprocal and integrated utterance\" that merely served to put the Otero statement \"into perspective and make [it] intelligible to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 996 n. 8 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Romero's request for \"some of those yellow caps that belonged to [Colón]\" gave context to Otero's response that he had some of Colón's yellow caps to sell her. Furthermore, nothing in the Romero statement exposed the jury to any information not already contained in the Otero statement which, as determined above, was itself admissible under the coconspirator exemption in Rule 801(d)(2)(E). <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zizzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744599\"><a href=\"/opinion/744599/united-states-v-anthony-c-zizzo-james-j-marcello-richard-gervasio/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1338</span></a></span>, 1348 (7th Cir.1997) (no error to admit portions of nonconspirator declarant's conversations with defendant's coconspirators, where coconspirators' statements had been admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), because nonconspirator's remarks \"were not admitted for their truth but rather to give <i>context</i> to the conspirators' ends of the conversations\"); <i>United States v. Catano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196298\"><a href=\"/opinion/196298/united-states-v-catano/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1995) (DEA informant's end of conversation with defendant not hearsay, where defendant's end of conversation admissible as nonhearsay admission of a party under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), because informant's utterances were \"reasonably required to place [defendant's] admissions into context\" and \"make them intelligible to the jury\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States v.

In these circumstances, the Romero statement was not hearsay, and it was not error to admit it. <i>See de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996 n. 8; <i>Catano,</i> 65 F.3d at 225.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We therefore turn to Colón's third and final assignment of error.</p>\n<p>C. The Purported Jencks Act Violation</p>\n<p>The Jencks Act obliges the Government to hand over, upon request, prior statements of a government witness relating to the witness's trial testimony, whether such statements are exculpatory or not. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763556\"><a href=\"/opinion/763556/united-states-v-cruz-rosario-peralta-aka-crescencio-cedeno-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1999) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b)). A \"statement\" for purposes of the Jencks Act includes any written statement made, adopted, or approved by the witness. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e).</p>\n<p>Several months before trial, Colón sent the Government a letter requesting what he termed Jencks material: \"copies of any confessions and/or statements which may be of [an] incriminating nature to Defendant.\" On cross-examination at trial, Romero testified that federal agents had interviewed her more than twenty times; in such interviews, an agent wrote down what Romero said, and Romero read what had been written and agreed with it. The district court found that Romero had thereby adopted these \"rough notes\"  thus making them producible under the Jencks Act  and asked the Government if it had the notes. The Government responded that it did not have them at trial that day, and Colón proceeded to cross-examine <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> Romero without the rough notes, apparently reserving the right to ask more questions once the rough notes had been given to him.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the Government announced that the rough notes no longer existed \"because the agent at the time prepared the DEA-6 report and destroyed their notes. And they discussed with [Romero] the DEA-6 report, which she has.\"<sup>[6]</sup> In response to a question by the district court, the Government clarified that the rough notes had been destroyed. The district court did not inquire further, and counsel for Colón did not comment or raise an objection. In its brief, the Government asserts that what Romero actually adopted was the DEA-6 reports, not the rough notes, but at oral argument the Government recanted and submitted that Romero could not have adopted the DEA-6 reports either, because she does not understand English.<sup>[7]</sup> The Government argues that there are only two federal agents who interviewed Romero and could possibly have taken these notes. The first, Pedro Pérez, testified on cross-examination that, while he wrote up DEA-6 reports of the Romero interviews, he did not take any notes while interviewing her, and does not recall any other agents taking notes. The second agent, Luis Batiz, testified prior to Romero and was not re-called by Colón to testify regarding the rough notes. The Government concludes that Romero was simply confused when she testified to having adopted notes taken, during her interviews.</p>\n<p>In order to prevail on an alleged violation of the Jencks Act, a defendant must show that he was prejudiced as a result of the Government's nondisclosure of a qualifying statement. <i>United States v. Duval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202877\"><a href=\"/opinion/202877/united-states-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2007). Colón claims that he may well have suffered prejudice because, if the rough notes failed to reflect Romero's conversation with Otero in which Otero stated that the yellow caps were Colón's, Colón could have used the notes as a powerful tool to impeach Romero's credibility. Colón asserts that he is not blindly speculating that the Otero statement would be absent: the audio recording of Romero and López's subsequent trip to the yellow point reveals no mention of Colón's name; according to Colón, this suggests Romero was lying when she testified that Otero mentioned Colón's name.</p>\n<p>While we ordinarily review determinations under the Jencks Act for abuse of discretion, <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 55, here we review for plain error because Colón failed to object at trial to the Government's nondisclosure of the rough notes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Schier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77185\"><a href=\"/opinion/77185/united-states-v-rosemary-schier/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></a></span>, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). Lacking sufficient information in the record, we are not in a position to determine a number of critical questions, including: (1) whether there were any rough notes taken at all; (2) if so, whether Romero adopted them; and (3) whether the rough notes or the DEA-6 reports contained any mention of Otero telling Romero the yellow caps were Colón's. When confronted with uncertainties of this type in the past, we have sometimes remanded the case to the district court to clarify the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 56-57; <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> <i>States v. Neal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1199 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Del Tom Soto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402521\"><a href=\"/opinion/402521/united-states-v-victor-del-toro-soto-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in light of other evidence presented at trial, and since the standard of review is plain error, we need not go so far. Even assuming the rough notes or the DEA-6 reports made no mention of Otero's statement to Romero, there was a considerable amount of other evidence presented to the jury establishing Colón as the provider of drugs sold at the yellow point and that crack sold there came in vials with yellow caps. The evidence linking Colón to the yellow point included, perhaps most importantly, the testimony of Colón's coconspirator Soto and that of Colón's friend Rivera. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Richards,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772203\"><a href=\"/opinion/772203/united-states-v-don-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 343 (3d Cir.2001) (no plain error despite Jencks Act violation because, <i>inter alia,</i> there was \"separate reliable evidence\" of defendant's guilt). On the facts of this case we cannot say that, even if the Jencks Act were violated, Colón was prejudiced or that the violation \"`seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation'\" of the trial. <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200598\"><a href=\"/opinion/200598/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2003)). Thus once again, no plain error occurred.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>D. Applicability of the Cumulative Error Doctrine</p>\n<p>Colón argues that, in the aggregate, the three sets of purported errors complained of in this appeal necessitate a new trial because they \"impugn[ed] the fairness of the proceedings and thus undermine[d] the trustworthiness of the verdict.\" <i>Williams v. Drake,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>Sepúlveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1195-96 (\"Individual errors, insufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect.\"). In light of what we have said above, this argument necessarily fails. <i>Cf. Flemmi</i> 402 F.3d at 95 n. 23 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[B]ecause we have found that none of [the defendant's] individual complaints resulted in substantial prejudice and that most are completely without merit, we reject the final contention that his conviction was tainted by cumulative error.\" (quoting <i>United States v. DeMasi</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1322 (1st Cir.1994))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, we affirm Colón's convictions.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At oral argument, Colón made much of the district court's wording of the first part of the López instruction, that the jury was \"not to take that into consideration, other than they were told that it was [Colón], period.\" Colón argued that, through these words, the court actually directed the jury to take the testimony as proof that Colón was indeed the owner of the yellow point. This is a clear misreading of the instruction. The district court instructed the jury only to consider the fact that López and her supervisor <i>told</i> Romero they were going to Colón's yellow point, not that the yellow point truly belonged to Colón. In any event, the court immediately dispelled any possible confusion in the next sentence of the instruction.</p>\n<p>[2]  Mr. Bauza was Colón's counsel at trial and Mr. Castro-Lang was his counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is immaterial that the other person in the conversation, Romero, was not a coconspirator but a government informant. <i>Piper,</i> 298 F.3d at 53 (\"[S]tatements made [by a coconspirator declarant] in the course of a discussion between [him] and a third party who is a stranger to the conspiracy are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), provided that they meet the Rule's foundational requirements[,] . . . regardless of whether the third party is a tipster, an informant, an undercover officer, or a mere acquaintance.\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Otero was originally charged in the indictment as a coconspirator along with Colón, Soto, and others. He subsequently pled guilty. <i>Cf. de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d at 996.</p>\n<p>[5]  In contrast to the testimony described earlier in this opinion, Colón did not request an instruction that the jury not consider the Romero statement for the truth of Colón's ownership of the yellow caps. The district court did not commit plain error in not giving such an instruction. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Tornabene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"408008\"><a href=\"/opinion/408008/united-states-v-joel-eric-tornabene/\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 317 (9th Cir.1982); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 105.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although the Government here appears to be speaking of a single DEA-6 report, shortly thereafter it referred to the \"6s,\" and other submissions and evidence in the record suggest that more than one DEA-6 report was created.</p>\n<p>[7]  We cannot examine the contents of the DEA-6 reports because they were not introduced at trial. <i>See </i><i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 56 (noting that a court cannot review evidence for first time on appeal).</p>\n<p>[8]  Although this outcome is dictated on the specific facts of this case, we take the opportunity to remind the Government that we do not take Jencks Act violations lightly. If the rough notes existed in the first place, it would have been much wiser for the Government to have preserved them, considering the likelihood that the notes would be requested at a later time and the possibility of sanctions for contravening the Act. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C.A. § 3500(d). As in <i>United States v. Lieberman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371190\"><a href=\"/opinion/371190/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97167-united-states-of-america-v-benjamin-lieberman/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>, 897 n. 13 (1st Cir.1979), we need not decide today whether government agents always have a Jencks Act duty to preserve rough interview notes where such notes are subsequently incorporated into a more formal report. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Melo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510502/united-states-v-melo/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21-24 (D.Mass.2006) (discussing the split in our sister circuits on this question). The Government should bear in mind that this remains an open question in our circuit, and should accordingly err on the side of caution.</p>\n\n</div>",
