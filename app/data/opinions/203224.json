Vital to our resolution\n\nof    this       appeal      is     an    understanding         of    the     controversy’s\n\nextensive            and    convoluted         procedural        history.        Our   story\n\nbegins          in    August      2003        when    Luis     Adorno-Cabán        (Adorno)\n\nfatally shot Jaime Pagán-Avilés (Pagán).                                The unfortunate\n\nincident occurred while both men were working at Pfizer’s\n\nfacility in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico.                                Pagán’s common law\n\nwife,       Emma      Fernández-Vargas               (Fernández),       and    their   minor\n\nson, C.J.P.F., survived him.                         Pagán also left behind E.P.S.\n\nand R.P.S., two minor daughters from his prior marriage to\n\nAnabel Sánchez-Valle (Sánchez).                          Pfizer is the Appellee in\n\nthis appeal.               Sánchez is the Appellant.                 Sánchez asserts the\n\ndistrict court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction from\n\nthe       outset,      (2)     improperly            dismissed    her       wrongful   death\n\ncross-claim, (3) issued a judgment that was null and void,\n\nand       (4)    erroneously             enjoined      her    from     suing     Pfizer    in\n\ncommonwealth               court.        We    exercise       jurisdiction        under    28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291, and affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n          Shortly after Pagán’s death, Fernández filed a workmen’s\n\ncompensation claim with the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund\n\n(SIF) on behalf of herself and C.J.P.F.                               See 11 P.R. Laws,\n\n§    8.      In      submitting          her    claim,       Fernández       disclosed    the\n\ndependent status not only of Pagán’s son, C.J.P.F., but also\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fof Pagán’s two daughters, E.P.S. and R.P.S.                  Sánchez did not\n\nfile a separate claim with the SIF on behalf of E.P.S. and\n\nR.P.S.       After an investigation, the SIF denied Fernández’s\n\nclaim in a terse order:\n\n       From the investigation conducted it is established\n       that the aggression occurred when [Pagán’s] co-\n       worker, in a joking manner, threatened the injured\n       party with a firearm that accidentally went off.\n       Said aggression has no bearing whatsoever with\n       the functions performed by the employee, nor with\n       the functions performed by the assailant, it does\n       not constitute an occupational risk nor a risk\n       of the work environment, and the assailant was in\n       violation of a . . . company rule, of not bearing\n       arms on the employer’s premises.\n\nIn    re    Pagán-Avilés,     No.    04-07-00733-2,      Order     (P.R.   State\n\nIns. Fund, July 22, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2007-\n\n330).      Because, according to the SIF, Pagán’s death was “not\n\nrelated to his occupation,” his death was not compensable\n\nunder Puerto Rico’s Work Accident Compensation Act (WACA).\n\nId.        Fernández did not appeal the SIF’s decision to the\n\nPuerto Rico Industrial Commission as permitted by the WACA.\n\nSee 11 P.R. Laws § 11.\n\n       Instead, in August 2004, Fernández and Sánchez commenced\n\nseparate lawsuits in Puerto Rico commonwealth court seeking\n\ndamages related to Pagán’s death.                Sánchez’s wrongful death\n\nlawsuit      named   as     plaintiffs       herself   and   her    two    minor\n\ndaughters,      as   well    as     Pagán’s    father,   aunt,     uncle,    and\n\nbrother.       Named defendants included Pfizer, Adorno, and the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fmedical personnel responsible for treating Pagán.                              Sánchez\n\ndid not join Fernández or C.J.P.F.                        See Pagán-Valentín v.\n\nPfizer Pharm., LLC, No. CDP-04-0212(403), Amended Complaint\n\n(Arecibo Sup. Pt., Oct. 27, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-\n\n2006-137).\n\n     Fernández         filed    a   lawsuit        on    behalf    of     herself    and\n\nC.J.P.F.        Fernández named, among others, Pfizer and Adorno\n\nas   defendants.            Importantly,       she       also    named    E.P.S.     and\n\nR.P.S.     as        defendants       through       their        mother,     Sánchez.\n\nAccording       to    the    complaint,        Fernández         named    E.P.S.     and\n\nR.P.S. as defendants because (1) Sánchez had not authorized\n\ntheir joinder as plaintiffs, and (2) they might be entitled\n\nto share in a recovery as Pagán’s heirs.                            See Fernández-\n\nVargas     v.     Pfizer       Pharm.,       Inc.,       No.      CDP-04-0209(404),\n\nComplaint       (Arecibo       Sup.    Pt.,     Aug.       3,     2004)    (Certified\n\nTranslation MC-2004-765).\n\n     Fernández’s complaint alleged two theories of recovery.\n\nFirst,     like       Sánchez,      Fernández           alleged     wrongful       death\n\nagainst     Pfizer       and     Adorno.           Second,        unlike     Sánchez,\n\nFernández        alleged       Pfizer        had        wrongfully        denied     her\n\ndisability        benefits.            The     latter           claim     arose     from\n\nFernández’s status as a Pfizer employee.                          Fernández alleged\n\nshe suffered emotional damages because Pfizer, instead of\n\nproviding her with disability benefits, forced her to return\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fto work after Pagán’s death.\n\n       Pfizer removed Fernández’s action to federal district\n\ncourt in November 2004.       Pfizer argued ERISA’s preemption of\n\nFernández’s employee benefits claim made the claim removable\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).            See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B);\n\nsee also Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 207-08\n\n(2004) (explaining that because ERISA completely preempted\n\na state law cause of action, a claim coming within the scope\n\nof that cause of action, even if pleaded in terms of state\n\nlaw,    was   actually   based   in    federal    law).     The   district\n\ncourt’s supplemental jurisdiction extended to Fernández’s\n\nwrongful death claim, which arose under Puerto Rico law.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c).\n\n       Once    in   federal   court,     Pfizer     moved    to    dismiss\n\nFernández’s complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\nPfizer argued ERISA preempted Fernández’s denial of benefits\n\nclaim.        Notwithstanding    the    SIF’s    prior    decision    that\n\nPagán’s death was “not related to his occupation,” Pfizer\n\nfurther argued that because Pagán’s death occurred in the\n\ncourse of his employment, Pfizer was immune from Fernández’s\n\nwrongful death claim under WACA § 21.             Section 21 provides:\n\n       When an employer insures his workmen or employees\n       in accordance with this chapter, the right herein\n       established to obtain compensation shall be the\n       only remedy against the employer, even in those\n       cases where maximum compensations and benefits have\n       been granted in accordance thereof; but in case of\n\n                                  -6-\n\f      accident to, or diseased or death of, the workmen\n      or employees not entitled to compensation under\n      this chapter, the liability of the employer is, and\n      shall continue to be, the same as if this chapter\n      did not exist.\n\n11 P.R. Laws § 21 (emphasis added).                     The district court\n\ngranted Fernández leave to file an amended complaint, while\n\nreserving       ruling   on     Pfizer’s      immunity    defense      pending\n\nsubmission of an English translation of the SIF’s decision.\n\n      Fernández filed her amended complaint in February 2005.\n\nFernández again named Pagán’s two daughters as defendants,\n\nthrough Sánchez, their mother. Fernández alleged wrongful\n\ndeath against Pfizer and Adorno.                She also alleged Pfizer\n\nhad   improperly       denied    her   disability       benefits      under    an\n\nERISA-covered plan:           “Under 29 U.S.C. § 1132 plaintiff Emma\n\nFernández is entitled to seek from Pfizer the benefits owed\n\nto her under the long term disability plan offered to her as\n\nan employee of Pfizer.”           Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm.,\n\nInc.,    Civ.    No.   04-2236    (JAF),      Amended    Complaint     (D.P.R.\n\nFebruary 22, 2005).           “[A]s a further violation of ERISA,”\n\nFernández alleged Pfizer had wrongfully refused to tender\n\nthe proceeds from Pagán’s profit-sharing and stock-option\n\nplans.    Pfizer answered by renewing its motion to dismiss\n\nFernández’s      wrongful     death    claim.        Pfizer   again   asserted\n\nemployer immunity under WACA § 21.                    Additionally, Pfizer\n\nmoved    to   dismiss    Fernández’s         ERISA    claims,   arguing       she\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffailed to exhaust the administrative remedies outlined in\n\nPfizer’s benefits plan.\n\n    Finally, in April 2005, Sánchez, on behalf of E.P.S. and\n\nR.P.S., appeared for the first time and answered Fernández’s\n\namended     complaint.           Sánchez          acknowledged          the      district\n\ncourt’s    federal      question           and     supplemental         jurisdiction.\n\nSánchez     also    filed       a     cross-claim,          on        behalf       of     her\n\ndaughters,    against        Pfizer        and    Adorno    for       wrongful       death.\n\nSánchez’s     cross-claim            set     forth       essentially           the      same\n\nallegations as those contained in the complaint she filed\n\nnine months earlier in the Puerto Rico commonwealth court.\n\n    Pfizer moved to dismiss Sánchez’s cross-claim, yet again\n\nasserting    employer         immunity           under   WACA     §    21.         Sánchez\n\nreceived    an     extension         of    time     until    June       6     to     oppose\n\nPfizer’s    motion      to    dismiss       her     cross-claim.            On     June    7,\n\nSánchez    filed    a    second       request        for    an    extension.              The\n\ndistrict court did not grant the second extension.                               Instead,\n\non June 8, the district court issued an Opinion and Order\n\naddressing    Pfizer’s         respective          motions       to    dismiss.           See\n\nFernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc., 394 F. Supp. 2d 407\n\n(D.P.R. 2005).       That same day, the district court denied as\n\nmoot Sánchez’s second motion for an extension of time to\n\nrespond to Pfizer’s motion to dismiss.\n\n    The     district         court    first       denied     Pfizer’s         motion       to\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fdismiss Fernández’s ERISA claims.                      According to the court,\n\nFernández’s allegation that Pfizer had refused to provide\n\nher benefits before she filed her lawsuit was sufficient to\n\nestablish         exhaustion        under    the     notice-pleading           standard.\n\nSee   Fed.    R.       Civ.    P.    8(a).         Second,    the     district     court\n\naddressed whether Pfizer was entitled to immunity from suit\n\nunder   WACA       §     21.        The    court     initially        considered       the\n\npreclusive effect of the SIF’s decision.                        Because Pfizer was\n\nnot a party to the SIF proceedings, the court reasoned that\n\nPfizer was not precluded from challenging the SIF’s decision\n\nand asserting immunity under the Act.                        See Fernández-Vargas,\n\n394 F. Supp. 2d at 413.\n\n      Turning to the merits, the district court concluded the\n\nSIF had interpreted the WACA too narrowly and, thus, wrongly\n\nconcluded Pagán’s death was not compensable under the Act.\n\nThe court cited numerous Puerto Rico court decisions holding\n\n“that if an accident occurs on an employer’s premises, the\n\ncausal connection required to make the injury compensable is\n\nsatisfied.”         Id. at 414 (collecting cases).                    Even assuming,\n\ncontrary      to       the     SIF’s      finding,     that     the    shooting        was\n\nintentional, the court reasoned that “where the intentional\n\naggression is unexplained or without a known motive, the\n\nbenefit      of    the    doubt      favors    the    worker,       and   it    must    be\n\nassumed      that        the     aggression          was     ‘work-related’         and,\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\ftherefore,         compensable.”              Id.     at   415    (collecting         cases).\n\nBecause      neither       Fernández          nor     Sánchez     alleged       any     motive\n\nbehind Pagán’s shooting or provided any explanation for it,\n\nthe    district       court       held      (1)     Pagán    death      was     compensable\n\nunder the WACA, and (2) Pfizer was entitled to the immunity\n\nprovided       by     §     21.         Accordingly,          the       court     dismissed\n\nFernández’s         wrongful       death          claim     and   Sánchez’s        wrongful\n\ndeath cross-claim against Pfizer. 1\n\n       As part of its dismissal order, the court scheduled a\n\nshow       cause    hearing       to    determine          “whether      cross-claimants\n\n[E.P.S. and R.P.S., through Sánchez] should remain in . . .\n\n[Fernández’s] ERISA suit and, if so, whether they [we]re\n\nappropriately             joined       as    co-defendants.”               Id.     at       416.\n\nSánchez filed a motion to reconsider the court’s dismissal\n\nof    her cross-claim. 2               Therein,        Sánchez      suggested         for    the\n\nfirst       time    that    Adorno          had   a   motive      for    shooting        Pagán\n\nrelated to an “emotional relationship,” and that discovery\n\n\n       1\n      The district court declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the wrongful death claims against Adorno\ngiven   those  claims   were   sufficiently   separate  from\nFernández’s ERISA claims. See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,\n383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966).    Accordingly, the district court\ndismissed the wrongful death claims against Adorno without\nprejudice. See Fernández-Vargas, 394 F. Supp. 2d at 415-16.\n       2\n       While the Federal Rules do not provide for a “motion\nto reconsider,” a district court has the inherent power to\nreconsider its interlocutory orders, and we encourage it to\ndo so where error is apparent.     See Warren v. American\nBankers Ins., 507 F.3d 1239, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                              -10-\n\fwas necessary to establish such motive.\n\n    With       Sánchez’s    motion       to    reconsider      pending,    Pfizer\n\nmoved    for    summary    judgment       on    Fernández’s      ERISA    claims.\n\nPfizer   again       asserted    Fernández’s         failure   to   exhaust   her\n\nadministrative remedies.           Fernández, whose counsel had been\n\npermitted       to     withdraw     on        July    6,   never     responded.\n\nConsequently, on August 22, Pfizer asked the court to deem\n\nits motion for summary judgment unopposed.                      Pfizer further\n\nmoved to dismiss Fernández’s case for failure to prosecute.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n\n    Oddly, the district court granted Sánchez an extension\n\nof time to respond to Pfizer’s motion for summary judgment\n\n– a motion that by all appearances was directed solely at\n\nFernández’s ERISA claims.           Sánchez filed a formal opposition\n\nto Pfizer’s motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2005.\n\nSánchez for the first time argued she had alleged, as part\n\nof her cross-claim, ERISA-based claims on behalf of E.P.S.\n\nand R.P.S.           Sánchez urged the court to forego ruling on\n\nPfizer’s motion and allow discovery.\n\n    On August 30, the district court granted Pfizer’s motion\n\nto dismiss Fernández’s action for failure to prosecute.                       The\n\nnext morning, the court held a show cause hearing on the\n\nlawsuit’s continued viability in light of two outstanding\n\nmatters:       (1)   Sánchez’s    motion       to    reconsider     the   court’s\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fprior dismissal of her wrongful death cross-claim against\n\nPfizer, and (2) Sánchez’s opposition to Pfizer’s motion for\n\nsummary       judgment       on    Fernández’s          ERISA      claims.        That\n\nafternoon,      the    court       entered      an   order    denying      Sánchez’s\n\nmotion    to    reconsider         without       comment.          The   court    then\n\ndismissed      the     case       in    its    entirety      and    entered      final\n\njudgment thereon:\n\n    There being no pending ERISA cause of action\n    pleaded by cross-claimants, the remaining portion\n    of this case is DISMISSED.   Any ERISA-type claims\n    by the . . . [Sánchez] claimants are not properly\n    before the court and are, if at all, premature.\n    The dismissal as to any future ERISA claims by\n    these claimants is without prejudice.\n\nFernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc., Civ. No. 04-2236\n\n(JAF), Order (D.P.R., Aug. 31, 2005).\n\n    Sanchez          filed    another         motion    to   reconsider         which,\n\nproperly construed, constituted a motion to alter or amend\n\nthe judgment.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).                   In her motion,\n\nSánchez suggested, for the first time, that the district\n\ncourt’s       judgment       was       “null”    because        Fernández’s       son,\n\nC.J.P.F., (1) had an unspecified conflict of interest with\n\nhis mother and (2) lacked legal representation at a crucial\n\nstage    of    the    proceeding.             Sánchez    asserted        the   court’s\n\nfailure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem rendered its\n\njudgment void.         Sánchez also argued that she had alleged a\n\ncause    of    action    under         ERISA,    and    summary      judgment      was\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fpremature prior to discovery.                   With Sánchez’s Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion outstanding, Pfizer moved the court for injunctive\n\nrelief      pursuant      to   the     Anti-Injunction          Act,       28    U.S.C.\n\n§   2283.       Pfizer     urged      the   court      to   enter      a    permanent\n\ninjunction       precluding           Sánchez      and      her       family          from\n\nrelitigating the issue of Pfizer’s immunity from suit in\n\ncommonwealth court.\n\n       In November 2006, the district court denied Sánchez’s\n\nRule    59(e)    motion     and      enjoined    her     and    her    family         from\n\nrelitigating the immunity issue.                    See Fernández-Vargas v.\n\nPfizer Pharm., Inc., Civ. No. 04-2236 (JAF), 2006 WL 3254463\n\n(D.P.R.,     Nov.    8,    2006)      (unpublished).            The    court      again\n\nrejected Sánchez’s argument that she had actually pled ERISA\n\nclaims against Pfizer.               The Court declined to address the\n\nneed for a guardian ad litem to represent C.J.P.F., or for\n\ndiscovery.       The court viewed these arguments as “premised on\n\nthe    [erroneous]        supposition       that    they       [Sánchez         and    her\n\ndaughters] had an ERISA cross-claim against Pfizer in the\n\nfirst instance.”          Id. at *4.\n\n       Turning to Pfizer’s motion for injunctive relief, the\n\ndistrict     court     recognized       that    Sánchez’s         wrongful        death\n\ncross-claim      against       Pfizer    was    identical       to    her    wrongful\n\ndeath    claim    pending       in    commonwealth          court.         The    court\n\nreasoned that because it had already conclusively determined\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fWACA § 21 rendered Pfizer immune from Sánchez’s wrongful\n\ndeath      cross-claim,        permitting     Sánchez         to   relitigate      the\n\nimmunity      issue      in   commonwealth      court         would    cause    Pfizer\n\nirreparable harm.             See id. at *8.         Consequently, the court\n\nissued the injunction against Sánchez and her family.                              See\n\n28   U.S.C.       §   2283.     Sánchez     appealed.           Our    jurisdiction\n\narises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.                We affirm.\n\n                                        II.\n\n      On    appeal       Sánchez    challenges        the       district       court’s\n\njudgment on four grounds.               First, Sánchez argues Pfizer’s\n\nremoval      of       Fernández’s   complaint        to       federal     court    was\n\nimproper and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the action from the outset.                     Second, she claims the\n\ncourt improperly dismissed her cross-claim against Pfizer\n\nbased on the erroneous view that WACA § 21 provided Pfizer\n\nimmunity from suit.            Third, she suggests the court’s failure\n\nto appoint Fernández’s son, C.J.P.F., a guardian ad litem\n\nrenders its judgment a nullity.                     Finally, Sánchez asserts\n\nthe court improperly enjoined her from pursuing her wrongful\n\ndeath claim against Pfizer in commonwealth court.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Sánchez’s         argument    that      the    district          court    lacked\n\nsubject     matter       jurisdiction      presents       a    legal    question    we\n\nconsider de novo.             See United Seniors Ass’n, Inc. v. Philip\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fMorris USA, 500 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2007) (reviewing de\n\nnovo the district court’s “implicit legal conclusion” that\n\nit had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint). Our\n\nresolution      of    Sánchez’s         jurisdictional           concern       need   not\n\ndetain us long.          Whether Pfizer’s removal of Fernández’s\n\noriginal commonwealth action to federal court was defective\n\nis immaterial.         Fernández amended her complaint to plainly\n\nallege    subject-matter        jurisdiction             in    the   context     of   her\n\nERISA     claims.        Once       Fernández            did     so,     any     initial\n\njurisdictional defect in removal was cured.                             See Brough v.\n\nUnited Steel Workers, 437 F.2d 748, (1st Cir. 1971)\n\n      In Brough, we plainly held that a federal claim, raised\n\nfor   the   first     time    in    an        amended     complaint,          cured   any\n\njurisdictional        defects      in    an     action        otherwise       improperly\n\nremoved     from     state   court.           Id.   at    750.         When    Fernández\n\namended     her      complaint,         the     district        court     undoubtedly\n\npossessed original federal question jurisdiction over her\n\nERISA claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental\n\njurisdiction over her wrongful death claim pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1367.\n\n      Sánchez’s cross-claim against Pfizer acknowledged both\n\nthe   court’s      original     and      supplemental           jurisdiction       under\n\n§§ 1131 and 1367, respectively.                  Courts have long recognized\n\nthat a party “cannot voluntarily invoke and then disavow\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\ffederal jurisdiction.”     New Mexico v. General Elec. Co., 467\n\nF.3d 1223, 1236 n.23 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotations\n\nomitted); accord Bernstein v. Lind-Waldock & Co., 738 F.2d\n\n179, 185-86 (7th Cir. 1984) (citing Brough).          Accordingly,\n\nwe   reject   Sánchez’s   challenge   to    the   district   court’s\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction in this case. 3\n\n                               B.\n\n     Next we consider Sánchez’s argument that Pfizer is not\n\nimmune from suit under WACA § 21.          This issue arose within\n\nthe context of Pfizer’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, and\n\nwe consider it de novo.    See Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School\n\nComm., 504 F.3d 165, 176 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Manager\n\nof the State Ins. Fund v. Flores Hermanos Cement Prod., 7\n\n\n\n     3\n        Sánchez’s argument that ERISA does not provide\nFernández a private right of action does not bear upon the\ndistrict court’s subject matter jurisdiction, but only upon\nthe question of whether Fernández stated a cause of action\nunder ERISA.    In Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm’n, 535 U.S. 635 (2002), the Supreme Court rejected the\nargument that a law’s failure to provide a private right of\naction bears upon the district court’s jurisdiction to\nentertain suit. The Court explained that, unless the claim\nis “wholly insubstantial or frivolous” or “made solely for\nthe purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,” the “absence of a\nvalid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not\nimplicate subject-matter jurisdiction.”     Id. at 642-43.\nSection 1132(a)(1)(B) of ERISA plainly provides that a plan\n“participant or beneficiary” may bring a “civil action” “to\nrecover benefits due him under the terms of the plan, to\nenforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to\nclarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the\nplan.” 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Fernández’s ERISA claims\nwere hardly “insubstantial or frivolous.”\n\n                               -16-\n\fP.R. Offic. Trans. 860, 860-62 (P.R. 1978) (characterizing\n\nan    employer’s      immunity    under    the    WACA     as    an    absolute\n\n“defense”   based      on   the   complete       absence    of    a    cause      of\n\naction); 6 Arthur Larson & Lex K. Larson, Larson’s Workers’\n\nComp. Law § 100.01[2], at 100-3 (2007) (hereinafter Larson)\n\n(describing an employer’s claim of immunity in the workers’\n\ncompensation context as an affirmative defense).\n\n      At the outset, we, like the district court, recognize\n\nthat because Pfizer was not a party to Fernández’s action\n\nbefore the SIF, the SIF’s decision that Pagán’s death was\n\nnot compensable under the WACA does not bind Pfizer.                              In\n\nNegrón v. C.I.T. Fin. Serv., 11 P.R. Offic. Trans. 828 (P.R.\n\n1981), the SIF denied benefits to the beneficiaries of the\n\ndecedent.       The    Industrial     Commission         upheld       the    SIF’s\n\ndecision and the beneficiaries took no further appeal.                           See\n\n11 P.R. Laws § 11 (providing for appeals from SIF decisions\n\nto the Industrial Commission); see also id. § 8 (providing\n\nfor   appeals   from     Industrial   Commission         decisions          to   the\n\n“courts of justice”).         Instead, they filed a wrongful death\n\nsuit against the employer in Puerto Rico commonwealth court.\n\nIn rejecting the SIF’s decision, the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt said this about the preclusive effect of that prior\n\ndecision upon the employer:\n\n      Although the Fund’s ruling denying                   compensation\n      rights is final and unappealable,                    because the\n\n                                    -17-\n\f       Commission’s upholding resolution was not appealed,\n       the employer, petitioner herein, was not a party to\n       that administrative proceeding. The Fund’s ruling\n       is res judicata between the Fund and the employee’s\n       beneficiaries,   respondents  herein.     But  that\n       administrative ruling cannot represent a bar in the\n       judicial   ambit   in   order  to   determine   its\n       correctness to the effect of the exclusiveness\n       [i.e., immunity] clause invoked by the petitioner.\n       Since it was not a party to said action, the ruling\n       is not res judicata as far as the petitioner is\n       concerned.\n\nNegron,      11     P.R.   Offic.     Trans.     at    832-33.        The    court\n\nconcluded that neither it, nor the employer, was bound “by\n\nan erred ruling of the Fund and the Commission.”                            Id. at\n\n834.     Similarly, neither we, nor Pfizer, are bound by the\n\nSIF’s decision that Pagán’s death was not compensable.\n\n       As   such,    we    assess    Pfizer’s       entitlement   to    immunity\n\nunder WACA § 21 anew.               We conclude the SIF construed the\n\nWACA’s      scope    of    coverage    too    narrowly.       López-Cotto       v.\n\nWestern Auto of Puerto Rico, Inc., No. CC-2006-248, slip op.\n\n(P.R., May 17, 2007) (Certified Translation MC-2007-380),\n\nbest illustrates our conclusion.                In that case, employees of\n\ndefendant     Western       Auto    locked    López,     a   fellow    employee,\n\ninside the men’s restroom at the store.                      López apparently\n\nhad notified management that a lock on the outside of the\n\nrestroom door attracted practical jokesters.                      As part of\n\ntheir practical joke, López’s coworkers emptied the contents\n\nof a fire extinguisher underneath the door.                    López suffered\n\n“permanent        pulmonary        damage     and     post-traumatic        stress\n\n                                       -18-\n\fdisorder.”        Id. at 2.    López sought benefits from the SIF.\n\nThe SIF labeled the incident a “work accident,” and awarded\n\nLópez compensation.\n\n      Subsequently,       López      and   his   conjugal      partner          sued\n\nWestern Auto for damages in commonwealth court.                       The trial\n\ncourt   refused     to    dismiss    the     complaint    on   the       basis    of\n\nemployer    immunity.         The     Puerto     Rico    Court      of    Appeals\n\nreversed, holding Western Auto enjoyed immunity under WACA\n\n§ 21.     López and his partner appealed to the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme    Court,    where    they    unsuccessfully       argued        that    the\n\nappellate court erred when it ruled on the employer’s lack\n\nof intent “in the abstract,” without allowing discovery or\n\npermitting an evidentiary hearing.               Id. at 7.       Importantly,\n\nthe   supreme     court    understood      the   question      of    WACA    §    21\n\nimmunity     to    turn    solely     on     whether     Western      Auto       had\n\n“intentionally” caused López’s injuries:\n\n      An examination of the facts arising from the file\n      of the case show that, at the most, the only thing\n      that may be charged on the mentioned employer,\n      regarding the incident occurred, is having been\n      negligent by not having corrected the situation of\n      the lock of the bathroom in spite of having been,\n      allegedly, advised of it prior to the occurrence of\n      the facts. In this kind of situation, ordinarily,\n      the worker does not have any cause of action\n      whatsoever against the employer.   The argument of\n      petitioners – to the effect that López Cotto was a\n      victim of an intentional act of the employer – is\n      totally unwarranted. . . . [T]he most that could be\n      charged on Western Auto is that it was negligent.\n\n      [I]n the complaint filed, the plaintiffs allege,\n\n                                      -19-\n\f    “in  the   alternative,”  that   Western   Auto  is\n    responsible for the intentional acts of López\n    Cotto’s coworkers.    They are not right. . . .\n    [W]hen the person who intentionally injures the\n    employee, is not the employer, in its personal\n    capacity or a person who is an “alter ego” of the\n    employer or corporation . . . and whether it is a\n    mere employee or supervisor, a cause of action in\n    damages against the employer for the acts committed\n    by its employees is not proper.\n\nId. at 11-12 (emphasis added).\n\n    In view of López-Cotto, we have little choice but to\n\nconclude   that    the   gunman   Adorno’s   mental       state    is   only\n\ntangentially      related   to   the   question    of    whether    Pagán’s\n\ndeath was compensable under the WACA. 4             Certainly, Sánchez\n\nhas not suggested that Adorno was the “alter ego” of Pfizer.\n\nUnder   López-Cotto’s       rationale,     Sánchez,        to     withstand\n\nPfizer’s § 21 immunity defense, must establish that Pfizer\n\n“intentionally” caused Pagán’s death.             See id. at 12.\n\n    Larson, a leading commentator on workers’ compensation\n\nlaw, explains the usual meaning of “intentional” within the\n\nworker’s   compensation      context.      His    view    is    undoubtedly\n\n\n    4\n       In 1962, the Puerto Rico Legislature amended the WACA\nto extend the benefits of “such an important social\nlegislation” to cases where a worker is intentionally and\nillegally assaulted by a coworker or other third party.\nOrtiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund, No. CE-93-471, slip op. at\n6 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation MC-2007-229).\nPrior to that time, the WACA denied compensation benefits to\nany worker suffering injury or death due to a third person’s\ncriminal act. In amending the WACA, the legislature sought\n“to adapt the local law to the modern trends in the scope of\nwork accident compensation that liberalized the restrictions\nas to what constitutes a work accident.”   Id at 5.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fconsistent with López-Cotto’s view:\n\n     [T]he common-law liability of the employer cannot,\n     under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to\n     include the accidental injuries caused by the\n     gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional,\n     reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, . . .\n     or other misconduct by the employer short of a\n     conscious and deliberate intent directed to the\n     purpose of inflicting an injury.\n\nLarson, supra § 103.03, at 103-7 - 103-8 (emphasis added)\n\n(footnotes omitted).          “Even if the alleged conduct . . .\n\nincludes such elements as . . . wilfully failing to furnish\n\na safe place to work . . . [or] failing to protect employees\n\nfrom crime, . . . the conduct still falls short of the kind\n\nof   actual   intention     to   injure    that   robs    the    injury   of\n\naccidental    character.”        Id.   §   103.03,   at   103-8    -   103-9\n\n(footnotes omitted).\n\n     Sánchez argues, as López did in López-Cotto, that we\n\nshould direct the district court to allow discovery on the\n\nintent issue.       But Sánchez’s cross-claim alleges only that\n\n“Pfizer    acted    with    intentional,     negligent     and    reckless\n\ndisregard in preventing, avoiding and/or detecting firearms\n\nwithin its premises . . . [and] failing to investigate and\n\nadequately supervise its workforce.”              Fernández-Vargas v.\n\nPfizer    Pharm.,   Inc.,    Civ.   No.    04-2236   (JAF),      Answer   to\n\nAmended Complaint (D.P.R., April 25, 2005) (emphasis added).\n\nIn other words, Sánchez alleges Pfizer failed to ensure a\n\nsafe workplace for its employees, despite having a written\n\n                                    -21-\n\fpolicy forbidding its employees from possessing firearms on\n\nthe plant’s premises.         These allegations do not amount to a\n\nclaim that Pfizer, consciously and deliberately intended to\n\ncause Pagán death.          See Larson, supra § 103.03, at 103-8 -\n\n103-9.    Perhaps like Western Auto in López-Cotto, Pfizer was\n\ncareless or indifferent to the need for a safe workplace.\n\nSuch nonfeasance, however, falls far short under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw of the intent required to deprive Pfizer of the benefits\n\nof WACA immunity.\n\n     To be sure, a worker’s assault upon a coworker may not\n\nbe compensable if based on animosity or conflict arising out\n\nof   a   “purely    private    and    personal”    matter   between     the\n\nworkers.    See Ortiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund, No. CE-93-471,\n\nslip op. at 7 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation\n\nMC-2007-229).         But     Sánchez’s     cross-claim     contains     no\n\nallegation that some private and personal conflict between\n\nthe two men motivated Adorno’s action.              The SIF found that\n\nAdorno was threatening Pagán “in a joking manner” when the\n\ngun went off.       None of the allegations in Sánchez’s cross-\n\nclaim contradict the SIF’s finding.               Sánchez’s cross-claim\n\nalleges only that Pfizer is responsible “for the negligent,\n\ncareless and reckless acts caused by the employee [Adorno].”\n\nThe cross-claim makes no reference to Adorno’s motivation.\n\n     Adorno’s      motive    for   shooting   Pagán,   if   he   had   one,\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fremains   unapparent         and     unexplained.              Given    Puerto    Rico\n\ncourts’   recognition           of     “the       doctrine       of     neutral     or\n\nunexplained     assaults,”           which     provides        WACA     coverage    in\n\ncases where “an employee is injured as a consequence of an\n\nassault   without       an    apparent         and     unexplainable       motive,”\n\nPagán’s death undoubtedly was compensable under the WACA.\n\nAnd the SIF erroneously held otherwise.                        Ortiz-Perez, slip.\n\nop. at 10-11.          Consequently, the district court properly\n\nheld that WACA § 21’s employer immunity shielded Pfizer from\n\nSánchez’s wrongful death cross-claim.\n\n                                        C.\n\n    Next, we address Sánchez’s argument that the district\n\ncourt’s failure to appoint C.J.P.F., Fernández’s minor son,\n\na guardian ad litem pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c) voids\n\nits judgment.      Among other things, Rule 17(c) provides that\n\nwhere a minor is “not otherwise represented in an action,”\n\na federal court “shall appoint a guardian ad litem . . . or\n\nshall   make    such    other      order     as   it    deems     proper    for    the\n\nprotection of the [minor].”                The decision as to whether to\n\nappoint   a    special    representative             for   a    minor    under    Rule\n\n17(c) rests within the district court’s sound discretion.\n\nAnd we will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      See Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Ctr.,\n\nInc. v. Melton, 689 F.2d 281, 285 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f       State law generally governs the capacity of one to sue\n\nas a representative of another.                   See id.     Puerto Rico law\n\ngrants parents a wide range of rights in the exercise of\n\n“patria potestas.”           These include the right to represent\n\ntheir     minor   children    in    civil       litigation.       See   Ex       Parte\n\nTorres-Ojeda, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 549, 556-57 (P.R. 1987).\n\nAbsent some conflict of interest between a parent and child,\n\nor apparent wrongdoing on behalf of the parent, that right\n\nsurely encompasses the right to decide whether to proceed\n\nwith    the   prosecution     of    a    civil    lawsuit    by   weighing         the\n\nattendant costs and benefits.                   Cf. P.R. R. Civ. Pro. 45.2\n\n(prohibiting a default judgment against a minor unless such\n\nminor is represented “by the father, mother, . . . or other\n\nsuch representative who has appeared therein”); accord Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 55(b)(2) (same).              After all, a parent is presumed\n\nto act in the best interest of her child.                         See Suboh v.\n\nDistrict Attorney’s Office, 298 F.3d 81, 92 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n       Consistent    with    this       view,    we   have   interpreted          Rule\n\n17(c), specifically the language “not otherwise represented\n\nin   an   action,”    as    “permitting          appointment      of    a    .    .   .\n\nguardian ad litem when it appears that the minor’s general\n\nrepresentative has interests which may conflict with those\n\nof the person he is supposed to represent.”                        Melton, 689\n\nF.2d at 285 (internal quotations omitted).                        Similarly, we\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fhave       interpreted        the      district      court’s     authority        to   “make\n\nsuch orders as it deems proper for the protection of the\n\n[minor]” as encompassing situations “where it is clear” the\n\ninterests of the parent and child conflict.                            Id. at 286.\n\n       The       district      court     implicitly         recognized       Fernández’s\n\nright       to    act    as      the    representative           of   her    minor      son,\n\nC.J.P.F.,         from     the    outset       of    this   action.         We    seriously\n\ndoubt       Sánchez,          having      no        natural      or   other        official\n\nrelationship to C.J.P.F., has any standing under Rule 17(c)\n\nto challenge the nature of that representation.                                  See id. at\n\n285; see also Charles Alan Wright, Arthur K. Miller & Mary\n\nKay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1570, at 503 (2d\n\ned. 1990)(explaining that a court may properly refuse to\n\nappoint a guardian under Rule 17(c) where the appointment\n\n“is sought for ulterior reasons that have nothing to do with\n\nprotecting the [minor]”).                   Notably, Sánchez never formally\n\nmoved the court to appoint C.J.P.F. a new representative.\n\nRather,          Sánchez      claimed     in        her   Rule    59(e)     motion      that\n\nFernández         and    C.J.P.F.        had    some      unspecified       conflict      of\n\ninterest requiring an appointment.                          Sánchez has provided us\n\nwith only vague, unverified assertions, and we have no idea\n\nwhat that conflict might be. 5\n\n\n       5\n         Rule 59(e) “does not allow a party to advance\narguments that could and should have been presented to the\n                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                            -25-\n\f     Our     careful   review   of    the    documents    Pfizer     filed   in\n\nsupport of its summary judgment motion on Fernández’s ERISA\n\nclaims indicate that Fernández, in all likelihood, failed to\n\nexhaust the administrative remedies contained in Pfizer’s\n\nemployee-benefit plan.          See Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc., 426\n\nF.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2005) (construing ERISA to require\n\nexhaustion of administrative remedies).                 Absent evidence or\n\na   course      of   conduct    suggesting         otherwise,   we    presume\n\nFernández saw nothing to be gained by continuing to expend\n\nresources on a case in which she and C.J.P.F. had little\n\nchance     of   prevailing.      We    see    no    conflict    inherent     in\n\nFernández’s decision not to respond to Pfizer’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, and we presume she acted in C.J.P.F.’s\n\nbest interests.        See Suboh, 298 F.3d at 92.          Thus, we reject\n\nSánchez’s challenge to the district court’s judgment based\n\n\n     5\n     (...continued)\ndistrict court prior to judgment.”         DiMarco-Zappa v.\nCabanillas, 238 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal\nquotations and ellipses omitted).     Sánchez recognizes as\nmuch by claiming, without citation to a single pertinent\nauthority, that the district court’s civil judgment is\nsimply void based on its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a\nguardian ad litem.     Of course, a void judgment may be\nvulnerable to attack at any point.      See Baella-Silva v.\nHulsey, 454 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2006) (“A void judgment is\nto be distinguished from an erroneous one, in that the\nlatter is subject only to direct attack. A void judgment is\none which, from its inception, was a complete nullity and\nwithout legal effect.”) (internal quotations and ellipses\nomitted). We view Sánchez’s claim that the district court’s\njudgment is void as nothing more than a forlorn attempt to\nforestall the entry of final judgment in this case.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fupon its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem.\n\n                                         D.\n\n    Lastly,     we    review       the     district          court’s     decision         to\n\nenjoin    Sánchez’s        commonwealth            action        under       the     Anti-\n\nInjunction    Act    for    an     abuse      of   discretion.            See       Zurich\n\nAmerican Ins. v. Superior Court, 326 F.3d 816, 824 (7th Cir.\n\n2003).      Within    this       context,          we       evaluate     the       court’s\n\nunderlying factual findings for clear error and its legal\n\ninterpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act de novo.                             Id.       For\n\nour purposes, we are concerned only with the “relitigation\n\nexception” to the Act.             The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits a\n\nfederal     court    from    “grant[ing]            an       injunction        to       stay\n\nproceedings    in    State    court       except        .    .   .   where    necessary\n\n. . . to protect or effectuate its judgments.”                                28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2283.     “The words ‘protect or effectuate’ in § 2283 are\n\ngenerally    viewed    as    incorporating              the      principles        of    res\n\njudicata and collateral estoppel, which come into play only\n\nwhen there is a final judgment or appealable order to be\n\nprotected or effectuated.”               See James v. Bellotti, 733 F.2d\n\n989, 993-94 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n    The relitigation exception provides that where a federal\n\ncourt has conclusively decided an issue, it may prevent the\n\nunsuccessful    party       from    relitigating              that    same     issue      in\n\nstate court.        Application of the exception (1) reinforces\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fthe    preclusive      effect     of     federal       court     judgments,      (2)\n\nensures the finality of federal court decisions, and (3)\n\nprevents       harassment        through        repetitive         state       court\n\nproceedings of those litigants prevailing in federal court.\n\nThe    relitigation          exception        applies     where,       because       of\n\npreclusion principals, the state court should not hear a\n\ncase but still may do so.                See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal\n\nJurisdiction § 11.2, at 751-52 (5th ed. 2007).\n\n       Certainly, a federal court should not lightly undertake\n\nthe    task    of     deciding       whether      to     enjoin       state    court\n\nproceedings.        That injunctive relief may issue does not mean\n\nit must issue.        See SMA Life Assurance Co. v. Sanchez-Pica,\n\n960    F.2d   274,     276    (1st     Cir.    1992).     The    court       needs    a\n\n“substantial        justification”       for     issuing       such    injunction.\n\nId. at 277.         And the general prerequisites for injunctive\n\nrelief must usually be met.                   See James, 733 F.2d at 993.\n\nBased on concerns of comity and federalism, a federal court\n\nmust    ask   whether    requiring       the     moving       party    to    raise    a\n\npreclusion defense in state court would be the wiser course.\n\nAt the same time, the court must remain mindful that the\n\nstate court’s rejection of a preclusion defense effectively\n\nproscribes      a     federal    court        from     issuing     a    subsequent\n\ninjunction to effectuate its judgment.                        See Parsons Steel,\n\nInc.    v.    First    Alabama       Bank,     474     U.S.    518,    524    (1986)\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\f(holding the relitigation exception was limited “to those\n\nsituations in which the state court has not yet ruled on the\n\nmerits of the res judicata issue”).\n\n       With these precepts in mind, we decline to disturb the\n\ndistrict       court’s      injunction    in   this    case   because    it   is\n\nsubstantially justified. 6           Puerto Rico’s employer immunity\n\ndefense “is of an absolute character which creates a legal\n\nimmunity in favor of an insured employer against any other\n\naction: in other words there is no cause of action.”                     Flores\n\nHermanos Cement Prod. 7 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 861-62.                      As a\n\ndefense from suit rather than a defense from liability, the\n\nimmunity provided by WACA is effectively lost if a case is\n\nallowed to proceed against the very employer it is designed\n\nto shield.          See Lowinger v. Broderick, 50 F.3d 61, 64 (1st\n\nCir.       1995).    Allowing    wrongful      death   proceedings      against\n\nPfizer to continue in Puerto Rico commonwealth court would\n\nwrongly require Pfizer to answer a claim that the law does\n\nnot recognize.           As such, the district court did not abuse\n\nits    discretion      in    concluding   that    such   proceedings      would\n\n\n\n       6\n       That the district court’s injunction enjoined Sánchez\nand her family, rather than the commonwealth court, is\nimmaterial. An injunction issued against a party under the\nAnti-Injunction Act is the same as an injunction issued\nagainst a court.    See In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d 1467,\n1478 n.9 (1st Cir. 1991), abrogated in part on other\ngrounds, Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249\n(1992).\n\n                                     -29-\n\fconstitute irreparable harm to Pfizer. 7            See Metro-Goldwyn\n\nMayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prod., Inc., 183 F.3d 10, 15 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (listing the factors to be considered before\n\nissuing injunctive relief). Moreover, the injunction does\n\nnot harm the public interest, but rather serves “the public\n\npolicy of the Commonwealth [of Puerto Rico] . . . favoring\n\nthe unique liability enacted by the [WACA].”             López-Cotto,\n\nslip op. at 8.\n\n    For   all   the   foregoing    reasons,   the    judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    7\n      We are not unsympathetic to the loss E.P.S. and R.P.S.\nhave suffered as a result of their father’s death. Sánchez,\nhowever, failed to fully protect her daughters’ interests\nwhen she failed to pursue, to the fullest extent, available\nadministrative remedies under the WACA. While Sánchez never\nfiled a claim with the SIF, the record reflects the SIF\nmailed notice to Sánchez at her last known address informing\nher and her daughters of the SIF’s decision to deny\ncompensation to Pagán’s beneficiaries.     Recall that when\nFernández filed her compensation claim she properly informed\nthe SIF that both E.P.S. and R.P.S. were the dependent\ndaughters of the decedent. The notice of the SIF’s decision\nmailed to Sánchez plainly explained her daughters’ right to\nappeal the SIF’s unfavorable decision.     Once the current\nlitigation was underway, Sánchez, or perhaps more accurately\nher counsel, continued to exhibit the indifference which\nbrings us to this point.    A belated answer to Fernández’s\ncomplaint, a failure to timely file responses to Pfizer’s\nmotions, and a penchant for raising arguments for the first\ntime in motions to reconsider emphasize this point.\n\n                                  -30-\n\f",

Our story begins in August 2003 when Luis Adorno-Cabán (Adorno) fatally shot Jaime Pagán-Avilés (Pagán). The unfortunate incident occurred while both men were working at Pfizer's facility in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. Pagán's common law wife, Emma Fernández-Vargas (Fernández), and their minor son, C.J.P.F., survived him. Pagán also left behind E.P.S. and R.P.S., two minor daughters from his prior marriage to Anabel Sánchez-Valle (Sánchez). Pfizer is the Appellee in this appeal. Sánchez is the Appellant. Sánchez asserts the district court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction from the outset, (2) improperly dismissed her wrongful death cross-claim, (3) issued a judgment that was null and void, and (4) erroneously enjoined her from suing Pfizer in commonwealth court. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Shortly after Pagán's death, Fernández filed a workmen's compensation claim with the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund (SIF) on behalf of herself and C.J.P.F. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws, § 8. In submitting her claim, Fernández disclosed the dependent status not only of Pagán's son, C.J.P.F., but also of Pagán's two daughters, E.P.S. and R.P.S. Sánchez did not file a separate claim with the SIF on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S. After an investigation, the SIF denied Fernández's claim in a terse order:</p>\n<blockquote>From the investigation conducted it is established that the aggression occurred when [Pagán's] co-worker, in a joking manner, threatened the injured party with a firearm that accidentally went off. Said aggression has no bearing whatsoever with the functions performed by the employee, nor with the functions performed by the assailant, it does not constitute an occupational risk nor a risk of the work environment, and the assailant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> was in violation of a . . . company rule, of not bearing arms on the employer's premises.</blockquote>\n<p><i>In re Pagán,</i> No. 04-07-00733-2, Order (P.R. State Ins. Fund, July 22, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2007-330). Because, according to the SIF, Pagán's death was \"not related to his occupation,\" his death was not compensable under Puerto Rico's Work Accident Compensation Act (WACA). <i>Id.</i> Fernández did not appeal the SIF's decision to the Puerto Rico Industrial Commission as permitted by the WACA. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws § 11.</p>\n<p>Instead, in August 2004, Fernández and Sánchez commenced separate lawsuits in Puerto Rico commonwealth court seeking damages related to Pagán's death. Sánchez's wrongful death lawsuit named as plaintiffs herself and her two minor daughters, as well as Pagán's father, aunt, uncle, and brother. Named defendants included Pfizer, Adorno, and the medical personnel responsible for treating Pagán. Sánchez did not join Fernández or C.J.P.F. <i>See Pagán-Valentín v. Pfizer Pharm., LLC,</i> No. CDP-04-0212(403), Amended Complaint. (Arecibo Sup. Pt., Oct. 27, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2006-137).</p>\n<p>Fernández filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and C.J.P.F. Fernández named, among others, Pfizer and Adorno as defendants. Importantly, she also named E.P.S. and R.P.S. as defendants through their mother, Sánchez. According to the complaint, Fernández named E.P.S. and R.P.S. as defendants because (1) Sánchez had not authorized their joinder as plaintiffs, and (2) they might be entitled to share in a recovery as Pagán's heirs. <i>See Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> No. CDP-04-0209(404), Complaint (Arecibo Sup. Pt., Aug. 3, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2004-765).</p>\n<p>Fernández's complaint alleged two theories of recovery. First, like Sánchez, Fernández alleged wrongful death against Pfizer and Adorno. Second, unlike Sánchez, Fernández alleged Pfizer had wrongfully denied her disability benefits. The latter claim arose from Fernández's status as a Pfizer employee. Fernández alleged she suffered emotional damages because Pfizer, instead of providing her with disability benefits, forced her to return to work after Pagán's death.</p>\n<p>Pfizer removed Fernández's action to federal district court in November 2004. Pfizer argued ERISA's preemption of Fernández's employee benefits claim made the claim removable under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,</i> 542 U.S. 200, 207-08, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004) (explaining that because ERISA completely preempted a state law cause of action, a claim coming within the scope of that cause of action, even if pleaded in terms of state law, was actually based in federal law). The district court's supplemental jurisdiction extended to Fernández's wrongful death claim, which arose under Puerto Rico law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c).</p>\n<p>Once in federal court, Pfizer moved to dismiss Fernández's complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Pfizer argued ERISA preempted Fernández's denial of benefits claim. Notwithstanding the SIF's prior decision that Pagán's death was \"not related to his occupation,\" Pfizer further argued that because Pagán's death occurred in the course of his employment, Pfizer was immune from Fernández's wrongful death claim under WACA § 21. Section 21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>When an employer insures his workmen or employees in accordance with this chapter, <i>the right herein established to obtain compensation shall be the only remedy against the employer,</i> even in those cases where maximum compensations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> and benefits have been granted in accordance thereof; but in case of accident to, or diseased or death of, the workmen or employees not entitled to compensation under this chapter, the liability of the employer is, and shall continue to be, the same as if this chapter did not exist.</blockquote>\n<p>11 P.R. Laws § 21 (emphasis added). The district court granted Fernández leave to file an amended complaint, while reserving ruling on Pfizer's immunity defense pending submission of an English translation of the SIF's decision.</p>\n<p>Fernández filed her amended complaint in February 2005. Fernández again named Pagán's two daughters as defendants, through Sánchez, their mother. Fernández alleged wrongful death against Pfizer and Adorno. She also alleged Pfizer had improperly denied her disability benefits under an ERISA-covered plan: \"Under 29 U.S.C. § 1132 plaintiff Emma Fernández is entitled to seek from Pfizer the benefits owed to her under the long term disability plan offered to her as an employee of Pfizer.\" <i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Amended Complaint (D.P.R. February 22, 2005). \"[A]s a further violation of ERISA,\" Fernández alleged Pfizer had wrongfully refused to tender the proceeds from Pagán's profit-sharing and stock-option plans. Pfizer answered by renewing its motion to dismiss Fernández's wrongful death claim. Pfizer again asserted employer immunity under WACA § 21. Additionally, Pfizer moved to dismiss Fernández's ERISA claims, arguing she failed to exhaust the administrative remedies outlined in Pfizer's benefits plan.</p>\n<p>Finally, in April 2005, Sánchez, on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S., appeared for the first time and answered Fernández's amended complaint. Sánchez acknowledged the district court's federal question and supplemental jurisdiction. Sánchez also filed a cross-claim, on behalf of her daughters, against Pfizer and Adorno for wrongful death. Sánchez's cross-claim set forth essentially the same allegations as those contained in the complaint she filed nine months earlier in the Puerto Rico commonwealth court.</p>\n<p>Pfizer moved to dismiss Sánchez's cross-claim, yet again asserting employer immunity under WACA § 21. Sánchez received an extension of time until June 6 to oppose Pfizer's motion to dismiss her cross-claim. On June 7, Sánchez filed a second request for an extension. The district court did not grant the second extension. Instead, on June 8, the district court issued an Opinion and Order addressing Pfizer's respective motions to dismiss. <i>See </i><i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> 394 F.Supp.2d 407 (D.P.R.2005). That same day, the district court denied as moot Sánchez's second motion for an extension of time to respond to Pfizer's motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>The district court first denied Pfizer's motion to dismiss Fernández's ERISA claims. According to the court, Fernández's allegation that Pfizer had refused to provide her benefits before she filed her lawsuit was sufficient to establish exhaustion under the notice-pleading standard. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). Second, the district court addressed whether Pfizer was entitled to immunity from, suit under WACA § 21. The court initially considered the preclusive effect of the SIF's decision. Because Pfizer was not a party to the SIF proceedings, the court reasoned that Pfizer was not precluded from challenging the SIF's decision and asserting immunity under the Act. <i>See Fernánkez-Vargas,</i> 394 F.Supp.2d at 413.</p>\n<p>Turning to the merits, the district court concluded the SIF had interpreted the WACA too narrowly and, thus, wrongly concluded Pagán's death was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> compensable under the Act. The court cited numerous Puerto Rico court decisions holding \"that if an accident occurs on an employer's premises, the causal connection required to make the injury compensable is satisfied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 414 (collecting cases). Even assuming, contrary to the SIF's finding, that the shooting was intentional, the court reasoned that \"where the intentional aggression is unexplained or without a known motive, the benefit of the doubt favors the worker, and it must be assumed that the aggression was `work-related' and, therefore, compensable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415 (collecting cases). Because neither Fernández nor Sánchez alleged any motive behind Pagán's shooting or provided any explanation for it, the district court held (1) Pagán death was compensable under the WACA, and (2) Pfizer was entitled to the immunity provided by § 21. Accordingly, the court dismissed Fernández's wrongful death claim and Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>As part of its dismissal order, the court scheduled a show cause hearing to determine \"whether cross-claimants [E.P.S. and R.P.S., through Sánchez] should remain in . . . [Fernández's] ERISA suit and, if so, whether they [we]re appropriately joined as co-defendants.\" <i>Id.</i> at 416. Sánchez filed a motion to reconsider the court's dismissal of her cross-claim.<sup>[2]</sup> Therein, Sánchez suggested for the first time that Adorno had a motive for shooting Pagan related to an \"emotional relationship,\" and that discovery was necessary to establish such motive.</p>\n<p>With Sánchez's motion to reconsider pending, Pfizer moved for summary judgment on Fernández's ERISA claims. Pfizer again asserted Fernández's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. Fernández, whose counsel had been permitted to withdraw on July 6, never responded. Consequently, on August 22, Pfizer asked the court to deem its motion for summary judgment unopposed. Pfizer further moved to dismiss Fernández's case for failure to prosecute. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n<p>Oddly, the district court granted Sánchez an extension of time to respond to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment  a motion that by all appearances was directed solely at Fernández's ERISA claims. Sánchez filed a formal opposition to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2005. Sánchez for the first time argued she had alleged, as part of her cross-claim, ERISA-based claims on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S. Sánchez urged the court to forego ruling on Pfizer's motion and allow discovery.</p>\n<p>On August 30, the district court granted Pfizer's motion to dismiss Fernández's action for failure to prosecute. The next morning, the court held a show cause hearing on the lawsuit's continued viability in light of two outstanding matters: (1) Sánchez's motion to reconsider the court's prior <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> dismissal of her wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer, and (2) Sánchez's opposition to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment on Fernández's ERISA claims. That afternoon, the court entered an order denying Sánchez's motion to reconsider without comment. The court then dismissed the case in its entirety and entered final judgment thereon:</p>\n<blockquote>There being no pending ERISA cause of action pleaded by cross-claimants, the remaining portion of this case is DISMISSED. Any ERISA-type claims by the . . . [Sánchez] claimants are not properly before the court and are, if at all, premature. The dismissal as to any future ERISA claims by these claimants is without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Order (D.P.R., Aug. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p>Sánchez filed another motion to reconsider which, properly construed, constituted a motion to alter or amend the judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). In her motion, Sánchez suggested, for the first time, that the district court's judgment was \"null\" because Fernández's son, C.J.P.F., (1) had an unspecified conflict of interest with his mother and (2) lacked legal representation at a crucial stage of the proceeding. Sánchez asserted the court's failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem rendered its judgment void. Sánchez also argued that she had alleged a cause of action under ERISA, and summary judgment was premature prior to discovery. With Sánchez's Rule 59(e) motion outstanding, Pfizer moved the court for injunctive relief pursuant to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283. Pfizer urged the court to enter a permanent injunction precluding Sánchez and her family from relitigating the issue of Pfizer's immunity from suit in commonwealth court.</p>\n<p>In November 2006, the district court denied Sánchez's Rule 59(e) motion and enjoined her and her family from relitigating the immunity issue. <i>See Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), 2006 WL 3254463 (D.P.R., Nov.8, 2006) (unpublished). The court again rejected Sánchez's argument that she had actually pled ERISA claims against Pfizer. The Court declined to address the need for a guardian ad litem to represent C.J.P.F., or for discovery. The court viewed these arguments as \"premised on the [erroneous] supposition that they [Sánchez and her daughters] had an ERISA cross-claim against Pfizer in the first instance.\" <i>Id.</i> at *4.</p>\n<p>Turning to Pfizer's motion for injunctive relief, the district court recognized that Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer was identical to her wrongful death claim pending in commonwealth court. The court reasoned that because it had already conclusively determined WACA § 21 rendered Pfizer immune from Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim, permitting Sánchez to relitigate the immunity issue in commonwealth court would cause Pfizer irreparable harm. <i>See id.</i> at *8. Consequently, the court issued the injunction against Sánchez and her family. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2283. Sánchez appealed. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal Sánchez challenges the district court's judgment on four grounds. First, Sánchez argues Pfizer's removal of Fernández's complaint to federal court was improper and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action from the outset. Second, she claims the court, improperly dismissed her cross-claim against Pfizer based on the erroneous view that WACA § 21 provided Pfizer immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> from suit. Third, she suggests the court's failure to appoint Fernández's son, C.J.P.F., a guardian ad litem renders its judgment a nullity. Finally, Sánchez asserts the court improperly enjoined her from pursuing her wrongful death claim against Pfizer in commonwealth court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Sánchez's argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction presents a legal question we consider de novo. <i>See </i><i>United Seniors Ass'n, Inc. v. Philip Morris USA</i> 500 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (reviewing de novo the district court's \"implicit legal conclusion\" that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint). Our resolution of Sánchez's jurisdictional concern need not detain us long. Whether Pfizer's removal of Fernández's original commonwealth action to federal court was defective is immaterial. Fernández amended her complaint to plainly allege subject-matter jurisdiction in the context of her ERISA claims. Once Fernández did so, any initial jurisdictional defect in removal was cured. <i>See </i><i>Brough v. United Steelworkers,</i> 437 F.2d 748 (1st Cir.1971)</p>\n<p>In <i>Brough,</i> we plainly held that a federal claim, raised for the first time in an amended complaint, cured any jurisdictional defects in an action otherwise improperly removed from state court. <i>Id.</i> at 750. When Fernández amended her complaint, the district court undoubtedly possessed original federal question jurisdiction over her ERISA claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over her wrongful death claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.</p>\n<p>Sánchez's cross-claim against Pfizer acknowledged both the court's original and supplemental jurisdiction under §§ 1331 and 1367, respectively. Courts have long recognized that a party \"cannot voluntarily invoke and then disavow federal jurisdiction.\" <i>New Mexico v. General Elec. Co.,</i> 467 F.3d 1223, 1236 n. 23 (10th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Bernstein v. Lind-Waldock &amp; Co.,</i> 738 F.2d 179, 185-86 (7th Cir.1984) (citing <i>Brough</i>). Accordingly, we reject Sánchez's challenge to the district court's subject matter jurisdiction in this case.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Next we consider Sánchez's argument that Pfizer is not immune from suit under WACA § 21. This issue arose within the context of Pfizer's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, and we consider it de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm.,</i> 504 F.3d 165, 176 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also Manager of the State Ins. Fund v. Flores Hermanos Cement Prod.,</i> 7 P.R. Offic. Trans. 860, 860-62, 107 D.P.R. 789 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> (P.R.1978) (characterizing an employer's immunity under the WACA as an absolute \"defense\" based on the complete absence of a cause of action); 6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <i>Larson's Workers' Comp. Law</i> § 100.01[2], at 100-3 (2007) (hereinafter Larson) (describing an employer's claim of immunity in the workers' compensation context as an affirmative defense).</p>\n<p>At the outset, we, like the district court, recognize that because Pfizer was not a party to Fernández's action before the SIF, the SIF's decision that Pagán's death' was not compensable under the WACA does not bind Pfizer. In <i>Negrón v. C.I.T. Fin. Serv.,</i> 11 P.R. Offic. Trans. 828, 111 D.P.R. 657 (P.R.1981), the SIF denied benefits to the beneficiaries of the decedent. The Industrial Commission upheld the SIF's decision and the beneficiaries took no further appeal. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws § 11 (providing for appeals from SIF decisions to the Industrial Commission); <i>see also id.</i> § 8 (providing for appeals from Industrial Commission decisions to the \"courts of justice\"). Instead, they filed a wrongful death suit against the employer in Puerto Rico commonwealth court. In rejecting the SIF's decision, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said this about the preclusive effect of that prior decision upon the employer:</p>\n<blockquote>Although the Fund's ruling denying compensation rights is final and unappealable, because the Commission's upholding resolution was not appealed, the employer, petitioner herein, was not a party to that administrative proceeding. The Fund's ruling is res judicata between the Fund and the employee's beneficiaries, respondents herein. But that administrative ruling cannot represent a bar in the judicial ambit in order to determine its correctness to the effect of the exclusiveness [<i>i.e.,</i> immunity] clause invoked by the petitioner. Since it was not a party to said action, the ruling is not res judicata as far as the petitioner is concerned.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Negron,</i> 11 P.R. Offic. Trans, at 832-33. The court concluded that neither it, nor the employer, was bound \"by an erred ruling of the Fund and the Commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 834. Similarly, neither we, nor Pfizer, are bound by the SIF's decision that Pagán's death was not compensable.</p>\n<p>As such, we assess Pfizer's entitlement to immunity under WACA § 21 anew. We conclude the SIF construed the WACA's scope of coverage too narrowly.. <i>López Cotto v. Western Auto of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> No. CC-2006-248, slip op., 2007 WL 1630930 (P.R., May 17, 2007) (Certified Translation MC-2007-380), best illustrates our conclusion. In that case, employees of defendant Western Auto locked López, a fellow employee, inside the men's restroom at the store. López apparently had notified management that a lock on the outside of the restroom door attracted practical jokesters. As part of their practical joke, López's coworkers emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher underneath the door. López suffered \"permanent pulmonary damage and post-traumatic stress disorder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2. López sought benefits from the SIF. The SIF labeled the incident a \"work accident,\" and awarded López compensation.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, López and his conjugal partner sued Western Auto for damages in commonwealth court. The trial court refused to dismiss the complaint on the basis of employer immunity. The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals reversed, holding Western Auto enjoyed immunity under WACA § 21. López and his partner appealed to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, where they unsuccessfully argued that the appellate court erred when it ruled on the employer's lack of intent \"in the abstract,\" without allowing discovery or permitting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> an evidentiary hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 7. Importantly, the supreme court understood, the question of WACA § 21 immunity to turn solely on whether Western Auto had \"intentionally\" caused López's injuries:</p>\n<blockquote>An examination of the facts arising from the file of the case, show that, at the most, the only thing that may be charged on the mentioned employer, regarding the incident occurred, is having been negligent by not having corrected the situation of the lock of the bathroom in spite of having been, allegedly, advised of it prior to the occurrence of the facts. In this kind of situation, ordinarily, the worker does <i>not</i> have any cause of action whatsoever against the employer. The argument of petitioners  to the effect that López Cotto was a victim of an intentional act of the employer  is totally unwarranted. . . . [T]he most that could be charged on Western Auto is that it was negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[I]n the complaint filed, the plaintiffs allege, \"in the alternative,\" that Western Auto is responsible for the intentional acts of López Cotto's coworkers. They are not right. . . . <i>[W]hen the person who intentionally injures the employee, is not the employer,</i> in its personal capacity or a person who is an \"alter ego\" of the employer or corporation . . . and whether it is a mere employee or supervisor, <i>a cause of action in damages against the employer for the acts committed by its employees is not proper.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 11-12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In view of <i>López Cotto,</i> we have little choice but to conclude that the gunman Adorno's mental state is only tangentially related to the question of whether Pagán's death was compensable under the WACA.<sup>[4]</sup> Certainly, Sánchez has not suggested that Adorno was the \"alter ego\" of Pfizer. Under <i>López Cotto's</i> rationale, Sánchez, to withstand Pfizer's § 21 immunity defense, must establish that Pfizer \"intentionally\" caused Pagán's death. <i>See id.</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>Larson, a leading commentator on workers' compensation law, explains the usual meaning of \"intentional\" within the worker's compensation context. His view is undoubtedly consistent with <i>López-Cotto's</i> view:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he common-law liability of the employer cannot, under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to include the accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, . . . or other misconduct by the employer <i>short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the purpose of inflicting an injury.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Larson, <i>supra</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). \"Even if the alleged conduct . . . includes such elements as . . . wilfully failing to furnish a safe place to work . . . [or] failing to protect employees from crime, . . . the conduct still falls short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character.\" <i>Id.</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Sánchez argues, as López did in <i>López Cotto,</i> that we should direct the district court to allow discovery on the intent issue. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> But Sánchez's cross-claim alleges only that \"Pfizer acted with intentional, negligent and reckless disregard in <i>preventing, avoiding and/or detecting firearms within its premises . . . [and] failing to investigate and adequately supervise its workforce.\" Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Answer to Amended Complaint (D.P.R., April 25, 2005) (emphasis added). In other words, Sánchez alleges Pfizer failed to ensure a safe workplace for its employees, despite having a written policy forbidding its employees from possessing firearms on the plant's premises. These allegations do not amount to a claim that Pfizer, <i>consciously and deliberately intended</i> to cause Pagan death. See Larson, <i>supra</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X. Perhaps like Western Auto in <i>López Cotto,</i> Pfizer was careless or indifferent to the need for a safe workplace. Such nonfeasance, however, falls far short under Puerto Rico law of the intent required to deprive Pfizer of the benefits of WACA immunity.</p>\n<p>To be sure, a worker's assault upon a coworker may not be compensable if based on animosity or conflict arising out of a \"purely private and personal\" matter between the workers. See <i>Ortiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund,</i> No. CE-93-171, slip op. at 7 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation MC-2007-229). But Sánchez's cross-claim contains no allegation that some private and personal conflict between the two men motivated Adorno's action. The SIF found that Adorno was threatening Pagán \"in a joking manner\" when the gun went off. None of the allegations in Sánchez's cross-claim contradict the SIF's finding. Sánchez's cross-claim alleges only, that Pfizer is responsible \"for the negligent, careless and reckless acts caused by the employee [Adorno].\" The cross-claim makes no reference to Adorno's motivation.</p>\n<p>Adorno's motive for shooting Pagán, if he had one, remains unapparent and unexplained. Given Puerto Rico courts' recognition of \"the doctrine of neutral or unexplained assaults,\" which provides WACA coverage in cases where \"an employee is injured as a consequence of an assault without an apparent and unexplainable motive,\" Pagán's death undoubtedly was compensable under the WACA. And the SIF erroneously held otherwise. <i>Ortiz-Perez,</i> slip. op. at 10-11. Consequently, the district court properly held that WACA § 21's employer immunity shielded Pfizer from Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Next, we address Sánchez's argument that the district court's failure to appoint C.J.P.F., Fernández's minor son, a guardian ad litem pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 17(c) voids its judgment. Among other things, Rule 17(c) provides that where a minor is \"not otherwise represented in an action,\" a federal court \"shall appoint a guardian ad litem . . . or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the [minor].\" The decision as to whether to appoint a special representative for a minor under Rule 17(c) rests within the district court's sound discretion. And we will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Ctr., Inc. v. Melton,</i> 689 F.2d 281, 285 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>State law generally governs the capacity of one to sue as a representative of another. <i>See id.</i> Puerto Rico law grants parents a wide range of rights in the exercise of <i>\"patria potestas.\"</i> These include the right to represent their minor children in civil litigation. <i>See Ex Parte Torres-Ojeda,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 549, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> 556-57 (P.R.1987). Absent some conflict of interest between a parent and child; or apparent wrongdoing on behalf of the parent, that right surely encompasses the right to decide whether to proceed with the prosecution of a civil lawsuit by weighing the attendant costs and benefits. <i>Cf.</i> P.R.R. Civ. Pro. 45.2 (prohibiting a default judgment against a minor <i>unless</i> such minor is represented \"by the father, mother, . . . or other such representative who has appeared therein\"); <i>accord</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2) (same). After all, a parent is presumed to act in the best interest of her child. <i>See </i><i>Suboh v. District Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 92 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Consistent with this view, we have interpreted Rule 17(c), specifically the language \"not otherwise represented in an action,\" as \"permitting appointment of a . . . guardian ad litem when it appears that the minor's general representative has interests which may conflict with those of the person he is supposed to represent.\" <i>Melton,</i> 689 F.2d at 285 (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, we have interpreted the district court's authority to \"make such orders as it deems proper for the protection of the [minor]\" as encompassing situations \"where it is clear\" the interests of the parent and child conflict. <i>Id.</i> at 286.</p>\n<p>The district court implicitly recognized Fernández's right to act as the representative of her minor son, C.J.P.F., from the outset of this action. We seriously doubt Sánchez, having no natural or other official relationship to C.J.P.F., has any standing under Rule 17(c) to challenge the nature of that representation. <i>See id.</i> at 285; <i>see also</i> 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur K. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1570, at 503 (2d ed.1990)(explaining that a court may properly refuse to appoint a guardian under Rule 17(c) where the appointment \"is sought for ulterior reasons that have nothing to do with protecting the [minor]\"). Notably, Sánchez never formally moved the court to appoint C.J.P.F. a new representative. Rather, Sánchez claimed in her Rule 59(e) motion that Fernández and C.J.P.F. had some unspecified conflict of interest requiring an appointment. Sánchez has provided us with only vague, unverified assertions, and we have no idea what that conflict might be.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Our careful review of the documents Pfizer filed in support of its summary judgment motion on Fernández's ERISA claims indicate that Fernández, in all likelihood, failed to exhaust the administrative remedies contained in Pfizer's employee-benefit plan. <i>See </i><i>Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc.,</i> 426 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.2005) (construing ERISA to require exhaustion of administrative remedies). Absent evidence or a course of conduct suggesting otherwise, we presume Fernández saw nothing to be gained by continuing to expend resources on a case in which she and C.J.P.F. had little chance of prevailing. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> We see no conflict inherent in Fernández's decision not to respond to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment, and we presume she acted in C.J.P.F.'s best interests. <i>See </i><i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92. Thus, we reject Sánchez's challenge to the district court's judgment based upon its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D.</h2>\n<p>Lastly, we review the district court's decision to enjoin Sánchez's commonwealth action under the Anti-Injunction Act for an abuse of discretion. See <i>Zurich American Ins. v. Superior Court,</i> 326 F.3d 816, 824 (7th Cir.2003). Within this context, we evaluate the court's underlying factual findings for clear error and its legal interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act de novo. <i>Id.</i> For our purposes, we are concerned only with the \"relitigation exception\" to the Act. The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits a federal court from \"granting] an injunction to stay proceedings in State court except . . . where necessary . . . to protect or effectuate its judgments.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2283. \"The words `protect or effectuate' in § 2283 are generally viewed as incorporating the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, which come into play only when there is a final judgment or appealable order to be protected or effectuated.\" <i>See </i><i>James v. Bellotti,</i> 733 F.2d 989, 993-94 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p>The relitigation exception provides that where a federal court has conclusively decided an issue, it <i>may</i> prevent the unsuccessful party from relitigating that same issue in state court., Application of the exception (1) reinforces the preclusive effect of federal court judgments, (2) ensures the finality of federal court decisions, and (3) prevents harassment through repetitive state court proceedings of those litigants prevailing in federal court. The relitigation exception applies where, because of preclusion principals, the state court should not hear a case but still may do so. <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> § 11.2, at 751-52 (5th ed.2007).</p>\n<p>Certainly, a federal court should not lightly undertake the task of deciding whether to enjoin state court proceedings. That injunctive relief may issue does not mean it must issue. <i>See </i><i>SMA Life Assurance Co. v. Sanchez-Pica,</i> 960 F.2d 274, 276 (1st Cir.1992). The court needs a \"substantial justification\" for issuing such injunction. <i>Id.</i> at 277. And the general prerequisites for injunctive relief must usually be met. <i>See </i><i>James,</i> 733 F.2d at 993. Based on concerns of comity and federalism, a federal court must ask whether requiring the moving party to raise a preclusion defense in state court would be the wiser course. At the same time, the court must remain mindful that the state court's rejection of a preclusion defense effectively proscribes a federal court from issuing a subsequent injunction to effectuate its judgment. <i>See </i><i>Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank,</i> 474 U.S. 518, 524, 106 S.Ct. 768, 88 L.Ed.2d 877 (1986) (holding the relitigation exception was limited \"to those situations in which the state court has not yet ruled on the merits of the res judicata issue\").</p>\n<p>With these precepts in mind, we decline to disturb the district court's injunction in this case because it is substantially justified.<sup>[6]</sup> Puerto Rico's employer immunity defense \"is of an absolute character which creates a legal immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> in favor of an insured employer against any other action: in other words there is no cause of action.\" <i>Flares Hermanos Cement Prod.</i> 7 P.R. Offic. Trans, at 861-62. As a defense from suit rather than a defense from liability, the immunity provided by WACA is effectively lost if a case is allowed to proceed against the very employer it is designed to shield. <i>See </i><i>Lowinger v. Broderick,</i> 50 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir.1995). Allowing wrongful death proceedings against Pfizer to continue in Puerto Rico commonwealth court would wrongly require Pfizer to answer a claim that the law does not recognize. As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such proceedings would constitute irreparable harm to Pfizer.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prod., Inc.,</i> 183 F.3d 10, 15 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (listing the factors to be considered before issuing injunctive relief). Moreover, the injunction does not harm the public interest, but rather serves \"the public policy of the Commonwealth [of Puerto Rico] . . . favoring the unique liability enacted by the [WACA].\" <i>López Cotto,</i> slip op. at 8.</p>\n<p>For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wrongful death claims against Adorno given those claims were sufficiently separate from Fernández's ERISA claims. <i>See </i><i>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Accordingly, the district court dismissed the wrongful death claims against Adorno without prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Fernández-Vargas,</i> 394 F.Supp.2d at 415-16.</p>\n<p>[2]  While the Federal Rules do not provide for a \"motion to reconsider,\" a district court has the inherent power to reconsider its interlocutory orders, and we encourage it to do so where error is apparent. <i>See </i><i>Warren v. American Bankers Ins.,</i> 507 F.3d 1239, 1243 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[3]  Sánchez's argument that ERISA does not provide Fernández a private right of action does not bear upon the district court's subject matter jurisdiction, but only upon the question of whether Fernández stated a cause of action under ERISA. In <i>Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n,</i> 535 U.S. 635, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002), the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a law's failure to provide a private right of action bears upon the district court's jurisdiction to entertain suit. The Court explained that, unless the claim is \"wholly insubstantial or frivolous\",or \"made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,\" the \"absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 642-43, 122 S.Ct. 1753. Section 1132(a)(1)(B) of ERISA plainly provides that a plan \"participant or beneficiary\" may bring a \"civil action\" \"to recover benefits due him under the terms of the plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Fernández's ERISA claims were hardly \"insubstantial or frivolous.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  In 1962, the Puerto Rico Legislature amended the WACA to extend the benefits of \"such an important social legislation\" to cases where a worker is intentionally and illegally assaulted by a coworker or other third party. <i>Ortiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund,</i> No. CE-93-471, slip op. at 6 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation MC-2007-229). Prior to that time, the WACA denied compensation benefits to any worker suffering injury or death due to a third person's criminal act. In amending the WACA, the legislature sought \"to adapt the local law to the modern trends in the scope of work accident compensation that liberalized the restrictions as to what constitutes a work accident.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 59(e) \"does not allow a party to advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas,</i> 238 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotations and ellipses omitted). Sánchez recognizes as much by claiming, without citation to a single pertinent authority, that the district court's civil judgment is simply void based on its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem. Of course, a void judgment may be vulnerable to attack at any point. <i>See </i><i>BaellaSilva v. Hulsey,</i> 454 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.2006) (\"A void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one, in that the latter is subject only to direct attack. A void judgment is one which, from its inception, was a complete nullity and without legal effect.\") (internal quotations and ellipses omitted). We view Sánchez's claim that the district court's judgment is void as nothing more than a forlorn attempt to forestall the entry of final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p>[6]  That the district court's injunction enjoined Sánchez and her family, rather than the commonwealth court, is immaterial. An injunction issued against a party under the Anti-Injunction Act is the same as an injunction issued against a court. <i>See </i><i>In re G.S.F. Corp.,</i> 938 F.2d 1467, 1478 n. 9 (1st Cir.1991), <i>abrogated in part on other grounds, </i><i>Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992).</p>\n<p>[7]  We are not unsympathetic to the loss E.P.S. and R.P.S. have suffered as a result of their father's death. Sánchez, however, failed to fully protect her daughters' interests when she failed to pursue, to the fullest extent, available administrative remedies under the WACA. While Sánchez never filed a claim with the SIF, the record reflects the SIF mailed notice to Sánchez at her last known address informing her and her daughters of the SIF's decision to deny compensation to Pagan's beneficiaries. Recall that when Fernández filed her compensation claim she properly informed the SIF that both E.P.S. and R.P.S. were the dependent daughters of the decedent. The notice of the SIF's decision mailed to Sánchez plainly explained her daughters' right to appeal the SIF's unfavorable decision. Once the current litigation was underway, Sánchez, or perhaps more accurately her counsel, continued to exhibit the indifference which brings us to this point. A belated answer to Fernández's complaint, a failure to timely file responses to Pfizer's motions, and a penchant for raising arguments for the first time in motions to reconsider emphasize this point.</p>\n\n</div>",

Our story begins in August 2003 when Luis Adorno-Cabán (Adorno) fatally shot Jaime Pagán-Avilés (Pagán). The unfortunate incident occurred while both men were working at Pfizer's facility in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. Pagán's common law wife, Emma Fernández-Vargas (Fernández), and their minor son, C.J.P.F., survived him. Pagán also left behind E.P.S. and R.P.S., two minor daughters from his prior marriage to Anabel Sánchez-Valle (Sánchez). Pfizer is the Appellee in this appeal. Sánchez is the Appellant. Sánchez asserts the district court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction from the outset, (2) improperly dismissed her wrongful death cross-claim, (3) issued a judgment that was null and void, and (4) erroneously enjoined her from suing Pfizer in commonwealth court. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Shortly after Pagán's death, Fernández filed a workmen's compensation claim with the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund (SIF) on behalf of herself and C.J.P.F. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws, § 8. In submitting her claim, Fernández disclosed the dependent status not only of Pagán's son, C.J.P.F., but also of Pagán's two daughters, E.P.S. and R.P.S. Sánchez did not file a separate claim with the SIF on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S. After an investigation, the SIF denied Fernández's claim in a terse order:</p>\n<blockquote>From the investigation conducted it is established that the aggression occurred when [Pagán's] co-worker, in a joking manner, threatened the injured party with a firearm that accidentally went off. Said aggression has no bearing whatsoever with the functions performed by the employee, nor with the functions performed by the assailant, it does not constitute an occupational risk nor a risk of the work environment, and the assailant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> was in violation of a . . . company rule, of not bearing arms on the employer's premises.</blockquote>\n<p><i>In re Pagán,</i> No. 04-07-00733-2, Order (P.R. State Ins. Fund, July 22, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2007-330). Because, according to the SIF, Pagán's death was \"not related to his occupation,\" his death was not compensable under Puerto Rico's Work Accident Compensation Act (WACA). <i>Id.</i> Fernández did not appeal the SIF's decision to the Puerto Rico Industrial Commission as permitted by the WACA. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws § 11.</p>\n<p>Instead, in August 2004, Fernández and Sánchez commenced separate lawsuits in Puerto Rico commonwealth court seeking damages related to Pagán's death. Sánchez's wrongful death lawsuit named as plaintiffs herself and her two minor daughters, as well as Pagán's father, aunt, uncle, and brother. Named defendants included Pfizer, Adorno, and the medical personnel responsible for treating Pagán. Sánchez did not join Fernández or C.J.P.F. <i>See Pagán-Valentín v. Pfizer Pharm., LLC,</i> No. CDP-04-0212(403), Amended Complaint. (Arecibo Sup. Pt., Oct. 27, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2006-137).</p>\n<p>Fernández filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and C.J.P.F. Fernández named, among others, Pfizer and Adorno as defendants. Importantly, she also named E.P.S. and R.P.S. as defendants through their mother, Sánchez. According to the complaint, Fernández named E.P.S. and R.P.S. as defendants because (1) Sánchez had not authorized their joinder as plaintiffs, and (2) they might be entitled to share in a recovery as Pagán's heirs. <i>See Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> No. CDP-04-0209(404), Complaint (Arecibo Sup. Pt., Aug. 3, 2004) (Certified Translation MC-2004-765).</p>\n<p>Fernández's complaint alleged two theories of recovery. First, like Sánchez, Fernández alleged wrongful death against Pfizer and Adorno. Second, unlike Sánchez, Fernández alleged Pfizer had wrongfully denied her disability benefits. The latter claim arose from Fernández's status as a Pfizer employee. Fernández alleged she suffered emotional damages because Pfizer, instead of providing her with disability benefits, forced her to return to work after Pagán's death.</p>\n<p>Pfizer removed Fernández's action to federal district court in November 2004. Pfizer argued ERISA's preemption of Fernández's employee benefits claim made the claim removable under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136991\"><a href=\"/opinion/136991/aetna-health-inc-v-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 207-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136991\"><a href=\"/opinion/136991/aetna-health-inc-v-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (2004) (explaining that because ERISA completely preempted a state law cause of action, a claim coming within the scope of that cause of action, even if pleaded in terms of state law, was actually based in federal law). The district court's supplemental jurisdiction extended to Fernández's wrongful death claim, which arose under Puerto Rico law. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c).</p>\n<p>Once in federal court, Pfizer moved to dismiss Fernández's complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Pfizer argued ERISA preempted Fernández's denial of benefits claim. Notwithstanding the SIF's prior decision that Pagán's death was \"not related to his occupation,\" Pfizer further argued that because Pagán's death occurred in the course of his employment, Pfizer was immune from Fernández's wrongful death claim under WACA § 21. Section 21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>When an employer insures his workmen or employees in accordance with this chapter, <i>the right herein established to obtain compensation shall be the only remedy against the employer,</i> even in those cases where maximum compensations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> and benefits have been granted in accordance thereof; but in case of accident to, or diseased or death of, the workmen or employees not entitled to compensation under this chapter, the liability of the employer is, and shall continue to be, the same as if this chapter did not exist.</blockquote>\n<p>11 P.R. Laws § 21 (emphasis added). The district court granted Fernández leave to file an amended complaint, while reserving ruling on Pfizer's immunity defense pending submission of an English translation of the SIF's decision.</p>\n<p>Fernández filed her amended complaint in February 2005. Fernández again named Pagán's two daughters as defendants, through Sánchez, their mother. Fernández alleged wrongful death against Pfizer and Adorno. She also alleged Pfizer had improperly denied her disability benefits under an ERISA-covered plan: \"Under 29 U.S.C. § 1132 plaintiff Emma Fernández is entitled to seek from Pfizer the benefits owed to her under the long term disability plan offered to her as an employee of Pfizer.\" <i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Amended Complaint (D.P.R. February 22, 2005). \"[A]s a further violation of ERISA,\" Fernández alleged Pfizer had wrongfully refused to tender the proceeds from Pagán's profit-sharing and stock-option plans. Pfizer answered by renewing its motion to dismiss Fernández's wrongful death claim. Pfizer again asserted employer immunity under WACA § 21. Additionally, Pfizer moved to dismiss Fernández's ERISA claims, arguing she failed to exhaust the administrative remedies outlined in Pfizer's benefits plan.</p>\n<p>Finally, in April 2005, Sánchez, on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S., appeared for the first time and answered Fernández's amended complaint. Sánchez acknowledged the district court's federal question and supplemental jurisdiction. Sánchez also filed a cross-claim, on behalf of her daughters, against Pfizer and Adorno for wrongful death. Sánchez's cross-claim set forth essentially the same allegations as those contained in the complaint she filed nine months earlier in the Puerto Rico commonwealth court.</p>\n<p>Pfizer moved to dismiss Sánchez's cross-claim, yet again asserting employer immunity under WACA § 21. Sánchez received an extension of time until June 6 to oppose Pfizer's motion to dismiss her cross-claim. On June 7, Sánchez filed a second request for an extension. The district court did not grant the second extension. Instead, on June 8, the district court issued an Opinion and Order addressing Pfizer's respective motions to dismiss. <i>See </i><i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427176\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427176/fernandez-vargas-v-pfizer-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2005). That same day, the district court denied as moot Sánchez's second motion for an extension of time to respond to Pfizer's motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>The district court first denied Pfizer's motion to dismiss Fernández's ERISA claims. According to the court, Fernández's allegation that Pfizer had refused to provide her benefits before she filed her lawsuit was sufficient to establish exhaustion under the notice-pleading standard. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). Second, the district court addressed whether Pfizer was entitled to immunity from, suit under WACA § 21. The court initially considered the preclusive effect of the SIF's decision. Because Pfizer was not a party to the SIF proceedings, the court reasoned that Pfizer was not precluded from challenging the SIF's decision and asserting immunity under the Act. <i>See Fernánkez-Vargas,</i> 394 F.Supp.2d at 413.</p>\n<p>Turning to the merits, the district court concluded the SIF had interpreted the WACA too narrowly and, thus, wrongly concluded Pagán's death was not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> compensable under the Act. The court cited numerous Puerto Rico court decisions holding \"that if an accident occurs on an employer's premises, the causal connection required to make the injury compensable is satisfied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 414 (collecting cases). Even assuming, contrary to the SIF's finding, that the shooting was intentional, the court reasoned that \"where the intentional aggression is unexplained or without a known motive, the benefit of the doubt favors the worker, and it must be assumed that the aggression was `work-related' and, therefore, compensable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 415 (collecting cases). Because neither Fernández nor Sánchez alleged any motive behind Pagán's shooting or provided any explanation for it, the district court held (1) Pagán death was compensable under the WACA, and (2) Pfizer was entitled to the immunity provided by § 21. Accordingly, the court dismissed Fernández's wrongful death claim and Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>As part of its dismissal order, the court scheduled a show cause hearing to determine \"whether cross-claimants [E.P.S. and R.P.S., through Sánchez] should remain in . . . [Fernández's] ERISA suit and, if so, whether they [we]re appropriately joined as co-defendants.\" <i>Id.</i> at 416. Sánchez filed a motion to reconsider the court's dismissal of her cross-claim.<sup>[2]</sup> Therein, Sánchez suggested for the first time that Adorno had a motive for shooting Pagan related to an \"emotional relationship,\" and that discovery was necessary to establish such motive.</p>\n<p>With Sánchez's motion to reconsider pending, Pfizer moved for summary judgment on Fernández's ERISA claims. Pfizer again asserted Fernández's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. Fernández, whose counsel had been permitted to withdraw on July 6, never responded. Consequently, on August 22, Pfizer asked the court to deem its motion for summary judgment unopposed. Pfizer further moved to dismiss Fernández's case for failure to prosecute. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n<p>Oddly, the district court granted Sánchez an extension of time to respond to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment  a motion that by all appearances was directed solely at Fernández's ERISA claims. Sánchez filed a formal opposition to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2005. Sánchez for the first time argued she had alleged, as part of her cross-claim, ERISA-based claims on behalf of E.P.S. and R.P.S. Sánchez urged the court to forego ruling on Pfizer's motion and allow discovery.</p>\n<p>On August 30, the district court granted Pfizer's motion to dismiss Fernández's action for failure to prosecute. The next morning, the court held a show cause hearing on the lawsuit's continued viability in light of two outstanding matters: (1) Sánchez's motion to reconsider the court's prior <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> dismissal of her wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer, and (2) Sánchez's opposition to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment on Fernández's ERISA claims. That afternoon, the court entered an order denying Sánchez's motion to reconsider without comment. The court then dismissed the case in its entirety and entered final judgment thereon:</p>\n<blockquote>There being no pending ERISA cause of action pleaded by cross-claimants, the remaining portion of this case is DISMISSED. Any ERISA-type claims by the . . . [Sánchez] claimants are not properly before the court and are, if at all, premature. The dismissal as to any future ERISA claims by these claimants is without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Order (D.P.R., Aug. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p>Sánchez filed another motion to reconsider which, properly construed, constituted a motion to alter or amend the judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). In her motion, Sánchez suggested, for the first time, that the district court's judgment was \"null\" because Fernández's son, C.J.P.F., (1) had an unspecified conflict of interest with his mother and (2) lacked legal representation at a crucial stage of the proceeding. Sánchez asserted the court's failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem rendered its judgment void. Sánchez also argued that she had alleged a cause of action under ERISA, and summary judgment was premature prior to discovery. With Sánchez's Rule 59(e) motion outstanding, Pfizer moved the court for injunctive relief pursuant to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283. Pfizer urged the court to enter a permanent injunction precluding Sánchez and her family from relitigating the issue of Pfizer's immunity from suit in commonwealth court.</p>\n<p>In November 2006, the district court denied Sánchez's Rule 59(e) motion and enjoined her and her family from relitigating the immunity issue. <i>See Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ.

The court again rejected Sánchez's argument that she had actually pled ERISA claims against Pfizer. The Court declined to address the need for a guardian ad litem to represent C.J.P.F., or for discovery. The court viewed these arguments as \"premised on the [erroneous] supposition that they [Sánchez and her daughters] had an ERISA cross-claim against Pfizer in the first instance.\" <i>Id.</i> at *4.</p>\n<p>Turning to Pfizer's motion for injunctive relief, the district court recognized that Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim against Pfizer was identical to her wrongful death claim pending in commonwealth court. The court reasoned that because it had already conclusively determined WACA § 21 rendered Pfizer immune from Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim, permitting Sánchez to relitigate the immunity issue in commonwealth court would cause Pfizer irreparable harm. <i>See id.</i> at *8. Consequently, the court issued the injunction against Sánchez and her family. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2283. Sánchez appealed. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal Sánchez challenges the district court's judgment on four grounds. First, Sánchez argues Pfizer's removal of Fernández's complaint to federal court was improper and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action from the outset. Second, she claims the court, improperly dismissed her cross-claim against Pfizer based on the erroneous view that WACA § 21 provided Pfizer immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> from suit. Third, she suggests the court's failure to appoint Fernández's son, C.J.P.F., a guardian ad litem renders its judgment a nullity. Finally, Sánchez asserts the court improperly enjoined her from pursuing her wrongful death claim against Pfizer in commonwealth court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Sánchez's argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction presents a legal question we consider de novo. <i>See </i><i>United Seniors Ass'n, Inc. v. Philip Morris USA</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1193530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1193530/united-seniors-assn-inc-v-philip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2007) (reviewing de novo the district court's \"implicit legal conclusion\" that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint). Our resolution of Sánchez's jurisdictional concern need not detain us long. Whether Pfizer's removal of Fernández's original commonwealth action to federal court was defective is immaterial. Fernández amended her complaint to plainly allege subject-matter jurisdiction in the context of her ERISA claims. Once Fernández did so, any initial jurisdictional defect in removal was cured. <i>See </i><i>Brough v. United Steelworkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"294569\"><a href=\"/opinion/294569/george-k-brough-v-united-steelworkers-of-america-afl-cio-and-third/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1971)</p>\n<p>In <i>Brough,</i> we plainly held that a federal claim, raised for the first time in an amended complaint, cured any jurisdictional defects in an action otherwise improperly removed from state court. <i>Id.</i> at 750. When Fernández amended her complaint, the district court undoubtedly possessed original federal question jurisdiction over her ERISA claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over her wrongful death claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.</p>\n<p>Sánchez's cross-claim against Pfizer acknowledged both the court's original and supplemental jurisdiction under §§ 1331 and 1367, respectively. Courts have long recognized that a party \"cannot voluntarily invoke and then disavow federal jurisdiction.\" <i>New Mexico v. General Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></span>, 1236 n. 23 (10th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Bernstein v.

Accordingly, we reject Sánchez's challenge to the district court's subject matter jurisdiction in this case.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Next we consider Sánchez's argument that Pfizer is not immune from suit under WACA § 21. This issue arose within the context of Pfizer's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, and we consider it de novo. <i>See </i><i>Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202969\"><a href=\"/opinion/202969/fitzgerald-v-barnstable-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 176 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also Manager of the State Ins.

Larson, <i>Larson's Workers' Comp. Law</i> § 100.01[2], at 100-3 (2007) (hereinafter Larson) (describing an employer's claim of immunity in the workers' compensation context as an affirmative defense).</p>\n<p>At the outset, we, like the district court, recognize that because Pfizer was not a party to Fernández's action before the SIF, the SIF's decision that Pagán's death' was not compensable under the WACA does not bind Pfizer. In <i>Negrón v. C.I.T. Fin. Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></span>, 111 D.P.R. 657 (P.R.1981), the SIF denied benefits to the beneficiaries of the decedent. The Industrial Commission upheld the SIF's decision and the beneficiaries took no further appeal. <i>See</i> 11 P.R. Laws § 11 (providing for appeals from SIF decisions to the Industrial Commission); <i>see also id.</i> § 8 (providing for appeals from Industrial Commission decisions to the \"courts of justice\"). Instead, they filed a wrongful death suit against the employer in Puerto Rico commonwealth court. In rejecting the SIF's decision, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said this about the preclusive effect of that prior decision upon the employer:</p>\n<blockquote>Although the Fund's ruling denying compensation rights is final and unappealable, because the Commission's upholding resolution was not appealed, the employer, petitioner herein, was not a party to that administrative proceeding. The Fund's ruling is res judicata between the Fund and the employee's beneficiaries, respondents herein. But that administrative ruling cannot represent a bar in the judicial ambit in order to determine its correctness to the effect of the exclusiveness [<i>i.e.,</i> immunity] clause invoked by the petitioner. Since it was not a party to said action, the ruling is not res judicata as far as the petitioner is concerned.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Negron,</i> 11 P.R. Offic. Trans, at 832-33. The court concluded that neither it, nor the employer, was bound \"by an erred ruling of the Fund and the Commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 834. Similarly, neither we, nor Pfizer, are bound by the SIF's decision that Pagán's death was not compensable.</p>\n<p>As such, we assess Pfizer's entitlement to immunity under WACA § 21 anew. We conclude the SIF construed the WACA's scope of coverage too narrowly.. <i>López Cotto v. Western Auto of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> No. CC-2006-248, slip op., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1630930</span></span> (P.R., May 17, 2007) (Certified Translation MC-2007-380), best illustrates our conclusion. In that case, employees of defendant Western Auto locked López, a fellow employee, inside the men's restroom at the store. López apparently had notified management that a lock on the outside of the restroom door attracted practical jokesters. As part of their practical joke, López's coworkers emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher underneath the door. López suffered \"permanent pulmonary damage and post-traumatic stress disorder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2. López sought benefits from the SIF. The SIF labeled the incident a \"work accident,\" and awarded López compensation.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, López and his conjugal partner sued Western Auto for damages in commonwealth court. The trial court refused to dismiss the complaint on the basis of employer immunity. The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals reversed, holding Western Auto enjoyed immunity under WACA § 21. López and his partner appealed to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, where they unsuccessfully argued that the appellate court erred when it ruled on the employer's lack of intent \"in the abstract,\" without allowing discovery or permitting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> an evidentiary hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 7. Importantly, the supreme court understood, the question of WACA § 21 immunity to turn solely on whether Western Auto had \"intentionally\" caused López's injuries:</p>\n<blockquote>An examination of the facts arising from the file of the case, show that, at the most, the only thing that may be charged on the mentioned employer, regarding the incident occurred, is having been negligent by not having corrected the situation of the lock of the bathroom in spite of having been, allegedly, advised of it prior to the occurrence of the facts. In this kind of situation, ordinarily, the worker does <i>not</i> have any cause of action whatsoever against the employer. The argument of petitioners  to the effect that López Cotto was a victim of an intentional act of the employer  is totally unwarranted. . . . [T]he most that could be charged on Western Auto is that it was negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[I]n the complaint filed, the plaintiffs allege, \"in the alternative,\" that Western Auto is responsible for the intentional acts of López Cotto's coworkers. They are not right. . . . <i>[W]hen the person who intentionally injures the employee, is not the employer,</i> in its personal capacity or a person who is an \"alter ego\" of the employer or corporation . . . and whether it is a mere employee or supervisor, <i>a cause of action in damages against the employer for the acts committed by its employees is not proper.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 11-12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>In view of <i>López Cotto,</i> we have little choice but to conclude that the gunman Adorno's mental state is only tangentially related to the question of whether Pagán's death was compensable under the WACA.<sup>[4]</sup> Certainly, Sánchez has not suggested that Adorno was the \"alter ego\" of Pfizer. Under <i>López Cotto's</i> rationale, Sánchez, to withstand Pfizer's § 21 immunity defense, must establish that Pfizer \"intentionally\" caused Pagán's death. <i>See id.</i> at 12.</p>\n<p>Larson, a leading commentator on workers' compensation law, explains the usual meaning of \"intentional\" within the worker's compensation context. His view is undoubtedly consistent with <i>López-Cotto's</i> view:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he common-law liability of the employer cannot, under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to include the accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, . . . or other misconduct by the employer <i>short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the purpose of inflicting an injury.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Larson, <i>supra</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). \"Even if the alleged conduct . . . includes such elements as . . . wilfully failing to furnish a safe place to work . . . [or] failing to protect employees from crime, . . . the conduct still falls short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character.\" <i>Id.</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Sánchez argues, as López did in <i>López Cotto,</i> that we should direct the district court to allow discovery on the intent issue. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> But Sánchez's cross-claim alleges only that \"Pfizer acted with intentional, negligent and reckless disregard in <i>preventing, avoiding and/or detecting firearms within its premises . . . [and] failing to investigate and adequately supervise its workforce.\" Fernández-Vargas v. Pfizer Pharm., Inc.,</i> Civ. No. 04-2236(JAF), Answer to Amended Complaint (D.P.R., April 25, 2005) (emphasis added). In other words, Sánchez alleges Pfizer failed to ensure a safe workplace for its employees, despite having a written policy forbidding its employees from possessing firearms on the plant's premises. These allegations do not amount to a claim that Pfizer, <i>consciously and deliberately intended</i> to cause Pagan death. See Larson, <i>supra</i> § 103.03, at XXX-X-XXX-X. Perhaps like Western Auto in <i>López Cotto,</i> Pfizer was careless or indifferent to the need for a safe workplace. Such nonfeasance, however, falls far short under Puerto Rico law of the intent required to deprive Pfizer of the benefits of WACA immunity.</p>\n<p>To be sure, a worker's assault upon a coworker may not be compensable if based on animosity or conflict arising out of a \"purely private and personal\" matter between the workers. See <i>Ortiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund,</i> No. CE-93-171, slip op. at 7 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation MC-2007-229). But Sánchez's cross-claim contains no allegation that some private and personal conflict between the two men motivated Adorno's action. The SIF found that Adorno was threatening Pagán \"in a joking manner\" when the gun went off. None of the allegations in Sánchez's cross-claim contradict the SIF's finding. Sánchez's cross-claim alleges only, that Pfizer is responsible \"for the negligent, careless and reckless acts caused by the employee [Adorno].\" The cross-claim makes no reference to Adorno's motivation.</p>\n<p>Adorno's motive for shooting Pagán, if he had one, remains unapparent and unexplained. Given Puerto Rico courts' recognition of \"the doctrine of neutral or unexplained assaults,\" which provides WACA coverage in cases where \"an employee is injured as a consequence of an assault without an apparent and unexplainable motive,\" Pagán's death undoubtedly was compensable under the WACA. And the SIF erroneously held otherwise. <i>Ortiz-Perez,</i> slip. op. at 10-11. Consequently, the district court properly held that WACA § 21's employer immunity shielded Pfizer from Sánchez's wrongful death cross-claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Next, we address Sánchez's argument that the district court's failure to appoint C.J.P.F., Fernández's minor son, a guardian ad litem pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 17(c) voids its judgment. Among other things, Rule 17(c) provides that where a minor is \"not otherwise represented in an action,\" a federal court \"shall appoint a guardian ad litem . . . or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the [minor].\" The decision as to whether to appoint a special representative for a minor under Rule 17(c) rests within the district court's sound discretion. And we will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Developmental Disabilities Advocacy Ctr., Inc. v. Melton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409209\"><a href=\"/opinion/409209/developmental-disabilities-advocacy-center-inc-and-harold-tuttle-v-jack/\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 285 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n<p>State law generally governs the capacity of one to sue as a representative of another. <i>See id.</i> Puerto Rico law grants parents a wide range of rights in the exercise of <i>\"patria potestas.\"</i> These include the right to represent their minor children in civil litigation. <i>See Ex Parte Torres-Ojeda,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> 556-57 (P.R.1987). Absent some conflict of interest between a parent and child; or apparent wrongdoing on behalf of the parent, that right surely encompasses the right to decide whether to proceed with the prosecution of a civil lawsuit by weighing the attendant costs and benefits. <i>Cf.</i> P.R.R. Civ. Pro. 45.2 (prohibiting a default judgment against a minor <i>unless</i> such minor is represented \"by the father, mother, . . . or other such representative who has appeared therein\"); <i>accord</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2) (same). After all, a parent is presumed to act in the best interest of her child. <i>See </i><i>Suboh v. District Attorney's Office,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Consistent with this view, we have interpreted Rule 17(c), specifically the language \"not otherwise represented in an action,\" as \"permitting appointment of a . . . guardian ad litem when it appears that the minor's general representative has interests which may conflict with those of the person he is supposed to represent.\" <i>Melton,</i> 689 F.2d at 285 (internal quotations omitted). Similarly, we have interpreted the district court's authority to \"make such orders as it deems proper for the protection of the [minor]\" as encompassing situations \"where it is clear\" the interests of the parent and child conflict. <i>Id.</i> at 286.</p>\n<p>The district court implicitly recognized Fernández's right to act as the representative of her minor son, C.J.P.F., from the outset of this action. We seriously doubt Sánchez, having no natural or other official relationship to C.J.P.F., has any standing under Rule 17(c) to challenge the nature of that representation. <i>See id.</i> at 285; <i>see also</i> 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur K. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1570, at 503 (2d ed.1990)(explaining that a court may properly refuse to appoint a guardian under Rule 17(c) where the appointment \"is sought for ulterior reasons that have nothing to do with protecting the [minor]\"). Notably, Sánchez never formally moved the court to appoint C.J.P.F. a new representative. Rather, Sánchez claimed in her Rule 59(e) motion that Fernández and C.J.P.F. had some unspecified conflict of interest requiring an appointment. Sánchez has provided us with only vague, unverified assertions, and we have no idea what that conflict might be.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Our careful review of the documents Pfizer filed in support of its summary judgment motion on Fernández's ERISA claims indicate that Fernández, in all likelihood, failed to exhaust the administrative remedies contained in Pfizer's employee-benefit plan. <i>See </i><i>Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201863\"><a href=\"/opinion/201863/madera-v-marsh-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2005) (construing ERISA to require exhaustion of administrative remedies). Absent evidence or a course of conduct suggesting otherwise, we presume Fernández saw nothing to be gained by continuing to expend resources on a case in which she and C.J.P.F. had little chance of prevailing. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> We see no conflict inherent in Fernández's decision not to respond to Pfizer's motion for summary judgment, and we presume she acted in C.J.P.F.'s best interests. <i>See </i><i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92. Thus, we reject Sánchez's challenge to the district court's judgment based upon its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D.</h2>\n<p>Lastly, we review the district court's decision to enjoin Sánchez's commonwealth action under the Anti-Injunction Act for an abuse of discretion. See <i>Zurich American Ins. v. Superior Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781666\"><a href=\"/opinion/781666/zurich-american-insurance-company-v-superior-court-for-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 824 (7th Cir.2003). Within this context, we evaluate the court's underlying factual findings for clear error and its legal interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act de novo. <i>Id.</i> For our purposes, we are concerned only with the \"relitigation exception\" to the Act. The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits a federal court from \"granting] an injunction to stay proceedings in State court except . . . where necessary . . . to protect or effectuate its judgments.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2283. \"The words `protect or effectuate' in § 2283 are generally viewed as incorporating the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, which come into play only when there is a final judgment or appealable order to be protected or effectuated.\" <i>See </i><i>James v. Bellotti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435233\"><a href=\"/opinion/435233/frank-b-james-v-francis-x-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 993-94 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p>The relitigation exception provides that where a federal court has conclusively decided an issue, it <i>may</i> prevent the unsuccessful party from relitigating that same issue in state court., Application of the exception (1) reinforces the preclusive effect of federal court judgments, (2) ensures the finality of federal court decisions, and (3) prevents harassment through repetitive state court proceedings of those litigants prevailing in federal court. The relitigation exception applies where, because of preclusion principals, the state court should not hear a case but still may do so. <i>See</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> § 11.2, at 751-52 (5th ed.2007).</p>\n<p>Certainly, a federal court should not lightly undertake the task of deciding whether to enjoin state court proceedings. That injunctive relief may issue does not mean it must issue. <i>See </i><i>SMA Life Assurance Co. v. Sanchez-Pica,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580703\"><a href=\"/opinion/580703/sma-life-assurance-company-v-antonio-sanchez-pica/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 276 (1st Cir.1992). The court needs a \"substantial justification\" for issuing such injunction. <i>Id.</i> at 277. And the general prerequisites for injunctive relief must usually be met. <i>See </i><i>James,</i> 733 F.2d at 993. Based on concerns of comity and federalism, a federal court must ask whether requiring the moving party to raise a preclusion defense in state court would be the wiser course. At the same time, the court must remain mindful that the state court's rejection of a preclusion defense effectively proscribes a federal court from issuing a subsequent injunction to effectuate its judgment. <i>See </i><i>Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111563\"><a href=\"/opinion/111563/parsons-steel-inc-v-first-alabama-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 524, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111563\"><a href=\"/opinion/111563/parsons-steel-inc-v-first-alabama-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span> (1986) (holding the relitigation exception was limited \"to those situations in which the state court has not yet ruled on the merits of the res judicata issue\").</p>\n<p>With these precepts in mind, we decline to disturb the district court's injunction in this case because it is substantially justified.<sup>[6]</sup> Puerto Rico's employer immunity defense \"is of an absolute character which creates a legal immunity <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> in favor of an insured employer against any other action: in other words there is no cause of action.\" <i>Flares Hermanos Cement Prod.</i> 7 P.R. Offic. Trans, at 861-62. As a defense from suit rather than a defense from liability, the immunity provided by WACA is effectively lost if a case is allowed to proceed against the very employer it is designed to shield. <i>See </i><i>Lowinger v. Broderick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195973\"><a href=\"/opinion/195973/lowinger-v-broderick/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.1995). Allowing wrongful death proceedings against Pfizer to continue in Puerto Rico commonwealth court would wrongly require Pfizer to answer a claim that the law does not recognize. As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such proceedings would constitute irreparable harm to Pfizer.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prod., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198547\"><a href=\"/opinion/198547/metro-goldwyn-meyer-v-007-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999) (listing the factors to be considered before issuing injunctive relief). Moreover, the injunction does not harm the public interest, but rather serves \"the public policy of the Commonwealth [of Puerto Rico] . . . favoring the unique liability enacted by the [WACA].\" <i>López Cotto,</i> slip op. at 8.</p>\n<p>For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wrongful death claims against Adorno given those claims were sufficiently separate from Fernández's ERISA claims. <i>See </i><i>United Mine Workers v.

In <i>Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1753</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span> (2002), the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a law's failure to provide a private right of action bears upon the district court's jurisdiction to entertain suit. The Court explained that, unless the claim is \"wholly insubstantial or frivolous\",or \"made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,\" the \"absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 642-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1753</span></a></span>. Section 1132(a)(1)(B) of ERISA plainly provides that a plan \"participant or beneficiary\" may bring a \"civil action\" \"to recover benefits due him under the terms of the plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Fernández's ERISA claims were hardly \"insubstantial or frivolous.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  In 1962, the Puerto Rico Legislature amended the WACA to extend the benefits of \"such an important social legislation\" to cases where a worker is intentionally and illegally assaulted by a coworker or other third party. <i>Ortiz-Perez v. State Ins. Fund,</i> No. CE-93-471, slip op. at 6 (P.R., Oct. 31, 1994) (Certified Translation MC-2007-229). Prior to that time, the WACA denied compensation benefits to any worker suffering injury or death due to a third person's criminal act. In amending the WACA, the legislature sought \"to adapt the local law to the modern trends in the scope of work accident compensation that liberalized the restrictions as to what constitutes a work accident.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5.</p>\n<p>[5]  Rule 59(e) \"does not allow a party to advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.\" <i>DiMarco-Zappa v. Cabanillas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771817\"><a href=\"/opinion/771817/joanna-dimarco-zappa-v-eugenio-cabanillas-federico-ced-alzamora-mary-jo/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotations and ellipses omitted). Sánchez recognizes as much by claiming, without citation to a single pertinent authority, that the district court's civil judgment is simply void based on its failure to appoint C.J.P.F. a guardian ad litem. Of course, a void judgment may be vulnerable to attack at any point. <i>See </i><i>BaellaSilva v. Hulsey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202295\"><a href=\"/opinion/202295/baella-silva-v-hulsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2006) (\"A void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one, in that the latter is subject only to direct attack. A void judgment is one which, from its inception, was a complete nullity and without legal effect.\") (internal quotations and ellipses omitted). We view Sánchez's claim that the district court's judgment is void as nothing more than a forlorn attempt to forestall the entry of final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p>[6]  That the district court's injunction enjoined Sánchez and her family, rather than the commonwealth court, is immaterial. An injunction issued against a party under the Anti-Injunction Act is the same as an injunction issued against a court. <i>See </i><i>In re G.S.F. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564956\"><a href=\"/opinion/564956/25-collier-bankrcas2d-113-bankr-l-rep-p-74130-in-re-gsf/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1467</span></a></span>, 1478 n. 9 (1st Cir.1991), <i>abrogated in part on other grounds, </i><i>Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span> (1992).</p>\n<p>[7]  We are not unsympathetic to the loss E.P.S. and R.P.S. have suffered as a result of their father's death. Sánchez, however, failed to fully protect her daughters' interests when she failed to pursue, to the fullest extent, available administrative remedies under the WACA. While Sánchez never filed a claim with the SIF, the record reflects the SIF mailed notice to Sánchez at her last known address informing her and her daughters of the SIF's decision to deny compensation to Pagan's beneficiaries. Recall that when Fernández filed her compensation claim she properly informed the SIF that both E.P.S. and R.P.S. were the dependent daughters of the decedent. The notice of the SIF's decision mailed to Sánchez plainly explained her daughters' right to appeal the SIF's unfavorable decision. Once the current litigation was underway, Sánchez, or perhaps more accurately her counsel, continued to exhibit the indifference which brings us to this point. A belated answer to Fernández's complaint, a failure to timely file responses to Pfizer's motions, and a penchant for raising arguments for the first time in motions to reconsider emphasize this point.</p>\n\n</div>",
