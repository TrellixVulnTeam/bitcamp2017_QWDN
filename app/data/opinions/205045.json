This   appeal   requires   us    to\n\nconsider the circumstances under which a litigant who obtains\n\nsignificant relief through a court-approved settlement, rather than\n\na verdict or a formal consent decree, may achieve \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status and, thus, become eligible for an award of attorneys'\n\nfees under a typical federal fee-shifting statute. The appeal also\n\nrequires us to consider when, short of the entry of a final\n\njudgment, \"prevailing party\" status may attach.\n\n          These questions (and the other questions before us) arise\n\nin the following setting.    After the parties reached a negotiated\n\nsettlement resolving the substance of a complicated class action,\n\nthe district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and\n\nexpenses totaling over three-quarters of a million dollars.                The\n\ndefendants appeal, asseverating that the district court improperly\n\ncharacterized   the   plaintiffs      as    prevailing     parties;   acted\n\nprematurely in arriving at that conclusion; and to add insult to\n\ninjury, set the amount of the award too generously.            We conclude\n\nthat the district court appropriately characterized the plaintiffs\n\nas prevailing parties, that the relief obtained was sufficiently\n\nfinal to justify a fee award, and that the court acted within the\n\npurview of its discretion in fixing the amount.            Consequently, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            On    May     17,     2007,   the    named    plaintiffs      —   several\n\nindividuals with acquired brain injuries who qualify for long-term\n\ncare services under the Medicaid program and two organizations\n\ndevoted     to    their    cause     (the       Brain    Injury    Association    of\n\nMassachusetts and the Stavros Center for Independent Living) —\n\nfiled suit to compel the defendants — various officials of the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts (collectively, the Commonwealth) — to\n\ncomply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794(a), and the reasonable promptness provision of the\n\nMedicaid program as set forth in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)(A), by offering services and programs for\n\nindividuals with acquired brain injuries in integrated community\n\nsettings.        The Commonwealth filed an answering motion, which\n\ntriggered a spate of motion practice.\n\n            On    July    13,     2007,   the     plaintiffs      moved   for   class\n\ncertification.      They then served an array of discovery requests.\n\nThe Commonwealth cross-moved to stay discovery pending a decision\n\non class certification.           The district court granted a stay.\n\n            On September 26, 2007, the court certified a class.\n\nShortly thereafter, the parties began settlement negotiations in\n\nearnest   and     agreed     to    suspend      discovery    while    negotiations\n\nproceeded.       The talks proved fruitful and, on May 30, 2008, the\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fparties executed a settlement agreement (the Agreement) that they\n\ndescribed as \"final\" and \"comprehensive.\"\n\n           In terms, the Agreement required the Commonwealth, over\n\na period of years, to expand community services (residential and\n\nnon-residential) for Medicaid-eligible individuals with acquired\n\nbrain injuries.    To this end, the Commonwealth is charged with\n\ndeveloping several new projects and programs.        The Commonwealth's\n\nresponsibilities are, however, subject to its ability to secure\n\nboth funding from the state legislature and necessary approvals\n\nfrom the federal government.      With respect to these matters, the\n\nAgreement impresses an obligation on the Commonwealth to use best\n\nefforts.    If the Commonwealth is unable to obtain funding or\n\napprovals and the Agreement stalls, either side may move to vacate\n\nthe settlement so that the plaintiffs can litigate the case.\n\n           The Agreement contemplates that the case will remain open\n\nfor a period of years while the Commonwealth performs thereunder;\n\nit authorizes dismissal of the action only after the Commonwealth\n\nhas completed certain specified obligations and is found to be in\n\n\"substantial compliance\" with the Agreement's terms. The Agreement\n\nfurther provides that the district court \"shall retain jurisdiction\n\nto hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions.\"\n\n           Because the district court had certified a class, the\n\nAgreement required judicial approval.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).\n\nThe   parties   jointly   moved   for    this   approval   and,   after   a\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fpreliminary   fairness   hearing,    the    district   court    allowed   the\n\napproval process to move forward.          The court acknowledged, at the\n\nCommonwealth's urging, that the Agreement memorialized a settlement\n\nand was not tendered as a consent decree.\n\n          After the class members were notified of the proposed\n\nsettlement, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1), the district court held\n\na final fairness hearing. The court again noted that the Agreement\n\n\"does not constitute a consent decree but is a settlement agreement\n\nof this disputed case.\"       The plaintiffs suggested that the court\n\napprove the Agreement by entering it as a court order, but the\n\nCommonwealth objected.        The court expressed its willingness to\n\nindicate, either orally or through a written order, its finding\n\nthat the Agreement represented a fair and appropriate resolution of\n\nthe matter.    It then asked the parties to submit a draft of a\n\nproposed order for approval of the Agreement.\n\n          On July 29, 2008, each side submitted a proposed order.\n\nThe parties disagreed as to whether the court needed explicitly to\n\nretain   jurisdiction    as    a   means    of   facilitating    subsequent\n\nenforcement of the Agreement.      In an effort to achieve a meeting of\n\nthe minds, the district court suggested the following language:\n\n          [T]he   court  approves  the  comprehensive\n          settlement agreement. This case will not be\n          closed and judgment will not enter pending\n          compliance with the terms of the settlement\n          agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fThis suggestion did not please anyone. The plaintiffs feared that,\n\nwithout language explicitly retaining enforcement jurisdiction, the\n\ncourt's authority might be questioned in the event that further\n\ncompliance   proceedings     become    necessary.      For   its   part,   the\n\nCommonwealth expressed concern that the court's words might be\n\ntransformed into the functional equivalent of a consent decree.\n\nThe   Commonwealth   noted    that,     in   the    course   of    settlement\n\nnegotiations, it had consistently maintained its unwillingness to\n\nresolve the case by means of \"a document that could be functionally\n\na consent decree.\"\n\n           Faced with this impasse, the district court took the\n\nmatter under advisement.      On September 18, 2008, the court, acting\n\nwithout further input from the parties, entered a final approval\n\norder.   The order states in pertinent part:\n\n           [T]he court finds that the Comprehensive\n           Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and\n           adequate. Therefore, the court approves the\n           Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, noting\n           that the parties agree that this agreement\n           does not constitute a consent decree, and that\n           the court will retain jurisdiction over the\n           case. The court orders that this case not be\n           closed and that judgment not enter pending\n           compliance with the terms of the Comprehensive\n           Settlement Agreement.\n\n           The entry of the approval order set the stage for the\n\ndevelopments leading to this appeal.         The plaintiffs, claiming to\n\nbe prevailing parties, moved for an award of attorneys' fees\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(including costs) in the amount of $786,123.1                The Commonwealth\n\ndisputed the \"prevailing party\" characterization, the timing of the\n\nmotion for fees, and the reasonableness of the requested award.\n\nThe district court found that the plaintiffs were prevailing\n\nparties, that fees were presently allowable, and that the amount\n\nsought      was   \"eminently   fair.\"         Accordingly,   it   awarded   the\n\nplaintiffs the full amount sought.            This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n              The Commonwealth prosecutes this appeal on three fronts.\n\nFirst it asserts that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties and\n\nthat, therefore, they are not entitled to a fee award.              Second, it\n\nquestions the timing of the plaintiffs' quest for fees.                     Its\n\nfallback position is that, even if we find its first two points\n\nunconvincing, the district court nevertheless committed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion in determining the size of the award. We consider these\n\nassertions sequentially.\n\n                       A.   Prevailing Party Status.\n\n              We review a determination of \"prevailing party\" status de\n\nnovo.       Aronov v. Napolitano, 562 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2009) (en\n\nbanc); Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch., 401 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n        1\n       The plaintiffs' motion was, by its terms, brought \"pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 42 U.S.C. § 12205.\" The language of these\ntwo fee-shifting provisions is virtually identical in all material\nrespects.   Following the lead of the parties and the district\ncourt, we treat the ADA's fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12205, as the operative statute.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f2005).      Fee-shifting statutes represent a departure from the\n\nhistoric American rule, which dictates that parties to a case\n\nnormally will bear their own counsel fees and costs.     See Alyeska\n\nPipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975).\n\nWhen, as in this case, the application of such a statute cuts\n\nthrough the government's traditional sovereign immunity, it \"must\n\nbe construed strictly in favor of the government.\"       Aronov, 562\n\nF.3d at 88 (citing Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 137 (1991)).\n\n            The text of the ADA's fee-shifting provision reads in its\n\nentirety:\n\n            In any action or administrative proceeding\n            commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court\n            or agency, in its discretion, may allow the\n            prevailing party, other than the United\n            States, a reasonable attorney's fee, including\n            litigation expenses, and costs, and the United\n            States shall be liable for the foregoing the\n            same as a private individual.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12205.    When used in a federal fee-shifting statute,\n\n\"the term 'prevailing party' [is] a legal term of art.\" Buckhannon\n\nBd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532\n\nU.S. 598, 603 (2001).      The concepts that shape the term apply\n\nbroadly to the entire universe of federal fee-shifting statutes.2\n\nSee Smith, 401 F.3d at 22 n.8; Doe v. Boston Pub. Sch., 358 F.3d\n\n20, 25 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n     2\n      In any event, the key precedent is Buckhannon, and the Court\nthere dealt in part, as we do here, with the ADA's fee-shifting\nprovision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205. See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 601.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            To qualify as a prevailing party, a litigant must show\n\nthat a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship has\n\ntaken place as a result of the litigation.            Tex. State Teachers\n\nAss'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792-93 (1989).\n\nIn addition, a party must demonstrate that the alteration possesses\n\na \"judicial imprimatur.\"      Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    We need only discuss the second of these requirements\n\nhere, as the Commonwealth asserts that the \"plaintiffs have failed\n\nto satisfy the judicial imprimatur requirement.\"\n\n            The Buckhannon Court identified only two situations in\n\nwhich this judicial imprimatur requirement would necessarily be\n\nsatisfied: where the plaintiff \"received a judgment on the merits\"\n\nor where she \"obtained a court-ordered consent decree.\"            Id.     The\n\nJustices left open the question of whether (and if so, under what\n\ncircumstances) a court-approved settlement that is not embodied in\n\na formal consent decree may serve as the gateway to \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status.        The case at hand requires us to ponder this\n\nquestion.\n\n            We do not write on a pristine page: our recent en banc\n\nopinion in Aronov provides guidance.         There, we indicated that an\n\norder short of a formal consent decree might be sufficient for this\n\npurpose.     562 F.3d at 90.        We emphasized, however, that this\n\ninquiry must focus on substance, not form.           It follows that it is\n\nthe   function   of   the   order   that   carries   the   most   weight    in\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fdetermining whether it may serve as the linchpin for \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status.    See id. (explaining that \"it is the reality, not\n\nthe nomenclature which is at issue\"); see also id. at 90 n.7\n\n(collecting    cases   from   other     circuits   reaching   the   same\n\nconclusion).     Thus, rather than look exclusively at the label\n\nattached to a particular order, an inquiring court must consider\n\n\"whether the order contains the sort of judicial involvement and\n\nactions inherent in a 'court ordered consent decree.'\"        Id. at 90.\n\n            The Commonwealth argues that Aronov directs us to ignore\n\nthe Agreement itself and look exclusively at the approval order\n\nwhen mulling whether the order contains elements inherent in a\n\nconventional consent decree.     That is too crabbed a reading of\n\nAronov.     Indeed, such a myopic approach would be at odds with\n\nAronov's instruction that \"[w]hether an order contains a sufficient\n\njudicial imprimatur can only be determined by determining the\n\ncontent of the order against the entire context before the court.\"\n\nId. at 92 (emphasis supplied); cf. Smyth ex rel. Smyth v. Rivero,\n\n282 F.3d 268, 279 (4th Cir. 2002) (examining whether agreement and\n\ndismissal order \"were, in combination, equivalent to a consent\n\ndecree\").   We thus construe the approval order in light of both the\n\ncontent of the Agreement itself and its entire context.\n\n            Our inquiry looks to three factors.     The first factor is\n\nwhether the change in the legal relationship between the parties\n\nwas \"court-ordered.\"    Aronov, 562 F.3d at 90 (quoting Buckhannon,\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f532 U.S. at 604).   The second factor is whether there was \"judicial\n\napproval of the relief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.\"          Id.     The\n\nthird factor is whether there exists continuing \"judicial oversight\n\nand ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties.\"\n\nId.   We start with a determination of whether the change in legal\n\nrelationship is court-ordered.\n\n           The Agreement itself specifically provides that, in the\n\nabsence of court approval, \"the Agreement shall be null and void\n\nand of no force and effect.\"      Hence, it is the approval order that\n\nmakes the provisions of the Agreement binding on the parties and\n\ngives bite to their reciprocal obligations.           In other words, this\n\nis a situation in which the court order triggers the change in the\n\nrelationship between the parties, not one in which \"the court\n\nmerely recognizes what the government has voluntarily agreed to do\n\nand only 'requir[es] [the government] to follow through.'\"           Id. at\n\n93 (alterations in original) (quoting Smith, 401 F.3d at 27).\n\nGiven   this   reality,   we   find   that   the   court's   involvement   is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the first prong of the inquiry.\n\n           The second prong of the inquiry requires us to determine\n\nwhether there has been \"judicial approval of the relief vis-à-vis\n\nthe merits of the case.\"        Id. at 90.     Under the Civil Rules, a\n\ncourt must approve a settlement in a class action and is directed\n\nto do so only if it finds the terms of the settlement \"fair,\n\nreasonable, and adequate.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2); see Nat'l\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fAss'n of Chain Drug Stores v. New Engl. Carpenters Health Benefits\n\nFund, 582 F.3d 30, 44 (1st Cir. 2009).                This is strikingly similar\n\nto a court's role in entering a consent decree — a role that\n\nrequires a court to ensure that the terms of the proposed decree\n\n\"are fair and not unlawful.\"              Smyth, 282 F.3d at 280.\n\n              This    background        informs   the    meaning    of    the    phrase\n\n\"appraisal of the merits\" in the \"prevailing party\" context. On the\n\nfacts here, the district court, while evaluating the fairness of the\n\nsettlement under Rule 23(e)(2), engaged in a sufficient appraisal\n\nof the merits for purposes of the imprimatur requirement.\n\n              In the process of approving the Agreement, the court\n\ncomplied fully with the requirements of Rule 23(e)(2).                          It held\n\nmultiple hearings during which it displayed its familiarity with the\n\nterms of the Agreement.             At the hearing held on July 25, 2008, the\n\ncourt expressed its satisfaction that the interests of the plaintiff\n\nclass   had    been        adequately     considered.      The    court's   extended\n\nengagement with the substance of the Agreement easily distinguishes\n\nthis case from the virtually nonexistent review conducted in Aronov,\n\n562   F.3d    at     87,    where   the    district     court    merely   entered    an\n\nelectronic docket entry granting the agreed motion to remand.                       For\n\nthese reasons, we conclude that a sufficient appraisal of the merits\n\noccurred.\n\n              This leaves the third prong of the inquiry, in which we\n\nask whether there exists \"an obligation to comply and the provision\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fof judicial oversight to enforce that obligation.\"                Id. at 91\n\n(citing Smyth, 282 F.3d at 279-81); see Petersen v. Gibson, 372 F.3d\n\n862, 866-67 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding that \"a settlement short of a\n\nconsent decree may qualify [as a basis for prevailing party status]\n\nif . . . the order provided that the court would retain jurisdiction\n\nto enforce the terms of the settlement\").\n\n             In the approval    order, the district court expressly\n\nretained jurisdiction over the case.        This fits tongue and groove\n\nwith the terms of the Agreement, which makes pellucid the parties'\n\nshared desire that the court \"retain jurisdiction to hear and\n\nadjudicate     noncompliance    motions\"   on   a   going-forward     basis.\n\nFinally, the approval order instructs that the \"case not be closed\n\nand that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of\"\n\nthe Agreement. These features distinguish the case at hand from the\n\nswath of cases in which a district court merely recognizes the fact\n\nof a settlement and dismisses the underlying action.              See, e.g.,\n\nSmith, 401 F.3d at 21; see also Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604 n.7\n\n(noting that federal jurisdiction to enforce private settlements\n\nwithin the structure of the original case is lacking unless the\n\nterms   of   the   settlement   \"are   incorporated    in   the    order   of\n\ndismissal\").\n\n             Here, moreover, the terms of the Agreement explain in some\n\ndetail the parameters of the district court's enforcement authority.\n\nIf the parties are unable to resolve compliance issues on their own,\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe plaintiffs may ask the court to determine that the Commonwealth\n\nis not living up to its obligations under the Agreement.   The court\n\nis authorized to grant equitable relief (but not to use the contempt\n\npowers) in order to achieve compliance.   If the Commonwealth fails\n\nto abide by such an order, the Agreement allows the court to \"use\n\nany appropriate equitable or remedial power then available to it.\"\n\nThe broad enforcement authority bestowed upon the district court\n\nseparates the Agreement from the mine-run of private settlements,\n\nwhich — though enforceable — require resort to an independent action\n\nfor breach of contract.       See, e.g., Aronov, 562 F.3d at 91;\n\nChristina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990, 993\n\n(8th Cir. 2003).\n\n            One other facet of the Agreement attests to the district\n\ncourt's ongoing role. The Agreement is subject to modification only\n\nupon mutual written assent of the parties and with the court's\n\nconcurrence.   The need for court approval of revisions in the terms\n\nof the Agreement closely resembles the process for amending a\n\nconventional consent decree. See Aronov, 562 F.3d at 91 (discussing\n\nprocess for modifying consent decrees); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(5).    Taken together, the approval order and the Agreement\n\nitself envision an ongoing role for the district court in the\n\ndispute.     That role includes ongoing judicial oversight.     The\n\napproval order, therefore, satisfies the third prong of the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f          We summarize succinctly.       Consideration of the three\n\npertinent factors leads inexorably to the conclusion that the\n\nAgreement, though structured as a court-approved settlement rather\n\nthan as a formal consent decree, bears a sufficient judicial\n\nimprimatur to qualify the plaintiffs as prevailing parties.        That\n\nqualification, in turn, renders them eligible for an award of\n\nattorneys' fees.3\n\n                            B.   Timing.\n\n          The Commonwealth maintains that any fee award is premature\n\nbecause (i) the \"success\" that the plaintiffs achieved was embodied\n\nin the Agreement and not in any court order; and (ii) in all events,\n\nthe order entered by the district court — the approval order — does\n\nnot constitute a final judgment.        The first of these arguments\n\n(which implicitly acknowledges that the plaintiffs have obtained\n\nsome relief on the merits) is easily dispatched. As we already have\n\nexplained, the plaintiffs' success hinges on the combined effect of\n\nthe Agreement and the approval order.      See supra Part II(A).    In\n\nview of that fact, it would be struthious — and plainly wrong — to\n\nattribute the relief obtained to the Agreement alone.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We emphasize that the mere fact that a settlement is subject\nto court approval does not in itself supply the necessary\ningredients for prevailing party status. It is the presence of\ncontinuing judicial oversight that pushes the ball across the goal\nline and thus suffices to give a settlement the required judicial\nimprimatur.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f           The plaintiffs' second argument has a certain superficial\n\nallure.   After all, merely winning a battle in an ongoing case will\n\nnot normally suffice to animate a federal fee-shifting statute. See\n\nSole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 86 (2007) (denying fees to plaintiff who\n\nwas granted preliminary injunction but was denied a permanent one);\n\nHewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987) (finding no prevailing\n\nparty   status   when   \"[t]he   most   that   [movant]   obtained   was    an\n\ninterlocutory    ruling   that   his    complaint   should   not   have   been\n\ndismissed for failure to state a constitutional claim\"); Hanrahan\n\nv. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758-59 (1980) (denying fees to plaintiffs\n\nwho successfully secured vacation of a judgment against them,\n\nyielding a new trial).\n\n           This does not mean, however, that a fee award always must\n\nawait full litigation of a case and the entry of a final judgment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made it transparently clear that an award\n\nunder a federal fee-shifting statute may sometimes be appropriate\n\nprior to the entry of a final judgment.        Tex. State Teachers Ass'n,\n\n489 U.S. at 791.    Such an award is proper, pendente lite, \"where a\n\nparty 'has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits\n\nof his claims.'\"     Id. at 790 (quoting Hanrahan, 446 U.S. at 757).\n\nThus, prevailing party status is not restricted to a party who has\n\nsecured a favorable final judgment.        LaRouche v. Kezer, 20 F.3d 68,\n\n71 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f           The question, then, is whether the plaintiffs, at this\n\nstage, can be said to have succeeded on significant claims affording\n\nthem some of the desired relief.             Like the lower court, we think\n\nthat they have.\n\n           The Court has indicated that civil rights plaintiffs who\n\nobtain enforceable relief by means of a consent decree or court-\n\napproved settlement may be entitled to attorneys' fees.             Maher v.\n\nGagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980). \"The fact that [a party] prevailed\n\nthrough a settlement rather than through litigation does not weaken\n\nher claim to fees.\"      Id.   So long as there is a judicial imprimatur\n\non the relief obtained, fees may follow.4\n\n           To be sure, this leaves open a question as to whether the\n\nsettlement is sufficiently final to bear the weight of a fee award.\n\nPut another way, does it mark the achievement of a significant\n\nmeasure of relief on the plaintiffs' claims?            Here too the focus on\n\nfunction   over   form    that   we   embraced     in   Aronov   informs   our\n\n\n\n     4\n       In Buckhannon, the Supreme Court emphasized that its earlier\ndecision in Maher continued to stand for the proposition that a\nconsent decree may serve as the basis for a fee award. 532 U.S. at\n604.   The Court noted, however, that any suggestion that Maher\nallowed for the recovery of fees for private settlements was\nmisplaced because such agreements \"do not entail the judicial\napproval and oversight involved in consent decrees.\" Id. at 604\nn.7. We think that, in light of the functional grounds on which\nthe Buckhannon Court distinguished private settlements from consent\ndecrees, its statement, consistent with our analysis in Aronov,\nsuggests that Maher allows for the award of fees in the case of a\nsettlement that does entail judicial approval and continuing\njudicial oversight (similar to what is involved in connection with\na consent decree).\n\n                                      -18-\n\funderstanding of whether the timing is appropriate for a fee award.\n\nViewed in that perspective, the question demands an affirmative\n\nanswer.    See, e.g., Richardson v. Miller, 279 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)     (implicitly    recognizing      that   a   settlement   that    was\n\nfunctionally similar to a consent decree could serve as the basis\n\nfor an award of fees).\n\n            This litigation has reached a significant plateau. In the\n\nAgreement, the parties characterize the settlement as \"final\" and\n\n\"comprehensive.\"        Moreover,   the   Agreement,   embellished   by   the\n\napproval order, affords meaningful relief to the plaintiff class and\n\nbears the requisite hallmarks of judicial approbation and oversight.\n\nSee supra Part II(A).      Thus, this case is unlike Wyner, Hewitt, or\n\nHanrahan, in which the fee-seeker achieved only some fleeting\n\nsuccess at a time when the litigation had yet to run its course.\n\nThis case, while not yet closed, is not currently being litigated;\n\nit has been settled and, therefore, the litigation, as a practical\n\nmatter, has drawn to a close.\n\n            The Commonwealth notes that there exists the possibility\n\nthat litigation could be resumed (if, say, it is unable to secure\n\nfunding and, thus, to follow through on the commitments embodied in\n\nthe Agreement).     But this sort of latent uncertainty exists in\n\nvirtually every case; even a final judgment can be appealed, see\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4, or reopened in certain circumstances, see, e.g.,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).      Such a bare possibility does not, in and of\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fitself, inject a sufficient level of uncertainty to make a fee award\n\npremature.    See generally Tex. State Teachers Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792\n\n(explaining that, at minimum, a prevailing party \"must be able to\n\npoint to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal\n\nrelationship     between    itself    and    the   defendant\"   and   that   an\n\ninsignificant \"technical victory\" would not suffice).\n\n                             C.    Reasonableness.\n\n             As a fallback, the Commonwealth challenges the size of the\n\nfee award.    For this purpose, we treat case law under the Fees Act,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other federal fees clarifying statutes, as\n\npersuasive authority.       See Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. R.,\n\n321 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003); New Hampshire v. Adams, 159 F.3d\n\n680, 684 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             \"[B]ecause determination of the extent of a reasonable fee\n\nnecessarily involves a series of judgment calls, an appellate court\n\nis far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee\n\ncomputations than in many other situations.\" Lipsett v. Blanco, 975\n\nF.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992).          Consequently, appellate review is\n\nfor abuse of discretion.          Burke v. McDonald, 572 F.3d 51, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2009); Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288,\n\n292 (1st Cir. 2001).        Within this rubric, a material error of law\n\nalways   constitutes   an    abuse    of    discretion.    Torres-Rivera     v.\n\nO'Neill-Cancel, 524 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 2008).              But apart from\n\nissues of law, \"we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fappears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant\n\nweight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper\n\nfactors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in\n\nweighing them.\"    Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292-93.\n\n            When fashioning a fee award, the district court ordinarily\n\nstarts by constructing what has come to be known as the lodestar.\n\nSee Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn, 130 S. Ct. 1662, 1672 (2010).\n\nIn general, the lodestar is the product of the number of hours\n\nappropriately worked times a reasonable hourly rate or rates.\n\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983); Gay Officers Action\n\nLeague, 247 F.3d at 295.      The party seeking the award has the burden\n\nof producing materials that support the request.         Hensley, 461 U.S.\n\nat 433.     These materials should include counsel's contemporaneous\n\ntime and billing records, suitably detailed, and information anent\n\nthe law firm's standard billing rates.        Gay Officers Action League,\n\n247 F.3d at 295-96.        The putative payor may submit countervailing\n\nevidence.    See, e.g., Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 20-21\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).      The court, usually after hearing arguments, will\n\nthen \"calculate[] the time counsel spent on the case, subtract[]\n\nduplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and . . . appl[y]\n\nprevailing    rates   in    the   community   (taking   into   account    the\n\nqualifications,    experience,     and   specialized    competence   of   the\n\nattorneys involved).\"       Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 295.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           In the instant case, the plaintiffs moved for an award of\n\nfees (including expenses) in the amount of $786,123.                  This figure\n\nincluded $775,136 in fees and $10,987 in expenses.               Billing rates\n\nranged   from    $250/hr.   to    $425/hr.    depending   on    the    skill   and\n\nexperience of the lawyer rendering a particular service.                   Travel\n\ntime, where separately delineated in the motion for fees, was\n\ninvoiced at a flat rate of $150/hr.\n\n           The plaintiffs buttressed their motion with an array of\n\nsupporting documents.       In mounting its opposition to the dollar\n\namount   of     the   request,    the   Commonwealth      relied      mainly    on\n\nargumentation, not evidence (although it did point to other, more\n\nmodest awards that had been made in unrelated cases).             After hearing\n\nprotracted arguments, the district court awarded the plaintiffs\n\nexactly what they requested.\n\n           On appeal, the Commonwealth contests the reasonableness of\n\nthis award on three grounds: (i) that it compensates the plaintiffs\n\nfor unnecessary work; (ii) that the rates used in formulating the\n\naward are inordinately high; and (iii) that many of the costs and\n\nexpense items claimed are not recoverable as part of a fee-shifting\n\naward.   We address each of these plaints separately.\n\n           1.     Time   Spent.      The     Commonwealth's    assault    on   the\n\ntemporal component of the fee award rests on an assertion that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by choosing not to pare the\n\ntotal number of hours claimed by the plaintiffs.              Specifically, the\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fCommonwealth insists that the plaintiffs overstaffed the case and\n\nthat the district court should have carved out time spent in\n\nprofligate   duplication     of     effort       and   other    unnecessary    or\n\nunreimbursable     endeavors,      such     as     intramural     conferencing,\n\nsettlement negotiations prior to the commencement of the action, and\n\ntravel.   We do not agree.\n\n           The Commonwealth's principal lament relates to staffing.\n\nIn   evaluating   this   plaint,    we    are    mindful   that   there   is   no\n\nmathematically precise formula for staffing complex litigation.\n\nEach case is different, and the trial court is \"uniquely positioned\n\nto weigh the parties' staffing needs, assess the reasonableness of\n\ntheir handling of the case, and evaluate the quality and relevance\n\nof the services rendered.\"        Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at\n\n298.\n\n           We focus first on the plaintiffs' enlistment of a number\n\nof different lawyers, many of whom worked collectively on specific\n\nprojects within the broader litigation. Such staffing practices are\n\nnot forbidden in fee-shifting cases; parties sometimes are justified\n\nin making a strategic choice to use teams of lawyers in various\n\nphases of complex litigation.        See id. at 297 (explaining that \"the\n\nmere fact that more than one lawyer toils on the same general task\n\ndoes not necessarily constitute excessive staffing\"). And where the\n\ndeployment of multiple attorneys on a single project is reasonable,\n\nthat staffing pattern inevitably results in a need for some amount\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fof coordination, including intramural conferencing.                 Everything\n\nturns on the reasonableness of the staffing patterns employed and\n\nthe   overall   time   spent.    See   Torres-Rivera,   524    F.3d    at   336\n\n(explaining that reasonableness in the context of time management\n\n\"is largely a matter of informed judgment\").\n\n           When all is said and done, staffing must be appraised on\n\na case-by-case basis.      See, e.g., Gay Officers Action League, 247\n\nF.3d at 298.      Here, the plaintiffs accounted for a modicum of\n\noverstaffing by eliminating some time spent by two of their lawyers\n\nand completely disregarding the hours worked by some minor players\n\nbefore formulating their fee request. The district court, which was\n\nintimately familiar with the demands of this unusually complicated\n\ncase, found the remaining hours spent to be reasonable.               Had the\n\nCommonwealth submitted evidence opposing the request — for example,\n\naffidavits    attesting   that   private   clients   would    not   typically\n\nconsent to staffing patterns like those used by the plaintiffs in\n\nthis case — the district court might have viewed the question\n\ndifferently.    We certainly would have.     Nor has the Commonwealth in\n\nlieu of an affidavit cited to us analogous cases in support of its\n\ncontention that this case was simply overstaffed.       In the absence of\n\nsuch information, though the district court's assessment is one on\n\nwhich reasonable minds could disagree, it was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f          Much the same approach can be taken to the Commonwealth's\n\ncomplaint about travel time.   Travel is often a necessary incident\n\nof litigation,5 and an attorney's travel time may be reimbursed in\n\na fee award.   See, e.g., Maceira v. Pagan, 698 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n1983). Although compensation for such time ordinarily is calculated\n\nat an hourly rate lower than that which applies to the attorney's\n\nsubstantive labors, see, e.g., id., there is no hard-and-fast rule\n\nestablishing what percentage of an attorney's standard billing rate\n\nis appropriate for travel time.\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop, the Commonwealth's broadside\n\nagainst travel time misses the mark.       Some of the plaintiffs'\n\nlawyers charged for travel time at a reduced rate and those that did\n\nnot provide a designated travel rate billed for travel time (as for\n\ntheir other work) at rates substantially below their customary\n\nbilling rates.   All of the submissions tied the quantum of travel to\n\nwork that the district court found appropriate.        The award of\n\namounts attributable to travel time was, therefore, not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          The Commonwealth also excoriates the inclusion of time\n\nspent in performing legal work prior to the commencement of suit.\n\n\"[P]re-suit fees may be awarded . . . only for 'discrete' work 'that\n\n\n\n     5\n       In this case, some travel was essential.     The case was\npending in the western division of the District of Massachusetts,\nsitting in Springfield, and the plaintiffs' lawyers were based in\nBoston (some 90 miles away).\n\n                                  -25-\n\fwas both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the\n\n. . . litigation to the stage it reached.'\"     Schneider v. Colegio de\n\nAbogados de P.R., 187 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Webb v.\n\nBd. of Educ. of Dyer Cnty., Tenn., 471 U.S. 234, 243 (1985)); see\n\nalso Bogan v. City of Boston, 489 F.3d 417, 427 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nThe district court found, at least implicitly, that the pre-suit\n\nhours lodged here fall within this taxonomy.          We think that this\n\njudgment call was within the encincture of the court's discretion.\n\n          Having dealt with the Commonwealth's specific plaints, we\n\nneed not tarry over its global objection to the fee award.             In\n\nconjunction with their motion for fees, the plaintiffs submitted\n\ndetailed records that itemized their work on the case over a period\n\nof several years. In addition, they submitted affidavits from three\n\nof their counsel describing each lawyer's role in the litigation and\n\nthe specific contributions that he or she had made to the case.       The\n\nplaintiffs   also   submitted   affidavits   from   brain-injury   experts\n\nspeaking to the significance of the relief obtained.\n\n          The district court had the benefit of these materials. It\n\n(understandably) gave considerable weight to the fact that the\n\nplaintiffs discounted the total number of hours before compiling\n\ntheir fee request, electing to eschew compensation for a portion of\n\nthe time that they had worked.      As a result of this self-pruning,\n\nthe requested fee, in the district court's estimation, was actually\n\nlower than the lodestar.    The fee award in this case was certainly\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fquite generous.        On this record, however, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in declining to reduce even\n\nfurther the total number of hours that the plaintiffs used as the\n\nmultiplicand in the calculation of fees.\n\n             2.     Rates.    The Commonwealth also challenges the rates\n\nthat the plaintiffs utilized in seeking fees.               It suggests that the\n\nuse of such exorbitant rates as a basis for the fee award results in\n\na windfall.\n\n             There is no universal market rate for legal services.\n\nRather, \"[r]easonable hourly rates will vary depending on the nature\n\nof   the    work,    the     locality   in     which   it   is    performed,   the\n\nqualifications of the lawyers, and other criteria.\"                  United States\n\nv. One Star Class Sloop Sailboat, 546 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir. 2008);\n\nsee Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984).               There are, however,\n\nsome generally accepted guideposts.\n\n             One such rule of thumb is that the rate that a private\n\nlawyer actually charges to clients in the ordinary course of his\n\npractice, though not conclusive, is a useful indicator of market\n\nvalue.     One Star Class Sloop Sailboat, 546 F.3d at 40.             Another rule\n\nof thumb is that data evidencing the prevailing market rate for\n\ncounsel     of    comparable    skill    and    experience       provides   helpful\n\nguidance.        See Blum, 465 U.S. at 895 & n.11.          The fee-seeker must\n\ncarry the burden of establishing the prevailing hourly rate (or\n\nschedule of rates) in the community for the performance of similar\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\flegal services by comparably credentialled counsel.         See Bordanaro\n\nv. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1168 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          The rates applied and awarded in this case are amply\n\nsupported.    In     their   motion   papers,    the   plaintiffs   sought\n\ncompensation at hourly rates ranging from $250/hr. to $425/hr.        The\n\nindividual lawyers fell into two groups: lawyers from the nonprofit\n\nCenter for Public Interest and lawyers from the Boston office of a\n\nnational law firm.\n\n          As to the former, the rates used were identical to those\n\nthat the same lawyers had previously received in civil rights cases.\n\nSee, e.g., Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Patrick, 593 F. Supp. 2d 325,\n\n331 (D. Mass. 2009).      Moreover, the rates were relatively modest\n\nwhen compared to the standard rates charged by their counterparts in\n\nprivate law firms.\n\n          As to the law firm, the rates charged were pretty much the\n\nsame as those received by the firm in a recently concluded public\n\ninterest case.     See id. at 330-31.          Those rates were in many\n\ninstances substantially below the standard billing rates charged by\n\nthe private attorneys.6      See id. at 330.\n\n          In passing upon the reasonableness of the rates, the court\n\nbelow considered the rates approved in Rosie D., a case in which the\n\n\n\n     6\n       For example, the standard billing rate for the most\naccomplished member of the law firm was $725/hr., but the\nplaintiffs used a rate of $425/hr. for his time in formulating\ntheir fee request.\n\n                                   -28-\n\ffee award against the Commonwealth was not appealed.          The court also\n\nconsidered affidavits executed by an independent expert on fees and\n\nby two public interest lawyers practicing in Massachusetts. Each of\n\nthose   affiants   opined   that   the   suggested   rates   were   not   only\n\nreasonable but also below the market rates for the types of work\n\nperformed by the caliber of lawyers involved.\n\n           We think it is significant that, despite the ferocity of\n\nthe Commonwealth's attack on the rates, it presented no evidence of\n\na countervailing rate structure.         The Supreme Court has admonished\n\nthat, where a party opposing a motion for fees fails to submit \"any\n\nevidence challenging the accuracy and reasonableness\" of the facts\n\nasserted in connection with a supported fee request, that failure\n\nmay amount to a waiver of the right to challenge the district\n\ncourt's determination regarding the reasonableness of the request on\n\nappeal.   Blum, 465 U.S. at 892 n.5.         Where as here, a prevailing\n\nparty submits a supported application for fees, the fee-target runs\n\na risk if it chooses to do no more than criticize the rates\n\nrequested and point to the fact that some other judge, in some other\n\ncase, has embraced a different set of rates.         Foley, 948 F.2d at 21\n\n(\"The City, of course, had an opportunity to adduce evidence of a\n\nmore realistic rate structure, but did not do so.            Absent any such\n\nevidence, we are hard pressed to fault the lower court for embracing\n\nthe plaintiff's suggested rates.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f           To say more on this point would be to paint the lily.            In\n\nlight of the supporting documentation provided by the plaintiffs and\n\nthe Commonwealth's failure to produce or point to contradictory\n\nevidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in fashioning a fee award premised on the suggested\n\nrates.\n\n           3.    Expenses.      The Commonwealth challenges the district\n\ncourt's allowance of certain expenses and cost items, including\n\ncharges for travel, printing, and photocopying.              The Commonwealth\n\nasserts that these charges should have been disallowed because they\n\nwere not \"directly associated\" with the litigation.             This argument\n\nseems to rest largely on the notion that expenses, not recoverable\n\nas costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1920, are not independently recoverable\n\nat all but, rather, comprise a part of the lawyers' overhead.\n\n           This assertion consists of more cry than wool.               It is\n\nsettled beyond peradventure that reasonable expenses, necessary for\n\nthe prosecution of a case, are ancillary to and may be incorporated\n\nas part of a fee award under a prototypical federal fee-shifting\n\nstatute.    See Palmigiano v. Garrahy, 707 F.2d 636, 637 (1st Cir.\n\n1983)    (per   curiam);   see    also    42   U.S.C.   §   12205   (including\n\n\"litigation expenses, and costs\" as components of allowable fee\n\nawards).        Contrary   to    the     Commonwealth's     implication,   the\n\navailability of such remediation is not limited to items recoverable\n\nas court costs under section 1920.         Rather, such recovery can extend\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fto a broad range of other items, including travel expenses, computer\n\ntime, and the like.      See Attrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp., 436 F.3d 32,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2006) (explaining that \"such items may be recovered\n\nwhere appropriate as part of attorneys' fees under the typical\n\nfederal fee-shifting statute\").\n\n            The   Commonwealth's   challenge   to   the   amount   of   costs\n\nawarded for printing — an expense explicitly listed as taxable under\n\nsection 1920 — is equally unavailing.            The ADA's fee-shifting\n\nprovision clearly includes \"costs\" as part of an allowable fee\n\naward, and in combination with the express terms of section 1920,\n\nthis renders the Commonwealth's bare assertion that printing costs\n\n\"have been repeatedly rejected as 'unrecoverable overhead'\" wholly\n\nunconvincing.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.          We hold, without\n\nserious question, that reasonable costs and expenses for travel,\n\nprinting, and photocopying can be recovered in a fee-shifting\n\nproceeding without regard to the limitations contained in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1920.    Because the Commonwealth has not contested either the fact\n\nor   the   amount   of    the   expenditures   targeted    here,   awarding\n\nreimbursement of them did not constitute an abuse of the trial\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.      For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe   uphold    the   district   court's    award   of   attorneys'   fees   and\n\nexpenses.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\f",

The appeal also requires us to consider when, short of the entry of a final judgment, \"prevailing party\" status may attach.</p>\n<p>These questions (and the other questions before us) arise in the following setting. After the parties reached a negotiated settlement resolving the substance of a complicated class action, the district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and expenses totaling over three-quarters of a million dollars. The defendants appeal, asseverating that the district court improperly characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties; acted prematurely in arriving at that conclusion; and to add insult to injury, set the amount of the award too generously. We conclude that the district court appropriately characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties, that the relief obtained was sufficiently final to justify a fee award, and that the court acted within the purview of its discretion in fixing the amount. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 17, 2007, the named plaintiffs several individuals with acquired brain injuries who qualify for long-term care services under the Medicaid program and two organizations devoted to their cause (the Brain Injury Association of Massachusetts and the Stavros Center for Independent Living)filed suit to compel the defendants various officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (collectively, the Commonwealth)to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and the reasonable promptness provision of the Medicaid program as set forth in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)(A), by offering services and programs for individuals with acquired brain injuries in integrated community settings. The Commonwealth filed an answering motion, which triggered a spate of motion practice.</p>\n<p>On July 13, 2007, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. They then served an array of discovery requests. The Commonwealth cross-moved to stay discovery pending a decision on class certification. The district court granted a stay.</p>\n<p>On September 26, 2007, the court certified a class. Shortly thereafter, the parties began settlement negotiations in earnest and agreed to suspend discovery while negotiations proceeded. The talks proved fruitful and, on May 30, 2008, the parties executed a settlement agreement (the Agreement) that they described as \"final\" and \"comprehensive.\"</p>\n<p>In terms, the Agreement required the Commonwealth, over a period of years, to expand community services (residential and non-residential) for Medicaid-eligible individuals with acquired brain injuries. To this end, the Commonwealth is charged with developing several new projects and programs. The Commonwealth's responsibilities are, however, subject to its ability to secure both funding from the state legislature and necessary approvals from the federal government. With respect to these matters, the Agreement impresses an obligation on the Commonwealth to use best efforts. If the Commonwealth is unable to obtain funding or approvals and the Agreement stalls, either side may move to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> vacate the settlement so that the plaintiffs can litigate the case.</p>\n<p>The Agreement contemplates that the case will remain open for a period of years while the Commonwealth performs thereunder; it authorizes dismissal of the action only after the Commonwealth has completed certain specified obligations and is found to be in \"substantial compliance\" with the Agreement's terms. The Agreement further provides that the district court \"shall retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions.\"</p>\n<p>Because the district court had certified a class, the Agreement required judicial approval. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). The parties jointly moved for this approval and, after a preliminary fairness hearing, the district court allowed the approval process to move forward. The court acknowledged, at the Commonwealth's urging, that the Agreement memorialized a settlement and was not tendered as a consent decree.</p>\n<p>After the class members were notified of the proposed settlement, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1), the district court held a final fairness hearing. The court again noted that the Agreement \"does not constitute a consent decree but is a settlement agreement of this disputed case.\" The plaintiffs suggested that the court approve the Agreement by entering it as a court order, but the Commonwealth objected. The court expressed its willingness to indicate, either orally or through a written order, its finding that the Agreement represented a fair and appropriate resolution of the matter. It then asked the parties to submit a draft of a proposed order for approval of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>On July 29, 2008, each side submitted a proposed order. The parties disagreed as to whether the court needed explicitly to retain jurisdiction as a means of facilitating subsequent enforcement of the Agreement. In an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds, the district court suggested the following language:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he court approves the comprehensive settlement agreement. This case will not be closed and judgment will not enter pending compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p>This suggestion did not please anyone. The plaintiffs feared that, without language explicitly retaining enforcement jurisdiction, the court's authority might be questioned in the event that further compliance proceedings become necessary. For its part, the Commonwealth expressed concern that the court's words might be transformed into the functional equivalent of a consent decree. The Commonwealth noted that, in the course of settlement negotiations, it had consistently maintained its unwillingness to resolve the case by means of \"a document that could be functionally a consent decree.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this impasse, the district court took the matter under advisement. On September 18, 2008, the court, acting without further input from the parties, entered a final approval order. The order states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he court finds that the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Therefore, the court approves the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, noting that the parties agree that this agreement does not constitute a consent decree, and that the court will retain jurisdiction over the case. The court orders that this case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p>The entry of the approval order set the stage for the developments leading to this appeal. The plaintiffs, claiming to be prevailing parties, moved for an award of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> attorneys' fees (including costs) in the amount of $786,123.<sup>[1]</sup> The Commonwealth disputed the \"prevailing party\" characterization, the timing of the motion for fees, and the reasonableness of the requested award. The district court found that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, that fees were presently allowable, and that the amount sought was \"eminently fair.\" Accordingly, it awarded the plaintiffs the full amount sought. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth prosecutes this appeal on three fronts. First it asserts that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties and that, therefore, they are not entitled to a fee award. Second, it questions the timing of the plaintiffs' quest for fees. Its fallback position is that, even if we find its first two points unconvincing, the district court nevertheless committed an abuse of discretion in determining the size of the award. We consider these assertions sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Prevailing Party Status.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a determination of \"prevailing party\" status de novo. <i>Aronov v. Napolitano,</i> 562 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2009) (en banc); <i>Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch.,</i> 401 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2005). Fee-shifting statutes represent a departure from the historic American rule, which dictates that parties to a case normally will bear their own counsel fees and costs. <i>See </i><i>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y,</i> 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). When, as in this case, the application of such a statute cuts through the government's traditional sovereign immunity, it \"must be construed strictly in favor of the government.\" <i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 88 (citing <i>Ardestani v. INS,</i> 502 U.S. 129, 137, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (1991)).</p>\n<p>The text of the ADA's fee-shifting provision reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote>In any action or administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court or agency, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs, and the United States shall be liable for the foregoing the same as a private individual.</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. § 12205. When used in a federal fee-shifting statute, \"the term `prevailing party' [is] a legal term of art.\" <i>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Res.,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 603, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). The concepts that shape the term apply broadly to the entire universe of federal fee-shifting statutes.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 22 n. 8; <i>Doe v. Boston Pub. Sch.,</i> 358 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>To qualify as a prevailing party, a litigant must show that a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship has taken place as a result of the litigation. <i>Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989). In addition, a party must demonstrate that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> the alteration possesses a \"judicial <i>imprimatur.\" </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (emphasis in original). We need only discuss the second of these requirements here, as the Commonwealth asserts that the \"plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the judicial imprimatur requirement.\"</p>\n<p>The <i>Buckhannon</i> Court identified only two situations in which this judicial imprimatur requirement would necessarily be satisfied: where the plaintiff \"received a judgment on the merits\" or where she \"obtained a court-ordered consent decree.\" <i>Id.</i> The Justices left open the question of whether (and if so, under what circumstances) a court-approved settlement that is not embodied in a formal consent decree may serve as the gateway to \"prevailing party\" status. The case at hand requires us to ponder this question.</p>\n<p>We do not write on a pristine page: our recent en banc opinion in <i>Aronov</i> provides guidance. There, we indicated that an order short of a formal consent decree might be sufficient for this purpose. 562 F.3d at 90. We emphasized, however, that this inquiry must focus on substance, not form. It follows that it is the function of the order that carries the most weight in determining whether it may serve as the linchpin for \"prevailing party\" status. <i>See id.</i> (explaining that \"it is the reality, not the nomenclature which is at issue\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 90 n. 7 (collecting cases from other circuits reaching the same conclusion). Thus, rather than look exclusively at the label attached to a particular order, an inquiring court must consider \"whether the order contains the sort of judicial involvement and actions inherent in a `court ordered consent decree.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 90.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that <i>Aronov</i> directs us to ignore the Agreement itself and look exclusively at the approval order when mulling whether the order contains elements inherent in a conventional consent decree. That is too crabbed a reading of <i>Aronov.</i> Indeed, such a myopic approach would be at odds with <i>Aronov's</i> instruction that \"[w]hether an order contains a sufficient judicial imprimatur can only be determined by determining the content of the order <i>against the entire context before the court.\" Id.</i> at 92 (emphasis supplied); <i>cf. </i><i>Smyth ex rel. Smyth v. Rivero,</i> 282 F.3d 268, 279 (4th Cir.2002) (examining whether agreement and dismissal order \"were, in combination, equivalent to a consent decree\"). We thus construe the approval order in light of both the content of the Agreement itself and its entire context.</p>\n<p>Our inquiry looks to three factors. The first factor is whether the change in the legal relationship between the parties was \"court-ordered.\" <i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 90 (quoting <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835). The second factor is whether there was \"judicial approval of the relief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> The third factor is whether there exists continuing \"judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> We start with a determination of whether the change in legal relationship is court-ordered.</p>\n<p>The Agreement itself specifically provides that, in the absence of court approval, \"the Agreement shall be null and void and of no force and effect.\" Hence, it is the approval order that makes the provisions of the Agreement binding on the parties and gives bite to their reciprocal obligations. In other words, this is a situation in which the court order triggers the change in the relationship between the parties, not one in which \"the court merely recognizes what the government has voluntarily agreed to do and only `requir[es] [the government] to follow through.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 93 (alterations in original) (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 27). Given this reality, we find that the court's involvement is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>The second prong of the inquiry requires us to determine whether there has been \"judicial approval of the relief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 90. Under the Civil Rules, a court must approve a settlement in a class action and is directed to do so only if it finds the terms of the settlement \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(2); <i>see </i><i>Nat'l Ass'n of Chain Drug Stores v. New Engl. Carpenters Health Benefits Fund,</i> 582 F.3d 30, 44 (1st Cir.2009). This is strikingly similar to a court's role in entering a consent decreea role that requires a court to ensure that the terms of the proposed decree \"are fair and not unlawful.\" <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 280.</p>\n<p>This background informs the meaning of the phrase \"appraisal of the merits\" in the \"prevailing party\" context. On the facts here, the district court, while evaluating the fairness of the settlement under Rule 23(e)(2), engaged in a sufficient appraisal of the merits for purposes of the imprimatur requirement.</p>\n<p>In the process of approving the Agreement, the court complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23(e)(2). It held multiple hearings during which it displayed its familiarity with the terms of the Agreement. At the hearing held on July 25, 2008, the court expressed its satisfaction that the interests of the plaintiff class had been adequately considered. The court's extended engagement with the substance of the Agreement easily distinguishes this case from the virtually nonexistent review conducted in <i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 87, where the district court merely entered an electronic docket entry granting the agreed motion to remand. For these reasons, we conclude that a sufficient appraisal of the merits occurred.</p>\n<p>This leaves the third prong of the inquiry, in which we ask whether there exists \"an obligation to comply and the provision of judicial oversight to enforce that obligation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 91 (citing <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 279-81); <i>see </i><i>Petersen v. Gibson,</i> 372 F.3d 862, 866-67 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that \"a settlement short of a consent decree may qualify [as a basis for prevailing party status] if ... the order provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement\").</p>\n<p>In the approval order, the district court expressly retained jurisdiction over the case. This fits tongue and groove with the terms of the Agreement, which makes pellucid the parties' shared desire that the court \"retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions\" on a going-forward basis. Finally, the approval order instructs that the \"case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of\" the Agreement. These features distinguish the case at hand from the swath of cases in which a district court merely recognizes the fact of a settlement and dismisses the underlying action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 21; <i>see also </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604 n. 7, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (noting that federal jurisdiction to enforce private settlements within the structure of the original case is lacking unless the terms of the settlement \"are incorporated in the order of dismissal\").</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, the terms of the Agreement explain in some detail the parameters of the district court's enforcement authority. If the parties are unable to resolve compliance issues on their own, the plaintiffs may ask the court to determine that the Commonwealth is not living up to its obligations under the Agreement. The court is authorized to grant equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> relief (but not to use the contempt powers) in order to achieve compliance. If the Commonwealth fails to abide by such an order, the Agreement allows the court to \"use any appropriate equitable or remedial power then available to it.\" The broad enforcement authority bestowed upon the district court separates the Agreement from the mine-run of private settlements, whichthough enforceable require resort to an independent action for breach of contract. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 91; <i>Christina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v. Bloomberg,</i> 315 F.3d 990, 993 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>One other facet of the Agreement attests to the district court's ongoing role. The Agreement is subject to modification only upon mutual written assent of the parties <i>and</i> with the court's concurrence. The need for court approval of revisions in the terms of the Agreement closely resembles the process for amending a conventional consent decree. <i>See </i><i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 91 (discussing process for modifying consent decrees); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5). Taken together, the approval order and the Agreement itself envision an ongoing role for the district court in the dispute. That role includes ongoing judicial oversight. The approval order, therefore, satisfies the third prong of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>We summarize succinctly. Consideration of the three pertinent factors leads inexorably to the conclusion that the Agreement, though structured as a court-approved settlement rather than as a formal consent decree, bears a sufficient judicial imprimatur to qualify the plaintiffs as prevailing parties. That qualification, in turn, renders them eligible for an award of attorneys' fees.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Timing.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth maintains that any fee award is premature because (i) the \"success\" that the plaintiffs achieved was embodied in the Agreement and not in any court order; and (ii) in all events, the order entered by the district courtthe approval orderdoes not constitute a final judgment. The first of these arguments (which implicitly acknowledges that the plaintiffs have obtained some relief on the merits) is easily dispatched. As we already have explained, the plaintiffs' success hinges on the combined effect of the Agreement and the approval order. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). In view of that fact, it would be struthiousand plainly wrongto attribute the relief obtained to the Agreement alone.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' second argument has a certain superficial allure. After all, merely winning a battle in an ongoing case will not normally suffice to animate a federal fee-shifting statute. <i>See </i><i>Sole v. Wyner,</i> 551 U.S. 74, 86, 127 S.Ct. 2188, 167 L.Ed.2d 1069 (2007) (denying fees to plaintiff who was granted preliminary injunction but was denied a permanent one); <i>Hewitt v. Helms,</i> 482 U.S. 755, 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987) (finding no prevailing party status when \"[t]he most that [movant] obtained was an interlocutory ruling that his complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to state a constitutional claim\"); <i>Hanrahan v. Hampton,</i> 446 U.S. 754, 758-59, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (denying fees to plaintiffs who successfully secured vacation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> of a judgment against them, yielding a new trial).</p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that a fee award always must await full litigation of a case and the entry of a final judgment. The Supreme Court has made it transparently clear that an award under a federal fee-shifting statute may sometimes be appropriate prior to the entry of a final judgment. <i>Tex. State Teachers Ass'n,</i> 489 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 1486. Such an award is proper, pendente lite, \"where a party `has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 790, 109 S.Ct. 1486 (quoting <i>Hanrahan,</i> 446 U.S. at 757, 100 S.Ct. 1987). Thus, prevailing party status is not restricted to a party who has secured a favorable final judgment. <i>LaRouche v. Kezer,</i> 20 F.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the plaintiffs, at this stage, can be said to have succeeded on significant claims affording them some of the desired relief. Like the lower court, we think that they have.</p>\n<p>The Court has indicated that civil rights plaintiffs who obtain enforceable relief by means of a consent decree or court-approved settlement may be entitled to attorneys' fees. <i>Maher v. Gagne,</i> 448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). \"The fact that [a party] prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not weaken her claim to fees.\" <i>Id.</i> So long as there is a judicial imprimatur on the relief obtained, fees may follow.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>To be sure, this leaves open a question as to whether the settlement is sufficiently final to bear the weight of a fee award. Put another way, does it mark the achievement of a significant measure of relief on the plaintiffs' claims? Here too the focus on function over form that we embraced in <i>Aronov</i> informs our understanding of whether the timing is appropriate for a fee award. Viewed in that perspective, the question demands an affirmative answer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Richardson v. Miller,</i> 279 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2002) (implicitly recognizing that a settlement that was functionally similar to a consent decree could serve as the basis for an award of fees).</p>\n<p>This litigation has reached a significant plateau. In the Agreement, the parties characterize the settlement as \"final\" and \"comprehensive.\" Moreover, the Agreement, embellished by the approval order, affords meaningful relief to the plaintiff class and bears the requisite hallmarks of judicial approbation and oversight. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Thus, this case is unlike <i>Wyner, Hewitt,</i> or <i>Hanrahan,</i> in which the fee-seeker achieved only some fleeting success at a time when the litigation had yet to run its course. This case, while not yet closed, is not currently being litigated; it has been settled and, therefore, the litigation, as a practical matter, has drawn to a close.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth notes that there exists the possibility that litigation could be resumed (if, say, it is unable to secure funding and, thus, to follow through on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> commitments embodied in the Agreement). But this sort of latent uncertainty exists in virtually every case; even a final judgment can be appealed, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4, or reopened in certain circumstances, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Such a bare possibility does not, in and of itself, inject a sufficient level of uncertainty to make a fee award premature. <i>See generally </i><i>Tex. State Teachers Ass'n,</i> 489 U.S. at 792, 109 S.Ct. 1486 (explaining that, at minimum, a prevailing party \"must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant\" and that an insignificant \"technical victory\" would not suffice).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Reasonableness.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As a fallback, the Commonwealth challenges the size of the fee award. For this purpose, we treat case law under the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and other federal fees clarifying statutes, as persuasive authority. <i>See </i><i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2003); <i>New Hampshire v. Adams,</i> 159 F.3d 680, 684 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>\"[B]ecause determination of the extent of a reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls, an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.\" <i>Lipsett v. Blanco,</i> 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992). Consequently, appellate review is for abuse of discretion. <i>Burke v. McDonald,</i> 572 F.3d 51, 63 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir.2001). Within this rubric, a material error of law always constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> 524 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir.2008). But apart from issues of law, \"we will set aside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 292-93.</p>\n<p>When fashioning a fee award, the district court ordinarily starts by constructing what has come to be known as the lodestar. <i>See </i><i>Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 1672, 176 L.Ed.2d 494 (2010). In general, the lodestar is the product of the number of hours appropriately worked times a reasonable hourly rate or rates. <i>Hensley v. Eckerhart,</i> 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 295. The party seeking the award has the burden of producing materials that support the request. <i>Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933. These materials should include counsel's contemporaneous time and billing records, suitably detailed, and information anent the law firm's standard billing rates. <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 295-96. The putative payor may submit countervailing evidence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Foley v. City of Lowell,</i> 948 F.2d 10, 20-21 (1st Cir.1991). The court, usually after hearing arguments, will then \"calculate[] the time counsel spent on the case, subtract[] duplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and ... appl[y] prevailing rates in the community (taking into account the qualifications, experience, and specialized competence of the attorneys involved).\" <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the plaintiffs moved for an award of fees (including expenses) in the amount of $786,123. This figure included $775,136 in fees and $10,987 in expenses. Billing rates ranged from $250/hr. to $425/hr. depending on the skill and experience of the lawyer rendering a particular service. Travel time, where separately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> delineated in the motion for fees, was invoiced at a flat rate of $150/hr.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs buttressed their motion with an array of supporting documents. In mounting its opposition to the dollar amount of the request, the Commonwealth relied mainly on argumentation, not evidence (although it did point to other, more modest awards that had been made in unrelated cases). After hearing protracted arguments, the district court awarded the plaintiffs exactly what they requested.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Commonwealth contests the reasonableness of this award on three grounds: (i) that it compensates the plaintiffs for unnecessary work; (ii) that the rates used in formulating the award are inordinately high; and (iii) that many of the costs and expense items claimed are not recoverable as part of a fee-shifting award. We address each of these plaints separately.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Time Spent.</i> The Commonwealth's assault on the temporal component of the fee award rests on an assertion that the district court abused its discretion by choosing not to pare the total number of hours claimed by the plaintiffs. Specifically, the Commonwealth insists that the plaintiffs overstaffed the case and that the district court should have carved out time spent in profligate duplication of effort and other unnecessary or unreimbursable endeavors, such as intramural conferencing, settlement negotiations prior to the commencement of the action, and travel. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's principal lament relates to staffing. In evaluating this plaint, we are mindful that there is no mathematically precise formula for staffing complex litigation. Each case is different, and the trial court is \"uniquely positioned to weigh the parties' staffing needs, assess the reasonableness of their handling of the case, and evaluate the quality and relevance of the services rendered.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>We focus first on the plaintiffs' enlistment of a number of different lawyers, many of whom worked collectively on specific projects within the broader litigation. Such staffing practices are not forbidden in fee-shifting cases; parties sometimes are justified in making a strategic choice to use teams of lawyers in various phases of complex litigation. <i>See id.</i> at 297 (explaining that \"the mere fact that more than one lawyer toils on the same general task does not necessarily constitute excessive staffing\"). And where the deployment of multiple attorneys on a single project is reasonable, that staffing pattern inevitably results in a need for some amount of coordination, including intramural conferencing. Everything turns on the reasonableness of the staffing patterns employed and the overall time spent. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rivera,</i> 524 F.3d at 336 (explaining that reasonableness in the context of time management \"is largely a matter of informed judgment\").</p>\n<p>When all is said and done, staffing must be appraised on a case-by-case basis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 298. Here, the plaintiffs accounted for a modicum of overstaffing by eliminating some time spent by two of their lawyers and completely disregarding the hours worked by some minor players before formulating their fee request. The district court, which was intimately familiar with the demands of this unusually complicated case, found the remaining hours spent to be reasonable. Had the Commonwealth submitted evidence opposing the request for example, affidavits attesting that private clients would not typically consent to staffing patterns like those used by the plaintiffs in this casethe district court might have viewed the question differently. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> We certainly would have. Nor has the Commonwealth in lieu of an affidavit cited to us analogous cases in support of its contention that this case was simply overstaffed. In the absence of such information, though the district court's assessment is one on which reasonable minds could disagree, it was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Much the same approach can be taken to the Commonwealth's complaint about travel time. Travel is often a necessary incident of litigation,<sup>[5]</sup> and an attorney's travel time may be reimbursed in a fee award. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maceira v. Pagan,</i> 698 F.2d 38, 40 (1st Cir.1983). Although compensation for such time ordinarily is calculated at an hourly rate lower than that which applies to the attorney's substantive labors, <i>see, e.g., id.,</i> there is no hard-and-fast rule establishing what percentage of an attorney's standard billing rate is appropriate for travel time.</p>\n<p>Viewed against this backdrop, the Commonwealth's broadside against travel time misses the mark. Some of the plaintiffs' lawyers charged for travel time at a reduced rate and those that did not provide a designated travel rate billed for travel time (as for their other work) at rates substantially below their customary billing rates. All of the submissions tied the quantum of travel to work that the district court found appropriate. The award of amounts attributable to travel time was, therefore, not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth also excoriates the inclusion of time spent in performing legal work prior to the commencement of suit. \"[P]re-suit fees may be awarded ... only for `discrete' work `that was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the ... litigation to the stage it reached.'\" <i>Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de P.R.,</i> 187 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Webb v. Bd. of Educ. of Dyer Cnty., Tenn.,</i> 471 U.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985)); <i>see also </i><i>Bogan v. City of Boston,</i> 489 F.3d 417, 427 (1st Cir.2007). The district court found, at least implicitly, that the pre-suit hours lodged here fall within this taxonomy. We think that this judgment call was within the encincture of the court's discretion.</p>\n<p>Having dealt with the Commonwealth's specific plaints, we need not tarry over its global objection to the fee award. In conjunction with their motion for fees, the plaintiffs submitted detailed records that itemized their work on the case over a period of several years. In addition, they submitted affidavits from three of their counsel describing each lawyer's role in the litigation and the specific contributions that he or she had made to the case. The plaintiffs also submitted affidavits from brain-injury experts speaking to the significance of the relief obtained.</p>\n<p>The district court had the benefit of these materials. It (understandably) gave considerable weight to the fact that the plaintiffs discounted the total number of hours before compiling their fee request, electing to eschew compensation for a portion of the time that they had worked. As a result of this self-pruning, the requested fee, in the district court's estimation, was actually <i>lower</i> than the lodestar. The fee award in this case was certainly quite generous. On this record, however, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to reduce even further the total number of hours that the plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> used as the multiplicand in the calculation of fees.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Rates.</i> The Commonwealth also challenges the rates that the plaintiffs utilized in seeking fees. It suggests that the use of such exorbitant rates as a basis for the fee award results in a windfall.</p>\n<p>There is no universal market rate for legal services. Rather, \"[r]easonable hourly rates will vary depending on the nature of the work, the locality in which it is performed, the qualifications of the lawyers, and other criteria.\" <i>United States v. One Star Class Sloop Sailboat,</i> 546 F.3d 26, 38 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see </i><i>Blum v. Stenson,</i> 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). There are, however, some generally accepted guideposts.</p>\n<p>One such rule of thumb is that the rate that a private lawyer actually charges to clients in the ordinary course of his practice, though not conclusive, is a useful indicator of market value. <i>One Star Class Sloop Sailboat,</i> 546 F.3d at 40. Another rule of thumb is that data evidencing the prevailing market rate for counsel of comparable skill and experience provides helpful guidance. <i>See </i><i>Blum,</i> 465 U.S. at 895 &amp; n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541. The fee-seeker must carry the burden of establishing the prevailing hourly rate (or schedule of rates) in the community for the performance of similar legal services by comparably credentialled counsel. <i>See </i><i>Bordanaro v. McLeod,</i> 871 F.2d 1151, 1168 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>The rates applied and awarded in this case are amply supported. In their motion papers, the plaintiffs sought compensation at hourly rates ranging from $250/hr. to $425/hr. The individual lawyers fell into two groups: lawyers from the nonprofit Center for Public Interest and lawyers from the Boston office of a national law firm.</p>\n<p>As to the former, the rates used were identical to those that the same lawyers had previously received in civil rights cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Patrick,</i> 593 F.Supp.2d 325, 331 (D.Mass. 2009). Moreover, the rates were relatively modest when compared to the standard rates charged by their counterparts in private law firms.</p>\n<p>As to the law firm, the rates charged were pretty much the same as those received by the firm in a recently concluded public interest case. <i>See id.</i> at 330-31. Those rates were in many instances substantially below the standard billing rates charged by the private attorneys.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 330.</p>\n<p>In passing upon the reasonableness of the rates, the court below considered the rates approved in <i>Rosie D.,</i> a case in which the fee award against the Commonwealth was not appealed. The court also considered affidavits executed by an independent expert on fees and by two public interest lawyers practicing in Massachusetts. Each of those affiants opined that the suggested rates were not only reasonable but also below the market rates for the types of work performed by the caliber of lawyers involved.</p>\n<p>We think it is significant that, despite the ferocity of the Commonwealth's attack on the rates, it presented no evidence of a countervailing rate structure. The Supreme Court has admonished that, where a party opposing a motion for fees fails to submit \"any evidence challenging the accuracy and reasonableness\" of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> facts asserted in connection with a supported fee request, that failure may amount to a waiver of the right to challenge the district court's determination regarding the reasonableness of the request on appeal. <i>Blum,</i> 465 U.S. at 892 n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 1541. Where as here, a prevailing party submits a supported application for fees, the fee-target runs a risk if it chooses to do no more than criticize the rates requested and point to the fact that some other judge, in some other case, has embraced a different set of rates. <i>Foley,</i> 948 F.2d at 21 (\"The City, of course, had an opportunity to adduce evidence of a more realistic rate structure, but did not do so. Absent any such evidence, we are hard pressed to fault the lower court for embracing the plaintiff's suggested rates.\").</p>\n<p>To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. In light of the supporting documentation provided by the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth's failure to produce or point to contradictory evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning a fee award premised on the suggested rates.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Expenses.</i> The Commonwealth challenges the district court's allowance of certain expenses and cost items, including charges for travel, printing, and photocopying. The Commonwealth asserts that these charges should have been disallowed because they were not \"directly associated\" with the litigation. This argument seems to rest largely on the notion that expenses, not recoverable as costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1920, are not independently recoverable at all but, rather, comprise a part of the lawyers' overhead.</p>\n<p>This assertion consists of more cry than wool. It is settled beyond peradventure that reasonable expenses, necessary for the prosecution of a case, are ancillary to and may be incorporated as part of a fee award under a prototypical federal fee-shifting statute. <i>See </i><i>Palmigiano v. Garrahy,</i> 707 F.2d 636, 637 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (including \"litigation expenses, and costs\" as components of allowable fee awards). Contrary to the Commonwealth's implication, the availability of such remediation is not limited to items recoverable as court costs under section 1920. Rather, such recovery can extend to a broad range of other items, including travel expenses, computer time, and the like. <i>See </i><i>Attrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp.,</i> 436 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that \"such items may be recovered where appropriate as part of attorneys' fees under the typical federal fee-shifting statute\").</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's challenge to the amount of costs awarded for printingan expense explicitly listed as taxable under section 1920is equally unavailing. The ADA's fee-shifting provision clearly includes \"costs\" as part of an allowable fee award, and in combination with the express terms of section 1920, this renders the Commonwealth's bare assertion that printing costs \"have been repeatedly rejected as `unrecoverable overhead'\" wholly unconvincing.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. We hold, without serious question, that reasonable costs and expenses for travel, printing, and photocopying can be recovered in a fee-shifting proceeding without regard to the limitations contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Because the Commonwealth has not contested either the fact or the amount of the expenditures targeted here, awarding reimbursement of them did not constitute an abuse of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> court's award of attorneys' fees and expenses.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiffs' motion was, by its terms, brought \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 42 U.S.C. § 12205.\" The language of these two fee-shifting provisions is virtually identical in all material respects. Following the lead of the parties and the district court, we treat the ADA's fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, as the operative statute.</p>\n<p>[2]  In any event, the key precedent is <i>Buckhannon,</i> and the Court there dealt in part, as we do here, with the ADA's fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205. <i>See </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 601, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n<p>[3]  We emphasize that the mere fact that a settlement is subject to court approval does not in itself supply the necessary ingredients for prevailing party status. It is the presence of <i>continuing judicial oversight</i> that pushes the ball across the goal line and thus suffices to give a settlement the required judicial imprimatur.</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>Buckhannon,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that its earlier decision in <i>Maher</i> continued to stand for the proposition that a consent decree may serve as the basis for a fee award. 532 U.S. at 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835. The Court noted, however, that any suggestion that <i>Maher</i> allowed for the recovery of fees for private settlements was misplaced because such agreements \"do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 604 n. 7, 121 S.Ct. 1835. We think that, in light of the functional grounds on which the <i>Buckhannon</i> Court distinguished private settlements from consent decrees, its statement, consistent with our analysis in <i>Aronov,</i> suggests that <i>Maher</i> allows for the award of fees in the case of a settlement that <i>does</i> entail judicial approval and continuing judicial oversight (similar to what is involved in connection with a consent decree).</p>\n<p>[5]  In this case, some travel was essential. The case was pending in the western division of the District of Massachusetts, sitting in Springfield, and the plaintiffs' lawyers were based in Boston (some 90 miles away).</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the standard billing rate for the most accomplished member of the law firm was $725/hr., but the plaintiffs used a rate of $425/hr. for his time in formulating their fee request.</p>\n\n</div>",

The appeal also requires us to consider when, short of the entry of a final judgment, \"prevailing party\" status may attach.</p>\n<p>These questions (and the other questions before us) arise in the following setting. After the parties reached a negotiated settlement resolving the substance of a complicated class action, the district court awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and expenses totaling over three-quarters of a million dollars. The defendants appeal, asseverating that the district court improperly characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties; acted prematurely in arriving at that conclusion; and to add insult to injury, set the amount of the award too generously. We conclude that the district court appropriately characterized the plaintiffs as prevailing parties, that the relief obtained was sufficiently final to justify a fee award, and that the court acted within the purview of its discretion in fixing the amount. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 17, 2007, the named plaintiffs several individuals with acquired brain injuries who qualify for long-term care services under the Medicaid program and two organizations devoted to their cause (the Brain Injury Association of Massachusetts and the Stavros Center for Independent Living)filed suit to compel the defendants various officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (collectively, the Commonwealth)to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and the reasonable promptness provision of the Medicaid program as set forth in the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)(A), by offering services and programs for individuals with acquired brain injuries in integrated community settings. The Commonwealth filed an answering motion, which triggered a spate of motion practice.</p>\n<p>On July 13, 2007, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. They then served an array of discovery requests. The Commonwealth cross-moved to stay discovery pending a decision on class certification. The district court granted a stay.</p>\n<p>On September 26, 2007, the court certified a class. Shortly thereafter, the parties began settlement negotiations in earnest and agreed to suspend discovery while negotiations proceeded. The talks proved fruitful and, on May 30, 2008, the parties executed a settlement agreement (the Agreement) that they described as \"final\" and \"comprehensive.\"</p>\n<p>In terms, the Agreement required the Commonwealth, over a period of years, to expand community services (residential and non-residential) for Medicaid-eligible individuals with acquired brain injuries. To this end, the Commonwealth is charged with developing several new projects and programs. The Commonwealth's responsibilities are, however, subject to its ability to secure both funding from the state legislature and necessary approvals from the federal government. With respect to these matters, the Agreement impresses an obligation on the Commonwealth to use best efforts. If the Commonwealth is unable to obtain funding or approvals and the Agreement stalls, either side may move to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> vacate the settlement so that the plaintiffs can litigate the case.</p>\n<p>The Agreement contemplates that the case will remain open for a period of years while the Commonwealth performs thereunder; it authorizes dismissal of the action only after the Commonwealth has completed certain specified obligations and is found to be in \"substantial compliance\" with the Agreement's terms. The Agreement further provides that the district court \"shall retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions.\"</p>\n<p>Because the district court had certified a class, the Agreement required judicial approval. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e). The parties jointly moved for this approval and, after a preliminary fairness hearing, the district court allowed the approval process to move forward. The court acknowledged, at the Commonwealth's urging, that the Agreement memorialized a settlement and was not tendered as a consent decree.</p>\n<p>After the class members were notified of the proposed settlement, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(1), the district court held a final fairness hearing. The court again noted that the Agreement \"does not constitute a consent decree but is a settlement agreement of this disputed case.\" The plaintiffs suggested that the court approve the Agreement by entering it as a court order, but the Commonwealth objected. The court expressed its willingness to indicate, either orally or through a written order, its finding that the Agreement represented a fair and appropriate resolution of the matter. It then asked the parties to submit a draft of a proposed order for approval of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>On July 29, 2008, each side submitted a proposed order. The parties disagreed as to whether the court needed explicitly to retain jurisdiction as a means of facilitating subsequent enforcement of the Agreement. In an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds, the district court suggested the following language:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he court approves the comprehensive settlement agreement. This case will not be closed and judgment will not enter pending compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<p>This suggestion did not please anyone. The plaintiffs feared that, without language explicitly retaining enforcement jurisdiction, the court's authority might be questioned in the event that further compliance proceedings become necessary. For its part, the Commonwealth expressed concern that the court's words might be transformed into the functional equivalent of a consent decree. The Commonwealth noted that, in the course of settlement negotiations, it had consistently maintained its unwillingness to resolve the case by means of \"a document that could be functionally a consent decree.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this impasse, the district court took the matter under advisement. On September 18, 2008, the court, acting without further input from the parties, entered a final approval order. The order states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he court finds that the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Therefore, the court approves the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, noting that the parties agree that this agreement does not constitute a consent decree, and that the court will retain jurisdiction over the case. The court orders that this case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p>The entry of the approval order set the stage for the developments leading to this appeal. The plaintiffs, claiming to be prevailing parties, moved for an award of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> attorneys' fees (including costs) in the amount of $786,123.<sup>[1]</sup> The Commonwealth disputed the \"prevailing party\" characterization, the timing of the motion for fees, and the reasonableness of the requested award. The district court found that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, that fees were presently allowable, and that the amount sought was \"eminently fair.\" Accordingly, it awarded the plaintiffs the full amount sought. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth prosecutes this appeal on three fronts. First it asserts that the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties and that, therefore, they are not entitled to a fee award. Second, it questions the timing of the plaintiffs' quest for fees. Its fallback position is that, even if we find its first two points unconvincing, the district court nevertheless committed an abuse of discretion in determining the size of the award. We consider these assertions sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Prevailing Party Status.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a determination of \"prevailing party\" status de novo. <i>Aronov v.

In addition, a party must demonstrate that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> the alteration possesses a \"judicial <i>imprimatur.\" </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We need only discuss the second of these requirements here, as the Commonwealth asserts that the \"plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the judicial imprimatur requirement.\"</p>\n<p>The <i>Buckhannon</i> Court identified only two situations in which this judicial imprimatur requirement would necessarily be satisfied: where the plaintiff \"received a judgment on the merits\" or where she \"obtained a court-ordered consent decree.\" <i>Id.</i> The Justices left open the question of whether (and if so, under what circumstances) a court-approved settlement that is not embodied in a formal consent decree may serve as the gateway to \"prevailing party\" status. The case at hand requires us to ponder this question.</p>\n<p>We do not write on a pristine page: our recent en banc opinion in <i>Aronov</i> provides guidance. There, we indicated that an order short of a formal consent decree might be sufficient for this purpose. 562 F.3d at 90. We emphasized, however, that this inquiry must focus on substance, not form. It follows that it is the function of the order that carries the most weight in determining whether it may serve as the linchpin for \"prevailing party\" status. <i>See id.</i> (explaining that \"it is the reality, not the nomenclature which is at issue\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 90 n. 7 (collecting cases from other circuits reaching the same conclusion). Thus, rather than look exclusively at the label attached to a particular order, an inquiring court must consider \"whether the order contains the sort of judicial involvement and actions inherent in a `court ordered consent decree.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 90.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that <i>Aronov</i> directs us to ignore the Agreement itself and look exclusively at the approval order when mulling whether the order contains elements inherent in a conventional consent decree. That is too crabbed a reading of <i>Aronov.</i> Indeed, such a myopic approach would be at odds with <i>Aronov's</i> instruction that \"[w]hether an order contains a sufficient judicial imprimatur can only be determined by determining the content of the order <i>against the entire context before the court.\" Id.</i> at 92 (emphasis supplied); <i>cf. </i><i>Smyth ex rel. Smyth v. Rivero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776760\"><a href=\"/opinion/776760/victoria-smyth-for-herself-and-as-next-friend-for-her-minor-child-angela/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 279 (4th Cir.2002) (examining whether agreement and dismissal order \"were, in combination, equivalent to a consent decree\"). We thus construe the approval order in light of both the content of the Agreement itself and its entire context.</p>\n<p>Our inquiry looks to three factors. The first factor is whether the change in the legal relationship between the parties was \"court-ordered.\" <i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 90 (quoting <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span>). The second factor is whether there was \"judicial approval of the relief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> The third factor is whether there exists continuing \"judicial oversight and ability to enforce the obligations imposed on the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> We start with a determination of whether the change in legal relationship is court-ordered.</p>\n<p>The Agreement itself specifically provides that, in the absence of court approval, \"the Agreement shall be null and void and of no force and effect.\" Hence, it is the approval order that makes the provisions of the Agreement binding on the parties and gives bite to their reciprocal obligations. In other words, this is a situation in which the court order triggers the change in the relationship between the parties, not one in which \"the court merely recognizes what the government has voluntarily agreed to do and only `requir[es] [the government] to follow through.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 93 (alterations in original) (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 27). Given this reality, we find that the court's involvement is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>The second prong of the inquiry requires us to determine whether there has been \"judicial approval of the relief vis-à-vis the merits of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 90. Under the Civil Rules, a court must approve a settlement in a class action and is directed to do so only if it finds the terms of the settlement \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(2); <i>see </i><i>Nat'l Ass'n of Chain Drug Stores v. New Engl. Carpenters Health Benefits Fund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203991\"><a href=\"/opinion/203991/national-assn-drug-stores-v-ne-carp-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2009). This is strikingly similar to a court's role in entering a consent decreea role that requires a court to ensure that the terms of the proposed decree \"are fair and not unlawful.\" <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 280.</p>\n<p>This background informs the meaning of the phrase \"appraisal of the merits\" in the \"prevailing party\" context. On the facts here, the district court, while evaluating the fairness of the settlement under Rule 23(e)(2), engaged in a sufficient appraisal of the merits for purposes of the imprimatur requirement.</p>\n<p>In the process of approving the Agreement, the court complied fully with the requirements of Rule 23(e)(2). It held multiple hearings during which it displayed its familiarity with the terms of the Agreement. At the hearing held on July 25, 2008, the court expressed its satisfaction that the interests of the plaintiff class had been adequately considered. The court's extended engagement with the substance of the Agreement easily distinguishes this case from the virtually nonexistent review conducted in <i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 87, where the district court merely entered an electronic docket entry granting the agreed motion to remand. For these reasons, we conclude that a sufficient appraisal of the merits occurred.</p>\n<p>This leaves the third prong of the inquiry, in which we ask whether there exists \"an obligation to comply and the provision of judicial oversight to enforce that obligation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 91 (citing <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 279-81); <i>see </i><i>Petersen v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786648\"><a href=\"/opinion/786648/deborah-petersen-v-byron-gibson-officer-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span>, 866-67 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that \"a settlement short of a consent decree may qualify [as a basis for prevailing party status] if ... the order provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement\").</p>\n<p>In the approval order, the district court expressly retained jurisdiction over the case. This fits tongue and groove with the terms of the Agreement, which makes pellucid the parties' shared desire that the court \"retain jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate noncompliance motions\" on a going-forward basis. Finally, the approval order instructs that the \"case not be closed and that judgment not enter pending compliance with the terms of\" the Agreement. These features distinguish the case at hand from the swath of cases in which a district court merely recognizes the fact of a settlement and dismisses the underlying action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith,</i> 401 F.3d at 21; <i>see also </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span> (noting that federal jurisdiction to enforce private settlements within the structure of the original case is lacking unless the terms of the settlement \"are incorporated in the order of dismissal\").</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, the terms of the Agreement explain in some detail the parameters of the district court's enforcement authority. If the parties are unable to resolve compliance issues on their own, the plaintiffs may ask the court to determine that the Commonwealth is not living up to its obligations under the Agreement. The court is authorized to grant equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> relief (but not to use the contempt powers) in order to achieve compliance. If the Commonwealth fails to abide by such an order, the Agreement allows the court to \"use any appropriate equitable or remedial power then available to it.\" The broad enforcement authority bestowed upon the district court separates the Agreement from the mine-run of private settlements, whichthough enforceable require resort to an independent action for breach of contract. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 91; <i>Christina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v. Bloomberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780436\"><a href=\"/opinion/780436/christina-a-by-and-through-her-parent-and-next-friend-jennifer-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 993 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>One other facet of the Agreement attests to the district court's ongoing role. The Agreement is subject to modification only upon mutual written assent of the parties <i>and</i> with the court's concurrence. The need for court approval of revisions in the terms of the Agreement closely resembles the process for amending a conventional consent decree. <i>See </i><i>Aronov,</i> 562 F.3d at 91 (discussing process for modifying consent decrees); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5). Taken together, the approval order and the Agreement itself envision an ongoing role for the district court in the dispute. That role includes ongoing judicial oversight. The approval order, therefore, satisfies the third prong of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>We summarize succinctly. Consideration of the three pertinent factors leads inexorably to the conclusion that the Agreement, though structured as a court-approved settlement rather than as a formal consent decree, bears a sufficient judicial imprimatur to qualify the plaintiffs as prevailing parties. That qualification, in turn, renders them eligible for an award of attorneys' fees.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Timing.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth maintains that any fee award is premature because (i) the \"success\" that the plaintiffs achieved was embodied in the Agreement and not in any court order; and (ii) in all events, the order entered by the district courtthe approval orderdoes not constitute a final judgment. The first of these arguments (which implicitly acknowledges that the plaintiffs have obtained some relief on the merits) is easily dispatched. As we already have explained, the plaintiffs' success hinges on the combined effect of the Agreement and the approval order. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). In view of that fact, it would be struthiousand plainly wrongto attribute the relief obtained to the Agreement alone.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' second argument has a certain superficial allure. After all, merely winning a battle in an ongoing case will not normally suffice to animate a federal fee-shifting statute. <i>See </i><i>Sole v.

Put another way, does it mark the achievement of a significant measure of relief on the plaintiffs' claims? Here too the focus on function over form that we embraced in <i>Aronov</i> informs our understanding of whether the timing is appropriate for a fee award. Viewed in that perspective, the question demands an affirmative answer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Richardson v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199797\"><a href=\"/opinion/199797/richardson-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2002) (implicitly recognizing that a settlement that was functionally similar to a consent decree could serve as the basis for an award of fees).</p>\n<p>This litigation has reached a significant plateau. In the Agreement, the parties characterize the settlement as \"final\" and \"comprehensive.\" Moreover, the Agreement, embellished by the approval order, affords meaningful relief to the plaintiff class and bears the requisite hallmarks of judicial approbation and oversight. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Thus, this case is unlike <i>Wyner, Hewitt,</i> or <i>Hanrahan,</i> in which the fee-seeker achieved only some fleeting success at a time when the litigation had yet to run its course. This case, while not yet closed, is not currently being litigated; it has been settled and, therefore, the litigation, as a practical matter, has drawn to a close.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth notes that there exists the possibility that litigation could be resumed (if, say, it is unable to secure funding and, thus, to follow through on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> commitments embodied in the Agreement). But this sort of latent uncertainty exists in virtually every case; even a final judgment can be appealed, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4, or reopened in certain circumstances, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Such a bare possibility does not, in and of itself, inject a sufficient level of uncertainty to make a fee award premature. <i>See generally </i><i>Tex.

These materials should include counsel's contemporaneous time and billing records, suitably detailed, and information anent the law firm's standard billing rates. <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 295-96. The putative payor may submit countervailing evidence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Foley v. City of Lowell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571252\"><a href=\"/opinion/571252/michael-j-foley-v-city-of-lowell-massachusetts-michael-j-foley-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 20-21 (1st Cir.1991). The court, usually after hearing arguments, will then \"calculate[] the time counsel spent on the case, subtract[] duplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and ... appl[y] prevailing rates in the community (taking into account the qualifications, experience, and specialized competence of the attorneys involved).\" <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the plaintiffs moved for an award of fees (including expenses) in the amount of $786,123. This figure included $775,136 in fees and $10,987 in expenses. Billing rates ranged from $250/hr. to $425/hr. depending on the skill and experience of the lawyer rendering a particular service. Travel time, where separately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> delineated in the motion for fees, was invoiced at a flat rate of $150/hr.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs buttressed their motion with an array of supporting documents. In mounting its opposition to the dollar amount of the request, the Commonwealth relied mainly on argumentation, not evidence (although it did point to other, more modest awards that had been made in unrelated cases). After hearing protracted arguments, the district court awarded the plaintiffs exactly what they requested.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Commonwealth contests the reasonableness of this award on three grounds: (i) that it compensates the plaintiffs for unnecessary work; (ii) that the rates used in formulating the award are inordinately high; and (iii) that many of the costs and expense items claimed are not recoverable as part of a fee-shifting award. We address each of these plaints separately.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Time Spent.</i> The Commonwealth's assault on the temporal component of the fee award rests on an assertion that the district court abused its discretion by choosing not to pare the total number of hours claimed by the plaintiffs. Specifically, the Commonwealth insists that the plaintiffs overstaffed the case and that the district court should have carved out time spent in profligate duplication of effort and other unnecessary or unreimbursable endeavors, such as intramural conferencing, settlement negotiations prior to the commencement of the action, and travel. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's principal lament relates to staffing. In evaluating this plaint, we are mindful that there is no mathematically precise formula for staffing complex litigation. Each case is different, and the trial court is \"uniquely positioned to weigh the parties' staffing needs, assess the reasonableness of their handling of the case, and evaluate the quality and relevance of the services rendered.\" <i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>We focus first on the plaintiffs' enlistment of a number of different lawyers, many of whom worked collectively on specific projects within the broader litigation. Such staffing practices are not forbidden in fee-shifting cases; parties sometimes are justified in making a strategic choice to use teams of lawyers in various phases of complex litigation. <i>See id.</i> at 297 (explaining that \"the mere fact that more than one lawyer toils on the same general task does not necessarily constitute excessive staffing\"). And where the deployment of multiple attorneys on a single project is reasonable, that staffing pattern inevitably results in a need for some amount of coordination, including intramural conferencing. Everything turns on the reasonableness of the staffing patterns employed and the overall time spent. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rivera,</i> 524 F.3d at 336 (explaining that reasonableness in the context of time management \"is largely a matter of informed judgment\").</p>\n<p>When all is said and done, staffing must be appraised on a case-by-case basis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gay Officers Action League,</i> 247 F.3d at 298. Here, the plaintiffs accounted for a modicum of overstaffing by eliminating some time spent by two of their lawyers and completely disregarding the hours worked by some minor players before formulating their fee request. The district court, which was intimately familiar with the demands of this unusually complicated case, found the remaining hours spent to be reasonable. Had the Commonwealth submitted evidence opposing the request for example, affidavits attesting that private clients would not typically consent to staffing patterns like those used by the plaintiffs in this casethe district court might have viewed the question differently. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> We certainly would have. Nor has the Commonwealth in lieu of an affidavit cited to us analogous cases in support of its contention that this case was simply overstaffed. In the absence of such information, though the district court's assessment is one on which reasonable minds could disagree, it was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Much the same approach can be taken to the Commonwealth's complaint about travel time. Travel is often a necessary incident of litigation,<sup>[5]</sup> and an attorney's travel time may be reimbursed in a fee award. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maceira v. Pagan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413302\"><a href=\"/opinion/413302/efrain-maceira-v-luis-enrique-pagan-local-901-international-brotherhood/\"><span class=\"volume\">698</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1983). Although compensation for such time ordinarily is calculated at an hourly rate lower than that which applies to the attorney's substantive labors, <i>see, e.g., id.,</i> there is no hard-and-fast rule establishing what percentage of an attorney's standard billing rate is appropriate for travel time.</p>\n<p>Viewed against this backdrop, the Commonwealth's broadside against travel time misses the mark. Some of the plaintiffs' lawyers charged for travel time at a reduced rate and those that did not provide a designated travel rate billed for travel time (as for their other work) at rates substantially below their customary billing rates. All of the submissions tied the quantum of travel to work that the district court found appropriate. The award of amounts attributable to travel time was, therefore, not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth also excoriates the inclusion of time spent in performing legal work prior to the commencement of suit. \"[P]re-suit fees may be awarded ... only for `discrete' work `that was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the ... litigation to the stage it reached.'\" <i>Schneider v.

The district court found, at least implicitly, that the pre-suit hours lodged here fall within this taxonomy. We think that this judgment call was within the encincture of the court's discretion.</p>\n<p>Having dealt with the Commonwealth's specific plaints, we need not tarry over its global objection to the fee award. In conjunction with their motion for fees, the plaintiffs submitted detailed records that itemized their work on the case over a period of several years. In addition, they submitted affidavits from three of their counsel describing each lawyer's role in the litigation and the specific contributions that he or she had made to the case. The plaintiffs also submitted affidavits from brain-injury experts speaking to the significance of the relief obtained.</p>\n<p>The district court had the benefit of these materials. It (understandably) gave considerable weight to the fact that the plaintiffs discounted the total number of hours before compiling their fee request, electing to eschew compensation for a portion of the time that they had worked. As a result of this self-pruning, the requested fee, in the district court's estimation, was actually <i>lower</i> than the lodestar. The fee award in this case was certainly quite generous. On this record, however, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to reduce even further the total number of hours that the plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> used as the multiplicand in the calculation of fees.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Rates.</i> The Commonwealth also challenges the rates that the plaintiffs utilized in seeking fees. It suggests that the use of such exorbitant rates as a basis for the fee award results in a windfall.</p>\n<p>There is no universal market rate for legal services. Rather, \"[r]easonable hourly rates will vary depending on the nature of the work, the locality in which it is performed, the qualifications of the lawyers, and other criteria.\" <i>United States v. One Star Class Sloop Sailboat,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203530\"><a href=\"/opinion/203530/united-states-v-one-star-class-sloop-sailboat-built-1930/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see </i><i>Blum v. Stenson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 895, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span> (1984). There are, however, some generally accepted guideposts.</p>\n<p>One such rule of thumb is that the rate that a private lawyer actually charges to clients in the ordinary course of his practice, though not conclusive, is a useful indicator of market value. <i>One Star Class Sloop Sailboat,</i> 546 F.3d at 40. Another rule of thumb is that data evidencing the prevailing market rate for counsel of comparable skill and experience provides helpful guidance. <i>See </i><i>Blum,</i> 465 U.S. at 895 &amp; n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1541</span></a></span>. The fee-seeker must carry the burden of establishing the prevailing hourly rate (or schedule of rates) in the community for the performance of similar legal services by comparably credentialled counsel. <i>See </i><i>Bordanaro v. McLeod,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520992\"><a href=\"/opinion/520992/rose-bordanaro-v-john-mcleod-appeal-of-city-of-everett-edward-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span>, 1168 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>The rates applied and awarded in this case are amply supported. In their motion papers, the plaintiffs sought compensation at hourly rates ranging from $250/hr. to $425/hr. The individual lawyers fell into two groups: lawyers from the nonprofit Center for Public Interest and lawyers from the Boston office of a national law firm.</p>\n<p>As to the former, the rates used were identical to those that the same lawyers had previously received in civil rights cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Patrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318678\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318678/rosie-d-ex-rel-john-d-v-patrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 331 (D.Mass. 2009). Moreover, the rates were relatively modest when compared to the standard rates charged by their counterparts in private law firms.</p>\n<p>As to the law firm, the rates charged were pretty much the same as those received by the firm in a recently concluded public interest case. <i>See id.</i> at 330-31. Those rates were in many instances substantially below the standard billing rates charged by the private attorneys.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 330.</p>\n<p>In passing upon the reasonableness of the rates, the court below considered the rates approved in <i>Rosie D.,</i> a case in which the fee award against the Commonwealth was not appealed. The court also considered affidavits executed by an independent expert on fees and by two public interest lawyers practicing in Massachusetts. Each of those affiants opined that the suggested rates were not only reasonable but also below the market rates for the types of work performed by the caliber of lawyers involved.</p>\n<p>We think it is significant that, despite the ferocity of the Commonwealth's attack on the rates, it presented no evidence of a countervailing rate structure. The Supreme Court has admonished that, where a party opposing a motion for fees fails to submit \"any evidence challenging the accuracy and reasonableness\" of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> facts asserted in connection with a supported fee request, that failure may amount to a waiver of the right to challenge the district court's determination regarding the reasonableness of the request on appeal. <i>Blum,</i> 465 U.S. at 892 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1541</span></a></span>. Where as here, a prevailing party submits a supported application for fees, the fee-target runs a risk if it chooses to do no more than criticize the rates requested and point to the fact that some other judge, in some other case, has embraced a different set of rates. <i>Foley,</i> 948 F.2d at 21 (\"The City, of course, had an opportunity to adduce evidence of a more realistic rate structure, but did not do so. Absent any such evidence, we are hard pressed to fault the lower court for embracing the plaintiff's suggested rates.\").</p>\n<p>To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. In light of the supporting documentation provided by the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth's failure to produce or point to contradictory evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning a fee award premised on the suggested rates.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Expenses.</i> The Commonwealth challenges the district court's allowance of certain expenses and cost items, including charges for travel, printing, and photocopying. The Commonwealth asserts that these charges should have been disallowed because they were not \"directly associated\" with the litigation. This argument seems to rest largely on the notion that expenses, not recoverable as costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1920, are not independently recoverable at all but, rather, comprise a part of the lawyers' overhead.</p>\n<p>This assertion consists of more cry than wool. It is settled beyond peradventure that reasonable expenses, necessary for the prosecution of a case, are ancillary to and may be incorporated as part of a fee award under a prototypical federal fee-shifting statute. <i>See </i><i>Palmigiano v. Garrahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418708\"><a href=\"/opinion/418708/nicholas-a-palmigiano-v-j-joseph-garrahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 637 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (including \"litigation expenses, and costs\" as components of allowable fee awards). Contrary to the Commonwealth's implication, the availability of such remediation is not limited to items recoverable as court costs under section 1920. Rather, such recovery can extend to a broad range of other items, including travel expenses, computer time, and the like. <i>See </i><i>Attrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2006) (explaining that \"such items may be recovered where appropriate as part of attorneys' fees under the typical federal fee-shifting statute\").</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's challenge to the amount of costs awarded for printingan expense explicitly listed as taxable under section 1920is equally unavailing. The ADA's fee-shifting provision clearly includes \"costs\" as part of an allowable fee award, and in combination with the express terms of section 1920, this renders the Commonwealth's bare assertion that printing costs \"have been repeatedly rejected as `unrecoverable overhead'\" wholly unconvincing.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. We hold, without serious question, that reasonable costs and expenses for travel, printing, and photocopying can be recovered in a fee-shifting proceeding without regard to the limitations contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Because the Commonwealth has not contested either the fact or the amount of the expenditures targeted here, awarding reimbursement of them did not constitute an abuse of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> court's award of attorneys' fees and expenses.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiffs' motion was, by its terms, brought \"pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 42 U.S.C. § 12205.\" The language of these two fee-shifting provisions is virtually identical in all material respects. Following the lead of the parties and the district court, we treat the ADA's fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, as the operative statute.</p>\n<p>[2]  In any event, the key precedent is <i>Buckhannon,</i> and the Court there dealt in part, as we do here, with the ADA's fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205. <i>See </i><i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 601, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[3]  We emphasize that the mere fact that a settlement is subject to court approval does not in itself supply the necessary ingredients for prevailing party status. It is the presence of <i>continuing judicial oversight</i> that pushes the ball across the goal line and thus suffices to give a settlement the required judicial imprimatur.</p>\n<p>[4]  In <i>Buckhannon,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that its earlier decision in <i>Maher</i> continued to stand for the proposition that a consent decree may serve as the basis for a fee award. 532 U.S. at 604, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span>. The Court noted, however, that any suggestion that <i>Maher</i> allowed for the recovery of fees for private settlements was misplaced because such agreements \"do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 604 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We think that, in light of the functional grounds on which the <i>Buckhannon</i> Court distinguished private settlements from consent decrees, its statement, consistent with our analysis in <i>Aronov,</i> suggests that <i>Maher</i> allows for the award of fees in the case of a settlement that <i>does</i> entail judicial approval and continuing judicial oversight (similar to what is involved in connection with a consent decree).</p>\n<p>[5]  In this case, some travel was essential. The case was pending in the western division of the District of Massachusetts, sitting in Springfield, and the plaintiffs' lawyers were based in Boston (some 90 miles away).</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the standard billing rate for the most accomplished member of the law firm was $725/hr., but the plaintiffs used a rate of $425/hr. for his time in formulating their fee request.</p>\n\n</div>",
