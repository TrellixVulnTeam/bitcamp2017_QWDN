R. 32.3\n\n           United States Court of Appeals\n                          For the First Circuit\n\nNo.   02-1385\n\n                                 WEST WATERS,\n\n                           Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                        v.\n\n                EARTHLINK, INC., and ONEMAIN.COM, INC.,\n\n                         Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n           [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Farris,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Christopher F. Robertson, with whom Brian E. Pastuszenski,\nColleen M. Geary, and Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP were on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Bruce A. Bierhans, with whom Law Office of Bruce A. Bierhans,\nCarlin J. Phillips and Phillips & Garcia, LLP were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                              October 31, 2003\n\n\n      *Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.    This putative class action suit arises out\n\nof plaintiff West Waters' complaints about allegedly poor internet\n\nservice.   Defendants-appellants Earthlink, Inc., and OneMain.com,\n\nInc., appeal the district court's refusal to dismiss or stay the\n\naction pending arbitration.\n\n           Plaintiff is an individual who resides in Wellfleet,\n\nMassachusetts, and was a customer of a local internet service\n\nprovider (ISP) that was acquired by OneMain in 1999.    In September\n\n2000, OneMain became a wholly owned subsidiary of Earthlink.\n\nPlaintiff brought a state court action alleging that, following\n\nOneMain's acquisition of the ISP with whom he had originally\n\ncontracted, OneMain (and then Earthlink) breached their assumed\n\nagreement(s) to provide him with adequate internet services and\n\ncommitted unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of Mass.\n\nGen. Laws chapter 93A.\n\n           Defendants removed the case to the district court on the\n\nbasis of diversity jurisdiction and thereafter moved to dismiss or\n\nstay it pending arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration\n\nAct, 9 U.S.C. ยง 3.       The district court denied the order without\n\nprejudice and permitted discovery to proceed because, in its view,\n\ndefendants had not established that plaintiff had in fact agreed to\n\narbitrate any disputes he might have with them.      Defendants have\n\ntaken an immediate appeal from the district court's order under 9\n\nU.S.C. ยง 16(a)(1)(C), see Intergen N.V. v. Grina, No. 03-1056, 344\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fF.3d 134, 140 (1st Cir. 2003), arguing that the district court\n\nerred in (1) concluding that they had not established the existence\n\nof   a   binding   agreement    to   arbitrate        between      themselves   and\n\nplaintiff, and (2) ordering unlimited discovery.                Even assuming we\n\nhave jurisdiction to address it (an issue ignored by the parties),\n\ndefendants'    second    argument       was     not    made     with   sufficient\n\nspecificity in the district court to preserve it for appellate\n\nreview.    See United States v. Frisby, 258 F. 3d 46, 48 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    Accordingly, we proceed directly to the merits of their\n\nfirst appellate argument.\n\n            Our review of the record convinces us that the district\n\ncourt's    conclusion   was    sound.      In    support      of    their   motion,\n\ndefendants submitted a copy of a OneMain license and service\n\nagreement that contains an arbitration provision which purports to\n\nbind its customers, and an affidavit stating that links to the\n\nagreement were placed on the web site of both the ISP with whom\n\nplaintiff had contracted and OneMain's own website.                 Conspicuously\n\nabsent, however, is any convincing explanation why we should\n\nconclude that plaintiff should have seen these links. Nor is there\n\nother compelling evidence that plaintiff was, or should have been,\n\non notice that he was bound to arbitrate any dispute he might have\n\nwith OneMain.      Were OneMain customers only able to access the\n\ninternet through these websites?           How prominently were the links\n\ndisplayed?    How were they labeled or explained?                   None of these\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fpotentially relevant issues is answered by the record.          And absent\n\na showing that it is reasonable to assume that plaintiff would have\n\nseen the links, we are at a loss to see how he could be found to\n\nhave agreed to arbitrate any disputes with defendants.\n\n            Even more fundamentally, we have serious doubts that this\n\ncase meets the amount-in-controversy requirement of 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1332, the basis on which it was removed.         While we recognize that\n\ndismissal   for   failure   to   establish     the   amount-in-controversy\n\nrequirement (here, more than $75,000) is appropriate only if the\n\ncourt is satisfied to a legal certainty that plaintiff is not\n\nentitled to recover from defendants the jurisdictional minimum,\n\nsee, e.g., Spielman v. Genzyme Corp., 251 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), we do not presently see how plaintiff's actual damages, even\n\nif multiplied under ch. 93A, could approach such a figure.1            After\n\nall, the amount-in-controversy must be satisfied independent of\n\nother plaintiffs' claims or any attorneys' fees to which the class\n\nmay be statutorily entitled.       See id. at 7-10.\n\n            Because the district court is better situated to resolve\n\nany   amount-in-controversy      issue,   we   are   content   for   present\n\npurposes simply to raise it.2      For the reasons set forth above, we\n\n\n\n      1\n      We note that the furniture company that plaintiff owns, and\nwhich allegedly was harmed by defendants' lapses, is not a named\nplaintiff.\n      2\n      The district court has, of course, authorized full discovery,\nand that may shed light on the amount actually in controversy.\n\n                                    -4-\n\faffirm the denial without prejudice of defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss or stay.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -5-\n\f",
