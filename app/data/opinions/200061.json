Baler on brief for appellant.\n     Dean A. Mazzone, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Thomas\nF. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                           August 7, 2002\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern   District   of    California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge. Roberto Medina appeals\n\nthe district court’s denial of his petition for writ of habeas\n\ncorpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).              He contends that\n\nthe state trial court's malice instruction created a mandatory\n\nrebuttable presumption shifting the burden to him in violation of\n\ndue process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.1                  We hold\n\nthat although the instruction was constitutional error, it was\n\nharmless error because it did not have a \"substantial and injurious\n\neffect on the verdict\" under Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619,\n\n637 (1993).      We therefore affirm.\n\n                          PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            On October 4, 1975, Medina was convicted of murder in the\n\nfirst degree by a Massachusetts state court.                  The trial court\n\ndenied his motion for a new trial, and the Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(“SJC”) affirmed the conviction on May 5, 1980.                 Commonwealth v.\n\nMedina, 380 Mass. 565 (1980) (“Medina I”).             On July 9, 1996, Medina\n\nagain    moved   the   state   court   for   a   new   trial,      claiming   that\n\nsubsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court with\n\nrespect    to    burden-shifting   presumptions        in   jury    instructions\n\nrendered the trial court’s instruction on malice erroneous and\n\n     1\n      \"A mandatory presumption, even though rebuttable, is\ndifferent from a permissive presumption, which ‘does not require\n. . . the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by\nthe prosecutor of the basic one and . . . places no burden of any\nkind on the defendant.’” Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. 391, 402 n.7\n(1991) (quoting Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 157\n(1979)).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fprejudicial.      The motion was denied.          A single justice of the SJC\n\ndenied Medina’s motion for leave to appeal on August 15, 1997.                   On\n\nJanuary    27,    1998,     the   justice      granted   Medina’s    motion     for\n\nreconsideration and referred the appeal to the full bench of the\n\nSJC.    On February 17, 2000, the SJC again affirmed the conviction\n\nfor murder in the first degree.           Commonwealth v. Medina, 430 Mass.\n\n800    (2000)    (“Medina    II”).       It    held   that   the   trial   judge’s\n\ninstruction regarding malice violated Sandstrom v. Montana, 442\n\nU.S. 510 (1979), but was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under\n\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), and Yates v. Evatt, 500\n\nU.S. 391 (1991).      Medina II, 430 Mass. at 812.             Medina filed the\n\ninstant petition on October 27, 2000. The district court held that\n\nthe instruction erroneously shifted the government's burden, but\n\nthat the error was harmless under Brecht, because it did not have\n\na substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.                    Medina\n\ntimely appealed.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n            At Medina’s trial for the unlawful killing of Ana Asua\n\nthe court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n            [M]alice . . . means every unlawful motive\n            that may be inferred from unlawful killing,\n            and when there are no circumstances disclosed\n            tending to show justification or excuse, there\n            is nothing to rebut the presumption of malice.\n            Malice . . . include[s] any intent to inflict\n            injury upon another without legal excuse or\n            palliation.\n\nThe    government    concedes     that    the    instruction,      containing    an\n\n                                         -3-\n\fevidentiary presumption that relieved the prosecution of its burden\n\nto prove each essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, was tainted by a Sandstrom error.2                     The only issue before\n\nus,    therefore,         is     whether    the    error    was     harmless    beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n                 Our review of the petition is governed by 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n\nAct (“AEDPA”).            In relevant part, the AEDPA precludes a federal\n\nhabeas          court    from    granting    relief        unless    the    state   court\n\nadjudication either “resulted in a decision that was contrary to,\n\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates”         or,     alternatively,      was    based     upon    “an    unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\n\nthe State court proceeding.”                  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).              The AEDPA\n\nfurther provides that “a determination of a factual issue made by\n\na state court shall be presumed to be correct” unless petitioner is\n\nable       to    “rebut    the    presumption      of   correctness        by   clear   and\n\nconvincing evidence.”              28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).             Medina does not\n\n\n\n       2\n      As the SJC held, “[b]y thus requiring the jury to conclude\nthat the killing was committed with malice if they found the fact\nof a killing coupled with the absence of a legally cognizable\nexcuse or justification, the instruction relieved the Commonwealth\nof its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the killer acted\nwith malice, and could have precluded the jury from considering any\nevidence, if such existed, that might have mitigated malice.”\nMedina II, 430 Mass. at 804.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcontend that the SJC’s adjudication was based on an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of factual issues.\n\n             The SJC held that the instruction shifted the burden of\n\ndisproving malice to the defendant.          It then proceeded, in a\n\ncomprehensive and painstaking opinion, to review the evidence\n\nrelevant to the predicating fact, viz., the unlawful killing, from\n\nwhich, under the deficient instruction, the ultimate fact of malice\n\nwas to be conclusively presumed.         It found the evidence to show\n\nthat Medina repeatedly struck the victim with a baseball bat as she\n\nwas lying incapacitated on the ground, causing the bat to break\n\ninto   two   pieces.    Other   evidence   showed   that   the   defendant\n\nparticipated in a further assault on the victim by dragging her\n\nbody behind an automobile.       Medina did not dispute the killer’s\n\nmalice at trial, instead denying that he was the killer and\n\ndisputing the causal link between the assault on the victim and her\n\ndeath.   These facts, the court found, “overwhelmingly demonstrate\n\nthat the victim’s assailant acted with malice.”            Medina II, 430\n\nMass. at 808.    It reasoned that if the evidence that the jury found\n\nsufficient to prove the predicating fact was “so closely bound up\n\nwith the ultimate fact presumed (here, malice) that they could not\n\nreasonably have found the former without also finding the latter,\n\nthen the presumption was, beyond a reasonable doubt, harmless to\n\nthe defendant.”     Medina II, 430 Mass. at 806.       “In light of the\n\nevidence regarding the nature of the assault on the victim and her\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fresulting injuries,” the court further concluded, “the jury’s\n\nfinding the predicate fact of unlawful killing was the functional\n\nequivalent of their finding the ultimate fact to be presumed,\n\nmalice.”   Medina II, 430 Mass. at 808.3\n\n           The SJC then applied the two-step harmless error analysis\n\nunder Yates. It determined first that reasonable jurors would have\n\nunderstood the malice instruction to limit their consideration of\n\nthe case to the evidence that bore on the circumstances of the\n\nkilling and preclude their consideration of any further evidence of\n\nMedina’s malice.     It then determined at the second step that\n\nweighing   the   probative   force    of   that   evidence   against   the\n\npresumption standing alone, the evidence considered by the jury in\n\naccordance with the instruction was so overwhelming as to leave it\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict resting on that evidence\n\nwould have been the same in the absence of the presumption.        Medina\n\nII, 430 Mass. at 802.    Although the Supreme Court in Estelle v.\n\nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 70 n.4 (1991), disapproved of the standard of\n\nreview articulated in Yates (namely, what “a reasonable juror would\n\nhave understood the instruction to mean”), the Yates two-step\n\nharmless error analysis for mandatory burden-shifting instructions\n\n\n     3\n      The evidence does not support Medina's arguments that he was\nprovoked, involved in sudden combat, defending himself, or\ndefending Muniz. As the SJC's recitation of the facts makes clear,\nthe victim was incapacitated on the ground when Medina assaulted\nher with the bat or the car. She could not have provoked him; he\nwas not in the midst of combat; and the victim posed no threat to\nhim or anyone else from that position.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fremains unimpaired.\n\n            A court on direct appeal “confronted by a preserved\n\nconstitutional error must set aside the judgment unless it is\n\nsatisfied that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nSanna v. DiPaulo, 265 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Chapman,\n\n386 U.S. at 24).    We have held, however, that the “less exacting”\n\nharmless error standard under Brecht, 507 U.S. at 619, governs our\n\nreview on habeas.   Sanna, 265 F.3d at 14.   A federal habeas court,\n\nwe said, is bound to uphold a state court judgment, notwithstanding\n\na preserved constitutional error, as long as the error did not have\n\n“a substantial, injurious effect on the jury’s verdict.”     Id. at\n\n14.   We agree with the SJC’s analysis and conclude that the\n\nevidence the jury would have considered was so overwhelming that\n\nthe instruction error could not have had a substantial, injurious\n\neffect on the verdict.     Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact\n\nthat since Medina did not contest malice, there was no other\n\nevidence to mitigate the compelling force of the evidence of\n\nmalice.   By analogy, in Bembury v. Butler, 968 F.2d 1399 (1st Cir.\n\n1992), we held a constitutionally defective malice instruction\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt because malice was not contested\n\nat trial.    There we observed:    \"Bembury's only defense was his\n\nalibi, that he did not commit the murder. . . . Bembury's failure\n\nto argue the issue of malice amounted to a concession of that\n\nissue, because, as in Hill, 'intent was never put in issue, and\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\findeed, could     hardly   have    been    contested.'\"   Id.   at   1402-03\n\n(quoting Hill v. Maloney, 927 F.2d 646, 656 (1st Cir. 1990)); see\n\nalso Sanna, 265 F.3d at 15 (finding arguably erroneous intoxication\n\ninstruction harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because defendant\n\npremised his trial defense on mistaken identity); Buehl v. Vaughn,\n\n166 F.3d 163, 177 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n          Bound as we are by the SJC’s determination of the facts,\n\nwe conclude that the burden-shifting malice instruction, though\n\nconstitutional error, did not have a substantial, injurious effect\n\non the verdict.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

The trial court denied his motion for a new trial, and the Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") affirmed the conviction on May 5, 1980. <i>Commonwealth v.

On July 9, 1996, Medina again moved the state court for a new trial, claiming that subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court with respect to burden-shifting presumptions in jury instructions rendered the trial court's instruction on malice erroneous and prejudicial. The motion was denied. A single justice of the SJC denied Medina's motion for leave to appeal on August 15, 1997. On January 27, 1998, the justice granted Medina's motion for reconsideration and referred the appeal to the full bench of the SJC. On February 17, 2000, the SJC again affirmed the conviction for murder in the first degree. <i>Commonwealth v.

Medina filed the instant petition on October 27, 2000. The district court held that the instruction erroneously shifted the government's burden, but that the error was harmless under <i>Brecht,</i> because it did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict. Medina timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Medina's trial for the unlawful killing of Ana Asua the court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[M]alice ... means every unlawful motive that may be inferred from unlawful killing, and when there are no circumstances disclosed tending to show justification or excuse, there is nothing to rebut the presumption of malice. Malice ... include[s] any intent to inflict injury upon another without legal excuse or palliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government concedes that the instruction, containing an evidentiary presumption that relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove each essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, was tainted by a <i>Sandstrom</i> error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The only issue before us, therefore, is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the petition is governed by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"). In relevant part, the AEDPA precludes a federal habeas court from granting relief unless the state court adjudication either \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" or, alternatively, was based upon \"an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). The AEDPA further provides that \"a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct\" unless petitioner is able to \"rebut the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1). Medina does not contend that the SJC's adjudication was based on an unreasonable determination of factual issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC held that the instruction shifted the burden of disproving malice to the defendant. It then proceeded, in a comprehensive and painstaking opinion, to review the evidence relevant to the predicating fact, viz., the unlawful killing, from which, under the deficient instruction, the ultimate fact of malice was to be conclusively presumed. It found the evidence to show that Medina repeatedly struck the victim with a baseball bat as she was lying incapacitated on the ground, causing the bat to break into two pieces. Other evidence showed that the defendant participated in a further assault on the victim by dragging her body behind an automobile. Medina did not dispute the killer's malice at trial, instead denying that he was the killer and disputing the causal link between the assault on the victim and her death. These facts, the court found, \"overwhelmingly demonstrate that the victim's assailant acted with malice.\" <i>Medina II,</i> 430 Mass. at 808, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>. It reasoned that if the evidence that the jury found sufficient to prove the predicating fact was \"so closely bound up with the ultimate fact presumed (here, malice) that they could not reasonably have found the former without also finding the latter, then the presumption was, beyond a reasonable doubt, harmless to the defendant.\" <i>Medina II,</i> 430 Mass. at 806, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>. \"In light of the evidence regarding the nature of the assault on the victim and her resulting injuries,\" the court further concluded, \"the jury's finding the predicate fact of unlawful killing was the functional equivalent of their finding the ultimate fact to be presumed, malice.\" <i>Medina II,</i> 430 Mass. at 808, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC then applied the two-step harmless error analysis under <i>Yates.</i> It determined first that reasonable jurors would have understood the malice instruction to limit their consideration of the case to the evidence that bore on the circumstances of the killing and preclude their consideration of any further evidence of Medina's malice. It then determined at the second step that weighing the probative force of that evidence against the presumption standing alone, the evidence considered by the jury in accordance with the instruction was so overwhelming as to leave it beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict resting on that evidence would have been the same in the absence of the presumption. <i>Medina II,</i> 430 Mass. at 802, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>.

She could not have provoked him; he was not in the midst of combat; and the victim posed no threat to him or anyone else from that position</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
