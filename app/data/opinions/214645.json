Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David Shaughnessy for appellant.\n     Amy L. Karangekis, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nMartha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         April 13, 2011\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.     The Supreme Court's new decision in\n\nCullen v. Pinholster, No. 09-1088, 2011 WL 1225705 (Apr. 4, 2011),\n\nrequires that we reject this appeal from a denial of a request for\n\nan evidentiary hearing in relation to a petition for habeas corpus.\n\n          On May 9, 2005, petitioner Larry Atkins was convicted in\n\nMassachusetts state court of unlawful possession of a firearm as\n\nwell as unlawful possession of a firearm or ammunition without an\n\nidentification card.   On a motion for a new trial, Atkins raised an\n\nineffective   assistance   of   counsel   claim,   which   concerned   the\n\nadmission into evidence of a 911 call.         The motion included a\n\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing and was accompanied by two\n\naffidavits, one of which contained an admission by trial counsel\n\nthat he should have asked for a more limiting instruction.\n\n          After considering the affidavits, trial transcript, and\n\ncourt notes of the proceeding, the state trial judge denied Atkins'\n\nrequest for an evidentiary hearing as well as his ineffective\n\nassistance claim. Commonwealth v. Atkins, No. 2004-01116, slip op.\n\nat 1 (Mass. Sup. Ct. Jan. 31, 2007).       The state trial judge found\n\nthat Atkins' lawyer had made a strategic choice as to the admission\n\nof the tapes that was not unreasonable, that the prejudice standard\n\nfor ineffective assistance had not been met, and that there was no\n\nsubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.        Id. at 5-11.\n\n          Atkins' appeals of his conviction and the denial of his\n\nmotion for a new trial were consolidated.      The state appeals court\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\faffirmed,      directly     addressing       and    rejecting     the   ineffective\n\nassistance claim and agreeing with the trial court's analysis.\n\nCommonwealth v. Atkins, No. 06-P-220, 2007 WL 4234095, at *1 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. Dec. 3, 2007).           The state court rejected Atkins' argument\n\nthat the trial judge abused her discretion in denying him an\n\nevidentiary hearing.        Id.     Atkins petitioned for further appellate\n\nreview, which was denied by the Supreme Judicial Court in January\n\n2008.   Commonwealth v. Atkins, 450 Mass. 1107 (2008).\n\n              Within a few weeks, Atkins filed a petition for habeas\n\ncorpus in federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). The petition\n\nwas   initially      dismissed      for    want    of   prosecution     but    it    was\n\nreinstated in February 2009.              Before the federal district court,\n\nAtkins raised the same ineffective assistance claim and argued\n\nunder     §   2254(d)(1)     that     the    state      court    decision     was     an\n\nunreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\n\n(1984).       He also sought a federal evidentiary hearing under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(e)(2) so that his trial counsel--and perhaps he--\n\ncould testify as to trial strategy.\n\n              The federal district court denied the evidentiary hearing\n\nand denied the petition on its merits.                  Atkins v. Clarke, 730 F.\n\nSupp.   2d    253,    254   (D.    Mass.     2010).      It     concluded     that    an\n\nevidentiary hearing was unnecessary because the state court record,\n\nwhich included trial counsel's affidavit on the new trial motion,\n\ncontained      the   material     facts     relevant    to    Atkins'   ineffective\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fassistance claim.       Id. at 255.      Atkins received a certificate of\n\nappealability only on the issue of whether the federal district\n\ncourt   abused    its   discretion      in    denying    his    request      for   an\n\nevidentiary hearing.        Thus, only that issue is before us.\n\n            Shortly before oral argument, Cullen clarified the legal\n\nlandscape as to evidentiary hearings under § 2254(e)(2).                         When\n\nCullen was decided on April 4, 2011, we advised counsel that day to\n\naddress Cullen at oral argument, which was done.\n\n            Cullen held that habeas \"review under § 2254(d)(1) is\n\nlimited   to    the   record    that   was    before    the    state    court    that\n\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.\"            Cullen, 2011 WL 1225705, at\n\n*8.     The Court reasoned that the \"backward-looking language\"\n\npresent in § 2254(d)(1) \"requires an examination of the state-court\n\ndecision at the time it was made\" and that therefore the record\n\nunder review must be \"limited to the record in existence at that\n\nsame time i.e., the record before the state court.\"                    Id.\n\n            The Court held that this reading was \"compelled\" by the\n\nstructure of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n\n1996 (AEDPA), which it held conveyed \"Congress' intent to channel\n\nprisoners' claims first to the state courts.\"                  Id.     It held that\n\n\"evidence      introduced      in   federal    court     has    no     bearing     on\n\n§ 2254(d)(1) review.        If a claim has been adjudicated on the merits\n\nby a state court, a federal habeas petitioner must overcome the\n\nlimitation of § 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before the state\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcourt.\"   Id. at *10.   The Court noted that this construction did\n\nnot render superfluous § 2254(e)(2), which sets limits on the\n\navailability of evidentiary hearings.   That subsection may apply\n\nwhen a constitutional claim was not \"adjudicated on the merits,\"\n\nwithin the meaning of § 2254(d)(1).   Id. at *10-11.\n\n          It is clear both that Atkins' petition for habeas corpus\n\nwas brought under § 2254(d)(1) and that his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim was adjudicated on the merits by the state court.   Until oral\n\nargument, Atkins had conceded in all of his habeas filings that the\n\nclaims were in fact adjudicated on the merits in the state courts.\n\n          Atkins now argues that the phrase \"adjudicated on the\n\nmerits\" in § 2254(d)(1) must be given a new meaning in light of\n\nCullen.   He argues that a state court has not adjudicated a claim\n\non the merits unless it has given a full and fair evidentiary\n\nhearing and that therefore federal courts must hear new evidence if\n\nthe state court has declined to give a petitioner such a hearing.\n\nAtkins relies on two pre-Cullen decisions: Winston v. Kelly, 592\n\nF.3d 535 (4th Cir. 2010), and Wilson v. Workman, 577 F.3d 1284\n\n(10th Cir. 2009) (en banc).\n\n          To the extent these cases are inconsistent with Cullen as\n\nto claims asserted under § 2254(d)(1), and that appears to be the\n\npoint of Atkins' citation to them, they are, of course, overruled.\n\nThe citation to Wilson is presumably for its statement that \"when\n\nthe state court makes such findings on an incomplete record, it has\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fnot made an adjudication on the merits to which we owe any\n\ndeference.\"      Wilson, 577 F.3d at 1290.        Neither of those cases is\n\nlike   this    one.     And   there   is    no   doubt   that   this   case   was\n\nadjudicated     on    the   merits.    A    contrary     interpretation   would\n\neviscerate Cullen and we reject it.\n\n              As the only issue on which a certificate of appealability\n\nwas entered concerned Atkins' request for a federal evidentiary\n\nhearing, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",
