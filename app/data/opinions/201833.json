These appeals evolve from a\n\nreverse sting operation designed to ferret out police corruption.\n\nThe defendants, all law enforcement officers who greedily took the\n\nbait, were found guilty by a jury on a myriad of charges and\n\nthereafter sentenced to lengthy prison terms.     In this venue, they\n\nvariously challenge the district court's stewardship of the trial,\n\ntheir convictions, and their sentences. Concluding, as we do, that\n\ntheir asseverational array lacks merit, we affirm the judgments\n\nbelow.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We recount the facts in the light most hospitable to the\n\nverdicts, consistent with record support.       United States v. Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 516 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The central figure in the reverse sting operation that\n\nled to the instant convictions is Arturo Ortiz-Colón, himself a\n\ncorrupt police officer who, after his apprehension in the spring of\n\n2000, began to cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n(FBI) in exchange for leniency.    That arrangement resulted in the\n\nlaunching of Operation Honor Perdido (Lost Honor).\n\n           In the course of that operation, Ortiz-Colón, posing as\n\na corrupt federal agent, would present opportunities to local\n\npolice officers to earn money for assisting in the transportation\n\nand protection of illegal drugs.        The FBI furnished Ortiz-Colón\n\nwith accouterments suitable to his assumed role, including a luxury\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fapartment and a flashy car (both of which were outfitted with\n\nrecording equipment). His telephone was similarly appointed and he\n\nhimself wore a body wire when the occasion demanded.                Ortiz-Colón\n\nfound no shortage of local police officers who hastened to trade\n\nhonor for hard cash.             See, e.g., United States v. Villafane-\n\nJimenez, 410 F.3d 74 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (recounting\n\ndetails of an unrelated Honor Perdido prosecution and conviction);\n\nUnited States v. Vázquez Guadalupe, 407 F.3d 492 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(same); United States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (same).\n\n            Diana Díaz, herself a corrupt police officer who had\n\nbought into Ortiz-Colón's charade, functioned as his \"recruiter.\"\n\nAt   various   times,   she      approached    defendant-appellant     Edgardo\n\nSánchez-Berríos (Sánchez), defendant-appellant José Cotto-Latorre\n\n(Cotto), and defendant-appellant David Cruz-Pagán (Cruz).               Each of\n\nthem was enlisted to participate in a different drug transport.\n\nThe details follow.\n\n            After Díaz initially contacted Sánchez, Ortiz-Colón hired\n\nhim to act as an escort for a drug delivery scheduled to take place\n\nin November of 2000.     Sánchez, driving Díaz's car, accompanied the\n\ntransport   vehicle     to   a    shopping    plaza   where   the   drugs   were\n\ntransferred to another vehicle.          Ortiz-Colón paid Sánchez $5,000\n\nfor his services.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            When   Díaz   approached    Cotto,    he   too   indicated   a\n\nwillingness to participate in drug deals.         She took him and other\n\npolice officers whom she had recruited to Ortiz-Colón's apartment.\n\nThe group discussed a transport projected to take place in April of\n\n2001.   At that meeting, Ortiz-Colón explained that he was working\n\nfor a Colombian drug dealer (El Viejo) and that the officers would\n\nbe expected to escort and unload an incoming shipment of cocaine\n\nwhile pretending that they were raiding the boat on which it\n\narrived.    The \"raiding party\" would then deliver the cocaine to El\n\nViejo and be paid for their services.            Ortiz-Colón offered the\n\nassembled officers an opportunity to opt out; Cotto not only chose\n\nto stay, but also volunteered to recruit other police officers to\n\nswell the coconspirators' ranks.\n\n            On the day of the transport, Cotto, wearing his uniform\n\nshirt and carrying his official firearm, rode with Ortiz-Colón to\n\na marina.    He helped to off-load the cocaine, stow it in Ortiz-\n\nColón's car, and ferry it to Ortiz-Colón's apartment.         Ortiz-Colón\n\npaid Cotto $5,000 for services rendered.\n\n            Díaz also recruited Cruz and arranged an audience for him\n\nwith Ortiz-Colón.    Cruz agreed to participate in a drug transport\n\nthat occurred in May of 2001.     During that incident, Cruz carried\n\nhis firearm and helped to move cocaine from one vehicle to another.\n\nOrtiz-Colón later paid him $5,000 for his help.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            The three appellants, along with Díaz and twelve other\n\nindividuals, were eventually indicted by a federal grand jury\n\nsitting in the District of Puerto Rico.         Pertinently, count 1 of\n\nthe   second    superseding   indictment    charged    the   sixteen   named\n\ndefendants, including all three appellants, with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.           See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841, 846.      Count 2 charged Sánchez with attempting to distribute\n\nmore than five kilograms of cocaine while aiding and abetting\n\nothers.   See 18 U.S.C. § 2; 21 U.S.C. § 841.         Counts 5 and 6 levied\n\nthe same charge against Cotto and Cruz, respectively.              Count 8\n\ncharged each of the three appellants, among others, with carrying\n\na firearm during and in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 924©).\n\n            After a twelve-day trial, the jury convicted Sánchez on\n\ncounts 1 and 2, Cotto on counts 1, 5, and 8, and Cruz on counts 1,\n\n6, and 8.      The district court sentenced Sánchez to 151 months of\n\nimprisonment and a five-year supervised release term; Cotto to 188\n\nmonths    of   imprisonment   on   the     drug-trafficking    charges,   a\n\nconsecutive five-year incarcerative term on the weapons count, and\n\neight years of supervised release; and Cruz to 151 months of\n\nimprisonment on the drug-trafficking charges, a consecutive five-\n\nyear incarcerative term on the weapons count, and eight years of\n\nsupervised release.     These appeals ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The appellants advance a gallimaufry of challenges to\n\ntheir convictions and sentences. We discuss this panoply of issues\n\nalong a quasi-chronological continuum that stretches from trial to\n\nsentencing.\n\n                     A.   Prosecutorial Misconduct.\n\n           Cotto argues that improper prosecutorial comments entitle\n\nhim to a new trial.       His challenge encompasses a variety of word\n\nchoices made throughout the proceedings.                He castigates (i) the\n\nprosecutor's     reference,    in    the     opening    statement,   to    \"Honor\n\nPerdido\"; (ii) the prosecutor's eliciting of testimony from an FBI\n\nagent, Jeffrey Paleaz, that the FBI used sham cocaine in the\n\nreverse sting operation because it \"did not trust\" the targeted\n\npolice officers with real cocaine; (iii) the prosecutor's repeated\n\ninvocation     of   the   term      \"corrupt    officers\";     and   (iv)    the\n\nprosecutor's     allusion,    in     closing    argument,     to   the    defense\n\nattorneys' explanation of what had occurred as a \"self serving\n\nabsurdity.\"\n\n           Because Cotto interposed no contemporaneous objections to\n\nany of these word choices, we review his claim of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct under the plain error rubric.               \"Review for plain error\n\nentails four showings:        (1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                     United\n\nStates   v.    Duarte,    246     F.3d   56,    60    (1st   Cir.   2001).    If   an\n\nassignment of error fails to pass through any of these four\n\nscreens, it is not a basis for reversal.                 See id.    Consequently, a\n\nparty who neglects to call a looming error to the trial court's\n\nattention acts at his peril; under plain error review, we have\n\nleeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors.\n\nSee United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(explaining     that     \"[t]he    plain   error       doctrine     concentrates   on\n\n'blockbusters'\" (quoting United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100\n\n(1st Cir. 1987))).\n\n              None of the statements singled out by Cotto was improper.\n\n\"Honor Perdido\" was the appellation assigned to the sting operation\n\nand, thus, was a background fact of the case.                            The agent's\n\ntestimony, which explained why no actual drugs were in evidence,\n\nfalls into the same classification.                  The prosecutor's description\n\nof the defense as a \"self serving absurdity,\" while not flattering,\n\nwas fair argument.        See, e.g., United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d\n\n40, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that prosecutor's comment that\n\nthe defense argument was a \"'diversion' that does not 'pass the\n\nlaugh    test'\"   did    not    \"cross[]       the    line\");   United    States   v.\n\nSblendorio, 830 F.2d 1382, 1395 (7th Cir. 1987) (\"Counsel represent\n\nmany people with lame defenses; the prosecutor [is] entitled to say\n\nthat the defenses [are] lame . . . .\").\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f              The references to \"corrupt officers\" present a marginally\n\ncloser call.          Mischaracterization or overuse of a potentially\n\ninflammatory phrase may in some exaggerated circumstances be deemed\n\nprejudicial.      As we said in United States v. Felton, 417 F.3d 97,\n\n103 (1st Cir. 2005), \"[o]ne can imagine situations in which an\n\nepithet carries connotations well beyond the crime charged . . . or\n\ncases    in   which    [a]   description    is   gratuitously    inflammatory,\n\nserving no reasonable purpose in summarizing the government's\n\nposition.\"      Here, however, the evidence justified the descriptive\n\nterm1 and the manner and frequency of the prosecutor's usage of it\n\nwas not excessive.            Moreover, the trial judge's instructions\n\nsafeguarded against the possibility of unfair prejudice.                   See\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d at 977. In these circumstances, we discern nothing\n\napproximating plain error.\n\n                      B.   Admission of Hearsay Evidence.\n\n              Cotto    challenges    the    admission    of     an   audiotaped\n\nconversation between Díaz and Ortiz-Colón, in which Díaz described\n\nher initial encounter with Cotto, opined that he had been involved\n\nin drug escorts before, and recounted his enthusiasm for the task.\n\nDíaz did not testify at trial.        Building on this foundation, Cotto\n\n\n     1\n      Virtually all of Cotto's participation in the drug transport\nwas recorded and presented to the jury by videotape and audiotape.\nGiven this nearly irrefutable evidence of Cotto's guilt and his\nheroic (if unsuccessful) efforts to mount an entrapment defense,\nsee infra Part II(C), it cannot sensibly be said that describing\nhim as a \"corrupt officer\" so poisoned the well as to require\nreversal here.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fmakes two arguments against the admission of this conversation.\n\nFirst, he maintains that it did not fall under any exception to the\n\nhearsay rule.       Second, he asseverates that its admission violated\n\nhis right to confrontation.\n\n             There is a threshold issue here — an issue that involves\n\nthe distinction between waiver and forfeiture. We have limned that\n\ndistinction in the following terms:\n\n             A party waives a right when he intentionally\n             relinquishes or abandons it.   This is to be\n             distinguished from a situation in which a\n             party fails to make a timely assertion of a\n             right   —  what   courts  typically   call  a\n             \"forfeiture.\" The difference is critical: a\n             waived issue ordinarily cannot be resurrected\n             on appeal, whereas a forfeited issue may be\n             reviewed for plain error.\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citations omitted).      Although there was no explicit waiver here,\n\nthe government asserts that we should not review this challenge\n\nbecause the hearsay issue was so obvious that the defense's failure\n\nto object constituted a waiver.\n\n             This    argument   is   unavailing.   In   the   absence   of\n\nextraordinary circumstances, see, e.g., United States v. Houlihan,\n\n92 F.3d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding that defendants had\n\nwaived right to raise hearsay objections by murdering the potential\n\nwitness) — and none are present here — a party who does not object\n\nto an evidentiary ruling has forfeited his claim of error, not\n\nwaived it.    See Fed. R. Evid. 103(d); see also Chestnut v. City of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fLowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam).             We\n\nthus       review   the   lower   court's    admission   of   the   challenged\n\nconversation for plain error.         See Chestnut, 305 F.3d at 20.\n\n               The Federal Rules of Evidence exclude from the definition\n\nof hearsay \"statement[s] by a coconspirator of a party [made]\n\nduring the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"              Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(E).         When uttered in furtherance of the mission of\n\nan ongoing conspiracy, such statements are outside the purview of\n\nthe hearsay bar.          See Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440,\n\n443 (1949); United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).2\n\n               Cotto posits that Díaz's statement — that is the only\n\nportion of the conversation with which we are concerned, as Ortiz-\n\nColón testified at the trial — does not fall under this exemption\n\nbecause it was made before he had joined the conspiracy and, thus,\n\nbefore he and Díaz could be considered coconspirators.              Yet it is\n\nclear from Díaz's statement, as well as from Cotto's subsequent\n\naccount of the conversation (recorded in the course of the sting\n\nand admitted into evidence without objection), that Cotto agreed to\n\njoin the conspiracy when he and Díaz first spoke.             Although Cotto\n\n\n\n       2\n      Although the Federal Rules of Evidence treat coconspirator\nstatements as exemptions from the hearsay rule and Supreme Court\njurisprudence treats them as exceptions to that rule, see\nKrulewitch, 336 U.S. at 443, this difference in nomenclature is\nimmaterial. See United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 399 n.12\n(1986).\n\n                                      -11-\n\fdid not know the precise details of the plan until he met with\n\nOrtiz-Colón, he understood both his role and the role of others in\n\nthe illicit activity.   No more was exigible.    Cf. United States v.\n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1019 (1st Cir. 1992)      (holding that \"the\n\ngovernment need not establish that the [members] knew or agreed\n\nupon every detail of the conspiracy,\" but only \"the essential\n\nnature of the plan and their connections with it\" (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Baines, 812\n\nF.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[A] conspiracy is like a train.      When\n\na party knowingly steps aboard, he is part of the crew, and assumes\n\nconspirator's responsibility for the existing freight — or conduct\n\n— regardless of whether he is aware of just what it is composed.\").\n\n          In all events, Díaz's statement unarguably was made in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy as it tended to promote one or more\n\nof the objects of the conspiracy.   See United States v. Piper, 298\n\nF.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir. 2002).    Díaz was reporting the progress of\n\nher recruitment efforts to the ringleader.      This was obviously an\n\nintegral element of the phantom drug-trafficking operation.         The\n\naudiotape thus falls squarely within the coconspirator exemption to\n\nthe hearsay rule and the district court did not err in admitting it\n\non that ground.\n\n          Cotto's   Confrontation   Clause   challenge   is   similarly\n\nunpersuasive.   In mounting this challenge, Cotto invokes Crawford\n\nv. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), in which the Supreme Court held\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fthat   the     admission      of     testimonial          statements,    without      any\n\nopportunity for cross-examination, amounted to a Sixth Amendment\n\nviolation.       Id.    at    68.      That    decision,         however,    explicitly\n\nrecognized that statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy \"by\n\ntheir nature [are] not testimonial.\"                 Id. at 56.     The introduction\n\nof   Díaz's    statement,      therefore,          does    not   constitute    a   Sixth\n\nAmendment violation despite the lack of any opportunity for cross-\n\nexamination.         See Felton, 417 F.3d at 103 (holding that the\n\nintroduction of a coconspirator statement did not abridge the\n\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment rights because the statement fell\n\nwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception and was nontestimonial);\n\nsee also United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 399-400 (1986)\n\n(holding      that     the    Sixth     Amendment          does    not      require    an\n\nunavailability rule for the admission of coconspirator statements).\n\n              Nor does the admission of Díaz's statement infract the\n\nConstitution by virtue of the rule announced in Bruton v. United\n\nStates, 391 U.S. 123 (1968).                Bruton held that a Sixth Amendment\n\nviolation occurs when a court, at a joint trial, admits one\n\ndefendant's     confession,         which    implicates      the    other    defendant,\n\nwithout the opportunity for cross-examination.                      Id. at 137.       The\n\nCourt was careful not to take a position on whether the outcome\n\nwould have been different had the confession been admitted under a\n\nhearsay exception.           See id. at 128 n.3.             We have answered this\n\nquestion, holding unequivocally that \"there is no Bruton problem\"\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fwhen a \"statement falls within the coconspirator exception to the\n\nhearsay rule.\"     United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 685 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 1983).\n\n            For these reasons, the admission of the audiotape was\n\nentirely proper.3\n\n                           C.   Entrapment.\n\n            We next examine Cotto's claim that the district court\n\nimproperly refused to instruct the jury on entrapment.        Because\n\nCotto objected to this refusal at trial, we review his assignment\n\nof error de novo.     United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            Two elements comprise the defense of entrapment:     \"(1)\n\ngovernment inducement of the accused to engage in criminal conduct,\n\nand (2) the accused's lack of predisposition to engage in such\n\nconduct.\"    Id.    Only when the accused satisfies an entry-level\n\nburden of production as to both elements is the government put to\n\nits burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that no entrapment\n\noccurred.    See id. at 814-15.    By like token, unless and until a\n\ndefendant carries his entry-level burden, he is not entitled to an\n\ninstruction on an entrapment defense.     Id. at 814.   To clear this\n\nhurdle, he must supply \"evidence which fairly supports the claims\n\n\n     3\n      If more were needed — and we do not think that it is — we\nnote that the bulk of what transpired at Cotto's initial meeting\nwith Díaz was rehearsed by Cotto himself in a later taped\nconversation.   That conversation was admitted at trial and its\nadmission is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fof both government inducement of the crime and [his own] lack of\n\npredisposition to engage in it.\"   Id.\n\n           In this instance, Cotto plainly failed to carry his\n\nentry-level burden as to improper inducement.4    In his appellate\n\nbrief, Cotto makes no meaningful effort to direct us to record\n\nevidence of any improper inducement, but, rather, contents himself\n\nwith sweeping generalities (e.g., that the government had gone \"to\n\nextraordinary lengths to create a fiction,\" suggested that there\n\nwould be \"reprisals if [Cotto] declined to join,\" and exploited\n\n\"the psychological pressure of the authority of higher ranked\n\nofficers [to overwhelm] any resistance\").    The record offers no\n\nsupport for these generalities. To the contrary, recorded meetings\n\nshow beyond hope of contradiction that Cotto was eager to avail\n\nhimself of the proffered drug-escort opportunities.       The only\n\ninducement that the record reflects is a chance to make money — and\n\nholding out the prospect of illicit gain is not the sort of\n\ngovernment inducement that can pave the way for an entrapment\n\ndefense.   See United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (explaining that entrapment does not exist merely because \"a\n\nperson succumbs to his own greed or to the lure of easy money\");\n\nsee also United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n\n\n     4\n      Because this failure, in and of itself, justified the\ndistrict court's refusal to charge the jury on entrapment, see\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814, we need not dwell on the evidence of\npredisposition.\n\n                               -15-\n\f(\"Neither mere solicitation nor the creation of opportunities to\n\ncommit an offense comprises inducement.\").\n\n          That    ends    this   aspect        of    the    matter.      Since   Cotto\n\nprovided no evidence of improper inducement adequate to satisfy his\n\nentry-level burden of production, the district court's decision to\n\nwithhold an entrapment instruction cannot be faulted.\n\n                   D.    Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n          Sánchez and Cotto both challenge the district court's\n\ndenial of their motions for judgment of acquittal.                       See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29.     We ordinarily review the denial of such motions de\n\nnovo, asking \"whether the evidence, construed favorably to the\n\ngovernment,    permitted    rational       jurors          to   conclude,   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty as charged.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2001).                       The\n\ngovernment can supply a satisfactory answer to this question\n\nthrough either direct or circumstantial evidence, or through any\n\ncombination thereof.       United States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Sánchez       claims   that    the        government     did   not   present\n\nsufficient evidence to prove the intent necessary for a conspiracy\n\nconviction.    Without ever using the word \"entrapment,\" he employs\n\nthe essentials of that construct to argue that the district court\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fshould have found entrapment as a matter of law.5       We reject his\n\nimportunings.\n\n           To defeat a sufficiency challenge premised on a defense\n\nof entrapment, the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to\n\nthe   government,    need   only    support   a   finding     of   either\n\npredisposition or lack of improper inducement.      See Rodriguez, 858\n\nF.2d at 814.    The record in this case contains ample evidence on\n\nboth points.\n\n           A discussion of lack of any improper inducement would\n\nsubstantially replicate what we already have written in relation to\n\nCotto.    See supra Part II©).     As to predisposition, we note that\n\nSánchez's involvement in the drug escort was recorded and presented\n\nto the jury.    Among other things, the jurors heard Sánchez being\n\ntold, over and over again, that he did not have to participate in\n\nthe venture.    The jurors also heard Sánchez state that he was not\n\nworried about doing something that he knew was illegal; he was\n\nworried only about the possibility of being caught.         From this and\n\nother evidence, it is abundantly clear that the government provided\n\nenough proof for a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that Sánchez was predisposed to commit the crime (and,\n\ntherefore, was not entrapped).\n\n\n\n      5\n      Had Sánchez raised this challenge in connection with the jury\ninstructions (as did Cotto, see supra Part II(C)), he would have\nencountered a more appellant-friendly scenario. In either guise,\nhowever, the challenge would fail.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          Cotto's Rule 29 challenge takes a different tack.     He\n\njettisons his entrapment argument at this juncture in favor of an\n\nargument that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nweapons count because the government used sham cocaine in the\n\nunderlying transport operation.    Therefore, his thesis runs, his\n\nfirearm could not have been used \"in furtherance of\" any drug-\n\nrelated crime.\n\n          The first flaw in this line of argument is that Cotto did\n\nnot pursue it below. Since this particular theory of insufficiency\n\nwas not preserved, our review is limited to the prevention of clear\n\nand gross injustice.6   Santiago, 83 F.3d at 23.\n\n          The evidence here is palpably sufficient to support the\n\nweapons count.   The statute of conviction applies to \"any person\n\nwho, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug\n\ntrafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted . .\n\n. , uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n\ncrime, possesses a firearm.\"      18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).    The\n\ngovernment brought the charge against Cotto in conjunction with the\n\nconspiracy count.   A culpable conspiracy may exist even though the\n\n\n     6\n      It is unclear from our precedents whether this standard is\nsimply a gloss on plain error review, see, e.g., United States v.\nPeña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 2000) (combining the two\ntests), or a more stringent standard all its own, see United States\nv. Luciano, 329 F.3d 1, 5 & n.6 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that \"we\nhave generally avoided framing the review of unpreserved\ninsufficiency claims in terms of 'plain error'\" and collecting\ncases). It is unnecessary for us to clarify this point today as\nCotto's claim would not succeed under either version.\n\n                               -18-\n\fconspirators misapprehend certain facts. United States v. Waldron,\n\n590 F.2d 33, 34 (1st Cir. 1979).        A conspiracy to traffic in\n\ncontrolled substances, punishable under 21 U.S.C. § 846, is itself\n\na drug-trafficking crime and may serve as a predicate offense for\n\npurposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924©).    See United States v. Meggett, 875\n\nF.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir. 1989).    While the substantive crime that is\n\nthe object of the conspiracy may be impossible to achieve, the\n\nconspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an offense for which a person\n\nmay be prosecuted.   See Waldron, 590 F.2d at 34.\n\n          That conclusion leads to game, set, and match.     If the\n\nuse of sham cocaine has no effect on the underlying conspiracy\n\ncharge, then a fortiori, it has no effect on the weapons charge in\n\nthis case.\n\n          Without a showing that the weapons count failed as a\n\nmatter of law, Cotto's sufficiency challenge fizzles.    Videotaped\n\nevidence showed Cotto with his firearm during the drug transport\n\nand additional testimony confirmed that he had his firearm with him\n\nduring the commission of the crime.      That evidence is certainly\n\nenough to allow a rational jury to conclude — as this jury did —\n\nthat Cotto was guilty as charged on the weapons count.\n\n                E.   Sentencing Factor Manipulation.\n\n          Both Sánchez and Cotto accuse the government of improper\n\nsentencing factor manipulation.    These accusations have different\n\nfocal points:   Sánchez asserts that the government manipulated the\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fquantity of drugs that he handled in order to hike his base offense\n\nlevel under the federal sentencing guidelines, see USSG §2D1.1,\n\nwhereas Cotto asserts that the government connived to have him\n\ncarry his firearm in order to assure a consecutive five-year\n\nsentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).          Neither Sánchez nor\n\nCotto raised the issue of sentencing factor manipulation in the\n\nlower court, so our review is at best restricted to plain error.7\n\n           Assuming,    favorably    to    the   appellants,   that   these\n\narguments were merely forfeited rather then waived, we discern no\n\nplain error.    Impermissible sentencing factor manipulation can\n\njustify a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines (or\n\nfrom any applicable statutory minimum). See Villafane-Jimenez, 410\n\nF.3d at 87; United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 194 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   Withal, such manipulation occurs only when the authorities\n\n\"venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage\n\nin extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or\n\nscale of the crime.\"      United States v. Barbour, 393 F.3d 82, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).       The facts in this case do not show anything\n\nbeyond the level of manipulation inherent in virtually any sting\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      We say \"at best\" because it is arguable that both appellants\nwaived the issue. Counsel for Sánchez stated at his sentencing\nhearing that he was not making a request for a downward departure,\nalthough he recognized the court's authority to depart. Counsel\nfor Cotto stated that \"[he didn't] think\" that the case\n\"qualifie[d] for sentencing entrapment.\"\n\n                                    -20-\n\foperation — and that is not enough to warrant a downward departure.\n\nSee Connell, 960 F.2d at 194.\n\n            We need not linger long over this point.          The record\n\nmakes manifest that the government did not lure the appellants into\n\ncommitting crimes more heinous than they were predisposed to\n\ncommit.   Rather, it fashioned a series of scenarios that fell well\n\nwithin the bounds of the crimes that the appellants indicated they\n\nwere prepared to perpetrate.      See id. at 196.    Both the amount of\n\ndrugs that Sánchez would transport and Cotto's agreement to carry\n\na firearm were part of the initial plans and remained consistent\n\nthroughout the operation.       Nothing about those stipulations would\n\nraise the eyebrow of an impartial observer.\n\n            In short, the record reflects no impermissible sentencing\n\nfactor manipulation here.\n\n                  F.    Acceptance of Responsibility.\n\n            Cotto argues that he should have received a two-level\n\nreduction    in   his    base    offense   level    for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility. See USSG §3E1.1. Because he raises this issue for\n\nthe first time on appeal, our review is for plain error.               See\n\nUnited States v. Carrasco-Mateo, 389 F.3d 239, 243 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWe find no error here, plain or otherwise.\n\n            An acceptance of responsibility adjustment ordinarily \"is\n\nnot intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its\n\nburden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fof guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses\n\nremorse.\"     USSG §3E1.1, cmt. (n.2).       There are, however, \"rare\n\nsituations\" in which \"a defendant may clearly demonstrate an\n\nacceptance of responsibility . . . even though he exercises his\n\nconstitutional right to trial.\" Id. Cotto attempts to fit himself\n\nwithin the narrow confines of this exception by professing that he\n\nwent to trial only to establish a defense of entrapment — not to\n\ncontest his factual guilt.\n\n            We do not rule out the possibility that, in some odd\n\ncircumstances, a defendant who goes to trial solely to test the\n\nmerits of an entrapment defense might nonetheless remain eligible\n\nfor an acceptance of responsibility adjustment.            Here, however,\n\nCotto's claim of entrapment was so weak that it did not even reach\n\nthe jury.    Given his election to put the government to its proof at\n\ntrial in order to explore so asthenic a defense, there is no\n\nprincipled     way   that   we   can   set   aside   the   trial   court's\n\ndiscretionary refusal to discount his sentence for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.\n\n                            G.   Booker Error.\n\n            Cotto and Cruz ask that their cases be remanded for\n\nresentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).            Because neither\n\nappellant preserved a claim of Booker error below, we review for\n\nplain error.    See United States v. Guzmán, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fCir.       2005)   [No.   04-1888,   slip    op.    at   9];   United   States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n               In its sentencing determinations, the district court\n\ntreated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory.                 As to Cotto, the\n\ncourt started with a base offense level of 34, see USSG §2D1.1, to\n\nwhich it added two levels for abuse of a position of trust, see id.\n\n§3B1.3.       A total offense level of 36, combined with the absence of\n\nany relevant criminal history, yielded a guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR) of 188-235 months for the drug-trafficking counts. The court\n\nimposed a 188-month sentence on those counts.\n\n               As to Cruz, the district court began with a base offense\n\nlevel of 32, see id. §2D1.1, and added two levels for abuse of a\n\nposition of trust, see id. §3B1.3.                A total offense level of 34,\n\ncombined      with   the   absence   of     any    relevant    criminal   history,\n\nresulted in a GSR of 151-181 months for the drug-trafficking\n\ncounts.       The court imposed a 151-month sentence on those counts.8\n\n               Because the court treated the sentencing guidelines as\n\nmandatory, the appellants have satisfied the first two prongs of\n\nthe plain error test.          See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.               The\n\n\n       8\n      Both Cotto and Cruz were convicted on weapons counts that\ncarried a statutory five-year mandatory minimum, to be imposed\nconsecutively to their sentences on the drug-trafficking counts.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).    Because that portion of the\nsentences was driven by statute, not by the guidelines, the claim\nof Booker error does not reach those counts. See Antonakopoulos,\n399 F.3d at 75 (\"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required\nby a statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by a\ndefendant is not a candidate for Booker error.\").\n\n                                       -23-\n\fthird prong requires us to ask whether either or both of the\n\nappellants have pointed to circumstances that create a reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would have imposed a more\n\nlenient sentence had the guidelines been advisory.     See id.   We\n\nconclude that they have not.\n\n          It is not enough for a defendant merely to argue that his\n\nsentence might have been different had the guidelines been advisory\n\nat the time of sentencing.     Guzmán, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n11].   By the same token, an unadorned claim that the judge — and\n\nnot the jury — found sentencing facts, even if true, does not\n\nwarrant resentencing.   United States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 152\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).   Rather, the defendant must point to specific\n\nindicia of a reasonable probability of a more favorable outcome,\n\nsee Guzmán, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 11] — a burden that is\n\ntempered by our acknowledgment that, in this sort of situation, we\n\nwill not be \"overly demanding as to proof of probability.\"   United\n\nStates v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Cruz argues broadly that his sentence was \"unreasonable,\"\n\nbut he declined our invitation to submit supplemental briefing in\n\nthe wake of the Booker and Antonakopoulos decisions.      The only\n\nspecific item to which he adverts is the fact that he was sentenced\n\nat the bottom of the GSR. That fact, standing alone, is manifestly\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\finsufficient to satisfy the third element of the plain error test.9\n\nSee Guzmán, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 12]; United States v.\n\nSerrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Cotto, too, cites the fact that the court sentenced him\n\nat   the   low   end   of   the   GSR.     Apart   from   that,   however,   his\n\nsupplemental brief consists mainly of a diatribe exhorting us to\n\nscrap our plain error framework and adopt a rebuttable presumption\n\nof prejudice for unpreserved Booker errors.                See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Barnett, 398 F.3d 516, 527-28 (6th Cir. 2005).                      We\n\nconsistently have declined to alter our approach in this way.                See\n\nGuzmán, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 8] (citing Eulitt v. Me.,\n\nDep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004), for the\n\nproposition that, in a multi-panel circuit, panels are bound by\n\nprior panel decision closely on point).\n\n            To say more on this topic would be supererogatory. There\n\nis simply no warrant here for a Booker remand.\n\n                 H.    Delegation of Sentencing Authority.\n\n            As a final matter, Sánchez and Cruz assert that the\n\ndistrict court improperly delegated its sentencing authority when\n\nit imposed a supervised release condition that allowed a probation\n\n\n\n      9\n      Within his claim of Booker error, Cruz inserts a conclusory\nassertion that the court improperly computed his GSR under the\nsentencing guidelines. Because he does not sufficiently develop\nthis assertion as an independent argument or assignment of error,\nwe deem it abandoned. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                         -25-\n\fofficer to determine the number of drug tests that would be\n\nconducted during their respective periods of supervised release and\n\nto decide what should happen if either tested positive (that is,\n\nwhether enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program would be\n\nrequired).10    Because neither Sánchez nor Cruz objected to the\n\nsupervised     release   conditions   at   sentencing,   their   current\n\nobjections engender plain error review.      United States v. Padilla,\n\n415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).\n\n           There is a procedural twist.       The government confessed\n\nerror on both points in its brief and indicated that it would\n\nacquiesce in a remand.     A concession by either party in a criminal\n\ncase as to a legal conclusion is not binding on an appellate court.\n\nSee United States v. Daas, 198 F.3d 1167, 1178 n.14 (9th Cir.\n\n1999).    Here, the government's concessions rested on our decision\n\nin United States v. Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 102-06 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) — a decision that has since been overruled in relevant part.\n\nSee Padilla, 415 F.3d at 215.     Given these unusual circumstances,\n\nwe will not hold the government to its concessions, but, rather,\n\n\n\n     10\n      The supervised release condition requires that Sánchez and\nCruz each\n     submit to a drug test within fifteen (15) days of release\n     on supervised release, and at least two (2) tests\n     thereafter when so requested by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer. If any such samples detect substance abuse, the\n     defendant, at the discretion of the U.S. Probation\n     Officer, shall participate in a substance abuse treatment\n     program, arranged and approved by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer . . . .\n\n                                  -26-\n\fwill examine the issues afresh.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\nResendiz-Patino, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (10th Cir. 2005) [No. 03-2191,\n\nslip op. at 10] (disregarding concession when government was \"too\n\nquick to concede the point\").\n\n           To begin, we acknowledge that the sentencing court erred\n\nin structuring the disputed supervised release condition vis-à-vis\n\nthe number of drug tests.     In Meléndez-Santana, we held, as to the\n\nfirst disputed condition, that a sentencing court's delegation of\n\ndiscretion to a probation officer to determine the number of drug\n\ntests that a defendant must undergo, without capping that number,\n\nconstituted a delegation error.         353 F.3d at 102-06 (citing 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d)).     The en banc decision in Padilla left intact\n\nthat holding and, thus, the error satisfies the first two prongs of\n\nthe plain error test.      See Padilla, 415 F.3d at 217-18.\n\n           However, we overruled the \"automatic reversal\" rule of\n\nMeléndez-Santana and substituted conventional plain error review.\n\nSee id. at 219-20.    Upon undertaking that analysis, we held that\n\nthe delegation error neither affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights   nor   seriously   impugned   the    integrity   of   the   judicial\n\nproceedings.     Id. at 220-23.       Thus, the error did not warrant\n\ncorrection.    Id. at 224.\n\n           For essentially the same reasons, we find no reversible\n\nerror here.     For Sánchez and Cruz to show that their supervised\n\nrelease conditions affected their substantial rights, they must\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fpoint to \"circumstances indicating a reasonable probability that\n\nthe trial court, but for the error, would have imposed a different,\n\nmore favorable sentence.\"          Id. at 221 (citing Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 75).        As to the number of drug tests, this showing is\n\n\"nearly impossible\" because we can neither know what limit the\n\ntrial court would have set on drug testing nor know the number of\n\ntests the probation officer will prescribe. Id. A fortiori, there\n\nis no reasonable probability that, but for the delegation error,\n\nthe    supervised    release   conditions       would   have     operated   more\n\nfavorably.\n\n            To cinch matters, the delegation error vis-à-vis the\n\nnumber of drug tests is, as in Padilla, \"simply not of such\n\nmagnitude or consequence that it would undermine faith in the\n\njudicial system were it to stand uncorrected.\"                   Id.   That the\n\nauthority to cap the number of drug tests lies with a judge and not\n\na     probation    officer   reflects    a   legislative        choice,   not   a\n\nconstitutionally grounded right. See id. at 222. In addition, the\n\nerror's effects are limited by statute:                 should the probation\n\nofficer require an inordinate number of tests, a defendant is free\n\nto invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2), which permits a court to modify\n\nthe conditions of supervised release at any time. See Padilla, 415\n\nF.3d at 223.\n\n            This    leaves   the    condition   that    gives    the   probation\n\nofficer discretion to place a defendant in a substance abuse\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\ftreatment program. Although the Padilla court did not specifically\n\naddress that exact condition, its reasoning and result extend to\n\nit.    We   continue   to     recognize     that   the   treatment   condition\n\nconstitutes a delegation error.       See Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d at\n\n101.   We find, however, that the error fails the third and fourth\n\nprongs of the plain error test.\n\n            We will not tarry.      Suffice it to say that we encounter\n\ngrave uncertainty in attempting to divine whether the sentencing\n\ncourt would be more or less likely to require substance abuse\n\ntreatment than the probation officer, so the error cannot be said\n\nto affect substantial rights.             See Padilla, 415 F.3d at 221.\n\nMoreover, the authority of the court to impose the treatment\n\ncondition   derives    from    a   policy    choice      memorialized   in   the\n\nsentencing guidelines, not from any sort of fundamental interest in\n\nfairness.   See USSG §5D1.3(d)(4) (allowing the sentencing court to\n\ninclude \"a [supervised release] condition requiring the defendant\n\nto participate in a program . . . for substance abuse\").                 Thus,\n\nallowing the probation officer, as opposed to the court, to make\n\nthe determination does not call into question the integrity of the\n\nproceedings.    See Padilla, 415 F.3d at 222.\n\n            The bottom line is that we should not waste scarce\n\njudicial resources \"by seeking to rescue forfeited errors of no\n\nimportance, encouraging more such claims and more wasted time in\n\nthe future.\"    Id. at 225 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).            A remand in\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fthis case to correct the modest imperfections in the supervised\n\nrelease conditions would be \"a theft of [judicial] time from cases\n\nwhere the dispute really matters.\"       Id.   We must respect the\n\nprocedural constraints of plain error review and take a practical,\n\ncommon sense approach to determining which few forfeited errors\n\nmerit correction.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the appellants were fairly tried, appropriately\n\nconvicted, and lawfully sentenced.     Their appeals are, therefore,\n\nimpuissant.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f",

The defendants, all law enforcement officers who greedily took the bait, were found guilty by a jury on a myriad of charges and thereafter sentenced to lengthy prison terms. In this venue, they variously challenge the district court's stewardship of the trial, their convictions, and their sentences. Concluding, as we do, that their asseverational array lacks merit, we affirm the judgments below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most hospitable to the verdicts, consistent with record support. <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 516 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central figure in the reverse sting operation that led to the instant convictions is Arturo Ortiz-Col&#243;n, himself a corrupt police officer who, after his apprehension in the spring of 2000, began to cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in exchange for leniency. That arrangement resulted in the launching of Operation Honor Perdido (Lost Honor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of that operation, Ortiz-Col&#243;n, posing as a corrupt federal agent, would present opportunities to local police officers to earn money for assisting in the transportation and protection of illegal drugs. The FBI furnished Ortiz-Col&#243;n with accouterments suitable to his assumed role, including a luxury apartment and a flashy car (both of which were outfitted with recording equipment). His telephone was similarly appointed and he himself wore a body wire when the occasion demanded. Ortiz-Col&#243;n found no shortage of local police officers who hastened to trade honor for hard cash. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d 74 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam) (recounting details of an unrelated Honor Perdido prosecution and conviction); <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <i>United States v. Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diana D&#237;az, herself a corrupt police officer who had bought into Ortiz-Col&#243;n's charade, functioned as his \"recruiter.\" At various times, she approached defendant-appellant Edgardo S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os (S&#225;nchez), defendant-appellant Jos&#233; Cotto-Latorre (Cotto), and defendant-appellant David Cruz-Pag&#225;n (Cruz). Each of them was enlisted to participate in a different drug transport. The details follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After D&#237;az initially contacted S&#225;nchez, Ortiz-Col&#243;n hired him to act as an escort for a drug delivery scheduled to take place in November of 2000. S&#225;nchez, driving D&#237;az's car, accompanied the transport vehicle to a shopping plaza where the drugs were transferred to another vehicle. Ortiz-Col&#243;n paid S&#225;nchez $5,000 for his services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When D&#237;az approached Cotto, he too indicated a willingness to participate in drug deals. She took him and other police officers whom she had recruited to Ortiz-Col&#243;n's apartment. The group discussed a transport projected to take place in April of 2001. At that meeting, Ortiz-Col&#243;n explained that he was working for a Colombian drug dealer (El Viejo) and that the officers would be expected to escort and unload an incoming shipment of cocaine while pretending that they were raiding the boat on which it arrived. The \"raiding party\" would then deliver the cocaine to El Viejo and be paid for their services. Ortiz-Col&#243;n offered the assembled officers an opportunity to opt out; Cotto not only chose to stay, but also volunteered to recruit other police officers to swell the coconspirators' ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day of the transport, Cotto, wearing his uniform shirt and carrying his official firearm, rode with Ortiz-Col&#243;n to a marina. He helped to off-load the cocaine, stow it in Ortiz-Col&#243;n's car, and ferry it to Ortiz-Col&#243;n's apartment. Ortiz-Col&#243;n paid Cotto $5,000 for services rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az also recruited Cruz and arranged an audience for him with Ortiz-Col&#243;n. Cruz agreed to participate in a drug transport that occurred in May of 2001. During that incident, Cruz carried his firearm and helped to move cocaine from one vehicle to another. Ortiz-Col&#243;n later paid him $5,000 for his help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three appellants, along with D&#237;az and twelve other individuals, were eventually indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico. Pertinently, count 1 of the second superseding indictment charged the sixteen named defendants, including all three appellants, with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841, 846. Count 2 charged S&#225;nchez with attempting to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine while aiding and abetting others. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. Counts 5 and 6 levied the same charge against Cotto and Cruz, respectively. Count 8 charged each of the three appellants, among others, with carrying a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. (<i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924&#169;).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a twelve-day trial, the jury convicted S&#225;nchez on counts 1 and 2, Cotto on counts 1, 5, and 8, and Cruz on counts 1, 6, and 8. The district court sentenced S&#225;nchez to 151 months of imprisonment and a five-year supervised release term; Cotto to 188 months of imprisonment on the drug-trafficking charges, a consecutive five-year incarcerative term on the weapons count, and eight years of supervised release; and Cruz to 151 months of imprisonment on the drug-trafficking charges, a consecutive five-year incarcerative term on the weapons count, and eight years of supervised release. These appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants advance a gallimaufry of challenges to their convictions and sentences. We discuss this panoply of issues along a quasi-chronological continuum that stretches from trial to sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto argues that improper prosecutorial comments entitle him to a new trial. His challenge encompasses a variety of word choices made throughout the proceedings. He castigates (i) the prosecutor's reference, in the opening statement, to \"Honor Perdido\"; (ii) the prosecutor's eliciting of testimony from an FBI agent, Jeffrey Paleaz, that the FBI used sham cocaine in the reverse sting operation because it \"did not trust\" the targeted police officers with real cocaine; (iii) the prosecutor's repeated invocation of the term \"corrupt officers\"; and (iv) the prosecutor's allusion, in closing argument, to the defense attorneys' explanation of what had occurred as a \"self serving absurdity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Cotto interposed no contemporaneous objections to any of these word choices, we review his claim of prosecutorial misconduct under the plain error rubric. \"Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). If an assignment of error fails to pass through any of these four screens, it is not a basis for reversal. <i>See id.</i> Consequently, a party who neglects to call a looming error to the trial court's attention acts at his peril; under plain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (explaining that \"[t]he plain error doctrine concentrates on `blockbusters'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the statements singled out by Cotto was improper. \"Honor Perdido\" was the appellation assigned to the sting operation and, thus, was a background fact of the case. The agent's testimony, which explained why no actual drugs were in evidence, falls into the same classification. The prosecutor's description of the defense as a \"self serving absurdity,\" while not flattering, was fair argument. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d 40, 46-47 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that prosecutor's comment that the defense argument was a \"`diversion' that does not `pass the laugh test'\" did not \"cross[] the line\"); <i>United States v. Sblendorio,</i> 830 F.2d 1382, 1395 (7th Cir.1987) (\"Counsel represent many people with lame defenses; the prosecutor [is] entitled to say that the defenses [are] lame . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The references to \"corrupt officers\" present a marginally closer call. Mischaracterization or overuse of a potentially inflammatory phrase may in some exaggerated circumstances be deemed prejudicial. As we said in <i>United States v. Felton,</i> 417 F.3d 97, 103 (1st Cir.2005), \"[o]ne can imagine situations in which an epithet carries connotations well beyond the crime charged . . . or cases in which [a] description is gratuitously inflammatory, serving no reasonable purpose in summarizing the government's position.\" Here, however, the evidence justified the descriptive term<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the manner and frequency of the prosecutor's usage of it was not excessive. Moreover, the trial judge's instructions safeguarded against the possibility of unfair prejudice. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 977. In these circumstances, we discern nothing approximating plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Admission of Hearsay Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto challenges the admission of an audiotaped conversation between D&#237;az and Ortiz-Col&#243;n, in which D&#237;az described her initial encounter with Cotto, opined that he had been involved in drug escorts before, and recounted his enthusiasm for the task. D&#237;az did not testify at trial. Building on this foundation, Cotto makes two arguments against the admission of this conversation. First, he maintains that it did not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule. Second, he asseverates that its admission violated his right to confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a threshold issue here &#8212; an issue that involves the distinction between waiver and forfeiture. We have limned that distinction in the following terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party waives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it. This is to be distinguished from a situation in which a party fails to make a timely assertion of a right &#8212; what courts typically call a \"forfeiture.\" The difference is critical: a waived issue ordinarily cannot be resurrected on appeal, whereas a forfeited issue may be reviewed for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002) (citations omitted). Although there was no explicit waiver here, the government asserts that we should not review this challenge because the hearsay issue was so obvious that the defense's failure to object constituted a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unavailing. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that defendants had waived right to raise hearsay objections by murdering the potential witness) &#8212; and none are present here &#8212; a party who does not object to an evidentiary ruling has forfeited his claim of error, not waived it. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 103(d); <i>see also Chestnut v. City of Lowell,</i> 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (per curiam). We thus review the lower court's admission of the challenged conversation for plain error. <i>See Chestnut,</i> 305 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Rules of Evidence exclude from the definition of hearsay \"statement[s] by a coconspirator of a party [made] during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). When uttered in furtherance of the mission of an ongoing conspiracy, such statements are outside the purview of the hearsay bar. <i>See Krulewitch v. United States,</i> 336 U.S. 440, 443, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949); <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto posits that D&#237;az's statement &#8212; that is the only portion of the conversation with which we are concerned, as Ortiz-Col&#243;n testified at the trial &#8212; does not fall under this exemption because it was made before he had joined the conspiracy and, thus, before he and D&#237;az could be considered coconspirators. Yet it is clear from D&#237;az's statement, as well as from Cotto's subsequent account of the conversation (recorded in the course of the sting and admitted into evidence without objection), that Cotto agreed to join the conspiracy when he and D&#237;az first spoke. Although Cotto did not know the precise details of the plan until he met with Ortiz-Col&#243;n, he understood both his role and the role of others in the illicit activity. No more was exigible. <i>Cf. United States v. O'Campo,</i> 973 F.2d 1015, 1019 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that \"the government need not establish that the [members] knew or agreed upon every detail of the conspiracy,\" but only \"the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Baines,</i> 812 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[A] conspiracy is like a train. When a party knowingly steps aboard, he is part of the crew, and assumes conspirator's responsibility for the existing freight &#8212; or conduct &#8212; regardless of whether he is aware of just what it is composed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, D&#237;az's statement unarguably was made in furtherance of the conspiracy as it tended to promote one or more of the objects of the conspiracy. <i>See United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir.2002). D&#237;az was reporting the progress of her recruitment efforts to the ringleader. This was obviously an integral element of the phantom drug-trafficking operation. The audiotape thus falls squarely within the coconspirator exemption to the hearsay rule and the district court did not err in admitting it on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto's Confrontation Clause challenge is similarly unpersuasive. In mounting this challenge, Cotto invokes <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), in which the Supreme Court held that the admission of testimonial statements, without any opportunity for cross-examination, amounted to a Sixth Amendment violation. <i>Id.</i> at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. That decision, however, explicitly recognized that statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy \"by their nature [are] not testimonial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The introduction of D&#237;az's statement, therefore, does not constitute a Sixth Amendment violation despite the lack of any opportunity for cross-examination. <i>See Felton,</i> 417 F.3d at 103 (holding that the introduction of a coconspirator statement did not abridge the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights because the statement fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception and was nontestimonial); <i>see also United States v. Inadi,</i> 475 U.S. 387, 399-400, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986) (holding that the Sixth Amendment does not require an unavailability rule for the admission of coconspirator statements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the admission of D&#237;az's statement infract the Constitution by virtue of the rule announced in <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). <i>Bruton</i> held that a Sixth Amendment violation occurs when a court, at a joint trial, admits one defendant's confession, which implicates the other defendant, without the opportunity for cross-examination. <i>Id.</i> at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620. The Court was careful not to take a position on whether the outcome would have been different had the confession been admitted under a hearsay exception. <i>See id.</i> at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct. 1620. We have answered this question, holding unequivocally that \"there is no <i>Bruton</i> problem\" when a \"statement falls within the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.\" <i>United States v. Arruda,</i> 715 F.2d 671, 685 n. 11 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the admission of the audiotape was entirely proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Entrapment.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next examine Cotto's claim that the district court improperly refused to instruct the jury on entrapment. Because Cotto objected to this refusal at trial, we review his assignment of error de novo. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two elements comprise the defense of entrapment: \"(1) government inducement of the accused to engage in criminal conduct, and (2) the accused's lack of predisposition to engage in such conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> Only when the accused satisfies an entry-level burden of production as to both elements is the government put to its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that no entrapment occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 814-15. By like token, unless and until a defendant carries his entry-level burden, he is not entitled to an instruction on an entrapment defense. <i>Id.</i> at 814. To clear this hurdle, he must supply \"evidence which fairly supports the claims of both government inducement of the crime and [his own] lack of predisposition to engage in it.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, Cotto plainly failed to carry his entry-level burden as to improper inducement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In his appellate brief, Cotto makes no meaningful effort to direct us to record evidence of any improper inducement, but, rather, contents himself with sweeping generalities (e.g., that the government had gone \"to extraordinary lengths to create a fiction,\" suggested that there would be \"reprisals if [Cotto] declined to join,\" and exploited \"the psychological pressure of the authority of higher ranked officers [to overwhelm] any resistance\"). The record offers no support for these generalities. To the contrary, recorded meetings show beyond hope of contradiction that Cotto was eager to avail himself of the proffered drug-escort opportunities. The <i>only</i> inducement that the record reflects is a chance to make money &#8212; and holding out the prospect of illicit gain is not the sort of government inducement that can pave the way for an entrapment defense. <i>See United States v. Coady,</i> 809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that entrapment does not exist merely because \"a person succumbs to his own greed or to the lure of easy money\"); <i>see also United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir.1994) (\"Neither mere solicitation nor the creation of opportunities to commit an offense comprises inducement.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Since Cotto provided no evidence of improper inducement adequate to satisfy his entry-level burden of production, the district court's decision to withhold an entrapment instruction cannot be faulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S&#225;nchez and Cotto both challenge the district court's denial of their motions for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 29. We ordinarily review the denial of such motions de novo, asking \"whether the evidence, construed favorably to the government, permitted rational jurors to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was guilty as charged.\" <i>United States v. Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir.2001). The government can supply a satisfactory answer to this question through either direct or circumstantial evidence, or through any combination thereof. <i>United States v. Santiago,</i> 83 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S&#225;nchez claims that the government did not present sufficient evidence to prove the intent necessary for a conspiracy conviction. Without ever using the word \"entrapment,\" he employs the essentials of that construct to argue that the district court should have found entrapment as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We reject his importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To defeat a sufficiency challenge premised on a defense of entrapment, the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government, need only support a finding of either predisposition or lack of improper inducement. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 814. The record in this case contains ample evidence on both points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A discussion of lack of any improper inducement would substantially replicate what we already have written in relation to Cotto. (<i>See supra</i> Part II&#169;). As to predisposition, we note that S&#225;nchez's involvement in the drug escort was recorded and presented to the jury. Among other things, the jurors heard S&#225;nchez being told, over and over again, that he did not have to participate in the venture. The jurors also heard S&#225;nchez state that he was not worried about doing something that he knew was illegal; he was worried only about the possibility of being caught. From this and other evidence, it is abundantly clear that the government provided enough proof for a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that S&#225;nchez was predisposed to commit the crime (and, therefore, was not entrapped).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto's Rule 29 challenge takes a different tack. He jettisons his entrapment argument at this juncture in favor of an argument that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the weapons count because the government used sham cocaine in the underlying transport operation. Therefore, his thesis runs, his firearm could not have been used \"in furtherance of\" any drug-related crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first flaw in this line of argument is that Cotto did not pursue it below. Since this particular theory of insufficiency was not preserved, our review is limited to the prevention of clear and gross injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Santiago,</i> 83 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here is palpably sufficient to support the weapons count. The statute of conviction applies to \"any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted . . ., uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). The government brought the charge against Cotto in conjunction with the conspiracy count. A culpable conspiracy may exist even though the conspirators misapprehend certain facts. <i>United States v. Waldron,</i> 590 F.2d 33, 34 (1st Cir.1979). (A conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances, punishable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, is itself a drug-trafficking crime and may serve as a predicate offense for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924&#169;). <i>See United States v. Meggett,</i> 875 F.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir.1989). While the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy may be impossible to achieve, the conspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an offense for which a person may be prosecuted. <i>See Waldron,</i> 590 F.2d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That conclusion leads to game, set, and match. If the use of sham cocaine has no effect on the underlying conspiracy charge, then a fortiori, it has no effect on the weapons charge in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without a showing that the weapons count failed as a matter of law, Cotto's sufficiency challenge fizzles. Videotaped evidence showed Cotto with his firearm during the drug transport and additional testimony confirmed that he had his firearm with him during the commission of the crime. That evidence is certainly enough to allow a rational jury to conclude &#8212; as this jury did &#8212; that Cotto was guilty as charged on the weapons count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>Sentencing Factor Manipulation.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both S&#225;nchez and Cotto accuse the government of improper sentencing factor manipulation. These accusations have different focal points: S&#225;nchez asserts that the government manipulated the quantity of drugs that he handled in order to hike his base offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1, whereas Cotto asserts that the government connived to have him carry his firearm in order to assure a consecutive five-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i). Neither S&#225;nchez nor Cotto raised the issue of sentencing factor manipulation in the lower court, so our review is at best restricted to plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, favorably to the appellants, that these arguments were merely forfeited rather then waived, we discern no plain error. Impermissible sentencing factor manipulation can justify a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines (or from any applicable statutory minimum). <i>See Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d at 87; <i>United States v. Connell,</i> 960 F.2d 191, 194 (1st Cir.1992). Withal, such manipulation occurs only when the authorities \"venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime.\" <i>United States v. Barbour,</i> 393 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2004). The facts in this case do not show anything beyond the level of manipulation inherent in virtually any sting operation &#8212; and that is not enough to warrant a downward departure. <i>See Connell,</i> 960 F.2d at 194.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over this point. The record makes manifest that the government did not lure the appellants into committing crimes more heinous than they were predisposed to commit. Rather, it fashioned a series of scenarios that fell well within the bounds of the crimes that the appellants indicated they were prepared to perpetrate. <i>See id.</i> at 196. Both the amount of drugs that S&#225;nchez would transport and Cotto's agreement to carry a firearm were part of the initial plans and remained consistent throughout the operation. Nothing about those stipulations would raise the eyebrow of an impartial observer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the record reflects no impermissible sentencing factor manipulation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">F. <i>Acceptance of Responsibility.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto argues that he should have received a two-level reduction in his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1. Because he raises this issue for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Carrasco-Mateo,</i> 389 F.3d 239, 243 (1st Cir.2004). We find no error here, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An acceptance of responsibility adjustment ordinarily \"is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\" USSG &#167; 3E1.1, cmt. (n.2). There are, however, \"rare situations\" in which \"a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility . . . even though he exercises his constitutional right to trial.\" <i>Id.</i> Cotto attempts to fit himself within the narrow confines of this exception by professing that he went to trial only to establish a defense of entrapment &#8212; not to contest his factual guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not rule out the possibility that, in some odd circumstances, a defendant who goes to trial solely to test the merits of an entrapment defense might nonetheless remain eligible for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment. Here, however, Cotto's claim of entrapment was so weak that it did not even reach the jury. Given his election to put the government to its proof at trial in order to explore so asthenic a defense, there is no principled way that we can set aside the trial court's discretionary refusal to discount his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">G. <i>Booker Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto and Cruz ask that their cases be remanded for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because neither appellant preserved a claim of <i>Booker</i> error below, we review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d 27, ___ (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its sentencing determinations, the district court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. As to Cotto, the court started with a base offense level of 34, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1, to which it added two levels for abuse of a position of trust, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.3. A total offense level of 36, combined with the absence of any relevant criminal history, yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188-235 months for the drug-trafficking counts. The court imposed a 188-month sentence on those counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cruz, the district court began with a base offense level of 32, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1, and added two levels for abuse of a position of trust, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.3. A total offense level of 34, combined with the absence of any relevant criminal history, resulted in a GSR of 151-181 months for the drug-trafficking counts. The court imposed a 151-month sentence on those counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory, the appellants have satisfied the first two prongs of the plain error test. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. The third prong requires us to ask whether either or both of the appellants have pointed to circumstances that create a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence had the guidelines been advisory. <i>See id.</i> We conclude that they have not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not enough for a defendant merely to argue that his sentence might have been different had the guidelines been advisory at the time of sentencing. <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at ___. By the same token, an unadorned claim that the judge &#8212; and not the jury &#8212; found sentencing facts, even if true, does not warrant resentencing. <i>United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, the defendant must point to specific indicia of a reasonable probability of a more favorable outcome, <i>see Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 11] &#8212; a burden that is tempered by our acknowledgment that, in this sort of situation, we will not be \"overly demanding as to proof of probability.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz argues broadly that his sentence was \"unreasonable,\" but he declined our invitation to submit supplemental briefing in the wake of the <i>Booker</i> and <i>Antonakopoulos</i> decisions. The only specific item to which he adverts is the fact that he was sentenced at the bottom of the GSR. That fact, standing alone, is manifestly insufficient to satisfy the third element of the plain error test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at ___; <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto, too, cites the fact that the court sentenced him at the low end of the GSR. Apart from that, however, his supplemental brief consists mainly of a diatribe exhorting us to scrap our plain error framework and adopt a rebuttable presumption of prejudice for unpreserved <i>Booker</i> errors. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Barnett,</i> 398 F.3d 516, 527-28 (6th Cir.2005). We consistently have declined to alter our approach in this way. <i>See Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 8] (citing <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004), for the proposition that, in a multi-panel circuit, panels are bound by prior panel decision closely on point).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this topic would be supererogatory. There is simply no warrant here for a <i>Booker</i> remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">H. <i>Delegation of Sentencing Authority.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final matter, S&#225;nchez and Cruz assert that the district court improperly delegated its sentencing authority when it imposed a supervised release condition that allowed a probation officer to determine the number of drug tests that would be conducted during their respective periods of supervised release and to decide what should happen if either tested positive (that is, whether enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program would be required).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Because neither S&#225;nchez nor Cruz objected to the supervised release conditions at sentencing, their current objections engender plain error review. <i>United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a procedural twist. The government confessed error on both points in its brief and indicated that it would acquiesce in a remand. A concession by either party in a criminal case as to a legal conclusion is not binding on an appellate court. <i>See United States v. Daas,</i> 198 F.3d 1167, 1178 n. 14 (9th Cir.1999). Here, the government's concessions rested on our decision in <i>United States v. Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 102-06 (1st Cir.2003) &#8212; a decision that has since been overruled in relevant part. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 215. Given these unusual circumstances, we will not hold the government to its concessions, but, rather, will examine the issues afresh. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Resendiz-Patino,</i> 420 F.3d 1177, ___ (10th Cir.2005) (disregarding concession when government was \"too quick to concede the point\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, we acknowledge that the sentencing court erred in structuring the disputed supervised release condition vis-&#224;-vis the number of drug tests. In <i>Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> we held, as to the first disputed condition, that a sentencing court's delegation of discretion to a probation officer to determine the number of drug tests that a defendant must undergo, without capping that number, constituted a delegation error. 353 F.3d at 102-06 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)). The en banc decision in <i>Padilla</i> left intact that holding and, thus, the error satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error test. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 217-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we overruled the \"automatic reversal\" rule of <i>Mel&#169;ndez-Santana</i> and substituted conventional plain error review. <i>See id.</i> at 219-20. Upon undertaking that analysis, we held that the delegation error neither affected the defendant's substantial rights nor seriously impugned the integrity of the judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 220-23. Thus, the error did not warrant correction. <i>Id.</i> at 224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For essentially the same reasons, we find no reversible error here. For S&#225;nchez and Cruz to show that their supervised release conditions affected their substantial rights, they must point to \"circumstances indicating a reasonable probability that the trial court, but for the error, would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221 (citing <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75). As to the number of drug tests, this showing is \"nearly impossible\" because we can neither know what limit the trial court would have set on drug testing nor know the number of tests the probation officer will prescribe. <i>Id.</i> A fortiori, there is no reasonable probability that, but for the delegation error, the supervised release conditions would have operated more favorably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the delegation error vis-&#224;-vis the number of drug tests is, as in <i>Padilla,</i> \"simply not of such magnitude or consequence that it would undermine faith in the judicial system were it to stand uncorrected.\" <i>Id.</i> That the authority to cap the number of drug tests lies with a judge and not a probation officer reflects a legislative choice, not a constitutionally grounded right. <i>See id.</i> at 222. In addition, the error's effects are limited by statute: should the probation officer require an inordinate number of tests, a defendant is free to invoke 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2), which permits a court to modify the conditions of supervised release at any time. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the condition that gives the probation officer discretion to place a defendant in a substance abuse treatment program. Although the <i>Padilla</i> court did not specifically address that exact condition, its reasoning and result extend to it. We continue to recognize that the treatment condition constitutes a delegation error. <i>See Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 101. We find, however, that the error fails the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not tarry. Suffice it to say that we encounter grave uncertainty in attempting to divine whether the sentencing court would be more or less likely to require substance abuse treatment than the probation officer, so the error cannot be said to affect substantial rights. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 221. Moreover, the authority of the court to impose the treatment condition derives from a policy choice memorialized in the sentencing guidelines, not from any sort of fundamental interest in fairness. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5D1.3(d)(4) (allowing the sentencing court to include \"a [supervised release] condition requiring the defendant to participate in a program . . . for substance abuse\"). Thus, allowing the probation officer, as opposed to the court, to make the determination does not call into question the integrity of the proceedings. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that we should not waste scarce judicial resources \"by seeking to rescue forfeited errors of no importance, encouraging more such claims and more wasted time in the future.\" <i>Id.</i> at 225 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). A remand in this case to correct the modest imperfections in the supervised release conditions would be \"a theft of [judicial] time from cases where the dispute really matters.\" <i>Id.</i> We must respect the procedural constraints of plain error review and take a practical, common sense approach to determining which few forfeited errors merit correction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

The FBI furnished Ortiz-Col&#243;n with accouterments suitable to his assumed role, including a luxury apartment and a flashy car (both of which were outfitted with recording equipment). His telephone was similarly appointed and he himself wore a body wire when the occasion demanded. Ortiz-Col&#243;n found no shortage of local police officers who hastened to trade honor for hard cash. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Each of them was enlisted to participate in a different drug transport. The details follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After D&#237;az initially contacted S&#225;nchez, Ortiz-Col&#243;n hired him to act as an escort for a drug delivery scheduled to take place in November of 2000. S&#225;nchez, driving D&#237;az's car, accompanied the transport vehicle to a shopping plaza where the drugs were transferred to another vehicle. Ortiz-Col&#243;n paid S&#225;nchez $5,000 for his services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When D&#237;az approached Cotto, he too indicated a willingness to participate in drug deals. She took him and other police officers whom she had recruited to Ortiz-Col&#243;n's apartment. The group discussed a transport projected to take place in April of 2001. At that meeting, Ortiz-Col&#243;n explained that he was working for a Colombian drug dealer (El Viejo) and that the officers would be expected to escort and unload an incoming shipment of cocaine while pretending that they were raiding the boat on which it arrived. The \"raiding party\" would then deliver the cocaine to El Viejo and be paid for their services. Ortiz-Col&#243;n offered the assembled officers an opportunity to opt out; Cotto not only chose to stay, but also volunteered to recruit other police officers to swell the coconspirators' ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day of the transport, Cotto, wearing his uniform shirt and carrying his official firearm, rode with Ortiz-Col&#243;n to a marina. He helped to off-load the cocaine, stow it in Ortiz-Col&#243;n's car, and ferry it to Ortiz-Col&#243;n's apartment. Ortiz-Col&#243;n paid Cotto $5,000 for services rendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az also recruited Cruz and arranged an audience for him with Ortiz-Col&#243;n. Cruz agreed to participate in a drug transport that occurred in May of 2001. During that incident, Cruz carried his firearm and helped to move cocaine from one vehicle to another. Ortiz-Col&#243;n later paid him $5,000 for his help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three appellants, along with D&#237;az and twelve other individuals, were eventually indicted by a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico. Pertinently, count 1 of the second superseding indictment charged the sixteen named defendants, including all three appellants, with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841, 846. Count 2 charged S&#225;nchez with attempting to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine while aiding and abetting others. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. Counts 5 and 6 levied the same charge against Cotto and Cruz, respectively. Count 8 charged each of the three appellants, among others, with carrying a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. (<i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924&#169;).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a twelve-day trial, the jury convicted S&#225;nchez on counts 1 and 2, Cotto on counts 1, 5, and 8, and Cruz on counts 1, 6, and 8. The district court sentenced S&#225;nchez to 151 months of imprisonment and a five-year supervised release term; Cotto to 188 months of imprisonment on the drug-trafficking charges, a consecutive five-year incarcerative term on the weapons count, and eight years of supervised release; and Cruz to 151 months of imprisonment on the drug-trafficking charges, a consecutive five-year incarcerative term on the weapons count, and eight years of supervised release. These appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants advance a gallimaufry of challenges to their convictions and sentences. We discuss this panoply of issues along a quasi-chronological continuum that stretches from trial to sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto argues that improper prosecutorial comments entitle him to a new trial. His challenge encompasses a variety of word choices made throughout the proceedings. He castigates (i) the prosecutor's reference, in the opening statement, to \"Honor Perdido\"; (ii) the prosecutor's eliciting of testimony from an FBI agent, Jeffrey Paleaz, that the FBI used sham cocaine in the reverse sting operation because it \"did not trust\" the targeted police officers with real cocaine; (iii) the prosecutor's repeated invocation of the term \"corrupt officers\"; and (iv) the prosecutor's allusion, in closing argument, to the defense attorneys' explanation of what had occurred as a \"self serving absurdity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Cotto interposed no contemporaneous objections to any of these word choices, we review his claim of prosecutorial misconduct under the plain error rubric. \"Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). If an assignment of error fails to pass through any of these four screens, it is not a basis for reversal. <i>See id.</i> Consequently, a party who neglects to call a looming error to the trial court's attention acts at his peril; under plain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (explaining that \"[t]he plain error doctrine concentrates on `blockbusters'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.1987))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the statements singled out by Cotto was improper. \"Honor Perdido\" was the appellation assigned to the sting operation and, thus, was a background fact of the case. The agent's testimony, which explained why no actual drugs were in evidence, falls into the same classification. The prosecutor's description of the defense as a \"self serving absurdity,\" while not flattering, was fair argument. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bennett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196545\"><a href=\"/opinion/196545/united-states-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 46-47 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that prosecutor's comment that the defense argument was a \"`diversion' that does not `pass the laugh test'\" did not \"cross[] the line\"); <i>United States v. Sblendorio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495448\"><a href=\"/opinion/495448/united-states-v-vito-sblendorio-wesley-yong-jaroslav-herda-jason-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1382</span></a></span>, 1395 (7th Cir.1987) (\"Counsel represent many people with lame defenses; the prosecutor [is] entitled to say that the defenses [are] lame . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The references to \"corrupt officers\" present a marginally closer call. Mischaracterization or overuse of a potentially inflammatory phrase may in some exaggerated circumstances be deemed prejudicial. As we said in <i>United States v. Felton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791236\"><a href=\"/opinion/791236/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-leo-v-felton-erica/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2005), \"[o]ne can imagine situations in which an epithet carries connotations well beyond the crime charged . . . or cases in which [a] description is gratuitously inflammatory, serving no reasonable purpose in summarizing the government's position.\" Here, however, the evidence justified the descriptive term<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the manner and frequency of the prosecutor's usage of it was not excessive. Moreover, the trial judge's instructions safeguarded against the possibility of unfair prejudice. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 977. In these circumstances, we discern nothing approximating plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Admission of Hearsay Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto challenges the admission of an audiotaped conversation between D&#237;az and Ortiz-Col&#243;n, in which D&#237;az described her initial encounter with Cotto, opined that he had been involved in drug escorts before, and recounted his enthusiasm for the task. D&#237;az did not testify at trial. Building on this foundation, Cotto makes two arguments against the admission of this conversation.

The record offers no support for these generalities. To the contrary, recorded meetings show beyond hope of contradiction that Cotto was eager to avail himself of the proffered drug-escort opportunities.

(<i>See supra</i> Part II&#169;). As to predisposition, we note that S&#225;nchez's involvement in the drug escort was recorded and presented to the jury. Among other things, the jurors heard S&#225;nchez being told, over and over again, that he did not have to participate in the venture. The jurors also heard S&#225;nchez state that he was not worried about doing something that he knew was illegal; he was worried only about the possibility of being caught. From this and other evidence, it is abundantly clear that the government provided enough proof for a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that S&#225;nchez was predisposed to commit the crime (and, therefore, was not entrapped).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cotto's Rule 29 challenge takes a different tack. He jettisons his entrapment argument at this juncture in favor of an argument that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the weapons count because the government used sham cocaine in the underlying transport operation. Therefore, his thesis runs, his firearm could not have been used \"in furtherance of\" any drug-related crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first flaw in this line of argument is that Cotto did not pursue it below. Since this particular theory of insufficiency was not preserved, our review is limited to the prevention of clear and gross injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Santiago,</i> 83 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here is palpably sufficient to support the weapons count. The statute of conviction applies to \"any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted . . ., uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A). The government brought the charge against Cotto in conjunction with the conspiracy count. A culpable conspiracy may exist even though the conspirators misapprehend certain facts. <i>United States v. Waldron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362477\"><a href=\"/opinion/362477/united-states-v-george-b-waldron/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1979). (A conspiracy to traffic in controlled substances, punishable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, is itself a drug-trafficking crime and may serve as a predicate offense for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924&#169;). <i>See United States v.

While the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy may be impossible to achieve, the conspiracy nonetheless qualifies as an offense for which a person may be prosecuted. <i>See Waldron,</i> 590 F.2d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That conclusion leads to game, set, and match. If the use of sham cocaine has no effect on the underlying conspiracy charge, then a fortiori, it has no effect on the weapons charge in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without a showing that the weapons count failed as a matter of law, Cotto's sufficiency challenge fizzles. Videotaped evidence showed Cotto with his firearm during the drug transport and additional testimony confirmed that he had his firearm with him during the commission of the crime. That evidence is certainly enough to allow a rational jury to conclude &#8212; as this jury did &#8212; that Cotto was guilty as charged on the weapons count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>Sentencing Factor Manipulation.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both S&#225;nchez and Cotto accuse the government of improper sentencing factor manipulation. These accusations have different focal points: S&#225;nchez asserts that the government manipulated the quantity of drugs that he handled in order to hike his base offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1, whereas Cotto asserts that the government connived to have him carry his firearm in order to assure a consecutive five-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i). Neither S&#225;nchez nor Cotto raised the issue of sentencing factor manipulation in the lower court, so our review is at best restricted to plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, favorably to the appellants, that these arguments were merely forfeited rather then waived, we discern no plain error. Impermissible sentencing factor manipulation can justify a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines (or from any applicable statutory minimum). <i>See Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d at 87; <i>United States v. Connell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 194 (1st Cir.1992). Withal, such manipulation occurs only when the authorities \"venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime.\" <i>United States v. Barbour,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201393\"><a href=\"/opinion/201393/united-states-v-barbour/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2004). The facts in this case do not show anything beyond the level of manipulation inherent in virtually any sting operation &#8212; and that is not enough to warrant a downward departure. <i>See Connell,</i> 960 F.2d at 194.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over this point. The record makes manifest that the government did not lure the appellants into committing crimes more heinous than they were predisposed to commit.

There are, however, \"rare situations\" in which \"a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility . . . even though he exercises his constitutional right to trial.\" <i>Id.</i> Cotto attempts to fit himself within the narrow confines of this exception by professing that he went to trial only to establish a defense of entrapment &#8212; not to contest his factual guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not rule out the possibility that, in some odd circumstances, a defendant who goes to trial solely to test the merits of an entrapment defense might nonetheless remain eligible for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment.

A total offense level of 36, combined with the absence of any relevant criminal history, yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 188-235 months for the drug-trafficking counts.

The government confessed error on both points in its brief and indicated that it would acquiesce in a remand. A concession by either party in a criminal case as to a legal conclusion is not binding on an appellate court. <i>See United States v. Daas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767081\"><a href=\"/opinion/767081/united-states-v-abdul-daas-aka-abdual-daas/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span>, 1178 n. 14 (9th Cir.1999). Here, the government's concessions rested on our decision in <i>United States v. Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 102-06 (1st Cir.2003) &#8212; a decision that has since been overruled in relevant part. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 215. Given these unusual circumstances, we will not hold the government to its concessions, but, rather, will examine the issues afresh. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Resendiz-Patino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166343\"><a href=\"/opinion/166343/united-states-v-resendiz-patino/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, ___ (10th Cir.2005) (disregarding concession when government was \"too quick to concede the point\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, we acknowledge that the sentencing court erred in structuring the disputed supervised release condition vis-&#224;-vis the number of drug tests. In <i>Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> we held, as to the first disputed condition, that a sentencing court's delegation of discretion to a probation officer to determine the number of drug tests that a defendant must undergo, without capping that number, constituted a delegation error. 353 F.3d at 102-06 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)). The en banc decision in <i>Padilla</i> left intact that holding and, thus, the error satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error test. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 217-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we overruled the \"automatic reversal\" rule of <i>Mel&#169;ndez-Santana</i> and substituted conventional plain error review. <i>See id.</i> at 219-20. Upon undertaking that analysis, we held that the delegation error neither affected the defendant's substantial rights nor seriously impugned the integrity of the judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 220-23. Thus, the error did not warrant correction. <i>Id.</i> at 224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For essentially the same reasons, we find no reversible error here. For S&#225;nchez and Cruz to show that their supervised release conditions affected their substantial rights, they must point to \"circumstances indicating a reasonable probability that the trial court, but for the error, would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221 (citing <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75). As to the number of drug tests, this showing is \"nearly impossible\" because we can neither know what limit the trial court would have set on drug testing nor know the number of tests the probation officer will prescribe. <i>Id.</i> A fortiori, there is no reasonable probability that, but for the delegation error, the supervised release conditions would have operated more favorably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the delegation error vis-&#224;-vis the number of drug tests is, as in <i>Padilla,</i> \"simply not of such magnitude or consequence that it would undermine faith in the judicial system were it to stand uncorrected.\" <i>Id.</i> That the authority to cap the number of drug tests lies with a judge and not a probation officer reflects a legislative choice, not a constitutionally grounded right. <i>See id.</i> at 222. In addition, the error's effects are limited by statute: should the probation officer require an inordinate number of tests, a defendant is free to invoke 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2), which permits a court to modify the conditions of supervised release at any time. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the condition that gives the probation officer discretion to place a defendant in a substance abuse treatment program. Although the <i>Padilla</i> court did not specifically address that exact condition, its reasoning and result extend to it. We continue to recognize that the treatment condition constitutes a delegation error. <i>See Mel&#169;ndez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 101. We find, however, that the error fails the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not tarry. Suffice it to say that we encounter grave uncertainty in attempting to divine whether the sentencing court would be more or less likely to require substance abuse treatment than the probation officer, so the error cannot be said to affect substantial rights. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 221. Moreover, the authority of the court to impose the treatment condition derives from a policy choice memorialized in the sentencing guidelines, not from any sort of fundamental interest in fairness. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5D1.3(d)(4) (allowing the sentencing court to include \"a [supervised release] condition requiring the defendant to participate in a program . . . for substance abuse\"). Thus, allowing the probation officer, as opposed to the court, to make the determination does not call into question the integrity of the proceedings. <i>See Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that we should not waste scarce judicial resources \"by seeking to rescue forfeited errors of no importance, encouraging more such claims and more wasted time in the future.\" <i>Id.</i> at 225 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). A remand in this case to correct the modest imperfections in the supervised release conditions would be \"a theft of [judicial] time from cases where the dispute really matters.\" <i>Id.</i> We must respect the procedural constraints of plain error review and take a practical, common sense approach to determining which few forfeited errors merit correction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
