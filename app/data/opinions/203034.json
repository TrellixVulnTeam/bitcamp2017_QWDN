Petitioner Liu Lie\n\nTjong, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of\n\na December 29, 2006 final order of removal issued by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"Board\" or \"BIA\") denying his second motion to\n\nreopen his removal proceedings.\n\n            In proceedings before the immigration judge (\"IJ\"), Tjong\n\nadmitted    the     factual   allegations   against    him    and   conceded\n\nremovability.       As relief from removal, Tjong requested asylum,\n\nwithholding    of    removal,   and   protection   under   the   regulations\n\nimplementing the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").\n\nTjong's claims for relief and protection from removal were based on\n\nallegations that he was, and would be, persecuted in Indonesia\n\nbased on his ethnicity (Chinese) and his religion (Christian).\n\nAfter a merits hearing on March 15, 2005, the IJ denied all relief\n\nfrom removal, except for a grant of a brief voluntary departure\n\nperiod.    Tjong appealed to the Board from the IJ's decision, and,\n\non June 26, the Board dismissed his appeal.           He did not petition\n\nthis court for review but instead moved the Board on July 25, 2006,\n\nto reconsider and reopen.       The Board denied that motion on August\n\n30, 2006.     Tjong then filed a second motion to reopen on October\n\n27, 2006, which was denied on December 29, 2006.             In denying the\n\nsecond motion, the Board noted that multiple motions of this kind\n\nwere ordinarily not allowed, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(c)(7)(A); (c)(7)(C)(i), and that Tjong had not met his burden\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fto demonstrate that reopening was warranted under the exception to\n\nthe rule.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).    The present review\n\npetition was then brought in this court.\n\n            We review the Board's ruling on a motion to reopen only\n\nfor abuse of discretion.     INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323-24\n\n(1992).   We must affirm the decision \"unless it was made 'without\n\na rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis.'\"     LeBlanc v. INS,\n\n715 F.2d 685, 693 (1st Cir. 1983) (citation omitted).           This\n\nstandard of review poses an extremely high barrier, and we find no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n            In ruling originally on Tjong's claims, the IJ found that\n\nTjong was ineligible for asylum because his application for asylum\n\nwas untimely under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) and because no changed\n\nor extraordinary circumstances had been shown excusing him for\n\nfiling late.      8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).      The IJ also ruled\n\nadversely to the merits of Tjong's claims, holding he had not met\n\nhis burden for withholding of removal because he did not establish\n\nit to be more likely than not if returned to Indonesia he will be\n\ntargeted for harm on account of race, religion, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, nationality, or political opinion.\n\n            After the Board affirmed the IJ, Tjong moved the Board to\n\nreconsider and reopen, submitting additional supporting evidence,\n\nbut the Board rejected his motions.       It found no error in its\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\finitial decision, and no basis in the new evidence for waiving the\n\none-year asylum filing requirement that Tjong had earlier failed to\n\nmeet.     The Board also determined that Tjong's and his attorney's\n\naffidavits, along with the State Department's April 2006 travel\n\nwarning,      were   insufficient    to   establish    individual   risk   of\n\npersecution or torture.\n\n              Following Tjong's present second motion to reopen with\n\naccompanying new evidence, asserting changed country conditions and\n\na   pattern    and   practice   of    persecution     against   Chinese    and\n\nChristians, the Board ruled that certain of the allegedly new\n\nevidence was not in fact new, as it was available at the time of\n\nthe hearing before the IJ.          The rest of the evidence, the Board\n\nconcluded, fell short of meeting the \"[h]eavy evidentiary burden\n\nrelevant to his reiterated claims,\" being mainly only generalized\n\nbackground information.         The Board also declined to reopen sua\n\nsponte.\n\n              None of the Board's rulings were made without rational\n\nexplanation, nor do they reflect an inexplicable departure from\n\nestablished policies.       Neither do we find them to rest on some\n\nimpermissible basis.       LeBlanc, 715 F.2d at 693.        We accordingly\n\ndeny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
