Lan Zhu Pan, a citizen of China,\n\npetitions for review of a final order of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals denying her claims for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nWe deny the petition.\n\n            Petitioner grew up in a small village in southeastern\n\nChina.   In 1998, her father partnered with Su Fei Pan, a local\n\nCommunist Party boss, to start a new business.         After an employee\n\nembezzled    the    business's   proceeds,    the   venture   failed   and\n\npetitioner's father was left unable to pay off his outstanding\n\nloans.   Su Fei Pan, however, brokered a deal to clear the father's\n\ndebts.      A wealthy Taiwanese man would pay off the debts if\n\npetitioner's father would permit the man to marry his daughter,\n\npetitioner's older sister.       Petitioner's father agreed, but the\n\nsister, who was 19 years younger than the Taiwanese man, refused\n\nand ran away from home.\n\n            A month later, in September 1999, Su Fei Pan attempted to\n\nbroker the same deal but with petitioner taking the place of her\n\nolder sister.      Su Fei Pan told petitioner that her older sister was\n\nwaiting for her in a hotel in the city of Fuzhou (a two hour drive\n\nfrom her village). When petitioner entered the hotel room, she was\n\ngrabbed by an older man, presumably the Taiwanese man, who then\n\ntried to force her down onto the bed.        Petitioner resisted and was\n\nable to escape.       She fled from the hotel and went into hiding.\n\nFrom September 1999 until February 2002, petitioner lived in\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fFuzhou, working in the textile and shoe factories.                 She did not\n\nreturn home during this time, nor did she see the Taiwanese man or\n\nSu Fei Pan again.           A friend in the city subsequently helped\n\npetitioner procure a bogus visa.          On February 22, 2002, petitioner\n\nleft China and arrived at Los Angeles International Airport later\n\nthat day.\n\n            After presenting her fraudulent visa, petitioner was\n\ntaken into custody and placed in removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) (barring entry of an alien who seeks admission\n\nby fraud); id. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (barring entry of any alien\n\nnot in possession of a valid visa or other entry documents).\n\nPetitioner       conceded   removability     and   applied   for   asylum    and\n\nwithholding of removal.         See id. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3).       Following a\n\nhearing,    an    immigration    judge   denied    petitioner's    claims    and\n\nordered her removal to China.            The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\ndismissed her appeal, and this petition for review followed.\n\n            We review the Board's denial of asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval under the deferential substantial evidence standard, under\n\nwhich the decision will stand unless \"the record evidence would\n\ncompel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"\n\nRomilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Guzman\n\nv. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)).              Legal conclusions are\n\nevaluated de novo, \"with appropriate deference to the agency's\n\ninterpretation       of   the   underlying   statute    in   accordance     with\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fadministrative law principles.\"         Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing her\n\neligibility for relief.        Romilus, 385 F.3d at 6; 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1).   That burden requires proof of a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution   on    account   of    a   statutorily   protected     ground,\n\nincluding, among others, membership in a particular social group.\n\nRomilus, 385 F.3d at 6.       A showing of past persecution creates a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.           See Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Although     the    immigration     judge   did     not   credit\n\npetitioner's alleged motive for coming to the United States -- to\n\nescape persecution -- he accepted her narrative of factual events\n\nas \"essentially credible.\"         Nevertheless, the judge denied her\n\nasylum and withholding claims because she had failed to establish\n\nthat she belonged to a particular social group.             On appeal, the\n\nBoard agreed that \"young women from rural China\" is too broad to be\n\nconsidered a \"particular social group\" within the purview of the\n\nimmigration laws.    See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 & n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).    Even assuming the more narrowly defined category\n\nof \"unmarried young wom[en] from rural China . . . who have\n\nresisted being forced into marriages and sexual relationships by a\n\nperson in power\" could be a valid social group, the Board held that\n\npetitioner had failed on the evidence to establish that such women\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fare targets of persecution in China. The Board therefore concluded\n\nthat petitioner had failed to establish a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution in China on account of her membership in a particular\n\nsocial group.\n\n           In her brief to this court, petitioner abandons her\n\ncontention that her social group, for asylum purposes, consists\n\nbroadly of \"young women from rural China.\" Instead, she urges this\n\ncourt to hold, as a matter of law, that \"young unmarried women from\n\nrural China who have resisted forced marriages and forced sexual\n\nrelationships by a person in power constitute an appropriate\n\nparticular social group.\"      Because we uphold the Board's analysis,\n\nwe need not decide this question.\n\n           Even assuming arguendo that petitioner's proffered social\n\ngroup is valid for asylum purposes, she has failed to establish\n\nthat she has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her\n\nmembership   in    that   group.     Petitioner's   only      evidence   of\n\npersecution is that her father and his business associate attempted\n\nto sell her and her sister into an arranged marriage (or some other\n\nkind of involuntary sexual relationship), and that both she and her\n\nsister successfully resisted and escaped. But there is no evidence\n\nof   persecution   following   petitioner's   escape   from    the   hotel.\n\nPetitioner never again saw Su Fei Pan or the Taiwanese man.\n\nIndeed, although Petitioner remained in China for two and a half\n\nyears following the hotel incident, she was never punished or\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fpersecuted because of her resistance.                See Velasquez v. Ashcroft,\n\n342   F.3d     55,    59    (1st    Cir.    2003)    (no    well-founded     fear    of\n\npersecution where petitioners remained in the country for eight\n\nyears after the alleged persecution), abrogated on other grounds by\n\nBocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 266 (1st Cir. 2005); Novoa-Umania\n\nv. INS, 896 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1990) (no ongoing threat of\n\npersecution where petitioner stayed in the country for six months\n\nwithout incident).           She likewise has presented no evidence that\n\nanyone in China now intends to punish her for her resistance.\n\n              Nor has petitioner presented evidence establishing that\n\nother young unmarried women from rural China who have similarly\n\nresisted forced sexual relationships have been persecuted on that\n\nbasis.       Petitioner relies on a State Department Country Report\n\nacknowledging that China has problems generally with domestic\n\nviolence, arranged marriages, sex trafficking, and prostitution.\n\nThe country report does not, however, indicate that women who have\n\nresisted      forced       sexual    relationships         are   singled     out    for\n\npersecution.         Nor does the country report indicate that such women\n\ncannot find safety, as petitioner did, by relocating within China,\n\nor    that     the     government      of    China    condones      forced     sexual\n\nrelationships.         See Galicia v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 446, 448 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (no well-founded fear where petitioner's claims of\n\ncountry-wide and government-sponsored or -condoned discrimination\n\nwere not supported in the country report).\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f           For these reasons, the evidence is insufficient to compel\n\na finding that petitioner's fear of persecution on account of her\n\nresistance is objectively reasonable.           Romilus, 385 F.3d at 7 (a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution requires that the applicant's fear\n\nbe both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable).          Because\n\npetitioner failed to satisfy the more lenient asylum standard, she\n\na   fortiori   cannot   satisfy   the    more    demanding   standard   for\n\nwithholding of removal.    See id. at 8.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

That burden requires proof of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, including, among others, membership in a particular social group. <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 6. A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <i>See Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the immigration judge did not credit petitioner's alleged motive for coming to the United States &#8212; to escape persecution &#8212; he accepted her narrative of factual events as \"essentially credible.\" Nevertheless, the judge denied her asylum and withholding claims because she had failed to establish that she belonged to a particular social group. On appeal, the Board agreed that \"young women from rural China\" is too broad to be considered a \"particular social group\" within the purview of the immigration laws. <i>See Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 761 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.1992). Even assuming the more narrowly defined category of \"unmarried young wom[en] from rural China . . . who have resisted being forced into marriages and sexual relationships by a person in power\" could be a valid social group, the Board held that petitioner had failed on the evidence to establish that such women are targets of persecution in China. The Board therefore concluded that petitioner had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in China on account of her membership in a particular social group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her brief to this court, petitioner abandons her contention that her social group, for asylum purposes, consists broadly of \"young women from rural China.\" Instead, she urges this court to hold, as a matter of law, that \"young unmarried women from rural China who have resisted forced marriages and forced sexual relationships by a person in power constitute an appropriate particular social group.\" Because we uphold the Board's analysis, we need not decide this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming arguendo that petitioner's proffered social group is valid for asylum purposes, she has failed to establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her membership in that group. Petitioner's only evidence of persecution is that her father and his business associate attempted to sell her and her sister into an arranged marriage (or some other kind of involuntary sexual relationship), and that both she and her sister successfully resisted and escaped. But there is no evidence of persecution following petitioner's escape from the hotel. Petitioner never again saw Su Fei Pan or the Taiwanese man. Indeed, although Petitioner remained in China for two and a half years following the hotel incident, she was never punished or persecuted because of her resistance. <i>See Velasquez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2003) (no well-founded fear of persecution where petitioners remained in the country for eight years after the alleged persecution), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 266 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Novoa-Umania v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536515\"><a href=\"/opinion/536515/samuel-novoa-umania-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.1990) (no ongoing threat of persecution where petitioner stayed in the country for six months without incident). She likewise has presented no evidence that anyone in China now intends to punish her for her resistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has petitioner presented evidence establishing that other young unmarried women from rural China who have similarly resisted forced sexual relationships have been persecuted on that basis. Petitioner relies on a State Department Country Report acknowledging that China has problems generally with domestic violence, arranged marriages, sex trafficking, and prostitution. The country report does not, however, indicate that women who have resisted forced sexual relationships are singled out for persecution. Nor does the country report indicate that such women cannot find safety, as petitioner did, by relocating within China, or that the government of China condones forced sexual relationships. <i>See Galicia v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201419\"><a href=\"/opinion/201419/galicia-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 448 (1st Cir.2005) (no well-founded fear where petitioner's claims of country-wide and government-sponsored or &#8212; condoned discrimination were not supported in the country report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the evidence is insufficient to compel a finding that petitioner's fear of persecution on account of her resistance is objectively reasonable. <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 7 (a well-founded fear of persecution requires that the applicant's fear be both subjectively genuine <i>and</i> objectively reasonable). Because petitioner failed to satisfy the more lenient asylum standard, she <i>a fortiori</i> cannot satisfy the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. <i>See id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
