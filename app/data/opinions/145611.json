Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     María I. Santos Rivera, for appellants.\n     James W. McCartney, with whom Rafael Barreto-Solá and Cancio,\nNadal, Rivera & Díaz were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                           May 5, 2010\n\f               SELYA, Circuit Judge.           The defendants, Rafael Rivera-\n\nVázquez (Rivera) and Isabel Hurtado, husband and wife, appeal from\n\n(i) the entry of summary judgment against them, (ii) the denial of\n\ntheir cross-motion for summary judgment, and (iii) the denial of a\n\ndiscovery-related motion.1 In the final analysis, the appeals turn\n\non the proper handling of cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that the district court abused its discretion\n\nby applying materially different procedural requirements to the two\n\nmotions, we wipe the slate clean.              On unrelated grounds, we vacate\n\nthe discovery-related order. The district court must revisit these\n\nmatters anew.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               These   appeals   arise    out    of   a   massive   civil   action\n\ncommenced in Puerto Rico's federal district court by nine insurance\n\ncompanies      against   hundreds   of    defendants      under     the   Racketeer\n\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-\n\n1968.       The complaint posited that the defendants had engaged in a\n\nwide-ranging scheme to defraud the insurers by submitting false\n\nautomobile insurance claims in violation of both RICO and a Puerto\n\nRico anti-fraud statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141.                   We limit\n\nour discussion to the claims against the appellants: Rivera,\n\n\n        1\n       There are two appeals, one from the entry of a partial\njudgment and the other from the entry of a final judgment (which\nsubsumes the partial judgment). For all practical purposes, the\ntwo appeals have merged. See SEC v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st\nCir. 2001).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fHurtado, and their conjugal partnership. The appellees are five of\n\nthe   plaintiffs     below,    namely,    Puerto     Rico   American    Insurance\n\nCompany (PRAICO), National Insurance Company, Universal Insurance\n\nCompany,    Caribbean    Alliance        Insurance     Company      (CAICO),    and\n\nCooperativa de Seguros Múltiples de Puerto Rico.2\n\n            The operative pleading for present purposes is the second\n\namended complaint, which added Rivera, Hurtado, and their conjugal\n\npartnership as defendants.          The complaint alleged that Rivera\n\nparticipated in a number of fraudulent claims, both as an attorney\n\nrepresenting claimants and as a claimant himself.                   The complaint\n\nfurther    alleged   that     Hurtado    took   part   in    the   swindle     as   a\n\nclaimant.\n\n            The case proceeded through discovery.                  One discovery-\n\nrelated ruling is pertinent to these appeals.                      We sketch the\n\ncircumstances relevant to this ruling.\n\n            During    discovery,    the    appellants       requested   that    the\n\ninsurers make certain admissions.             See Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(1).\n\nReceiving no responses within the allotted time, the appellants\n\nmoved for an order deeming admitted the matters delineated in their\n\nrequests.    The district court denied the motion and extended the\n\ntime for responding.        The insurers served their responses within\n\n\n\n      2\n        Integrand Assurance Company is also listed on the\nconsolidated briefs as an appellee, but we are unable to ascertain\nhow Integrand is involved in these appeals. We leave it to the\ndistrict court, on remand, to resolve Integrand's status.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthis extended period.    The appellants objected, asserting that the\n\nmatters set forth in the requests should be deemed admitted because\n\nthe responses did not comply with Rule 36.\n\n            The objection lay fallow for slightly more than three\n\nyears. At that point the district court, treating the objection as\n\na motion,3 denied it on the ground that the appellants had failed\n\nto   include   the   required   certification.   See   D.P.R.R.   26(b)\n\n(providing that a district court \"shall not consider any discovery\n\nmotion that is not accompanied by a certification that the moving\n\nparty has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to reach an\n\nagreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the\n\nmotion\").\n\n            During the protracted period in which the parties were\n\nsquabbling over the requests for admission, the summary judgment\n\nissues were starting to crystallize.     The district court had set a\n\ndeadline of February 17, 2006, for the filing of dispositive\n\nmotions.    On February 16, the insurers filed a motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment.4     They supported their motion with a separate\n\nstatement of uncontested facts (SUF) and a series of affidavits.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n         Neither   side    challenges   the   district   court's\ncharacterization of the objection as a motion. We therefore take\nno view of the accuracy of that taxonomy.\n      4\n        This motion targeted the appellants and two               other\ndefendants. We restrict our discussion to the appellants.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThe motion sought to impose liability on the appellants under\n\nsections 1962(c) and (d) of RICO.\n\n          One day later (and within the period prescribed by the\n\ndistrict court), the appellants filed a cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment, supported by a separate SUF.     This cross-motion sought\n\nthe dismissal of all claims against them.    On March 30, 2006, the\n\ninsurers filed a timely opposition, but did not respond to the\n\nappellants' SUF. In their opposition, the insurers mentioned that,\n\non February 21, 2006, Rivera had pleaded guilty to a criminal\n\ninformation charging him with conspiring to devise a scheme to\n\ndefraud insurance companies in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341.\n\nThe insurers attached the information and plea agreement to their\n\nopposition.\n\n          On April 18, 2006, the appellants filed an opposition to\n\nthe insurers' summary judgment motion, supported by a separate\n\nresponse to the insurers' SUF.\n\n          On June 12, 2008, the district court addressed the\n\ninsurers' motion for summary judgment.       The court granted that\n\nmotion in part and denied it in part.5    In its opinion, the court\n\nheld that the insurers' SUF was proper in form, appropriately\n\nsupported by affidavits, and compliant in all other respects with\n\nthe requirements of the local rules.     P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos\n\n\n\n     5\n       The court denied relief to four of the insurance company\nplaintiffs. Those rulings are not before us.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f(PRAICO I), No. 01-1186, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. June 12, 2008)\n\n(unpublished) (citing D.P.R.R. 56).             The court also held that the\n\nappellants' opposition failed to comply with the local rules and,\n\naccordingly, deemed admitted the facts set out in the insurers'\n\nSUF.    Id. at 5 (citing D.P.R.R. 56(e)).             Based on this ruling the\n\ncourt concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera had\n\nfiled fraudulent insurance claims, both as an attorney representing\n\nother claimants and to his own behoof, with PRAICO, Cooperativa,\n\nNational,    CAICO,     and     Universal.      Id.       Similarly,     the    court\n\nconcluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera and Hurtado\n\nhad jointly filed a false claim with National.                Id. at 6.        Moving\n\nto damages, the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact,\n\nthat   the   insurers     had    paid   these   bogus     claims,   resulting      in\n\nspecific monetary losses.          Id. at 5-6.        With these determinations\n\nin place, the court held that the summary judgment record satisfied\n\nthe requirements for liability under RICO § 1962(c), id. at 10, and\n\nproceeded to award treble damages in the insurers' favor.                         Id.\n\n(citing 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). The court entered a partial judgment\n\nagainst the appellants in these amounts.\n\n             In a separate opinion, issued more than a month later,\n\nthe    district   court    granted      in   part   and    denied   in   part     the\n\nappellants' cross-motion for summary judgment.                  The court noted\n\nthat the appellants' SUF complied with the local rules and that the\n\ninsurers had neglected to file the separate response to the SUF\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frequired by those rules.       P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos (PRAICO II),\n\nNo. 01-1186, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. July 29, 2008) (unpublished).\n\nBased on this deficiency, the court deemed admitted some of the\n\nfacts limned in the appellants' SUF.        Id.   But the court stopped\n\nshort of deeming all the facts admitted; rather, it concluded that,\n\ndespite the insurers' failure to file a counter-statement, it would\n\nnot deem admitted any facts that contradicted the facts on which\n\nits earlier partial judgment rested.       Id.\n\n               This truncated view of the record led the district court\n\nto deny the cross-motion with respect to the claims asserted\n\nagainst the appellants by PRAICO, Cooperativa, National, CAICO, and\n\nUniversal.       Id.   The court exonerated the appellants with respect\n\nto other claims.         See id. at 7; see also supra note 5.       This\n\nincluded a determination that Hurtado had not submitted false\n\nclaims to PRAICO, Universal, or Cooperativa.        PRAICO II, slip op.\n\nat 8.       The court thereupon entered another partial judgment.\n\n               On August 8, 2008, the district court entered a final\n\njudgment.6      We have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n               Before us, the appellants asseverate that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in disregarding their opposition to the\n\n\n        6\n       The court did not hinge any portion of this judgment or any\nof its underlying decisions on Rivera's guilty plea in the criminal\ncase.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fSUF that accompanied the insurers' motion for summary judgment;\n\nthat, in all events, the lower court treated them unfairly by\n\napplying materially different standards to the adjudication of the\n\ntwo motions for summary judgment; and that the court erred in its\n\nfinal ruling concerning their requests for admission.7           We discuss\n\nthe first two assignments of error together and then move to the\n\nthird.\n\n                      A.     Summary Judgment Practice.\n\n             When passing upon a motion for summary judgment, a\n\ndistrict court must take the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom to\n\nthat party's behoof.         Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,\n\n486   F.3d   1,   8   (1st    Cir.   2007).   This   standard   operates   in\n\nconjunction with a district court's local anti-ferret rule.            When\n\nthe district court, acting in pursuance of an anti-ferret rule,\n\ndeems admitted facts contained in the movant's SUF, those facts are\n\nconsidered not properly controverted, but the district court must\n\nstill apply the standard articulated in Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 56.         In such circumstances, we review the district\n\ncourt's deeming order for abuse of discretion.            CMI Capital Mkt.\n\nInv., LLC v. González-Toro, 520 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 2008).           This\n\n\n      7\n       The appellants also claim that (i) the facts set forth in\nthe insurers' SUF should have been ignored because these facts were\nsupported only by inadmissable hearsay; and (ii) the record does\nnot support an award of treble damages against Hurtado. We have no\nneed to reach those claims today.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fentails \"a special degree of deference . . . to [the] court's\n\ninterpretation of its own local rules.\"             Crowley v. L.L. Bean,\n\nInc., 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Jarvis, 53\n\nF.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir. 1995)).           Apart from any judgment calls\n\nconcerning the application of the local rule, the ultimate decision\n\nto grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo.            Cabán Hernández,\n\n486 F.3d at 8.\n\n           Local Rule 56 of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico is such an anti-ferret rule.              It requires\n\na party moving for summary judgment to submit a \"separate, short,\n\nand concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered\n\nparagraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.\"       D.P.R.R. 56(b).      Each fact must\n\nbe supported by a citation to a specific paragraph or page of the\n\nsummary judgment record.       D.P.R.R. 56(e).\n\n           A party opposing a motion for summary judgment must\n\nsubmit a counter-statement, which \"shall admit, deny or qualify the\n\nfacts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's\n\nstatement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall\n\nsupport   each   denial   or   qualification   by    a   record    citation.\"\n\nD.P.R.R. 56(c). Properly supported facts contained in an SUF shall\n\nbe deemed admitted unless controverted in the manner prescribed by\n\nthe local rule.    D.P.R.R. 56(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            In this case, the appellants' first line of argument is\n\nthat the district court should not have deemed admitted the facts\n\nset forth in the insurers' SUF.      The mainstay of this argument is\n\nthat their opposition to the SUF complied with Local Rule 56.         In\n\nthis regard, they stress that their opposing statement addressed\n\nall of the SUF's declared facts         in the order in which they\n\nappeared.\n\n            This argument is disingenuous.   Even a cursory glance at\n\nthe opposition reveals that the appellants wholly failed to \"admit,\n\ndeny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph\n\nof the moving party's statement of material facts.\"            D.P.R.R.\n\n56(c).   This is starkly evident from a side-by-side comparison of\n\nthe SUF and the opposition. Although the SUF contains eighty-eight\n\nnumbered paragraphs of facts, the opposition nowhere matches up\n\nwith, or even references, these numbered paragraphs.         Rather, it\n\ncomprises   twenty-five   numbered   paragraphs,   divided   into   five,\n\nseparately numbered sections, and repeatedly lumps responses to\n\nseveral separately declared facts into a single sentence.\n\n            The appellants counter that any failure of compliance was\n\ntechnical and, therefore, harmless.     This ipse dixit overlooks the\n\nroot purpose of an \"anti-ferret\" rule.     This type of rule is aimed\n\nat enabling a district court to adjudicate a summary judgment\n\nmotion without endless rummaging through a plethoric record.         See\n\nCMI Capital Mkt. Inv., 520 F.3d at 62; Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi,\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f520 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2008); Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland\n\nSec., 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2007).        Given this root purpose,\n\nwe have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that\n\nparties ignore the strictures of an \"anti-ferret\" rule at their\n\nperil.    See, e.g., Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n               We add, moreover, that it is primarily the role of the\n\ndistrict court to determine what departures from a local rule may\n\nbe tolerated.       United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).        Here, the district court concluded that the\n\nappellants' failure to comply with Local Rule 56 was material.\n\nThis conclusion makes sense: had the district court overlooked the\n\nappellants' noncompliance, it would have had to comb through the\n\nopposition in an effort to match the appellants' non-conforming\n\nresponses to the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF.             Only then\n\ncould    the    court   have   determined   which   facts   were   genuinely\n\ncontroverted and which were not.            This is exactly the sort of\n\narcheological dig that anti-ferret rules are designed to prevent.\n\n               The appellants have a fallback position.       They contend\n\nthat because they incorporated by reference in their opposition to\n\nthe insurers' motion their own SUF (which was attached to their\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment), they made clear their version\n\nof the facts.      They strive to persuade us that this incorporation\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fby reference constituted substantial compliance with Local Rule 56.\n\nWe are not convinced.\n\n            As indicated above, Local Rule 56 serves the important\n\npurpose of \"prevent[ing] parties from shifting to the district\n\ncourt the burden of sifting through the inevitable mountain of\n\ninformation generated by discovery in search of relevant material.\"\n\nRíos-Jiménez, 520 F.3d at 38. The appellants' SUF did not address,\n\nparagraph by paragraph or statement by statement, the insurers'\n\nSUF.    Even if the district court could have gleaned the parties'\n\npositions by independent analysis of the two documents, that was\n\nnot the court's job.      A party cannot circumvent the requirements\n\nimposed by an anti-ferret rule simply by filing a cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment and expecting the district court to do the party's\n\nhomework.\n\n            Nevertheless, the appellants' cross-motion is significant\n\nin   another   respect.   The   district   court   determined   that   the\n\nappellants' SUF, which accompanied the cross-motion, complied with\n\nLocal Rule 56.   PRAICO II, slip op. at 5. The court also determined\n\nthat the insurers had failed to proffer the counter-statement\n\nrequired by that rule. Id. The court acknowledged that, given this\n\nnoncompliance, it ought to deem admitted the facts contained in the\n\nappellants' SUF.    See id.; see also D.P.R.R. 56(e).     But the court\n\nnonetheless declined to deem admitted those facts that contradicted\n\nthe facts on which its earlier summary judgment order rested.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fPRAICO II, slip. op. at 5.            That led the court to deny the\n\nappellants' motion for summary judgment against the five insurers\n\nin whose favor the earlier order ran (the appellees here).\n\n             The appellants argue that the court treated the two SUFs\n\ndifferently.      This is undeniably so.      The appellants add that this\n\napproach unfairly gave preference to the facts set forth in the\n\ninsurers' SUF merely because the court happened to decide the\n\ninsurers' motion first.         This differential treatment, they say,\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.        We agree.\n\n             To be sure, a district court has broad discretion in the\n\nadministration and enforcement of its own local rules.                Diaz-\n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d at 46.        But this discretion is not unbridled.\n\nId.       Rules   must    be   administered    evenhandedly   and   applied\n\nconsistently.      To deviate from a local rule, the court \"(1) must\n\nhave a sound reason for doing so, and (2) must ensure that no\n\nparty's substantial rights are unfairly jeopardized.\"          Id.; accord\n\nGarcía-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 19-20\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).         Fundamental fairness is the mainstay of this\n\nparadigm.     See Wight v. BankAmerica Corp., 219 F.3d 79, 85-86 (2d\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n             In the case at hand, the district court faced a dilemma\n\n— but it was a dilemma of the court's own making.8         The court could\n\n\n      8\n       To be sure, the parties bear the lion's share of the\nresponsibility for the predicament in which the district court\nfound itself.   Had each of the parties filed responses to the\n\n                                    -13-\n\fhave considered both motions for summary judgment at the same time.\n\nFor some unexplained reason, it eschewed that course.          Thus, at the\n\ntime it took up the appellants' motion, the court realized that\n\nfollowing   the   local    rule   and   deeming   admitted   all   the    facts\n\ncontained in the appellants' SUF would require it to deem admitted\n\nfacts that were in open contradiction to the facts upon which the\n\nearlier summary judgment rested. That, in turn, would result in the\n\nentry of a judgment that directly conflicted with the earlier\n\njudgment.\n\n            The prospect of this bizarre result sent up a red flag.\n\nIt counselled in favor of a careful review of the available options\n\nand a balancing of the equities.         Here, however, the court warded\n\noff the potential conflict by giving one set of litigants (the\n\ninsurers) a largesse       that it withheld from the other set of\n\nlitigants (the appellants).         To be specific, the court, having\n\nstrictly enforced Local Rule 56 against the appellants in connection\n\nwith the insurers' summary judgment motion, excused the insurers\n\nfrom compliance with that rule in connection with the appellants'\n\nsummary judgment motion.\n\n            Because the inconsistency is patent — the court held\n\nopposing    parties   to    materially     different   standards     in     the\n\napplication and enforcement of a local rule — the inquiry reduces\n\n\n\nother's SUF in compliance with the local rule, this problem easily\ncould have been avoided.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fto whether the court had good cause to justify the differential\n\ntreatment.    See Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 46.    In mounting such\n\nan inquiry, context is important. Here, the district court reasoned\n\nthat the appellants could not be allowed to cure defects in their\n\nopposition to the insurers' summary judgment motion by filing their\n\nown cross-motion.     PRAICO II, slip op. at 5.     This reasoning is\n\nvalid in the abstract, but the court's attempt to use it here does\n\nnot withstand scrutiny.\n\n             This is not a situation in which a party tried to rectify\n\nits noncompliance with the local rule by filing a cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment after the time had run for opposing a summary\n\njudgment motion. By contrast, both sides in this case filed motions\n\nfor summary judgment within the same time frame — the motions were\n\nfiled a day apart, and both were filed within the period prescribed\n\nby the district court for the service of dispositive motions. Thus,\n\nthe timing is a non-issue.      On these facts, where neither side\n\nproperly contested the other's SUF in the manner prescribed by Local\n\nRule 56, strictly enforcing the local rule against one party while\n\nexcusing the other party's noncompliance cannot be countenanced.\n\n             Here, moreover, the appellants' rights were prejudiced by\n\nthe district court's inconsistent application of the local rule.\n\nThe court's decision to address the insurers' motion first led it,\n\nin effect, to apply the insurers' version of the facts to both\n\nmotions.     Based on that decision, the court granted the insurers'\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fmotion for summary judgment against the appellants and denied the\n\nappellants' motion for summary judgment.\n\n               The arbitrariness of this approach is obvious: had the\n\ndistrict court opted to consider the appellants' motion first, the\n\nshoe would have been on the other foot; the district court would\n\nhave applied the appellants' version of the facts across the board;\n\nand,   presumably,    the   appellants    would    have   prevailed    on    both\n\nmotions.   The outcome of litigation should not be permitted to turn\n\non so vagarious a choice.\n\n               It is settled law that each cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment must be decided on its own merits.           See, e.g., Blackie v.\n\nMaine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996).              That does not mean,\n\nhowever, that each motion must be considered in a vacuum.               Where,\n\nas     here,    cross-motions    for     summary     judgment    are        filed\n\nsimultaneously, or nearly so, the district court ordinarily should\n\nconsider the two motions at the same time.            If the court opts to\n\nconsider them at different times, it must at the very least apply\n\nthe same standards to each.\n\n               To sum up, the two SUFs (each properly supported and\n\neffectively uncontested) directly contradicted each other.                  Faced\n\nwith that situation, we think that the court should have denied both\n\nmotions without prejudice and directed the parties to refile. After\n\nall, the first summary judgment order was merely an order for\n\npartial summary judgment which did not dispose of all claims amongst\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fall parties.    Consequently, that order could be revisited by the\n\ndistrict court at any time up until the entry of final judgment.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); see also Williamson v. UNUM Life Ins. Co.\n\nof Am., 160 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. 1998); Anixter v. Home-Stake\n\nProd. Co., 977 F.2d 1533, 1548 (10th Cir. 1992); 10 James Wm. Moore\n\net al., Moore's Federal Practice § 56.41[2][a], at 56-334 (3d ed.\n\n2010).    Instead, the court avoided the paradox of entering two\n\nconflicting orders by applying Local Rule 56 inconsistently to the\n\nparties' motions without good cause for doing so.             Because this\n\ndifferential treatment unfairly prejudiced the appellants, we hold\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion. It follows that both\n\norders (as between these parties) must be vacated.9\n\n                     B.   Requests for Admission.\n\n           There is one loose end.        The appellants claim that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying their motion to deem\n\nadmitted the matters limned in their requests for admission.            The\n\nappellants add that this bevue prejudiced them because, had the\n\nmatters   in   question   been   deemed    admitted,   that    would   have\n\nstrengthened their hand at summary judgment.      Because the propriety\n\n\n\n     9\n       The insurers suggest that the district court's summary\njudgment orders can be upheld on the basis of Rivera's guilty plea\nin the criminal case.    The district court did not address the\neffect of the plea, and the issue is not clear-cut. Thus, even\nthough we have discretion to affirm a summary judgment order on\nalternate grounds, the course of prudence in this case is to allow\nthe parties to raise the issue before the district court.      See\nVelazquez-Rivera v. Danzig, 234 F.3d 790, 795 n.2 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                  -17-\n\fof summary judgment must be revisited, see supra Part II(A),\n\nefficiency concerns prompt us to address this claim of error now.\n\n           \"A party may serve on any other party a written request\n\nto admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of\n\n[certain] matters.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(1).       Under this rule,\n\n\"[a] matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served,\n\nthe party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting\n\nparty a written answer or objection.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3).\n\n           The   appellants   resorted    to   this   procedure   during\n\ndiscovery. After some procedural skirmishing, not now relevant, the\n\ninsurers served responses to the requests for admission.             The\n\nappellants, thinking the responses evasive, asked the district court\n\nto treat as admitted the matters delineated in the requests.         The\n\ndistrict court denied this motion on the ground that the motion\n\nlacked the requisite certification.      See D.P.R.R. 26(b).\n\n           The appellants suggest that the district court simply\n\nmisread the record.   A review of the court papers validates this\n\nsuggestion: the appellants did include the required certification\n\nin their motion. Because the district court's error is obvious, the\n\norder appealed from must be set aside.         The district court, on\n\nremand, should address the motion on the merits prior to considering\n\nthe motions for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe order denying the appellants' Rule 36 motion is vacated; the\n\norders on the cross-motions for summary judgment are likewise\n\nvacated; and the case is remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.   All parties shall bear\n\ntheir own costs.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Concluding, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> as we do, that the district court abused its discretion by applying materially different procedural requirements to the two motions, we wipe the slate clean. On unrelated grounds, we vacate the discovery-related order. The district court must revisit these matters anew.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>These appeals arise out of a massive civil action commenced in Puerto Rico's federal district court by nine insurance companies against hundreds of defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. The complaint posited that the defendants had engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud the insurers by submitting false automobile insurance claims in violation of both RICO and a Puerto Rico anti-fraud statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141. We limit our discussion to the claims against the appellants: Rivera, Hurtado, and their conjugal partnership. The appellees are five of the plaintiffs below, namely, Puerto Rico American Insurance Company (PRAICO), National Insurance Company, Universal Insurance Company, Caribbean Alliance Insurance Company (CAICO), and Cooperativa de Seguros Múltiples de Puerto Rico.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The operative pleading for present purposes is the second amended complaint, which added Rivera, Hurtado, and their conjugal partnership as defendants. The complaint alleged that Rivera participated in a number of fraudulent claims, both as an attorney representing claimants and as a claimant himself. The complaint further alleged that Hurtado took part in the swindle as a claimant.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded through discovery. One discovery-related ruling is pertinent to these appeals. We sketch the circumstances relevant to this ruling.</p>\n<p>During discovery, the appellants requested that the insurers make certain admissions. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(1). Receiving no responses within the allotted time, the appellants moved for an order deeming admitted the matters delineated in their requests. The district court denied the motion and extended the time for responding. The insurers served their responses within this extended period. The appellants objected, asserting that the matters set forth in the requests should be deemed admitted because the responses did not comply with Rule 36.</p>\n<p>The objection lay fallow for slightly more than three years. At that point the district court, treating the objection as a motion,<sup>[3]</sup> denied it on the ground that the appellants had failed to include the required certification. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 26(b) (providing that a district court \"shall not consider any discovery motion that is not accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to reach an agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion\").</p>\n<p>During the protracted period in which the parties were squabbling over the requests for admission, the summary judgment issues were starting to crystallize. The district court had set a deadline of February 17, 2006, for the filing of dispositive motions. On February 16, the insurers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> filed a motion for partial summary judgment.<sup>[4]</sup> They supported their motion with a separate statement of uncontested facts (SUF) and a series of affidavits. The motion sought to impose liability on the appellants under sections 1962(c) and (d) of RICO.</p>\n<p>One day later (and within the period prescribed by the district court), the appellants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, supported by a separate SUF. This cross-motion sought the dismissal of all claims against them. On March 30, 2006, the insurers filed a timely opposition, but did not respond to the appellants' SUF. In their opposition, the insurers mentioned that, on February 21, 2006, Rivera had pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiring to devise a scheme to defraud insurance companies in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341. The insurers attached the information and plea agreement to their opposition.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 2006, the appellants filed an opposition to the insurers' summary judgment motion, supported by a separate response to the insurers' SUF.</p>\n<p>On June 12, 2008, the district court addressed the insurers' motion for summary judgment. The court granted that motion in part and denied it in part.<sup>[5]</sup> In its opinion, the court held that the insurers' SUF was proper in form, appropriately supported by affidavits, and compliant in all other respects with the requirements of the local rules. <i>P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos</i> (<i>PRAICO I</i>), No. 01-1186, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. June 12, 2008) (unpublished) (citing D.P.R.R. 56). The court also held that the appellants' opposition failed to comply with the local rules and, accordingly, deemed admitted the facts set out in the insurers' SUF. <i>Id.</i> at 5 (citing D.P.R.R. 56(e)). Based on this ruling the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera had filed fraudulent insurance claims, both as an attorney representing other claimants and to his own behoof, with PRAICO, Cooperativa, National, CAICO, and Universal. <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera and Hurtado had jointly filed a false claim with National. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Moving to damages, the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that the insurers had paid these bogus claims, resulting in specific monetary losses. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. With these determinations in place, the court held that the summary judgment record satisfied the requirements for liability under RICO § 1962(c), <i>id.</i> at 10, and proceeded to award treble damages in the insurers' favor. <i>Id.</i> (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). The court entered a partial judgment against the appellants in these amounts.</p>\n<p>In a separate opinion, issued more than a month later, the district court granted in part and denied in part the appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment. The court noted that the appellants' SUF complied with the local rules and that the insurers had neglected to file the separate response to the SUF required by those rules. <i>P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos</i> (<i>PRAICO II</i>), No. 01-1186, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. July 29, 2008) (unpublished). Based on this deficiency, the court deemed admitted some of the facts limned in the appellants' SUF. <i>Id.</i> But the court stopped short of deeming all the facts admitted; rather, it concluded that, despite the insurers' failure to file a counter-statement, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> would not deem admitted any facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier partial judgment rested. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This truncated view of the record led the district court to deny the cross-motion with respect to the claims asserted against the appellants by PRAICO, Cooperativa, National, CAICO, and Universal. <i>Id.</i> The court exonerated the appellants with respect to other claims. <i>See id.</i> at 7; <i>see also supra</i> note 5. This included a determination that Hurtado had not submitted false claims to PRAICO, Universal, or Cooperativa. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 8. The court thereupon entered another partial judgment.</p>\n<p>On August 8, 2008, the district court entered a final judgment.<sup>[6]</sup> We have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Before us, the appellants asseverate that the district court abused its discretion in disregarding their opposition to the SUF that accompanied the insurers' motion for summary judgment; that, in all events, the lower court treated them unfairly by applying materially different standards to the adjudication of the two motions for summary judgment; and that the court erred in its final ruling concerning their requests for admission.<sup>[7]</sup> We discuss the first two assignments of error together and then move to the third.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Summary Judgment Practice.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When passing upon a motion for summary judgment, a district court must take the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom to that party's behoof. <i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007). This standard operates in conjunction with a district court's local anti-ferret rule. When the district court, acting in pursuance of an anti-ferret rule, deems admitted facts contained in the movant's SUF, those facts are considered not properly controverted, but the district court must still apply the standard articulated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. In such circumstances, we review the district court's deeming order for abuse of discretion. <i>CMI Capital Mkt. Inv., LLC v. González-Toro,</i> 520 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.2008). This entails \"a special degree of deference. . . to [the] court's interpretation of its own local rules.\" <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>In re Jarvis,</i> 53 F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir.1995)). Apart from any judgment calls concerning the application of the local rule, the ultimate decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>Local Rule 56 of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is such an anti-ferret rule. It requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit a \"separate, short, and concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact.\" D.P.R.R. 56(b). Each fact must be supported by a citation to a specific paragraph or page of the summary judgment record. D.P.R.R. 56(e).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> A party opposing a motion for summary judgment must submit a counter-statement, which \"shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). Properly supported facts contained in an SUF shall be deemed admitted unless controverted in the manner prescribed by the local rule. D.P.R.R. 56(e).</p>\n<p>In this case, the appellants' first line of argument is that the district court should not have deemed admitted the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF. The mainstay of this argument is that their opposition to the SUF complied with Local Rule 56. In this regard, they stress that their opposing statement addressed all of the SUF's declared facts in the order in which they appeared.</p>\n<p>This argument is disingenuous. Even a cursory glance at the opposition reveals that the appellants wholly failed to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). This is starkly evident from a side-by-side comparison of the SUF and the opposition. Although the SUF contains eighty-eight numbered paragraphs of facts, the opposition nowhere matches up with, or even references, these numbered paragraphs. Rather, it comprises twenty-five numbered paragraphs, divided into five, separately numbered sections, and repeatedly lumps responses to several separately declared facts into a single sentence.</p>\n<p>The appellants counter that any failure of compliance was technical and, therefore, harmless. This ipse dixit overlooks the root purpose of an \"anti-ferret\" rule. This type of rule is aimed at enabling a district court to adjudicate a summary judgment motion without endless rummaging through a plethoric record. <i>See </i><i>CMI Capital Mkt. Inv.,</i> 520 F.3d at 62; <i>Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi,</i> 520 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir.2007). Given this root purpose, we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that parties ignore the strictures of an \"anti-ferret\" rule at their peril. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ruiz Rivera v. Riley,</i> 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>We add, moreover, that it is primarily the role of the district court to determine what departures from a local rule may be tolerated. <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, the district court concluded that the appellants' failure to comply with Local Rule 56 was material. This conclusion makes sense: had the district court overlooked the appellants' noncompliance, it would have had to comb through the opposition in an effort to match the appellants' non-conforming responses to the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF. Only then could the court have determined which facts were genuinely controverted and which were not. This is exactly the sort of archeological dig that anti-ferret rules are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p>The appellants have a fallback position. They contend that because they incorporated by reference in their opposition to the insurers' motion their own SUF (which was attached to their cross-motion for summary judgment), they made clear their version of the facts. They strive to persuade us that this incorporation by reference constituted substantial compliance with Local Rule 56. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>As indicated above, Local Rule 56 serves the important purpose of \"prevent[ing] parties from shifting to the district court the burden of sifting through the inevitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> mountain of information generated by discovery in search of relevant material.\" <i>Ríos-Jiménez,</i> 520 F.3d at 38. The appellants' SUF did not address, paragraph by paragraph or statement by statement, the insurers' SUF. Even if the district court could have gleaned the parties' positions by independent analysis of the two documents, that was not the court's job. A party cannot circumvent the requirements imposed by an anti-ferret rule simply by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment and expecting the district court to do the party's homework.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the appellants' cross-motion is significant in another respect. The district court determined that the appellants' SUF, which accompanied the cross-motion, complied with Local Rule 56. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 5. The court also determined that the insurers had failed to proffer the counter-statement required by that rule. <i>Id.</i> The court acknowledged that, given this noncompliance, it ought to deem admitted the facts contained in the appellants' SUF. <i>See id.</i>; <i>see also</i> D.P.R.R. 56(e). But the court nonetheless declined to deem admitted those facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier summary judgment order rested. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip. op. at 5. That led the court to deny the appellants' motion for summary judgment against the five insurers in whose favor the earlier order ran (the appellees here).</p>\n<p>The appellants argue that the court treated the two SUFs differently. This is undeniably so. The appellants add that this approach unfairly gave preference to the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF merely because the court happened to decide the insurers' motion first. This differential treatment, they say, constituted an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p>To be sure, a district court has broad discretion in the administration and enforcement of its own local rules. <i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 46. But this discretion is not unbridled. <i>Id.</i> Rules must be administered evenhandedly and applied consistently. To deviate from a local rule, the court \"(1) must have a sound reason for doing so, and (2) must ensure that no party's substantial rights are unfairly jeopardized.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>accord </i><i>García-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc.,</i> 428 F.3d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir.2005). Fundamental fairness is the mainstay of this paradigm. <i>See </i><i>Wight v. BankAmerica Corp.,</i> 219 F.3d 79, 85-86 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court faced a dilemmabut it was a dilemma of the court's own making.<sup>[8]</sup> The court could have considered both motions for summary judgment at the same time. For some unexplained reason, it eschewed that course. Thus, at the time it took up the appellants' motion, the court realized that following the local rule and deeming admitted all the facts contained in the appellants' SUF would require it to deem admitted facts that were in open contradiction to the facts upon which the earlier summary judgment rested. That, in turn, would result in the entry of a judgment that directly conflicted with the earlier judgment.</p>\n<p>The prospect of this bizarre result sent up a red flag. It counselled in favor of a careful review of the available options and a balancing of the equities. Here, however, the court warded off the potential conflict by giving one set of litigants (the insurers) a largesse that it withheld from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> the other set of litigants (the appellants). To be specific, the court, having strictly enforced Local Rule 56 against the appellants in connection with the insurers' summary judgment motion, excused the insurers from compliance with that rule in connection with the appellants' summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p>Because the inconsistency is patentthe court held opposing parties to materially different standards in the application and enforcement of a local rulethe inquiry reduces to whether the court had good cause to justify the differential treatment. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 46. In mounting such an inquiry, context is important. Here, the district court reasoned that the appellants could not be allowed to cure defects in their opposition to the insurers' summary judgment motion by filing their own cross-motion. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 5. This reasoning is valid in the abstract, but the court's attempt to use it here does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p>This is not a situation in which a party tried to rectify its noncompliance with the local rule by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment <i>after</i> the time had run for opposing a summary judgment motion. By contrast, both sides in this case filed motions for summary judgment within the same time framethe motions were filed a day apart, and both were filed within the period prescribed by the district court for the service of dispositive motions. Thus, the timing is a non-issue. On these facts, where neither side properly contested the other's SUF in the manner prescribed by Local Rule 56, strictly enforcing the local rule against one party while excusing the other party's noncompliance cannot be countenanced.</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, the appellants' rights were prejudiced by the district court's inconsistent application of the local rule. The court's decision to address the insurers' motion first led it, in effect, to apply the insurers' version of the facts to both motions. Based on that decision, the court granted the insurers' motion for summary judgment against the appellants and denied the appellants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The arbitrariness of this approach is obvious: had the district court opted to consider the appellants' motion first, the shoe would have been on the other foot; the district court would have applied the appellants' version of the facts across the board; and, presumably, the appellants would have prevailed on both motions. The outcome of litigation should not be permitted to turn on so vagarious a choice.</p>\n<p>It is settled law that each cross-motion for summary judgment must be decided on its own merits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir.1996). That does not mean, however, that each motion must be considered in a vacuum. Where, as here, cross-motions for summary judgment are filed simultaneously, or nearly so, the district court ordinarily should consider the two motions at the same time. If the court opts to consider them at different times, it must at the very least apply the same standards to each.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the two SUFs (each properly supported and effectively uncontested) directly contradicted each other. Faced with that situation, we think that the court should have denied both motions without prejudice and directed the parties to refile. After all, the first summary judgment order was merely an order for partial summary judgment which did not dispose of all claims amongst all parties. Consequently, that order could be revisited by the district court at any time up until the entry of final judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <i>see also </i><i>Williamson v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> <i>Am.,</i> 160 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.,</i> 977 F.2d 1533, 1548 (10th Cir.1992); 10 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 56.41[2][a], at 56-334 (3d ed.2010). Instead, the court avoided the paradox of entering two conflicting orders by applying Local Rule 56 inconsistently to the parties' motions without good cause for doing so. Because this differential treatment unfairly prejudiced the appellants, we hold that the district court abused its discretion. It follows that both orders (as between these parties) must be vacated.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Requests for Admission.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is one loose end. The appellants claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion to deem admitted the matters limned in their requests for admission. The appellants add that this bevue prejudiced them because, had the matters in question been deemed admitted, that would have strengthened their hand at summary judgment. Because the propriety of summary judgment must be revisited, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), efficiency concerns prompt us to address this claim of error now.</p>\n<p>\"A party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of [certain] matters.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(1). Under this rule, \"[a] matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(3).</p>\n<p>The appellants resorted to this procedure during discovery. After some procedural skirmishing, not now relevant, the insurers served responses to the requests for admission. The appellants, thinking the responses evasive, asked the district court to treat as admitted the matters delineated in the requests. The district court denied this motion on the ground that the motion lacked the requisite certification. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 26(b).</p>\n<p>The appellants suggest that the district court simply misread the record. A review of the court papers validates this suggestion: the appellants did include the required certification in their motion. Because the district court's error is obvious, the order appealed from must be set aside. The district court, on remand, should address the motion on the merits prior to considering the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the order denying the appellants' Rule 36 motion is vacated; the orders on the cross-motions for summary judgment are likewise vacated; and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  There are two appeals, one from the entry of a partial judgment and the other from the entry of a final judgment (which subsumes the partial judgment). For all practical purposes, the two appeals have merged. <i>See </i><i>SEC v. SG Ltd.,</i> 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  Integrand Assurance Company is also listed on the consolidated briefs as an appellee, but we are unable to ascertain how Integrand is involved in these appeals. We leave it to the district court, on remand, to resolve Integrand's status.</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither side challenges the district court's characterization of the objection as a motion. We therefore take no view of the accuracy of that taxonomy.</p>\n<p>[4]  This motion targeted the appellants and two other defendants. We restrict our discussion to the appellants.</p>\n<p>[5]  The court denied relief to four of the insurance company plaintiffs. Those rulings are not before us.</p>\n<p>[6]  The court did not hinge any portion of this judgment or any of its underlying decisions on Rivera's guilty plea in the criminal case.</p>\n<p>[7]  The appellants also claim that (i) the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF should have been ignored because these facts were supported only by inadmissable hearsay; and (ii) the record does not support an award of treble damages against Hurtado. We have no need to reach those claims today.</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, the parties bear the lion's share of the responsibility for the predicament in which the district court found itself. Had each of the parties filed responses to the other's SUF in compliance with the local rule, this problem easily could have been avoided.</p>\n<p>[9]  The insurers suggest that the district court's summary judgment orders can be upheld on the basis of Rivera's guilty plea in the criminal case. The district court did not address the effect of the plea, and the issue is not clear-cut. Thus, even though we have discretion to affirm a summary judgment order on alternate grounds, the course of prudence in this case is to allow the parties to raise the issue before the district court. <i>See </i><i>Velazquez-Rivera v.

On unrelated grounds, we vacate the discovery-related order. The district court must revisit these matters anew.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>These appeals arise out of a massive civil action commenced in Puerto Rico's federal district court by nine insurance companies against hundreds of defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. The complaint posited that the defendants had engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to defraud the insurers by submitting false automobile insurance claims in violation of both RICO and a Puerto Rico anti-fraud statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141. We limit our discussion to the claims against the appellants: Rivera, Hurtado, and their conjugal partnership. The appellees are five of the plaintiffs below, namely, Puerto Rico American Insurance Company (PRAICO), National Insurance Company, Universal Insurance Company, Caribbean Alliance Insurance Company (CAICO), and Cooperativa de Seguros Múltiples de Puerto Rico.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The operative pleading for present purposes is the second amended complaint, which added Rivera, Hurtado, and their conjugal partnership as defendants. The complaint alleged that Rivera participated in a number of fraudulent claims, both as an attorney representing claimants and as a claimant himself. The complaint further alleged that Hurtado took part in the swindle as a claimant.</p>\n<p>The case proceeded through discovery. One discovery-related ruling is pertinent to these appeals. We sketch the circumstances relevant to this ruling.</p>\n<p>During discovery, the appellants requested that the insurers make certain admissions. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(1). Receiving no responses within the allotted time, the appellants moved for an order deeming admitted the matters delineated in their requests. The district court denied the motion and extended the time for responding. The insurers served their responses within this extended period. The appellants objected, asserting that the matters set forth in the requests should be deemed admitted because the responses did not comply with Rule 36.</p>\n<p>The objection lay fallow for slightly more than three years. At that point the district court, treating the objection as a motion,<sup>[3]</sup> denied it on the ground that the appellants had failed to include the required certification. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 26(b) (providing that a district court \"shall not consider any discovery motion that is not accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to reach an agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion\").</p>\n<p>During the protracted period in which the parties were squabbling over the requests for admission, the summary judgment issues were starting to crystallize. The district court had set a deadline of February 17, 2006, for the filing of dispositive motions. On February 16, the insurers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> filed a motion for partial summary judgment.<sup>[4]</sup> They supported their motion with a separate statement of uncontested facts (SUF) and a series of affidavits. The motion sought to impose liability on the appellants under sections 1962(c) and (d) of RICO.</p>\n<p>One day later (and within the period prescribed by the district court), the appellants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, supported by a separate SUF. This cross-motion sought the dismissal of all claims against them. On March 30, 2006, the insurers filed a timely opposition, but did not respond to the appellants' SUF. In their opposition, the insurers mentioned that, on February 21, 2006, Rivera had pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiring to devise a scheme to defraud insurance companies in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341. The insurers attached the information and plea agreement to their opposition.</p>\n<p>On April 18, 2006, the appellants filed an opposition to the insurers' summary judgment motion, supported by a separate response to the insurers' SUF.</p>\n<p>On June 12, 2008, the district court addressed the insurers' motion for summary judgment. The court granted that motion in part and denied it in part.<sup>[5]</sup> In its opinion, the court held that the insurers' SUF was proper in form, appropriately supported by affidavits, and compliant in all other respects with the requirements of the local rules. <i>P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos</i> (<i>PRAICO I</i>), No. 01-1186, slip op. at 3 (D.P.R. June 12, 2008) (unpublished) (citing D.P.R.R. 56). The court also held that the appellants' opposition failed to comply with the local rules and, accordingly, deemed admitted the facts set out in the insurers' SUF. <i>Id.</i> at 5 (citing D.P.R.R. 56(e)). Based on this ruling the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera had filed fraudulent insurance claims, both as an attorney representing other claimants and to his own behoof, with PRAICO, Cooperativa, National, CAICO, and Universal. <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that Rivera and Hurtado had jointly filed a false claim with National. <i>Id.</i> at 6. Moving to damages, the court concluded, as a matter of undisputed fact, that the insurers had paid these bogus claims, resulting in specific monetary losses. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. With these determinations in place, the court held that the summary judgment record satisfied the requirements for liability under RICO § 1962(c), <i>id.</i> at 10, and proceeded to award treble damages in the insurers' favor. <i>Id.</i> (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)). The court entered a partial judgment against the appellants in these amounts.</p>\n<p>In a separate opinion, issued more than a month later, the district court granted in part and denied in part the appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment. The court noted that the appellants' SUF complied with the local rules and that the insurers had neglected to file the separate response to the SUF required by those rules. <i>P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Burgos</i> (<i>PRAICO II</i>), No. 01-1186, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. July 29, 2008) (unpublished). Based on this deficiency, the court deemed admitted some of the facts limned in the appellants' SUF. <i>Id.</i> But the court stopped short of deeming all the facts admitted; rather, it concluded that, despite the insurers' failure to file a counter-statement, it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> would not deem admitted any facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier partial judgment rested. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This truncated view of the record led the district court to deny the cross-motion with respect to the claims asserted against the appellants by PRAICO, Cooperativa, National, CAICO, and Universal. <i>Id.</i> The court exonerated the appellants with respect to other claims. <i>See id.</i> at 7; <i>see also supra</i> note 5. This included a determination that Hurtado had not submitted false claims to PRAICO, Universal, or Cooperativa. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 8. The court thereupon entered another partial judgment.</p>\n<p>On August 8, 2008, the district court entered a final judgment.<sup>[6]</sup> We have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Before us, the appellants asseverate that the district court abused its discretion in disregarding their opposition to the SUF that accompanied the insurers' motion for summary judgment; that, in all events, the lower court treated them unfairly by applying materially different standards to the adjudication of the two motions for summary judgment; and that the court erred in its final ruling concerning their requests for admission.<sup>[7]</sup> We discuss the first two assignments of error together and then move to the third.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Summary Judgment Practice.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When passing upon a motion for summary judgment, a district court must take the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom to that party's behoof. <i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202726\"><a href=\"/opinion/202726/caban-hernandez-v-phillip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 2007). This standard operates in conjunction with a district court's local anti-ferret rule. When the district court, acting in pursuance of an anti-ferret rule, deems admitted facts contained in the movant's SUF, those facts are considered not properly controverted, but the district court must still apply the standard articulated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. In such circumstances, we review the district court's deeming order for abuse of discretion. <i>CMI Capital Mkt. Inv., LLC v. González-Toro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203192\"><a href=\"/opinion/203192/cmi-capital-market-v-gonzalez-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2008). This entails \"a special degree of deference. . . to [the] court's interpretation of its own local rules.\" <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200913\"><a href=\"/opinion/200913/crowley-v-ll-bean-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>In re Jarvis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196044\"><a href=\"/opinion/196044/jarvis-v-debtor-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 422 (1st Cir.1995)). Apart from any judgment calls concerning the application of the local rule, the ultimate decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>Local Rule 56 of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is such an anti-ferret rule. It requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit a \"separate, short, and concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact.\" D.P.R.R. 56(b). Each fact must be supported by a citation to a specific paragraph or page of the summary judgment record. D.P.R.R. 56(e).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> A party opposing a motion for summary judgment must submit a counter-statement, which \"shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). Properly supported facts contained in an SUF shall be deemed admitted unless controverted in the manner prescribed by the local rule. D.P.R.R. 56(e).</p>\n<p>In this case, the appellants' first line of argument is that the district court should not have deemed admitted the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF. The mainstay of this argument is that their opposition to the SUF complied with Local Rule 56. In this regard, they stress that their opposing statement addressed all of the SUF's declared facts in the order in which they appeared.</p>\n<p>This argument is disingenuous. Even a cursory glance at the opposition reveals that the appellants wholly failed to \"admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\" D.P.R.R. 56(c). This is starkly evident from a side-by-side comparison of the SUF and the opposition. Although the SUF contains eighty-eight numbered paragraphs of facts, the opposition nowhere matches up with, or even references, these numbered paragraphs. Rather, it comprises twenty-five numbered paragraphs, divided into five, separately numbered sections, and repeatedly lumps responses to several separately declared facts into a single sentence.</p>\n<p>The appellants counter that any failure of compliance was technical and, therefore, harmless. This ipse dixit overlooks the root purpose of an \"anti-ferret\" rule. This type of rule is aimed at enabling a district court to adjudicate a summary judgment motion without endless rummaging through a plethoric record. <i>See </i><i>CMI Capital Mkt. Inv.,</i> 520 F.3d at 62; <i>Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201216/rios-jimenez-v-principi/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203075\"><a href=\"/opinion/203075/mariani-colon-v-dept-of-homeland-sec/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 219 (1st Cir.2007). Given this root purpose, we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that parties ignore the strictures of an \"anti-ferret\" rule at their peril. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ruiz Rivera v. Riley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198879\"><a href=\"/opinion/198879/ruiz-rivera-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>We add, moreover, that it is primarily the role of the district court to determine what departures from a local rule may be tolerated. <i>United States v. Diaz-Villafane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, the district court concluded that the appellants' failure to comply with Local Rule 56 was material. This conclusion makes sense: had the district court overlooked the appellants' noncompliance, it would have had to comb through the opposition in an effort to match the appellants' non-conforming responses to the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF. Only then could the court have determined which facts were genuinely controverted and which were not. This is exactly the sort of archeological dig that anti-ferret rules are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p>The appellants have a fallback position. They contend that because they incorporated by reference in their opposition to the insurers' motion their own SUF (which was attached to their cross-motion for summary judgment), they made clear their version of the facts. They strive to persuade us that this incorporation by reference constituted substantial compliance with Local Rule 56. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>As indicated above, Local Rule 56 serves the important purpose of \"prevent[ing] parties from shifting to the district court the burden of sifting through the inevitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*132</span> mountain of information generated by discovery in search of relevant material.\" <i>Ríos-Jiménez,</i> 520 F.3d at 38. The appellants' SUF did not address, paragraph by paragraph or statement by statement, the insurers' SUF. Even if the district court could have gleaned the parties' positions by independent analysis of the two documents, that was not the court's job. A party cannot circumvent the requirements imposed by an anti-ferret rule simply by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment and expecting the district court to do the party's homework.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the appellants' cross-motion is significant in another respect. The district court determined that the appellants' SUF, which accompanied the cross-motion, complied with Local Rule 56. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 5. The court also determined that the insurers had failed to proffer the counter-statement required by that rule. <i>Id.</i> The court acknowledged that, given this noncompliance, it ought to deem admitted the facts contained in the appellants' SUF. <i>See id.</i>; <i>see also</i> D.P.R.R. 56(e). But the court nonetheless declined to deem admitted those facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier summary judgment order rested. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip. op. at 5. That led the court to deny the appellants' motion for summary judgment against the five insurers in whose favor the earlier order ran (the appellees here).</p>\n<p>The appellants argue that the court treated the two SUFs differently. This is undeniably so. The appellants add that this approach unfairly gave preference to the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF merely because the court happened to decide the insurers' motion first. This differential treatment, they say, constituted an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p>To be sure, a district court has broad discretion in the administration and enforcement of its own local rules. <i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 46. But this discretion is not unbridled. <i>Id.</i> Rules must be administered evenhandedly and applied consistently. To deviate from a local rule, the court \"(1) must have a sound reason for doing so, and (2) must ensure that no party's substantial rights are unfairly jeopardized.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>accord </i><i>García-Goyco v. Law Envtl. Consultants, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201895\"><a href=\"/opinion/201895/garcia-goyco-v-law-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.2005). Fundamental fairness is the mainstay of this paradigm. <i>See </i><i>Wight v. BankAmerica Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769494\"><a href=\"/opinion/769494/ian-an-wight-as-an-official-liquidator-of-bank-of-credit-and-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 85-86 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court faced a dilemmabut it was a dilemma of the court's own making.<sup>[8]</sup> The court could have considered both motions for summary judgment at the same time. For some unexplained reason, it eschewed that course. Thus, at the time it took up the appellants' motion, the court realized that following the local rule and deeming admitted all the facts contained in the appellants' SUF would require it to deem admitted facts that were in open contradiction to the facts upon which the earlier summary judgment rested. That, in turn, would result in the entry of a judgment that directly conflicted with the earlier judgment.</p>\n<p>The prospect of this bizarre result sent up a red flag. It counselled in favor of a careful review of the available options and a balancing of the equities. Here, however, the court warded off the potential conflict by giving one set of litigants (the insurers) a largesse that it withheld from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> the other set of litigants (the appellants). To be specific, the court, having strictly enforced Local Rule 56 against the appellants in connection with the insurers' summary judgment motion, excused the insurers from compliance with that rule in connection with the appellants' summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p>Because the inconsistency is patentthe court held opposing parties to materially different standards in the application and enforcement of a local rulethe inquiry reduces to whether the court had good cause to justify the differential treatment. <i>See </i><i>Diaz-Villafane,</i> 874 F.2d at 46. In mounting such an inquiry, context is important. Here, the district court reasoned that the appellants could not be allowed to cure defects in their opposition to the insurers' summary judgment motion by filing their own cross-motion. <i>PRAICO II,</i> slip op. at 5. This reasoning is valid in the abstract, but the court's attempt to use it here does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p>This is not a situation in which a party tried to rectify its noncompliance with the local rule by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment <i>after</i> the time had run for opposing a summary judgment motion. By contrast, both sides in this case filed motions for summary judgment within the same time framethe motions were filed a day apart, and both were filed within the period prescribed by the district court for the service of dispositive motions. Thus, the timing is a non-issue. On these facts, where neither side properly contested the other's SUF in the manner prescribed by Local Rule 56, strictly enforcing the local rule against one party while excusing the other party's noncompliance cannot be countenanced.</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, the appellants' rights were prejudiced by the district court's inconsistent application of the local rule. The court's decision to address the insurers' motion first led it, in effect, to apply the insurers' version of the facts to both motions. Based on that decision, the court granted the insurers' motion for summary judgment against the appellants and denied the appellants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The arbitrariness of this approach is obvious: had the district court opted to consider the appellants' motion first, the shoe would have been on the other foot; the district court would have applied the appellants' version of the facts across the board; and, presumably, the appellants would have prevailed on both motions. The outcome of litigation should not be permitted to turn on so vagarious a choice.</p>\n<p>It is settled law that each cross-motion for summary judgment must be decided on its own merits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712176\"><a href=\"/opinion/712176/dana-blackie-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 721 (1st Cir.1996). That does not mean, however, that each motion must be considered in a vacuum. Where, as here, cross-motions for summary judgment are filed simultaneously, or nearly so, the district court ordinarily should consider the two motions at the same time. If the court opts to consider them at different times, it must at the very least apply the same standards to each.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the two SUFs (each properly supported and effectively uncontested) directly contradicted each other. Faced with that situation, we think that the court should have denied both motions without prejudice and directed the parties to refile. After all, the first summary judgment order was merely an order for partial summary judgment which did not dispose of all claims amongst all parties. Consequently, that order could be revisited by the district court at any time up until the entry of final judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <i>see also </i><i>Williamson v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> <i>Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759277\"><a href=\"/opinion/759277/22-employee-benefits-cas-2419-98-daily-journal-dar-11954-sherry-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span>, 1251 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Anixter v. Home-Stake Prod. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1533</span></span>, 1548 (10th Cir.1992); 10 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 56.41[2][a], at 56-334 (3d ed.2010). Instead, the court avoided the paradox of entering two conflicting orders by applying Local Rule 56 inconsistently to the parties' motions without good cause for doing so. Because this differential treatment unfairly prejudiced the appellants, we hold that the district court abused its discretion. It follows that both orders (as between these parties) must be vacated.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Requests for Admission.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is one loose end. The appellants claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion to deem admitted the matters limned in their requests for admission. The appellants add that this bevue prejudiced them because, had the matters in question been deemed admitted, that would have strengthened their hand at summary judgment. Because the propriety of summary judgment must be revisited, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), efficiency concerns prompt us to address this claim of error now.</p>\n<p>\"A party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of [certain] matters.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(1). Under this rule, \"[a] matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a)(3).</p>\n<p>The appellants resorted to this procedure during discovery. After some procedural skirmishing, not now relevant, the insurers served responses to the requests for admission. The appellants, thinking the responses evasive, asked the district court to treat as admitted the matters delineated in the requests. The district court denied this motion on the ground that the motion lacked the requisite certification. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 26(b).</p>\n<p>The appellants suggest that the district court simply misread the record. A review of the court papers validates this suggestion: the appellants did include the required certification in their motion. Because the district court's error is obvious, the order appealed from must be set aside. The district court, on remand, should address the motion on the merits prior to considering the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the order denying the appellants' Rule 36 motion is vacated; the orders on the cross-motions for summary judgment are likewise vacated; and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  There are two appeals, one from the entry of a partial judgment and the other from the entry of a final judgment (which subsumes the partial judgment). For all practical purposes, the two appeals have merged. <i>See </i><i>SEC v. SG Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  Integrand Assurance Company is also listed on the consolidated briefs as an appellee, but we are unable to ascertain how Integrand is involved in these appeals. We leave it to the district court, on remand, to resolve Integrand's status.</p>\n<p>[3]  Neither side challenges the district court's characterization of the objection as a motion. We therefore take no view of the accuracy of that taxonomy.</p>\n<p>[4]  This motion targeted the appellants and two other defendants. We restrict our discussion to the appellants.</p>\n<p>[5]  The court denied relief to four of the insurance company plaintiffs. Those rulings are not before us.</p>\n<p>[6]  The court did not hinge any portion of this judgment or any of its underlying decisions on Rivera's guilty plea in the criminal case.</p>\n<p>[7]  The appellants also claim that (i) the facts set forth in the insurers' SUF should have been ignored because these facts were supported only by inadmissable hearsay; and (ii) the record does not support an award of treble damages against Hurtado. We have no need to reach those claims today.</p>\n<p>[8]  To be sure, the parties bear the lion's share of the responsibility for the predicament in which the district court found itself. Had each of the parties filed responses to the other's SUF in compliance with the local rule, this problem easily could have been avoided.</p>\n<p>[9]  The insurers suggest that the district court's summary judgment orders can be upheld on the basis of Rivera's guilty plea in the criminal case. The district court did not address the effect of the plea, and the issue is not clear-cut. Thus, even though we have discretion to affirm a summary judgment order on alternate grounds, the course of prudence in this case is to allow the parties to raise the issue before the district court. <i>See </i><i>Velazquez-Rivera v.
