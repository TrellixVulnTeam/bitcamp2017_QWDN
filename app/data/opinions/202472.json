In 2003, following a five-day\n\njury trial in the United States District Court in Puerto Rico,\n\nJacinta Thomas was found guilty of smuggling and possession of\n\nillegal drugs.     Concluding that the evidence is sufficient to\n\nsustain the verdicts and that the trial court properly refused to\n\nallow extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter, we affirm.\n\n     I.   Statement of Facts\n\n           A.   Mr. Smalls and the Box of Pink Lady\n\n           On July 6, 2002, a confidential informant (CI) contacted\n\nthe San Juan, Puerto Rico office of the United States Customs\n\nService   (Customs)   concerning   a     shipment   of   narcotics   being\n\ntransported from St. Martin, Netherlands, Antilles into San Juan.\n\nThe CI, a crew member from a Caribbean cargo vessel, had been a\n\npaid informant since 1998 and had previously provided Customs with\n\ninformation concerning narcotics smuggling. He reported that a box\n\nof wine containing narcotics was going to be entrusted to him to\n\ntransport from St. Martin to Pier 10 in the port of San Juan.\n\nLater that day in St. Martin, a man by the name of Mr. Smalls1\n\napproached the CI.     Smalls confirmed that he wanted the CI to\n\ntransport a box of wine to San Juan, told the CI that one of his\n\nworkers would deliver the wine to him, and slipped the CI two\n\ntelephone numbers to contact upon his arrival in San Juan.           Later,\n\na worker brought the CI a sealed white carton box indicating that\n\nit contained wine and marked “Pink Lady,” which the CI stowed\n\n\n     1\n     The parties refer either to Mr. Small or Mr. Smalls; this\nopinion uses “Smalls.”\n\n                                   -2-\n\fsecurely in his cabin.        After leaving St. Martin, the vessel set\n\nsail for the port of San Juan.          Awaiting his arrival at Pier 10 was\n\na surveillance team from Customs.\n\n              B.   The Vessel Arrives at Pier 10\n\n              On July 9, 2002 at about 7:00 a.m., the cargo vessel\n\narrived at Pier 10 in San Juan harbor.             After the CI contacted\n\nCustoms, agents boarded the vessel, debriefed the CI, and opened\n\nthe box labeled Pink Lady.         Inside the box, the agents observed\n\npelletized objects in brick-shaped packages and other objects\n\nshaped like shoe soles inside bags.             They resealed the box and\n\ninstructed the CI to call the numbers Smalls had given him.\n\n              When the CI called the first number, a woman answered the\n\nphone.      After the CI asked for Smalls, she asked him to call back\n\nin five minutes.      When he did so, he spoke directly to Smalls, who\n\nsaid he would send a woman who was well known in the pier area to\n\npick up the box.       The CI called a third time and spoke to a woman\n\nwho confirmed that she was going to come to the port to pick up the\n\nbox.       The telephone number the CI had called was listed to the\n\nAppellant.\n\n              C.   Jacinta Thomas and Pier 10\n\n              The morning of July 9, 2002, Thomas, a resident of\n\nSanturce, Puerto Rico, got in her Ford Taurus and drove to Pier 10.\n\nShe    arrived     sometime   between    7:00   a.m.   and   9:00   a.m.2   and\n\nimmediately came under Customs surveillance.           After Thomas entered\n\n       2\n      The Agents disagreed about precisely when she arrived: one\nsaid between 7:00 and 7:15 a.m.; another said between 8:00 and 9:00\na.m.; and, a third said 8:20 a.m.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe dock area, she parked her car and got out.              After exiting her\n\nvehicle, she answered her cell phone and then looked toward the\n\ncargo vessel.      Customs agents observed her frequently looking\n\ntoward the freight and cargo area, as if searching for someone\n\nspecific.    Unlike others with business in the port, she did not\n\nenter any offices, was not carrying any documents, and repeatedly\n\nused her cell phone.     She then reentered her vehicle and left the\n\ndock area for ten to fifteen minutes.\n\n            Upon her return, she parked again, got out of her car,\n\nand sat in a chair, chatting with people passing by.            This time she\n\nremained on the dock for several hours.            While she was there, the\n\nCI placed four calls to her cell phone to establish contact and to\n\ncoordinate delivery of the box.         These calls took place at 10:30,\n\n10:50,   11:10,   and   11:26   a.m.    and   as   these   calls   were   made,\n\nsurveillance confirmed that Thomas was using her cell phone.                It\n\ntook hours to coordinate the delivery of the box to Thomas, because\n\nThomas did not want to pick up the box at the end of the pier, but\n\ninstead wanted the box delivered to her car.               Ultimately, the CI\n\narranged to have one of his employees take the box on a forklift to\n\nThomas’s car.     When the forklift operator arrived at her car,\n\nThomas got up from her chair, pointed to the side of the car,\n\nwalked in front of the forklift operator, and opened the door to\n\nthe driver’s seat.      The forklift operator placed the box in the\n\nrear seat behind the driver.\n\n            After the box was placed in her vehicle, Thomas stayed\n\nnear her car momentarily and then walked toward the LADY ROMNEY,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fanother cargo vessel.        Thomas returned to her car accompanied by\n\nanother woman, who was wearing a type of hair net commonly worn by\n\ncooks.        This woman joined Thomas approximately thirty seconds\n\nbefore Thomas began to drive out of Pier 10.         As Thomas was driving\n\nout of Pier 10, Customs agents stopped her.             After identifying\n\nhimself, Agent Ritchie Flores asked Thomas whether she had any\n\ncargo or foreign property in her vehicle.         Thomas replied that she\n\nhad a box in the rear seat that had come from Anguila.         Flores was\n\naware, however, that the wine box had originated in St. Martin and\n\nhad not traveled to Anguila.       Flores asked if he could search both\n\nthe box and Thomas; she consented.            Inside the wine box, Flores\n\ndiscovered brick-shaped packages wrapped in newspaper and covered\n\nin grease and inside these packages were bricks of heroin and\n\ncocaine base, containing 3.96 kilograms of heroin hydrocholoride\n\nand 4.922 kilograms of cocaine base.3           There was no wine in the\n\nbox.\n\n               D.   Customs Procedure\n\n               Under Customs regulations, all incoming foreign cargo\n\nmust be manifested and declared, including merchandise brought by\n\ncrew members.         To exit the port with foreign merchandise, the\n\nrecipient must proceed to Customs with the required forms and\n\nreceive clearance.       Thomas did not have any paperwork to accompany\n\nthe box of wine.\n\n               E.   Narcotics Smuggling\n\n               The value of one kilogram of heroin was $90,000 wholesale\n\n       3\n           The parties stipulated to these drug amounts at trial.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fand $270,000 retail, and the value of one kilogram of cocaine base\n\nwas $17,500 wholesale and $52,000 retail.           The range of value for\n\nthe entire shipment, therefore, was between $442,535 wholesale and\n\n$1,325,144 retail. At trial, a DEA task force member expressed the\n\nview that, because of the value of the shipment, the owner of the\n\ndrugs would only assign the job of picking up the drugs to a highly\n\ntrusted member of the drug organization.         He also testified that a\n\ndrug organization would never use a person who was unaware of what\n\nwas being transported.\n\n           F.    Jacinta Thomas’s Defense\n\n           Thomas’s defense was, in short, that the cook did it.\n\nThomas took the stand during her trial and testified that every\n\nTuesday she had gone to Pier 10 to meet the LADY ROMNEY and to pick\n\nup its cook, Claudette Henriquez.         In exchange for $100.00, Thomas\n\nwould   then    take   Henriquez   in   her   car   to   various   wholesale\n\nbusinesses in San Juan, such as Costco and Sam’s, where Henriquez\n\nwould purchase food and other supplies for the vessel.\n\n           Thomas testified that she had arrived, as usual, at Pier\n\n10 the morning of Tuesday, July 9, 2002, to pick up Henriquez.\n\nWhen she arrived, however, Jack, the captain of the LADY ROMNEY,\n\nasked her to take his girlfriend to the beauty parlor, which Thomas\n\ndid, returning shortly thereafter to pick up Henriquez.               After\n\nThomas returned to Pier 10, Henriquez asked if she could borrow\n\nThomas’s cell phone and disappeared inside the LADY ROMNEY. Thomas\n\nwaited for Henriquez to reappear and ultimately went inside the\n\nvessel to find Henriquez, who told her that she had to finish\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fcooking for the crew that day and would then be ready to leave.\n\nHenriquez also told Thomas that she had a box of liquor to take\n\nout.         Thomas replied that this would be no problem.         Thomas\n\nreturned to the dock, where she continued to wait for Henriquez.\n\nAs Thomas waited, she placed a number of calls on her cell phone,\n\nincluding to her daughter and her own clients.4\n\n                Thomas agreed that while she was waiting for Henriquez,\n\nshe received a telephone call from someone, informing her that\n\nHenriquez had asked him to call her about the box of wine and that\n\nhe needed her permission to deliver the box, since it was her car.\n\nThomas agreed, knowing that Henriquez had informed her about the\n\nwine.        This same person called a second time and told her to come\n\npick up the box; Thomas refused and instead told him to bring the\n\nwine to her vehicle.         This took some time and Thomas went back\n\ninside the LADY ROMNEY to hurry Henriquez along.            When she came\n\nout, a person had arrived at her vehicle with a forklift and the\n\nwine.        Thomas told him where to place the box.   Henriquez emerged\n\nfrom the LADY ROMNEY, got into Thomas’s car, and they both left\n\nPier 10.\n\n                As they were leaving, they were stopped by Customs\n\nAgents. Thomas immediately conceded that they had brought a box of\n\nwine from the docks and when she was asked for papers for it\n\nreplied: “[T]hey just bring me the box but they didn’t give me ...\n\nany paper or anything.”        She consented to a search of the box.\n\n                At the police station, after the Agents detained both\n\n        4\n            Thomas operates a beauty salon from her home.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fHenriquez and Thomas, Thomas informed them that she was unaware of\n\nthe contents of the box, but thought it had come from Anguila,\n\nbecause she knew that was where Henriquez was coming from.       At the\n\ntime of her arrest, Thomas had $83.00 in her pocketbook.            The\n\npolice released Henriquez that same day.      Henriquez subsequently\n\nresigned her cook’s job, left the Island, and disappeared.\n\n           G.   The Progress of the Case\n\n           On August 7, 2002, Thomas was indicted for (1) the\n\nknowing and intentional importing into the United States of heroin\n\nand cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.     §   952(a); and, (2) the\n\nknowing and intentional possession of heroin and cocaine base with\n\nthe intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\nThe case was tried before a Puerto Rican jury from July 28, 2003 to\n\nAugust 4, 2003, and the jury returned guilty verdicts on both\n\ncounts.    After Rule 29 motions were denied, Thomas filed a timely\n\nappeal on September 9, 2004.\n\n     II.         Discussion\n\n           A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Thomas’s main challenge is directed to the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence on an essential element of the offense: whether she\n\n“knowingly and intentionally” either possessed or imported illegal\n\nnarcotics into the United States.      21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), 952(a).\n\nShe strenuously argues that the sole evidence tending to establish\n\nthat she had actual knowledge that illegal narcotics were contained\n\nwithin the box marked Pink Lady is the testimony of a DEA agent to\n\nthe effect that drug smugglers do not generally entrust large\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\famounts of drugs to innocents.       She contends that even if the\n\ntestimony of the CI were credible, it is a leap too far to conclude\n\nthat Smalls, who never testified, told her that the box contained\n\nillegal drugs or that she otherwise knew or should have known that\n\nit did.   In effect, she argues that, though the evidence could\n\neasily sustain a guilty verdict if charged with aiding and abetting\n\nthe attempted smuggling of a few bottles of Pink Lady wine, it\n\ncannot sustain a verdict for smuggling large quantities of heroin\n\nand cocaine base.\n\n          While we review Rule 29 determinations de novo, we will\n\naffirm the conviction if, “after assaying all the evidence in the\n\nlight most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.”     United States v. Carucci, 364\n\nF.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Boulerice,\n\n325 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2003)).      “All ‘reasonable evidentiary\n\ninferences’ are to be drawn ‘in harmony with the verdict,’ and ‘all\n\nissues of credibility’ are to be resolved ‘in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government.’” United States v. Washington, 434\n\nF.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Casas, 356\n\nF.3d 104, 126 (1st Cir. 2004)).      Our task, therefore, is not to\n\nmake an original determination as to whether Thomas possessed the\n\nrequisite knowledge but, rather, to determine whether a rational\n\njury could have found that Thomas did so.\n\n          Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fevidence against Thomas is substantial. First, the jury could have\n\nreadily believed the CI, who testified that Smalls had given not\n\nhis own, but Thomas’s telephone number to the CI, that Smalls\n\nanswered when the CI called Thomas’s number earlier that morning,\n\nthat Smalls said he was sending someone to pick up the box, that\n\nThomas was the only person who then appeared, that Thomas was the\n\nperson answering the CI’s telephone calls at Pier 10, and that she\n\ndirected the CI to have the box delivered to her car.       Indeed,\n\nThomas’s own telephone records confirmed the calls from the CI to\n\nher phone, including calls the CI had made before she arrived at\n\nPier 10.\n\n            Second, the size of this operation, exceeding $1,300,000\n\nin street value, makes it less plausible that Thomas was wholly\n\nignorant of the criminal operation.    The jury could have accepted\n\nthe DEA agent’s testimony that smuggling operations, like Smalls’s,\n\ninvolving millions of dollars do not take unnecessary risks,\n\ninstead opting for trusted and close associates, like Thomas, who\n\nare aware of the high stakes.       Therefore, the jury could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Smalls knew Thomas well enough to use her\n\ncell phone number as a contact, was present with her when the CI\n\nmade the calls, and sent her to pick up this valuable illegal\n\nshipment.\n\n            Third, Thomas was certainly aware, at the very least,\n\nthat she was sneaking something into Puerto Rico.       The box was\n\nemblazoned Pink Lady on the outside, proclaiming its purported\n\ncontents, and smugglers rarely openly advertise the true nature of\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fthe smuggled goods. Further, as opposed to the high value of\n\nnarcotics, there is no evidence that the value of the box of wine\n\njustified the considerable time and energy she expended that\n\nmorning. Under the willful blindness instruction, Thomas could “be\n\ncharged with knowledge of a fact if she deliberately closed her\n\neyes to something that otherwise would have been obvious to her.”5\n\nUnited States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 42 n.7 (1st Cir. 2004).               Given\n\nher striking lack of curiosity as to the actual contents of the box\n\nthat       had   consumed   her   entire   morning,   the   jury   could   have\n\nrationally concluded that Thomas was at the least willfully blind\n\nto the fact that she was smuggling narcotics.\n\n                 It is true that Thomas is an unlikely drug dealer or\n\nsmuggler.        A native of St. Kitts and a twenty-seven-year resident\n\nof Puerto Rico, Thomas is a forty-four-year old single mother of\n\nnine children, ranging in ages from ten to twenty-five.                By all\n\nappearances, she is hard-working, operating a beauty parlor from\n\nher modest home and, on weekends, running a small entertainment\n\nbar, Caribbean Flavor Pub, where she serves food and liquor. There\n\nis no sign of the accumulation of any ill-gotten gains.                To the\n\ncontrary, one of the telephone calls she had received while waiting\n\n\n       5\n      Here, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that\nThomas’s “willful blindness” could satisfy the knowledge element.\nTo infer knowledge, the jury had to find first that the defendant\n“was aware of a high probability of ‘the fact in question,’ which\nin this case would be that there were controlled substances inside\nthe box that was marked ‘Pink Lady’ ... and second, that the\ndefendant consciously and deliberately avoided learning of the\nfact. That is to say, that defendant willfully made herself blind\nto the fact.” See United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 66 n.6\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                      -11-\n\fat Pier 10 relayed the unhappy news that the electric company was\n\nthreatening to cut off service for failure to pay.                Finally, on\n\narrest, she was carrying a relatively modest sum of money.               It is\n\nalso true that there was no direct evidence that she was aware of\n\nthe contents of the box.            It is, however, within the unique\n\nprovince of the jury to sift through conflicting evidence, assess\n\nthe credibility of the witnesses, and find facts.           As the Supreme\n\nCourt stated:\n\n      A fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is\n      that “the jury is the lie detector.” Determining the\n      weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore,\n      has long been held to be the “part of every case [that]\n      belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it\n      by their natural intelligence and their practical\n      knowledge of men and the ways of men.”\n\nUnited States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 313 (1998) (citation\n\nomitted); see also Blake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (“It is the jury, not the court, which is the fact-finding\n\nbody.   It weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences, judges\n\nthe credibility of witnesses ... and draws the ultimate conclusions\n\nas to the facts.” (omission in original) (quoting Boston & Me. R.R.\n\nv. Cabana, 148 F.2d 150, 152 (1st Cir. 1945) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).\n\n             Ultimately, it is Thomas’s own trial testimony that seals\n\nher   fate    on    appeal.   At   trial,   Thomas   proclaimed    her   total\n\ninnocence and insisted that the entire plot was concocted by the\n\ncook.   She        maintained that she was there only to take the cook\n\nshopping and that it was the cook who duped her into transporting\n\nthe box of Pink Lady.          What may have been plausible at trial,\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fhowever, becomes untenable on appeal, once the evidence is viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to the government.     The government’s\n\nevidence establishes that Thomas was implicated to some degree with\n\nSmalls in the scheme and her protestations of absolute innocence\n\ncannot be reconciled with the weight of the collective evidence.6\n\nIf Thomas had admitted the bulk of the government’s evidence but\n\ndenied the final crucial element -- that she knew the box contained\n\nnarcotics -- her trial testimony would at least be consistent with\n\nher current legal argument.      But, once the case is cast in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, the evidence exposes an\n\ninexplicable inconsistency between what the government proved and\n\nwhat Thomas stated under oath.    In view of this inconsistency, the\n\njury could well have found Thomas’s testimony incredible and found\n\nthat she was neither hermetically sealed from the true nature of\n\nthe criminal enterprise nor that the cook was the actual culprit.\n\nUnited States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(“[P]lausible credibility determinations cannot be disturbed on\n\nappeal.”).\n\n          In sum, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, a “rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential\n\nelements of the crime.”   Carucci, 364 F.3d at 343.\n\n\n     6\n      This evidence includes Smalls’s use of her cell phone number,\nher presence with Smalls when the CI made the calls earlier that\nday, her arrival as the courier promised by Smalls, the documented\ncalls from the CI to her cell phone, both before and after she\narrived at Pier 10, her unusual conduct on the Pier, and her odd\ninsistence that the box be delivered to her vehicle.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          B.   Rule 608(b)\n\n          We need not tarry long with the second issue.       Defense\n\ncounsel was aware from handling other matters that Modesto Augusto\n\nMesa, a convicted felon, had previously accused the CI of retaining\n\nfor himself part of a drug shipment in another case in which the CI\n\nhad participated as an informant.      On cross-examination, defense\n\ncounsel sought to question the CI as to whether Mesa’s accusation\n\nwas true, and the district court allowed it.           However, when\n\nquestioned about the prior bad act, the CI flatly denied it.   After\n\nthe CI’s denial, defense counsel asked leave to call Mesa as a\n\nwitness in an effort to prove that the CI was lying.     The district\n\ncourt refused permission.       Thomas contends the trial court’s\n\nrefusal violated Rule 608(b) and infringed her Sixth Amendment\n\nright of confrontation.\n\n          Thomas misses the mark.    First, the rules of evidence do\n\nnot require the admission of such extrinsic evidence.     Rule 608(b)\n\nprovides in part that “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a\n\nwitness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’\n\ncharacter for truthfulness ... may not be proved by extrinsic\n\nevidence.”   Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).     It is “well established that a\n\nparty may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by\n\ncontradiction on a collateral matter.” United States v. Beauchamp,\n\n986 F.2d 1,3 (1st Cir. 1993).   Thus, “it is often said that when a\n\nwitness testifies to a collateral matter, the examiner must take\n\n[the] answer.”   Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).     Even if\n\nthe proposed testimony was proffered to show bias rather than to\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fattack the CI’s veracity, it is nevertheless inadmissible under a\n\nRule 402 and Rule 403 analysis.               See Fed. R. Evid. 608 Advisory\n\nCommittee Note 2003 Amendment(“By limiting the application of the\n\nRule    to    proof   of   a    witness’    character     for    truthfulness,    the\n\namendment leaves the admissibility of extrinsic evidence offered\n\nfor other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior\n\ninconsistent statement, bias and mental capacity) to Rule 402 and\n\n403.”).\n\n              Second, turning to the Confrontation Clause question, in\n\nthe    post-Crawford       v.   Washington,       541   U.S.    36   (2004),   era,   a\n\n“balancing of interests” is still called for and the result must\n\ndepend “upon the circumstances of the case.”                   White v. Coplan, 399\n\nF.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir. 2005).               Here, in refusing to allow a trial\n\nwithin a trial on a collateral matter, the trial court struck the\n\nproper balance.        United States v. Coplin, No. 05-2077, 2006 U.S.\n\nApp. LEXIS 23910, *21 (1st Cir. Sept. 20, 2006) (trial courts have\n\n“undeniable authority ... to place reasonable limits on cross-\n\nexamination in order to cut off protected discussion of marginally\n\nrelevant subjects.”).\n\n       III.    Conclusion\n\n              The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f",

In 2003, following a five-day\n\njury trial in the United States District Court in Puerto Rico,\n\nJacinta Thomas was found guilty of smuggling and possession of\n\nillegal drugs.     Concluding that the evidence is sufficient to\n\nsustain the verdicts and that the trial court properly refused to\n\nallow extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter, we affirm.\n\n     I.   Statement of Facts\n\n           A.   Mr. Smalls and the Box of Pink Lady\n\n           On July 6, 2002, a confidential informant (CI) contacted\n\nthe San Juan, Puerto Rico office of the United States Customs\n\nService   (Customs)   concerning   a     shipment   of   narcotics   being\n\ntransported from St. Martin, Netherlands, Antilles into San Juan.\n\nThe CI, a crew member from a Caribbean cargo vessel, had been a\n\npaid informant since 1998 and had previously provided Customs with\n\ninformation concerning narcotics smuggling. He reported that a box\n\nof wine containing narcotics was going to be entrusted to him to\n\ntransport from St. Martin to Pier 10 in the port of San Juan.\n\nLater that day in St. Martin, a man by the name of Mr. Smalls1\n\napproached the CI.     Smalls confirmed that he wanted the CI to\n\ntransport a box of wine to San Juan, told the CI that one of his\n\nworkers would deliver the wine to him, and slipped the CI two\n\ntelephone numbers to contact upon his arrival in San Juan.           Later,\n\na worker brought the CI a sealed white carton box indicating that\n\nit contained wine and marked “Pink Lady,” which the CI stowed\n\n\n     1\n     The parties refer either to Mr. Small or Mr. Smalls; this\nopinion uses “Smalls.”\n\n                                   -2-\n\fsecurely in his cabin.        After leaving St. Martin, the vessel set\n\nsail for the port of San Juan.          Awaiting his arrival at Pier 10 was\n\na surveillance team from Customs.\n\n              B.   The Vessel Arrives at Pier 10\n\n              On July 9, 2002 at about 7:00 a.m., the cargo vessel\n\narrived at Pier 10 in San Juan harbor.             After the CI contacted\n\nCustoms, agents boarded the vessel, debriefed the CI, and opened\n\nthe box labeled Pink Lady.         Inside the box, the agents observed\n\npelletized objects in brick-shaped packages and other objects\n\nshaped like shoe soles inside bags.             They resealed the box and\n\ninstructed the CI to call the numbers Smalls had given him.\n\n              When the CI called the first number, a woman answered the\n\nphone.      After the CI asked for Smalls, she asked him to call back\n\nin five minutes.      When he did so, he spoke directly to Smalls, who\n\nsaid he would send a woman who was well known in the pier area to\n\npick up the box.       The CI called a third time and spoke to a woman\n\nwho confirmed that she was going to come to the port to pick up the\n\nbox.       The telephone number the CI had called was listed to the\n\nAppellant.\n\n              C.   Jacinta Thomas and Pier 10\n\n              The morning of July 9, 2002, Thomas, a resident of\n\nSanturce, Puerto Rico, got in her Ford Taurus and drove to Pier 10.\n\nShe    arrived     sometime   between    7:00   a.m.   and   9:00   a.m.2   and\n\nimmediately came under Customs surveillance.           After Thomas entered\n\n       2\n      The Agents disagreed about precisely when she arrived: one\nsaid between 7:00 and 7:15 a.m.; another said between 8:00 and 9:00\na.m.; and, a third said 8:20 a.m.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe dock area, she parked her car and got out.              After exiting her\n\nvehicle, she answered her cell phone and then looked toward the\n\ncargo vessel.      Customs agents observed her frequently looking\n\ntoward the freight and cargo area, as if searching for someone\n\nspecific.    Unlike others with business in the port, she did not\n\nenter any offices, was not carrying any documents, and repeatedly\n\nused her cell phone.     She then reentered her vehicle and left the\n\ndock area for ten to fifteen minutes.\n\n            Upon her return, she parked again, got out of her car,\n\nand sat in a chair, chatting with people passing by.            This time she\n\nremained on the dock for several hours.            While she was there, the\n\nCI placed four calls to her cell phone to establish contact and to\n\ncoordinate delivery of the box.         These calls took place at 10:30,\n\n10:50,   11:10,   and   11:26   a.m.    and   as   these   calls   were   made,\n\nsurveillance confirmed that Thomas was using her cell phone.                It\n\ntook hours to coordinate the delivery of the box to Thomas, because\n\nThomas did not want to pick up the box at the end of the pier, but\n\ninstead wanted the box delivered to her car.               Ultimately, the CI\n\narranged to have one of his employees take the box on a forklift to\n\nThomas’s car.     When the forklift operator arrived at her car,\n\nThomas got up from her chair, pointed to the side of the car,\n\nwalked in front of the forklift operator, and opened the door to\n\nthe driver’s seat.      The forklift operator placed the box in the\n\nrear seat behind the driver.\n\n            After the box was placed in her vehicle, Thomas stayed\n\nnear her car momentarily and then walked toward the LADY ROMNEY,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fanother cargo vessel.        Thomas returned to her car accompanied by\n\nanother woman, who was wearing a type of hair net commonly worn by\n\ncooks.        This woman joined Thomas approximately thirty seconds\n\nbefore Thomas began to drive out of Pier 10.         As Thomas was driving\n\nout of Pier 10, Customs agents stopped her.             After identifying\n\nhimself, Agent Ritchie Flores asked Thomas whether she had any\n\ncargo or foreign property in her vehicle.         Thomas replied that she\n\nhad a box in the rear seat that had come from Anguila.         Flores was\n\naware, however, that the wine box had originated in St. Martin and\n\nhad not traveled to Anguila.       Flores asked if he could search both\n\nthe box and Thomas; she consented.            Inside the wine box, Flores\n\ndiscovered brick-shaped packages wrapped in newspaper and covered\n\nin grease and inside these packages were bricks of heroin and\n\ncocaine base, containing 3.96 kilograms of heroin hydrocholoride\n\nand 4.922 kilograms of cocaine base.3           There was no wine in the\n\nbox.\n\n               D.   Customs Procedure\n\n               Under Customs regulations, all incoming foreign cargo\n\nmust be manifested and declared, including merchandise brought by\n\ncrew members.         To exit the port with foreign merchandise, the\n\nrecipient must proceed to Customs with the required forms and\n\nreceive clearance.       Thomas did not have any paperwork to accompany\n\nthe box of wine.\n\n               E.   Narcotics Smuggling\n\n               The value of one kilogram of heroin was $90,000 wholesale\n\n       3\n           The parties stipulated to these drug amounts at trial.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fand $270,000 retail, and the value of one kilogram of cocaine base\n\nwas $17,500 wholesale and $52,000 retail.           The range of value for\n\nthe entire shipment, therefore, was between $442,535 wholesale and\n\n$1,325,144 retail. At trial, a DEA task force member expressed the\n\nview that, because of the value of the shipment, the owner of the\n\ndrugs would only assign the job of picking up the drugs to a highly\n\ntrusted member of the drug organization.         He also testified that a\n\ndrug organization would never use a person who was unaware of what\n\nwas being transported.\n\n           F.    Jacinta Thomas’s Defense\n\n           Thomas’s defense was, in short, that the cook did it.\n\nThomas took the stand during her trial and testified that every\n\nTuesday she had gone to Pier 10 to meet the LADY ROMNEY and to pick\n\nup its cook, Claudette Henriquez.         In exchange for $100.00, Thomas\n\nwould   then    take   Henriquez   in   her   car   to   various   wholesale\n\nbusinesses in San Juan, such as Costco and Sam’s, where Henriquez\n\nwould purchase food and other supplies for the vessel.\n\n           Thomas testified that she had arrived, as usual, at Pier\n\n10 the morning of Tuesday, July 9, 2002, to pick up Henriquez.\n\nWhen she arrived, however, Jack, the captain of the LADY ROMNEY,\n\nasked her to take his girlfriend to the beauty parlor, which Thomas\n\ndid, returning shortly thereafter to pick up Henriquez.               After\n\nThomas returned to Pier 10, Henriquez asked if she could borrow\n\nThomas’s cell phone and disappeared inside the LADY ROMNEY. Thomas\n\nwaited for Henriquez to reappear and ultimately went inside the\n\nvessel to find Henriquez, who told her that she had to finish\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fcooking for the crew that day and would then be ready to leave.\n\nHenriquez also told Thomas that she had a box of liquor to take\n\nout.         Thomas replied that this would be no problem.         Thomas\n\nreturned to the dock, where she continued to wait for Henriquez.\n\nAs Thomas waited, she placed a number of calls on her cell phone,\n\nincluding to her daughter and her own clients.4\n\n                Thomas agreed that while she was waiting for Henriquez,\n\nshe received a telephone call from someone, informing her that\n\nHenriquez had asked him to call her about the box of wine and that\n\nhe needed her permission to deliver the box, since it was her car.\n\nThomas agreed, knowing that Henriquez had informed her about the\n\nwine.        This same person called a second time and told her to come\n\npick up the box; Thomas refused and instead told him to bring the\n\nwine to her vehicle.         This took some time and Thomas went back\n\ninside the LADY ROMNEY to hurry Henriquez along.            When she came\n\nout, a person had arrived at her vehicle with a forklift and the\n\nwine.        Thomas told him where to place the box.   Henriquez emerged\n\nfrom the LADY ROMNEY, got into Thomas’s car, and they both left\n\nPier 10.\n\n                As they were leaving, they were stopped by Customs\n\nAgents. Thomas immediately conceded that they had brought a box of\n\nwine from the docks and when she was asked for papers for it\n\nreplied: “[T]hey just bring me the box but they didn’t give me ...\n\nany paper or anything.”        She consented to a search of the box.\n\n                At the police station, after the Agents detained both\n\n        4\n            Thomas operates a beauty salon from her home.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fHenriquez and Thomas, Thomas informed them that she was unaware of\n\nthe contents of the box, but thought it had come from Anguila,\n\nbecause she knew that was where Henriquez was coming from.       At the\n\ntime of her arrest, Thomas had $83.00 in her pocketbook.            The\n\npolice released Henriquez that same day.      Henriquez subsequently\n\nresigned her cook’s job, left the Island, and disappeared.\n\n           G.   The Progress of the Case\n\n           On August 7, 2002, Thomas was indicted for (1) the\n\nknowing and intentional importing into the United States of heroin\n\nand cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.     §   952(a); and, (2) the\n\nknowing and intentional possession of heroin and cocaine base with\n\nthe intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\nThe case was tried before a Puerto Rican jury from July 28, 2003 to\n\nAugust 4, 2003, and the jury returned guilty verdicts on both\n\ncounts.    After Rule 29 motions were denied, Thomas filed a timely\n\nappeal on September 9, 2004.\n\n     II.         Discussion\n\n           A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Thomas’s main challenge is directed to the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence on an essential element of the offense: whether she\n\n“knowingly and intentionally” either possessed or imported illegal\n\nnarcotics into the United States.      21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), 952(a).\n\nShe strenuously argues that the sole evidence tending to establish\n\nthat she had actual knowledge that illegal narcotics were contained\n\nwithin the box marked Pink Lady is the testimony of a DEA agent to\n\nthe effect that drug smugglers do not generally entrust large\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\famounts of drugs to innocents.       She contends that even if the\n\ntestimony of the CI were credible, it is a leap too far to conclude\n\nthat Smalls, who never testified, told her that the box contained\n\nillegal drugs or that she otherwise knew or should have known that\n\nit did.   In effect, she argues that, though the evidence could\n\neasily sustain a guilty verdict if charged with aiding and abetting\n\nthe attempted smuggling of a few bottles of Pink Lady wine, it\n\ncannot sustain a verdict for smuggling large quantities of heroin\n\nand cocaine base.\n\n          While we review Rule 29 determinations de novo, we will\n\naffirm the conviction if, “after assaying all the evidence in the\n\nlight most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.”     United States v. Carucci, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785772\"><a href=\"/opinion/785772/united-states-v-michael-l-carucci-united-states-v-michael-l-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202001\"><a href=\"/opinion/202001/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v.

Our task, therefore, is not to\n\nmake an original determination as to whether Thomas possessed the\n\nrequisite knowledge but, rather, to determine whether a rational\n\njury could have found that Thomas did so.\n\n          Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fevidence against Thomas is substantial. First, the jury could have\n\nreadily believed the CI, who testified that Smalls had given not\n\nhis own, but Thomas’s telephone number to the CI, that Smalls\n\nanswered when the CI called Thomas’s number earlier that morning,\n\nthat Smalls said he was sending someone to pick up the box, that\n\nThomas was the only person who then appeared, that Thomas was the\n\nperson answering the CI’s telephone calls at Pier 10, and that she\n\ndirected the CI to have the box delivered to her car.       Indeed,\n\nThomas’s own telephone records confirmed the calls from the CI to\n\nher phone, including calls the CI had made before she arrived at\n\nPier 10.\n\n            Second, the size of this operation, exceeding $1,300,000\n\nin street value, makes it less plausible that Thomas was wholly\n\nignorant of the criminal operation.    The jury could have accepted\n\nthe DEA agent’s testimony that smuggling operations, like Smalls’s,\n\ninvolving millions of dollars do not take unnecessary risks,\n\ninstead opting for trusted and close associates, like Thomas, who\n\nare aware of the high stakes.       Therefore, the jury could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Smalls knew Thomas well enough to use her\n\ncell phone number as a contact, was present with her when the CI\n\nmade the calls, and sent her to pick up this valuable illegal\n\nshipment.\n\n            Third, Thomas was certainly aware, at the very least,\n\nthat she was sneaking something into Puerto Rico.       The box was\n\nemblazoned Pink Lady on the outside, proclaiming its purported\n\ncontents, and smugglers rarely openly advertise the true nature of\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fthe smuggled goods. Further, as opposed to the high value of\n\nnarcotics, there is no evidence that the value of the box of wine\n\njustified the considerable time and energy she expended that\n\nmorning. Under the willful blindness instruction, Thomas could “be\n\ncharged with knowledge of a fact if she deliberately closed her\n\neyes to something that otherwise would have been obvious to her.”5\n\nUnited States v. Cheal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201336\"><a href=\"/opinion/201336/united-states-v-cheal/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 n.7 (1st Cir. 2004).               Given\n\nher striking lack of curiosity as to the actual contents of the box\n\nthat       had   consumed   her   entire   morning,   the   jury   could   have\n\nrationally concluded that Thomas was at the least willfully blind\n\nto the fact that she was smuggling narcotics.\n\n                 It is true that Thomas is an unlikely drug dealer or\n\nsmuggler.        A native of St. Kitts and a twenty-seven-year resident\n\nof Puerto Rico, Thomas is a forty-four-year old single mother of\n\nnine children, ranging in ages from ten to twenty-five.                By all\n\nappearances, she is hard-working, operating a beauty parlor from\n\nher modest home and, on weekends, running a small entertainment\n\nbar, Caribbean Flavor Pub, where she serves food and liquor. There\n\nis no sign of the accumulation of any ill-gotten gains.                To the\n\ncontrary, one of the telephone calls she had received while waiting\n\n\n       5\n      Here, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that\nThomas’s “willful blindness” could satisfy the knowledge element.\nTo infer knowledge, the jury had to find first that the defendant\n“was aware of a high probability of ‘the fact in question,’ which\nin this case would be that there were controlled substances inside\nthe box that was marked ‘Pink Lady’ ... and second, that the\ndefendant consciously and deliberately avoided learning of the\nfact. That is to say, that defendant willfully made herself blind\nto the fact.” See United States v. Gabriele, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196253\"><a href=\"/opinion/196253/united-states-v-gabriele/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 n.6\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                      -11-\n\fat Pier 10 relayed the unhappy news that the electric company was\n\nthreatening to cut off service for failure to pay.                Finally, on\n\narrest, she was carrying a relatively modest sum of money.               It is\n\nalso true that there was no direct evidence that she was aware of\n\nthe contents of the box.            It is, however, within the unique\n\nprovince of the jury to sift through conflicting evidence, assess\n\nthe credibility of the witnesses, and find facts.           As the Supreme\n\nCourt stated:\n\n      A fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is\n      that “the jury is the lie detector.” Determining the\n      weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore,\n      has long been held to be the “part of every case [that]\n      belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it\n      by their natural intelligence and their practical\n      knowledge of men and the ways of men.”\n\nUnited States v.

At   trial,   Thomas   proclaimed    her   total\n\ninnocence and insisted that the entire plot was concocted by the\n\ncook.   She        maintained that she was there only to take the cook\n\nshopping and that it was the cook who duped her into transporting\n\nthe box of Pink Lady.          What may have been plausible at trial,\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fhowever, becomes untenable on appeal, once the evidence is viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to the government.     The government’s\n\nevidence establishes that Thomas was implicated to some degree with\n\nSmalls in the scheme and her protestations of absolute innocence\n\ncannot be reconciled with the weight of the collective evidence.6\n\nIf Thomas had admitted the bulk of the government’s evidence but\n\ndenied the final crucial element -- that she knew the box contained\n\nnarcotics -- her trial testimony would at least be consistent with\n\nher current legal argument.      But, once the case is cast in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government, the evidence exposes an\n\ninexplicable inconsistency between what the government proved and\n\nwhat Thomas stated under oath.    In view of this inconsistency, the\n\njury could well have found Thomas’s testimony incredible and found\n\nthat she was neither hermetically sealed from the true nature of\n\nthe criminal enterprise nor that the cook was the actual culprit.\n\nUnited States v. Soto-Beniquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784866\"><a href=\"/opinion/784866/united-states-v-william-soto-beniquez-united-states-of-america-v-juan/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(“[P]lausible credibility determinations cannot be disturbed on\n\nappeal.”).\n\n          In sum, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, a “rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential\n\nelements of the crime.”   Carucci, 364 F.3d at 343.\n\n\n     6\n      This evidence includes Smalls’s use of her cell phone number,\nher presence with Smalls when the CI made the calls earlier that\nday, her arrival as the courier promised by Smalls, the documented\ncalls from the CI to her cell phone, both before and after she\narrived at Pier 10, her unusual conduct on the Pier, and her odd\ninsistence that the box be delivered to her vehicle.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          B.   Rule 608(b)\n\n          We need not tarry long with the second issue.       Defense\n\ncounsel was aware from handling other matters that Modesto Augusto\n\nMesa, a convicted felon, had previously accused the CI of retaining\n\nfor himself part of a drug shipment in another case in which the CI\n\nhad participated as an informant.      On cross-examination, defense\n\ncounsel sought to question the CI as to whether Mesa’s accusation\n\nwas true, and the district court allowed it.           However, when\n\nquestioned about the prior bad act, the CI flatly denied it.   After\n\nthe CI’s denial, defense counsel asked leave to call Mesa as a\n\nwitness in an effort to prove that the CI was lying.     The district\n\ncourt refused permission.       Thomas contends the trial court’s\n\nrefusal violated Rule 608(b) and infringed her Sixth Amendment\n\nright of confrontation.\n\n          Thomas misses the mark.    First, the rules of evidence do\n\nnot require the admission of such extrinsic evidence.     Rule 608(b)\n\nprovides in part that “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a\n\nwitness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’\n\ncharacter for truthfulness ... may not be proved by extrinsic\n\nevidence.”   Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).     It is “well established that a\n\nparty may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by\n\ncontradiction on a collateral matter.” United States v. Beauchamp,\n\n986 F.2d 1,3 (1st Cir. 1993).   Thus, “it is often said that when a\n\nwitness testifies to a collateral matter, the examiner must take\n\n[the] answer.”   Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).     Even if\n\nthe proposed testimony was proffered to show bias rather than to\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fattack the CI’s veracity, it is nevertheless inadmissible under a\n\nRule 402 and Rule 403 analysis.               See Fed. R. Evid. 608 Advisory\n\nCommittee Note 2003 Amendment(“By limiting the application of the\n\nRule    to    proof   of   a    witness’    character     for    truthfulness,    the\n\namendment leaves the admissibility of extrinsic evidence offered\n\nfor other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior\n\ninconsistent statement, bias and mental capacity) to Rule 402 and\n\n403.”).\n\n              Second, turning to the Confrontation Clause question, in\n\nthe    post-Crawford       v.
