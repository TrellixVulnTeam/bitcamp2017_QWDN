Wernery,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n                           July 1, 2005\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This case raises one new question\n\nof immigration law: does the issuance by this court of a stay of\n\nremoval pending judicial review of a denial of asylum itself toll\n\nthe 90-day deadline established by statute for an alien to file a\n\nmotion to the BIA to reopen its prior determination?                The answer is\n\nplainly no.\n\n             In her second visit to this court,1 Sam Neang Keo Chan\n\n(\"Keo Chan\") petitions for review of the denial by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) of her motion to reconsider the denial of\n\nher motion to reopen her removal proceedings.                She had sought to\n\nreopen so that she could seek an adjustment of status based on an\n\napproved immediate relative visa stemming from her intervening\n\nmarriage to a United States citizen.             We had earlier affirmed the\n\nBIA's denial of her claims for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nSee   Chan    v.    Ashcroft,    93   Fed.     Appx.   247   (1st    Cir.   2004)\n\n(unpublished).\n\n             The BIA denied her motion to reopen and her subsequent\n\nmotion to reconsider the denial on the basis that her motion to\n\nreopen   was       not   filed   within   90    days   of    the    BIA's   final\n\nadministrative decision.           See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n\n\n1\n   Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United\nStates on February 3, 2005.     We have substituted him for John\nAshcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f             The petitioner concedes that her motion to reopen was not\n\nfiled within that 90-day period, but counters that the period was\n\ntolled when this court (with no opposition from the government)\n\nissued a stay of removal during its consideration of her earlier\n\nasylum claim.\n\n             The BIA rejected this tolling argument, holding that this\n\ncourt's order of stay of removal was not intended to toll filing\n\ndeadlines within the BIA itself as to motions to reopen.             The BIA\n\nwas entirely correct and we affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             Keo Chan, a native and citizen of Cambodia, entered the\n\nUnited States on a non-immigrant visitor visa on October 8, 1998.\n\nShe remained in the United States beyond the expiration of her 30-\n\nday   visa   and   on   January    14,    1999,   applied   for   asylum   and\n\nwithholding of removal.      After a hearing, on October 10, 2000, an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied her application and granted her\n\nvoluntary departure, but if she should fail to depart voluntarily,\n\nthe IJ ordered her removal to Cambodia.           The BIA affirmed the IJ's\n\ndenial on March 17, 2003.     Keo Chan then petitioned this court for\n\nreview of the BIA's order.        She sought a stay of removal, which the\n\ngovernment did not oppose.         On June 6, 2003, we issued an order\n\nsaying that \"deportation is stayed until the petition for judicial\n\nreview is adjudicated.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          While her petition for review was pending in this court,\n\nKeo Chan married a United States citizen on July 9, 2003.       Her\n\nhusband then filed an immediate relative visa petition on her\n\nbehalf, and the petition was approved on November 24, 2003.      On\n\nFebruary 23, 2004, she filed a motion to reopen proceedings with\n\nthe BIA in order to seek adjustment of status based on the approved\n\nimmediate relative visa petition.    On March 30, 2004, this court\n\naffirmed the BIA's and IJ's denial of her initial application for\n\nasylum, thus lifting the stay on her removal.   Chan v. Ashcroft, 93\n\nFed. Appx. 247 (1st Cir. 2004) (unpublished).\n\n          The BIA denied Keo Chan's motion to reopen on April 12,\n\n2004.   Citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), the BIA determined that a\n\nmotion to reopen the proceedings had to have been filed within 90\n\ndays after March 17, 2003, the date the final administrative order\n\nin Keo Chan's case -- the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's decision --\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fhad been entered.2      The BIA thus denied Keo Chan's motion to reopen\n\nproceedings as being \"filed out of time.\"\n\n            Keo Chan moved the BIA to reconsider, arguing that the\n\nmotion to reopen was filed on time because it had been filed while\n\nthis court's temporary stay of her removal pending review was still\n\nin effect.    The BIA denied the motion to reconsider on June 15,\n\n2004, because it considered the temporary stay was limited to the\n\nexecution    of   the   removal   order    and   did   not   toll   the   filing\n\ndeadlines for other motions such as a motion to reopen.\n\n            Keo Chan then petitioned this court for review of the\n\nBIA's denial of her motion to reconsider the denial of her motion\n\nto reopen her removal proceedings.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            This petition comes to us after the effective date for\n\nthe REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, which alters this court's\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The 90-day deadline is a statutory requirement.      8 U.S.C. §\n1229a(c)(6)(C)(i) (\"[T]he motion to reopen shall be filed within 90\ndays of the date of entry of a final administrative order of\nremoval.\"). The regulation in question provides that (except for\nlimited exceptions which Keo Chan does not argue apply to her):\n\n            [A]n alien may file only one motion to reopen\n            removal proceedings (whether before the Board\n            or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must\n            be filed no later than 90 days after the date\n            on which the final administrative decision was\n            rendered in the proceeding sought to be\n            reopened.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fstandard of review on several issues in immigration cases.                     These\n\nalterations do not apply to the issue presented here.\n\n            We review denials of motions to reconsider solely for\n\nabuse of discretion.            Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).     The BIA's decision \"must be upheld unless it was made\n\nwithout     a    rational       explanation,     inexplicably       departed    from\n\nestablished policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\" Ven v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).            Of course, a pure error of law by an\n\nagency constitutes an abuse of discretion.                   See, e.g., Radkov v.\n\nAshcroft, 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Before this court, Keo Chan's main argument is that the\n\nBIA erred as a matter of law because this court's June 6, 2003 stay\n\nof   her   deportation         tolled   \"all   action   (including     the     filing\n\ndeadlines       as    to    motions)    in   connection      with   [her]    removal\n\nproceedings.\" Keo Chan's argument implicitly concedes that but for\n\nthe purported tolling effect, the 90-day period would have run from\n\nthe date of entry of her final administrative order of removal:\n\nMarch 17, 2003.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i).          The BIA, in\n\nrejecting       Keo   Chan's     argument,     said   that   \"[t]he   stay     merely\n\nextended the effect of the [removal] order while the reviewing\n\ncourt evaluated the petition for review.\" The plain reading of the\n\ncourt's order, of course, is that it did no more than stay removal,\n\nas the BIA said.           We go on to address why we reject any notion that\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fimplicit in a stay of removal is any suspension of requirements set\n\nfor filing a motion to the BIA to reopen.\n\n             The      Illegal         Immigration           Reform        and        Immigrant\n\nResponsibility        Act     (IIRIRA),        a    1996      law,       transformed         the\n\nimmigration law landscape.              See generally Goncalves v. Reno, 144\n\nF.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999).\n\nIIRIRA transformed           motions     to    reopen       from    a    regulatory        to   a\n\nstatutory form of relief.             See Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278,\n\n1283 (9th Cir. 2005).           At the same time, the 90-day limitations\n\nperiod, subject to exceptions not relevant here, for filing a\n\nmotion   to        reopen     became      statutory.               Id.;       8     U.S.C.      §\n\n1229a(c)(6)(C)(i).\n\n           There       has     been     considerable          litigation           about     the\n\nauthority of the courts of appeals to issue two different types of\n\nplace-holding orders pending review of denials of asylum (and\n\nassociated relief).          The first is the courts' power to issue stays\n\nof removal, which, pre-IIRIRA, had been automatically granted by\n\nstatute pending the completion of judicial review.                            See Arevalo v.\n\nAshcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).                     This court has answered\n\nthat   question      in     Arevalo.          We    held,    over       the       government's\n\nobjection,    that     we    had   the    power      to     issue       stays      of   removal\n\nemploying the traditional four-part test used for preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief (as opposed to imposing a higher burden on the\n\npetitioners).         Id. at 7.          IIRIRA provides that service of a\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fpetition for      review   of    an    order    of   removal    (formerly      called\n\ndeportation) \"does not stay the removal of an alien pending the\n\ncourt's   decision    on     the      petition,      unless    the    court    orders\n\notherwise.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(3)(B). Thus, Congress contemplated\n\ncourt orders staying the removal of the alien pending judicial\n\nreview.    Congress did not contemplate that such orders would\n\nimplicitly affect the time limits which it had also set for filing\n\nmotions to reopen before the BIA.\n\n           The second type of question was whether the courts of\n\nappeals could extend a period of voluntary departure granted\n\ninitially by the agency, and, if so, whether it could do so only\n\nwhere a petitioner had moved for a stay in court before the\n\nvoluntary deportation period had expired.               See Khalil v. Ashcroft,\n\n370 F.3d 176, 180-82 (1st Cir. 2004) (Khalil II).                We noted but did\n\nnot decide these issues in Khalil II.\n\n           Both    Arevalo      and    Khalil   II    stressed       the   difference\n\nbetween the role played by the court in reviewing an agency\n\ndetermination and that played by the agency.                  A stay is \"an order\n\nintegral to a system of judicial review,\" and the concept of the\n\nstay is reflected in 8 U.S.C. § 1252, as well as Fed. R. App. P. 18\n\nand 28 U.S.C. § 2349.      Hor v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 482, 484 (7th Cir.\n\n2005).    Our decision in Arevalo discussed whether Congress had\n\nintended to curb the traditional power of courts to issue stays and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fconcluded that nothing in IIRIRA evidenced such an intent.               See\n\nArevalo, 344 F.3d at 7-8.\n\n             The petitioner seems to suggest that our holding in\n\nArevalo somehow expanded the power of the stays issued by the\n\ncourts.     Nothing in Arevalo suggests that the effect of issuing a\n\nstay   of    removal,   which     is    within   the   court's   traditional\n\njurisdiction, had in any way affected the operation of a statutory\n\nand regulatory time frame for filing motions to reopen with the\n\nagency.     Such an assumption would set up a potential conflict with\n\nCongress, a reason alone not to make the assumption.             The BIA was\n\ncorrect not to read such an assumption into this court's order.3\n\n             Our holding in Khalil II is closer to the point.         Khalil\n\nII considered the effect on legal requirements for filing of\n\nmotions to reopen when a court had reinstated a period of voluntary\n\ndeparture, after affirmance of the denial of asylum. In Khalil II,\n\nthe petitioner had first petitioned this court for review of the\n\nBIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal.           Khalil II, 370\n\nF.3d at 178.    The BIA had also granted Khalil a brief 30-day window\n\nof voluntary departure.         Id.    While his initial appeal was still\n\npending before this court, Khalil did not voluntarily depart, but\n\ninstead moved to reopen before the BIA to seek adjustment of\n\n\n3\n  Indeed, the legal separateness of the denial of the asylum claim\nand the motion to reopen is demonstrated by the fact that each is\na separate appealable order. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(6) (providing\nfor consolidation of review of petition for review of motion to\nreopen and underlying removal order).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fstatus.   Id.    He did not move this court to stay removal or toll\n\nthe running of the period for voluntary departure.    Id. at 178-79.\n\nThe BIA, citing 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), rejected the motion to reopen\n\non the grounds that Khalil was statutorily ineligible since he had\n\noverstayed his departure period.        Id. at 179.   A few months\n\nafterwards, this court decided Khalil's initial appeal and affirmed\n\nthe BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal.   See Khalil\n\nv. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2003) (Khalil I).    In that\n\ndecision, this court also reinstated, as a matter of grace, the\n\nsame brief window of voluntary departure (30 days) granted to the\n\npetitioner earlier by the BIA.    See id.\n\n           In his second petition to this court, challenging the\n\nBIA's denial of his motion to reopen, Khalil argued to us that our\n\nlater reinstatement of voluntary departure had to act retroactively\n\n(which meant that he had not overstayed), and that it did so in a\n\nway which excused him from the normal rules before the BIA for\n\neligibility for motions to reopen there.    See Khalil II, 370 F.3d\n\nat 179.   We rejected the argument, see id. at 179-80, holding that\n\nour reinstatement was only intended to apply prospectively and not\n\nretroactively.\n\n           Here, as in Khalil II, the petitioner argues that a\n\ncourt's temporary remedial order operates automatically to excuse\n\nthe alien from meeting normal legal requirements for motions to\n\nreopen before the BIA.    Here, as in Khalil II, the argument fails.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fHere, as in Khalil II, the alien overreaches and manipulates the\n\nsystem.\n\n          The main argument Keo Chan offers for her interpretation\n\nis that courts have sometimes interpreted their own remedial orders\n\nto include other related remedial orders, even if not explicitly\n\nasked for by the alien.          See, e.g., Rife v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 606,\n\n616 (8th Cir. 2004) (interpreting a request for stay of removal\n\npending appeal   as    including          a    request      for    stay    of    voluntary\n\ndeparture); Desta v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir. 2004)\n\n(same).   But there is a distinct difference between a court's\n\ndesire to cover all the bases in maintaining its ability to give\n\neffective relief      and    a    court       order   being       read    to    implicitly\n\ninterfere with an agency's running of its own affairs.4\n\n          We   note    one       factor,      which    is    that    the       BIA   is   not\n\ninsensitive to the problem of aliens who wish to be married pending\n\nadjudication of their visa petitions.                  The BIA denied Keo Chan's\n\nasylum claim on March 17, 2003.                Her motion to reopen was due on\n\nJune 16, 2003.   She did not file one.                She was married about three\n\nweeks later, on July 9, 2003.              It is reasonable to think that by\n\nthe June 16 deadline she knew that she was getting married, but she\n\nnonetheless married after the deadline. She did not move to reopen\n\n\n\n4\n   We do not reach the hypothetical of whether a court could\nexplicitly set aside an agency filing deadline if necessary to\nprovide complete relief or to preserve its jurisdiction. This case\ndoes not present that question.\n\n                                       -11-\n\funtil February 23, 2004, more than six months later.    Even if she\n\ndid not have an approved relative visa until November 24, 2003, she\n\ndoes not claim she would have been precluded from seeking to reopen\n\nbased on an earlier wedding date and a pending visa petition.\n\nIndeed, the BIA has specifically held that notwithstanding an\n\nunadjudicated visa petition filed on an alien's behalf, a motion to\n\nreopen proceedings based on a marriage entered into by the alien\n\nafter commencement of removal proceedings may still be granted.\n\nSee In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002).\n\nThis policy was motivated by IIRIRA's short 90-day deadline, the\n\nlong wait time for visa approvals, and the concern that otherwise\n\neligible aliens may thus be deprived of the chance to adjust\n\nstatus.   See id. at 255.   Keo Chan did not take advantage of this\n\npolicy.\n\n                                III.\n\n           The BIA's decision is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

She remained in the United States beyond the expiration of her 30-day visa and on January 14, 1999, applied for asylum and withholding of removal. After a hearing, on October 10, 2000, an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied her application and granted her voluntary departure, but if she should fail to depart voluntarily, the IJ ordered her removal to Cambodia. The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial on March 17, 2003. Keo Chan then petitioned this court for review of the BIA's order. She sought a stay of removal, which the government did not oppose. On June 6, 2003, we issued an order saying that \"deportation is stayed until the petition for judicial review is adjudicated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While her petition for review was pending in this court, Keo Chan married a United States citizen on July 9, 2003. Her husband then filed an immediate relative visa petition on her behalf, and the petition was approved on November 24, 2003. On February 23, 2004, she filed a motion to reopen proceedings with the BIA in order to seek adjustment of status based on the approved immediate relative visa petition. On March 30, 2004, this court affirmed the BIA's and IJ's denial of her initial application for asylum, thus lifting the stay on her removal. <i>Chan v.

Citing 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2), the BIA determined that a motion to reopen the proceedings had to have been filed within 90 days after March 17, 2003, the date the final administrative order in Keo Chan's case&#8212;the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's decision&#8212;had been entered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The BIA thus denied Keo Chan's motion to reopen proceedings as being \"filed out of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keo Chan moved the BIA to reconsider, arguing that the motion to reopen was filed on time because it had been filed while this court's temporary stay of her removal pending review was still in effect.

INS,</i> 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003). The BIA's decision \"must be upheld unless it was made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\" <i>Ven v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Of course, a pure error of law by an agency constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Radkov v. Ashcroft,</i> 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before this court, Keo Chan's main argument is that the BIA erred as a matter of law because this court's June 6, 2003 stay of her deportation tolled \"all action (including the filing deadlines as to motions) in connection with [her] removal proceedings.\" Keo Chan's argument implicitly concedes that but for the purported tolling effect, the 90-day period would have run from the date of entry of her final administrative order of removal: March 17, 2003. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i). The BIA, in rejecting Keo Chan's argument, said that \"[t]he stay merely extended the effect of the [removal] order while the reviewing court evaluated the petition for review.\" The plain reading of the court's order, of course, is that it did no more than stay removal, as the BIA said. We go on to address why we reject any notion that implicit in a stay of removal is any suspension of requirements set for filing a motion to the BIA to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), a 1996 law, transformed the immigration law landscape. <i>See generally Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 526 U.S. 1004, 119 S.Ct. 1140, 143 L.Ed.2d 208 (1999). IIRIRA transformed motions to reopen from a regulatory to a statutory form of relief. <i>See Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1278, 1283 (9th Cir. 2005). At the same time, the 90-day limitations period, subject to exceptions not relevant here, for filing a motion to reopen became statutory. <i>Id.</i>; 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has been considerable litigation about the authority of the courts of appeals to issue two different types of place-holding orders pending review of denials of asylum (and associated relief). The first is the courts' power to issue stays of removal, which, pre-IIRIRA, had been automatically granted by statute pending the completion of judicial review. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003). This court has answered that question in <i>Arevalo.</i> We held, over the government's objection, that we had the power to issue stays of removal employing the traditional four-part test used for preliminary injunctive relief (as opposed to imposing a higher burden on the petitioners). <i>Id.</i> at 7. IIRIRA provides that service of a petition for review of an order of removal (formerly called deportation) \"does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B). Thus, Congress contemplated court orders staying the removal of the alien pending judicial review. Congress did not contemplate that such orders would implicitly affect the time limits which it had also set for filing motions to reopen before the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second type of question was whether the courts of appeals could extend a period of voluntary departure granted initially by the agency, and, if so, whether it could do so only where a petitioner had moved for a stay in court before the voluntary deportation period had expired. <i>See</i> <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 370 F.3d 176, 180-82 (1st Cir.2004) (<i>Khalil II</i>). We noted but did not decide these issues in <i>Khalil II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Arevalo</i> and <i>Khalil II</i> stressed the difference between the role played by the court in reviewing an agency determination and that played by the agency. A stay is \"an order integral to a system of judicial review,\" and the concept of the stay is reflected in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, as well as Fed. R.App. P. 18 and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349. <i>Hor v. Gonzales,</i> 400 F.3d 482, 484 (7th Cir.2005). Our decision in <i>Arevalo</i> discussed whether Congress had intended to curb the traditional power of courts to issue stays and concluded that nothing in IIRIRA evidenced such an intent. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner seems to suggest that our holding in <i>Arevalo</i> somehow expanded the power of the stays issued by the courts. Nothing in <i>Arevalo</i> suggests that the effect of issuing a stay of removal, which is within the court's traditional jurisdiction, had in any way affected the operation of a statutory and regulatory time frame for filing motions to reopen with the agency. Such an assumption would set up a potential conflict with Congress, a reason alone not to make the assumption. The BIA was correct not to read such an assumption into this court's order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in <i>Khalil II</i> is closer to the point. <i>Khalil II</i> considered the effect on legal requirements for filing of motions to reopen when a court had reinstated a period of voluntary departure, after affirmance of the denial of asylum. In <i>Khalil II,</i> the petitioner had first petitioned this court for review of the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <i>Khalil II,</i> 370 F.3d at 178. The BIA had also granted Khalil a brief 30-day window of voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> While his initial appeal was still pending before this court, Khalil did not voluntarily depart, but instead moved to reopen before the BIA to seek adjustment of status. <i>Id.</i> He did not move this court to stay removal or toll the running of the period for voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> at 178-79. The BIA, citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d), rejected the motion to reopen on the grounds that Khalil was statutorily ineligible since he had overstayed his departure period. <i>Id.</i> at 179. A few months afterwards, this court decided Khalil's initial appeal and affirmed the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <i>See Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.2003) (<i>Khalil I</i>). In that decision, this court also reinstated, as a matter of grace, the same brief window of voluntary departure (30 days) granted to the petitioner earlier by the BIA. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition to this court, challenging the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen, Khalil argued to us that our later reinstatement of voluntary departure had to act retroactively (which meant that he had not overstayed), and that it did so in a way which excused him from the normal rules before the BIA for eligibility for motions to reopen there. <i>See Khalil II,</i> 370 F.3d at 179. We rejected the argument, <i>see id.</i> at 179-80, holding that our reinstatement was only intended to apply prospectively and not retroactively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the petitioner argues that a court's temporary remedial order operates automatically to excuse the alien from meeting normal legal requirements for motions to reopen before the BIA. Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the argument fails. Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the alien overreaches and manipulates the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main argument Keo Chan offers for her interpretation is that courts have sometimes interpreted their own remedial orders to include other related remedial orders, even if not explicitly asked for by the alien. <i>See, e.g., Rife v. Ashcroft,</i> 374 F.3d 606, 616 (8th Cir.2004) (interpreting a request for stay of removal pending appeal as including a request for stay of voluntary departure); <i>Desta v. Ashcroft,</i> 365 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir.2004) (same). But there is a distinct difference between a court's desire to cover all the bases in maintaining its ability to give effective relief and a court order being read to implicitly interfere with an agency's running of its own affairs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note one factor, which is that the BIA is not insensitive to the problem of aliens who wish to be married pending adjudication of their visa petitions. The BIA denied Keo Chan's asylum claim on March 17, 2003. Her motion to reopen was due on June 16, 2003. She did not file one. She was married about three weeks later, on July 9, 2003. It is reasonable to think that by the June 16 deadline she knew that she was getting married, but she nonetheless married after the deadline. She did not move to reopen until February 23, 2004, more than <i>six months</i> later. Even if she did not have an approved relative visa until November 24, 2003, she does not claim she would have been precluded from seeking to reopen based on an earlier wedding date and a pending visa petition. Indeed, the BIA has specifically held that notwithstanding an unadjudicated visa petition filed on an alien's behalf, a motion to reopen proceedings based on a marriage entered into by the alien after commencement of removal proceedings may still be granted. <i>See In re Velarde-Pacheco,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). This policy was motivated by IIRIRA's short 90-day deadline, the long wait time for visa approvals, and the concern that otherwise eligible aliens may thus be deprived of the chance to adjust status. <i>See id.</i> at 255. Keo Chan did not take advantage of this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's decision is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States on February 3, 2005.

Of course, a pure error of law by an agency constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Radkov v.

The BIA, in rejecting Keo Chan's argument, said that \"[t]he stay merely extended the effect of the [removal] order while the reviewing court evaluated the petition for review.\" The plain reading of the court's order, of course, is that it did no more than stay removal, as the BIA said. We go on to address why we reject any notion that implicit in a stay of removal is any suspension of requirements set for filing a motion to the BIA to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), a 1996 law, transformed the immigration law landscape. <i>See generally Goncalves v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197952\"><a href=\"/opinion/197952/perceira-goncalves-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></span> (1999). IIRIRA transformed motions to reopen from a regulatory to a statutory form of relief. <i>See Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788917\"><a href=\"/opinion/788917/salvador-azarte-celia-castellon-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1283 (9th Cir. 2005). At the same time, the 90-day limitations period, subject to exceptions not relevant here, for filing a motion to reopen became statutory. <i>Id.</i>; 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(6)(C)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has been considerable litigation about the authority of the courts of appeals to issue two different types of place-holding orders pending review of denials of asylum (and associated relief). The first is the courts' power to issue stays of removal, which, pre-IIRIRA, had been automatically granted by statute pending the completion of judicial review. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200622\"><a href=\"/opinion/200622/arevalo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2003). This court has answered that question in <i>Arevalo.</i> We held, over the government's objection, that we had the power to issue stays of removal employing the traditional four-part test used for preliminary injunctive relief (as opposed to imposing a higher burden on the petitioners). <i>Id.</i> at 7. IIRIRA provides that service of a petition for review of an order of removal (formerly called deportation) \"does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B). Thus, Congress contemplated court orders staying the removal of the alien pending judicial review. Congress did not contemplate that such orders would implicitly affect the time limits which it had also set for filing motions to reopen before the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second type of question was whether the courts of appeals could extend a period of voluntary departure granted initially by the agency, and, if so, whether it could do so only where a petitioner had moved for a stay in court before the voluntary deportation period had expired. <i>See</i> <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201050\"><a href=\"/opinion/201050/khalil-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 180-82 (1st Cir.2004) (<i>Khalil II</i>). We noted but did not decide these issues in <i>Khalil II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Arevalo</i> and <i>Khalil II</i> stressed the difference between the role played by the court in reviewing an agency determination and that played by the agency. A stay is \"an order integral to a system of judicial review,\" and the concept of the stay is reflected in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, as well as Fed. R.App. P. 18 and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349. <i>Hor v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789482\"><a href=\"/opinion/789482/abdelhadi-hor-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 484 (7th Cir.2005). Our decision in <i>Arevalo</i> discussed whether Congress had intended to curb the traditional power of courts to issue stays and concluded that nothing in IIRIRA evidenced such an intent. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner seems to suggest that our holding in <i>Arevalo</i> somehow expanded the power of the stays issued by the courts. Nothing in <i>Arevalo</i> suggests that the effect of issuing a stay of removal, which is within the court's traditional jurisdiction, had in any way affected the operation of a statutory and regulatory time frame for filing motions to reopen with the agency. Such an assumption would set up a potential conflict with Congress, a reason alone not to make the assumption. The BIA was correct not to read such an assumption into this court's order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in <i>Khalil II</i> is closer to the point. <i>Khalil II</i> considered the effect on legal requirements for filing of motions to reopen when a court had reinstated a period of voluntary departure, after affirmance of the denial of asylum. In <i>Khalil II,</i> the petitioner had first petitioned this court for review of the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <i>Khalil II,</i> 370 F.3d at 178. The BIA had also granted Khalil a brief 30-day window of voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> While his initial appeal was still pending before this court, Khalil did not voluntarily depart, but instead moved to reopen before the BIA to seek adjustment of status. <i>Id.</i> He did not move this court to stay removal or toll the running of the period for voluntary departure. <i>Id.</i> at 178-79. The BIA, citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(d), rejected the motion to reopen on the grounds that Khalil was statutorily ineligible since he had overstayed his departure period. <i>Id.</i> at 179. A few months afterwards, this court decided Khalil's initial appeal and affirmed the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <i>See Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2003) (<i>Khalil I</i>). In that decision, this court also reinstated, as a matter of grace, the same brief window of voluntary departure (30 days) granted to the petitioner earlier by the BIA. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second petition to this court, challenging the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen, Khalil argued to us that our later reinstatement of voluntary departure had to act retroactively (which meant that he had not overstayed), and that it did so in a way which excused him from the normal rules before the BIA for eligibility for motions to reopen there. <i>See Khalil II,</i> 370 F.3d at 179. We rejected the argument, <i>see id.</i> at 179-80, holding that our reinstatement was only intended to apply prospectively and not retroactively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the petitioner argues that a court's temporary remedial order operates automatically to excuse the alien from meeting normal legal requirements for motions to reopen before the BIA. Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the argument fails. Here, as in <i>Khalil II,</i> the alien overreaches and manipulates the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main argument Keo Chan offers for her interpretation is that courts have sometimes interpreted their own remedial orders to include other related remedial orders, even if not explicitly asked for by the alien. <i>See, e.g., Rife v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786841\"><a href=\"/opinion/786841/alex-nicolay-rife-yulia-rife-yola-rife-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 616 (8th Cir.2004) (interpreting a request for stay of removal pending appeal as including a request for stay of voluntary departure); <i>Desta v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785908\"><a href=\"/opinion/785908/tilahun-fantaye-desta-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 749 (9th Cir.2004) (same). But there is a distinct difference between a court's desire to cover all the bases in maintaining its ability to give effective relief and a court order being read to implicitly interfere with an agency's running of its own affairs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note one factor, which is that the BIA is not insensitive to the problem of aliens who wish to be married pending adjudication of their visa petitions. The BIA denied Keo Chan's asylum claim on March 17, 2003. Her motion to reopen was due on June 16, 2003. She did not file one. She was married about three weeks later, on July 9, 2003. It is reasonable to think that by the June 16 deadline she knew that she was getting married, but she nonetheless married after the deadline. She did not move to reopen until February 23, 2004, more than <i>six months</i> later. Even if she did not have an approved relative visa until November 24, 2003, she does not claim she would have been precluded from seeking to reopen based on an earlier wedding date and a pending visa petition. Indeed, the BIA has specifically held that notwithstanding an unadjudicated visa petition filed on an alien's behalf, a motion to reopen proceedings based on a marriage entered into by the alien after commencement of removal proceedings may still be granted. <i>See In re Velarde-Pacheco,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). This policy was motivated by IIRIRA's short 90-day deadline, the long wait time for visa approvals, and the concern that otherwise eligible aliens may thus be deprived of the chance to adjust status. <i>See id.</i> at 255. Keo Chan did not take advantage of this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's decision is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States on February 3, 2005.
