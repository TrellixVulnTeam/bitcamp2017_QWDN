Plaintiff Eric Sarsfield\n\nappeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant Great American Insurance Company of New York.                       The\n\ndistrict court found that Sarsfield’s complaint against the City in\n\nthe underlying action did not allege a wrongful act during the\n\npolicy period, and therefore Great American did not have a duty to\n\ndefend or indemnify.          Sarsfield appeals the grant of summary\n\njudgment.    For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            Sarsfield was convicted of rape in 1987 and served almost\n\nten years in prison.          In 2000, he was exonerated based on DNA\n\nevidence.     He then sued the City of Marlborough, Massachusetts,\n\nand several of its employees for federal civil rights and state law\n\nclaims arising out of his arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment.\n\nReading     the   complaint    as   a    whole,      including     the   detailed\n\nallegations of the individual counts, a reasonable reader would\n\nconclude that Sarsfield was complaining about two different forms\n\nof misconduct by the police:\n\n            First, that the police engaged in a highly suggestive\n\nidentification process that coerced the victim of the rape to\n\nidentify Sarsfield as her rapist.             Compounding matters, the police\n\ndid   not   disclose   in   connection        with   the   trial   the   victim’s\n\nhesitancy in identifying Sarsfield, nor the measures taken by the\n\npolice department to make it appear to the victim that Sarsfield\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwas the rapist (including requiring Sarsfield to wear the rapist’s\n\njacket during a one-on-one identification).\n\n           Second, that one of the police officers drafted a police\n\nreport   that   falsely    stated   that   Sarsfield    had    made   several\n\nincriminating statements.       The report “turned up” only three days\n\nbefore trial, but the only issue before the trial judge was its\n\ntiming, not its veracity.       It appears that the report was entered\n\ninto evidence with the police officer testifying to its contents at\n\ntrial as a rebuttal witness to Sarsfield.\n\n           In   response   to   Sarfield’s   suit,     the    City   requested\n\ncoverage from Great American, which had issued to the City one-year\n\ngeneral liability policies from 1991-2000.           Great American denied\n\nthe request, and the City entered into a settlement with Sarsfield.\n\nIt stipulated the City’s liability, provided for a $2 million\n\nsettlement payment, and assigned to Sarsfield its right to recover\n\ndefense costs, the settlement payment, and any other recoverable\n\ncosts, expenses, damages, fees and penalties.\n\n           The district court held a bench trial on damages, entered\n\nfinal judgment against the City pursuant to the stipulation, and\n\nawarded Sarsfield approximately $13 million in damages.              Sarsfield\n\nsought to recover the portion of the judgment allocated for the\n\ntime period after July 1, 1991 ($11,615,940), plus attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs for the underlying suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nSarsfield asserted that Great American breached its duty owed to\n\nthe   City   by    not   defending       and       indemnifying      the     City    in    the\n\nunderlying suit.         Great American asserted that it had no duty to\n\ndefend or indemnify.           The district court denied Sarsfield’s motion\n\nand   granted      Great       American’s      motion        for    summary       judgment,\n\nconcluding that Great American did not have a duty to defend or\n\nindemnify the City.\n\n                                             II.\n\n             “We    review     de    novo    the     grant    or    denial    of     summary\n\njudgment, as well as pure issues of law.”                    Rodriguez v.

We have described the\n\nanalytical framework for duty-to-defend cases:\n\n     [T]he question of the initial duty of a liability insurer\n     to defend third-party actions against the insured is\n     decided by matching the third-party complaint with the\n     policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint\n     are “reasonably susceptible” of an interpretation that\n     they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy\n     terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\n\nHerbert   A.

Co., 568 N.E.2d 631, 633 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1991).\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Sarsfield bases his claim for insurance coverage upon the\n\nLaw Enforcement Liability (“LEL policy”) coverage included in the\n\ngeneral liability policies from 1991 through 2000, specifically\n\nrelying on the policy which became effective on July 1, 1992.                  The\n\npolicies contained the following relevant language:\n\n\n     We will pay those sums that the Insured becomes legally\n     obligated to pay as damages because of “wrongful act(s)”\n     which result in:\n\n     1. personal injury;\n     2. bodily injury;\n     3. property damage;\n\n                                     -5-\n\f    caused by an “occurrence” and arising out of the\n    performance of the Insured’s duties to provide law\n    enforcement activities. This insurance applies to\n    “wrongful act(s)” which occurs in the “coverage\n    territory” and during the policy period.\n\n    We will have the right and duty to defend any “suit”\n    seeking those damages.\n    . . . .\n    1. “Bodily Injury” means bodily injury, sickness or\n    disease sustained by a person, including death resulting\n    from any of these at any time.\n    . . . .\n    3. “Occurrence” means an event, including continuous or\n    repeated exposure to substantially the same general\n    harmful conditions.\n    4. “Personal Injury” means injury, other than “bodily\n    injury,” arising out of one or more of the following\n    offenses:\n    . . .\n          c. false arrest, detention or imprisonment;\n          d. malicious prosecution;\n          . . .\n          f. humiliation or mental distress;\n          . . .\n          i. violation of civil rights protected under 42 USC\n          1981 ET sequential\n          [sic] or state law;\n    . . . .\n    7. “Wrongful Act(s)” means any or all of the following:\n          a. actual or alleged errors;\n          b. misstatement or misleading statement;\n          c. act or omission; or\n          d. negligent act or breach of duty;\n          by any Insured while performing law enforcement\n          duties.\n\n\n         Sarsfield argues that the “wrongful acts” occurring after\n\n1992 were the City police officers’ conduct in affirmatively\n\ncovering up and failing to turn over exculpatory evidence once\n\nSarsfield was in prison.   As to the “personal injury,” he argues\n\nthat the injuries were non-bodily injuries that arose out of the\n\n\n                               -6-\n\foffenses of denial of parole, denial of access to courts for\n\npost-conviction relief, and having to register as a sex offender.\n\nGreat American argues that the “wrongful acts” at issue here are\n\nthe   arrest,   malicious   prosecution,   and     false    imprisonment      of\n\nSarsfield, and since these all occurred before the policy became\n\neffective, they do not trigger coverage.         It asserts that there is\n\nno covered injury because all of the alleged injuries arise out of\n\noffenses, including malicious prosecution and false arrest, which\n\noccurred before 1992.\n\n           The district court first found that Sarsfield’s complaint\n\ndid not allege any wrongful act that occurred after 1992.              It said\n\nthe only two claims Sarsfield asserted in his complaint that\n\nrelated to the officers’ ongoing concealment were the claim for\n\nsuppression of exculpatory evidence and conspiracy to violate his\n\nconstitutional    rights.     It   found   these    to    be    wrongful    acts\n\noccurring before the policy period because these claims were\n\npresented as the officers’ concealment from the prosecutor, and\n\ntherefore the wrongful acts ended before Sarsfield was incarcerated\n\nand the policy period began.\n\n           Next, the district court assumed, arguendo, that the\n\ncomplaint alleged wrongful acts based on the officers’ violation of\n\na continuing duty to disclose their misconduct.            Even if this were\n\nsufficient, it found that the injuries resulting therefrom were not\n\ndistinct   from    the   injuries    incurred      upon        conviction    and\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fimprisonment. Further, it found that even if the concealment could\n\nbe said to cause a distinct injury, because it first occurred prior\n\nto the policy period, any resulting injury would predate the\n\npolicy.    Finally, the court considered whether the concealment\n\ncould result in a “continuing injury” and found that it could not\n\nbe framed this way because theories of continuing injury only apply\n\nin tort cases which concern injuries which may have existed but\n\nwere unknown at the time the insured purchased insurance.1\n\n               Because we find that the complaint itself failed to\n\nallege wrongful acts occurring within the policy period, we affirm\n\nthe district court’s holding only to the extent it rested on this\n\nground.    Finding this sufficient, we do not reach the parties’\n\narguments relating to that holding.\n\n               The   policy   states   that   the   insurance   “applies   to\n\n‘wrongful act(s)’ which occurs . . . during the policy period.”\n\nThis language supports Great American’s argument that this is an\n\n“occurrence policy,” as opposed to a “claims made” policy, as\n\nargued    by    Sarsfield.      “An    ‘occurrence’   policy    protects   the\n\npolicyholder from liability for any act done while the policy is in\n\neffect, whereas a ‘claims made’ policy protects the holder only\n\nagainst claims made during the life of the policy.”             St. Paul Fire\n\n& Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 535 (1978) (citing Barry\n\n\n\n     1\n       On appeal, Sarsfield explicitly states he does not make a\n“continuing injury” argument.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fv. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 555 F.2d 3, 5 n. 1 (1st Cir.\n\n1977)). Therefore, in order for Sarsfield to succeed, he must show\n\nthat his complaint is “reasonably susceptible” of an interpretation\n\nthat it describes a “wrongful act” that occurred after 1992, when\n\ncoverage began.\n\n          The provision of the complaint relied on by Sarsfield to\n\nshow he sufficiently alleged a “wrongful act” occurring during the\n\ncoverage period is paragraph 53 of his third amended complaint:\n\n     Throughout each year of Mr. Sarsfield’s decade of\n     imprisonment, and indeed in each year of Mr. Sarsfield’s\n     subsequent parole and after his exoneration, [the\n     defendant police officers] continued to cover up their\n     misconduct, including that they had used unduly\n     suggestive identification procedures with [the rape\n     victim], fabricated evidence and testified falsely at Mr.\n     Sarsfield’s criminal trial. During each day that passes\n     during which defendants refuse to come forward, they\n     violate their ongoing duties to Mr. Sarsfield and cause\n     him continued suffering. Indeed, to date none of these\n     defendants   had   admitted   the   truth   about   their\n     misconduct.2\n\n          As   the   district   court   found,   the   only   concealment\n\nspecifically discussed was tied to concealment from the prosecutor.\n\nThe clause stating that the defendants “continued to cover up their\n\nmisconduct” (the “misconduct” being further described as including\n\nthe suggestive identification, fabrication of evidence and false\n\n\n     2\n       Paragraph 53 was a statement in the “Facts” section of the\ncomplaint, and each count started off with a statement\nincorporating “all of the foregoing,” yet nowhere in the “Counts”\nlisted   does  Sarsfield   specifically   discuss  this   ongoing\nconcealment. Each count re-enumerated the relevant facts to the\nclaim specifically, and no count included any facts specifically\nshowing ongoing concealment.\n\n                                  -9-\n\ftestimony at the trial) is not enough to allege a “wrongful act”\n\noccurring during the coverage period. Therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat Great American, acting as “an objectively reasonable insured,\n\nreading the relevant policy language,” would expect these alleged\n\n“wrongful acts” to be covered.     See Hazen Paper Co. v. United\n\nStates Fid. & Guar. Co., 55 N.E.2d 576 (Mass. 1993).\n\n                            IV.\n\n          In sum, Great American had no duty to defend or\n\nindemnify the City for Sarsfield’s cause of action.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -10-\n\f",

Sarsfield\n\nsought to recover the portion of the judgment allocated for the\n\ntime period after July 1, 1991 ($11,615,940), plus attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs for the underlying suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nSarsfield asserted that Great American breached its duty owed to\n\nthe   City   by    not   defending       and       indemnifying      the     City    in    the\n\nunderlying suit.         Great American asserted that it had no duty to\n\ndefend or indemnify.           The district court denied Sarsfield’s motion\n\nand   granted      Great       American’s      motion        for    summary       judgment,\n\nconcluding that Great American did not have a duty to defend or\n\nindemnify the City.\n\n                                             II.\n\n             “We    review     de    novo    the     grant    or    denial    of     summary\n\njudgment, as well as pure issues of law.”                    Rodriguez v.

The\n\npolicies contained the following relevant language:\n\n\n     We will pay those sums that the Insured becomes legally\n     obligated to pay as damages because of “wrongful act(s)”\n     which result in:\n\n     1. personal injury;\n     2. bodily injury;\n     3. property damage;\n\n                                     -5-\n\f    caused by an “occurrence” and arising out of the\n    performance of the Insured’s duties to provide law\n    enforcement activities. This insurance applies to\n    “wrongful act(s)” which occurs in the “coverage\n    territory” and during the policy period.\n\n    We will have the right and duty to defend any “suit”\n    seeking those damages.\n    . . . .\n    1. “Bodily Injury” means bodily injury, sickness or\n    disease sustained by a person, including death resulting\n    from any of these at any time.\n    . . . .\n    3. “Occurrence” means an event, including continuous or\n    repeated exposure to substantially the same general\n    harmful conditions.\n    4. “Personal Injury” means injury, other than “bodily\n    injury,” arising out of one or more of the following\n    offenses:\n    . . .\n          c. false arrest, detention or imprisonment;\n          d. malicious prosecution;\n          . . .\n          f. humiliation or mental distress;\n          . . .\n          i. violation of civil rights protected under 42 USC\n          1981 ET sequential\n          [sic] or state law;\n    . . . .\n    7. “Wrongful Act(s)” means any or all of the following:\n          a. actual or alleged errors;\n          b. misstatement or misleading statement;\n          c. act or omission; or\n          d. negligent act or breach of duty;\n          by any Insured while performing law enforcement\n          duties.\n\n\n         Sarsfield argues that the “wrongful acts” occurring after\n\n1992 were the City police officers’ conduct in affirmatively\n\ncovering up and failing to turn over exculpatory evidence once\n\nSarsfield was in prison.   As to the “personal injury,” he argues\n\nthat the injuries were non-bodily injuries that arose out of the\n\n\n                               -6-\n\foffenses of denial of parole, denial of access to courts for\n\npost-conviction relief, and having to register as a sex offender.\n\nGreat American argues that the “wrongful acts” at issue here are\n\nthe   arrest,   malicious   prosecution,   and     false    imprisonment      of\n\nSarsfield, and since these all occurred before the policy became\n\neffective, they do not trigger coverage.         It asserts that there is\n\nno covered injury because all of the alleged injuries arise out of\n\noffenses, including malicious prosecution and false arrest, which\n\noccurred before 1992.\n\n           The district court first found that Sarsfield’s complaint\n\ndid not allege any wrongful act that occurred after 1992.              It said\n\nthe only two claims Sarsfield asserted in his complaint that\n\nrelated to the officers’ ongoing concealment were the claim for\n\nsuppression of exculpatory evidence and conspiracy to violate his\n\nconstitutional    rights.     It   found   these    to    be    wrongful    acts\n\noccurring before the policy period because these claims were\n\npresented as the officers’ concealment from the prosecutor, and\n\ntherefore the wrongful acts ended before Sarsfield was incarcerated\n\nand the policy period began.\n\n           Next, the district court assumed, arguendo, that the\n\ncomplaint alleged wrongful acts based on the officers’ violation of\n\na continuing duty to disclose their misconduct.            Even if this were\n\nsufficient, it found that the injuries resulting therefrom were not\n\ndistinct   from    the   injuries    incurred      upon        conviction    and\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fimprisonment. Further, it found that even if the concealment could\n\nbe said to cause a distinct injury, because it first occurred prior\n\nto the policy period, any resulting injury would predate the\n\npolicy.    Finally, the court considered whether the concealment\n\ncould result in a “continuing injury” and found that it could not\n\nbe framed this way because theories of continuing injury only apply\n\nin tort cases which concern injuries which may have existed but\n\nwere unknown at the time the insured purchased insurance.1\n\n               Because we find that the complaint itself failed to\n\nallege wrongful acts occurring within the policy period, we affirm\n\nthe district court’s holding only to the extent it rested on this\n\nground.    Finding this sufficient, we do not reach the parties’\n\narguments relating to that holding.\n\n               The   policy   states   that   the   insurance   “applies   to\n\n‘wrongful act(s)’ which occurs . . . during the policy period.”\n\nThis language supports Great American’s argument that this is an\n\n“occurrence policy,” as opposed to a “claims made” policy, as\n\nargued    by    Sarsfield.      “An    ‘occurrence’   policy    protects   the\n\npolicyholder from liability for any act done while the policy is in\n\neffect, whereas a ‘claims made’ policy protects the holder only\n\nagainst claims made during the life of the policy.”             St. Paul Fire\n\n& Marine Ins.

Therefore, in order for Sarsfield to succeed, he must show\n\nthat his complaint is “reasonably susceptible” of an interpretation\n\nthat it describes a “wrongful act” that occurred after 1992, when\n\ncoverage began.\n\n          The provision of the complaint relied on by Sarsfield to\n\nshow he sufficiently alleged a “wrongful act” occurring during the\n\ncoverage period is paragraph 53 of his third amended complaint:\n\n     Throughout each year of Mr. Sarsfield’s decade of\n     imprisonment, and indeed in each year of Mr. Sarsfield’s\n     subsequent parole and after his exoneration, [the\n     defendant police officers] continued to cover up their\n     misconduct, including that they had used unduly\n     suggestive identification procedures with [the rape\n     victim], fabricated evidence and testified falsely at Mr.\n     Sarsfield’s criminal trial. During each day that passes\n     during which defendants refuse to come forward, they\n     violate their ongoing duties to Mr. Sarsfield and cause\n     him continued suffering. Indeed, to date none of these\n     defendants   had   admitted   the   truth   about   their\n     misconduct.2\n\n          As   the   district   court   found,   the   only   concealment\n\nspecifically discussed was tied to concealment from the prosecutor.\n\nThe clause stating that the defendants “continued to cover up their\n\nmisconduct” (the “misconduct” being further described as including\n\nthe suggestive identification, fabrication of evidence and false\n\n\n     2\n       Paragraph 53 was a statement in the “Facts” section of the\ncomplaint, and each count started off with a statement\nincorporating “all of the foregoing,” yet nowhere in the “Counts”\nlisted   does  Sarsfield   specifically   discuss  this   ongoing\nconcealment. Each count re-enumerated the relevant facts to the\nclaim specifically, and no count included any facts specifically\nshowing ongoing concealment.\n\n                                  -9-\n\ftestimony at the trial) is not enough to allege a “wrongful act”\n\noccurring during the coverage period. Therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat Great American, acting as “an objectively reasonable insured,\n\nreading the relevant policy language,” would expect these alleged\n\n“wrongful acts” to be covered.
