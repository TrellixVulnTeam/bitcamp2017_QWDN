It was in evidence that the plaintiffs' car, driven by Hildegarde Wiedenroth Wise, was proceeding along a public highway near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, when she had occasion to turn off the highway on a rather narrow private road on the right. To give warning of an impending right turn, she put on her direction signal. In order to turn into the private road, she first had to swing her car slightly to the left, before turning to the right. When the front of her car had about entered the private road, the car was struck broadside on the right rear by an automobile, coming from behind, driven by the defendant Welton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried by the judge without a jury.
