Horving    Ramos-Santiago\n\n(\"Ramos\") was a driver with the United Parcel Service (\"UPS\") when\n\nhe failed to deliver thirty-seven packages over the span of two\n\nbusiness days in 2003.         For this incident, UPS terminated his\n\nemployment and Ramos, through his union representative, filed a\n\ngrievance challenging the termination. Pursuant to the controlling\n\ncollective-bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), Ramos's grievance was\n\nsubmitted to arbitration.      The arbitrator found that under Article\n\n11, § 3 of the CBA, UPS was justified in terminating him.             Ramos\n\nnow seeks judicial review.      Applying the high degree of deference\n\ngenerally accorded arbitral decisions, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment enforcing the arbitration award.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           As this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we\n\nrecite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant,\n\nRamos, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.           Franceschi\n\nv. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 514 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nPetitioner Ramos had been a UPS employee for the past twelve years,\n\nmost recently as a driver.       He is a member of the International\n\nBrotherhood of Teamsters (\"Union\"), which, along with UPS, is party\n\nto a CBA; the CBA outlines the procedure to be followed in carrying\n\nout   disciplinary   actions    against   union   members.      On   Friday,\n\nJanuary 24, and Monday, January 27, 2003, Ramos failed to deliver\n\nthirty-seven packages to Centro Médico, a medical institution in\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fRío Piedras, Puerto Rico.1          As a result, UPS terminated Ramos's\n\nemployment pursuant to Article 11, § 3 of the CBA.2           The Union then\n\nfiled a grievance challenging Ramos's discharge, arguing that UPS\n\nhad failed to follow the disciplinary procedure mandated by the\n\nCBA, which requires the application of progressive discipline\n\nbefore    a   final    dismissal.     The   grievance   was   submitted    to\n\narbitration.\n\n              The arbitrator assigned to adjudicate Ramos's grievance\n\nheld     hearings     at   the   Puerto   Rico   Department   of   Labor   on\n\nSeptember 29, 2003, and August 13, 2004.          At these hearings, Ramos\n\nstated that he had engaged in an \"error of judgment\" when he \"made\n\nthe decision\" not to deliver the packages to Centro Médico.            After\n\nreviewing the evidence, the arbitrator held in favor of UPS,\n\nfinding that the failure to deliver the packages was \"not about\n\nmere negligence nor failure of procedures,\" but was instead a\n\n\"deliberate action.\"        As such, Ramos had violated Article 11, § 3\n\nof the CBA and UPS had properly terminated his employment.\n\n              Thereafter, Ramos filed a complaint in Puerto Rico state\n\ncourt challenging the arbitrator's decision.          UPS promptly removed\n\n\n\n1\n   Ramos failed to deliver fifteen packages on Friday, and those\nsame fifteen packages plus seven additional ones on Monday.\n2\n  Article 11, § 3 reads: \"The Company can suspend or discharge any\ndelegate or employee who declares an unauthorized strike, work\nstoppage, slowdown, walk out or who takes any other action that\nparalyzes, obstructs, or interrupts the operations of the Company\nwithout resorting to the grievance procedure.\"\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe case to the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nbased on jurisdiction granted by § 301 of the Labor Management\n\nRelations Act. 29 U.S.C. § 185(a) (2000).   On August 7, 2006, UPS\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment, which Ramos opposed. The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion on October 2, 2006, finding that\n\nthe arbitral award was a plausible interpretation of the CBA.\n\nSubsequently, the district court granted UPS's request for costs on\n\nNovember 2, 2006. Ramos now appeals the district court's decision,\n\nas well as its award of costs.\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\n          A. Arbitration Award\n\n                 1. Standard of Review\n\n          We review a district court's decision to vacate or\n\nconfirm an arbitration award de novo.    Cytic Corp. v. DEKA Prods.\n\nLtd. P'ship, 439 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2006).    A federal court's\n\nreview of an arbitrator's decision, however, is \"'extremely narrow\n\nand exceedingly deferential.'\"   Airline Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v. Pan\n\nAm. Airways Corp., 405 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Bull HN\n\nInfo. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir. 2000));\n\nFirst State Ins. Co. v. Banco de Seguros del Estado, 254 F.3d 354,\n\n357 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Wheelabrator Envirotech Operating\n\nServs. Inc. v. Mass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144, 88 F.3d 40,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1996)).   Indeed, it is \"among the narrowest known in\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthe law.\" Maine Cent. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Maint. of Way Employees,\n\n873 F.2d 425, 428 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           When parties include an arbitration clause in their\n\ncollective-bargaining agreement, they are choosing to forego a\n\nnumber of legal options in favor of having their disputes regarding\n\nthe construction of that contract settled by an arbitrator.            As\n\nthis was the bargain the parties struck, they are bound by the\n\narbitrator's decision.     See Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local\n\n170, 247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).       In the spirit of freedom of\n\ncontract then, we cannot review the merits of the underlying\n\ndispute and are obligated to enforce the arbitral award unless the\n\ndecision   fails   to   \"draw[]   its    essence   from   the   collective\n\nbargaining agreement.\"     See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter.\n\nWheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960);        accord Kraft Foods,\n\nInc. v. Office & Prof. Employees Int'l Union, Local 1295, 203 F.3d\n\n98, 100 (1st Cir. 2000).      Though we may be convinced that the\n\narbitrator committed a serious error, if she is \"even arguably\n\nconstruing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of\n\nhis authority,\" we may not overturn the arbitrator's decision.\n\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38\n\n(1987).\n\n                   2. Review of the Arbitration Award\n\n           This Court has recognized a very limited exception under\n\nwhich we may vacate an arbitration award when there is evidence\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthat the arbitrator acted in \"manifest disregard of the law.\"\n\nWonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Autotote Sys., Inc., 274 F.3d\n\n34, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).        To establish such an exception, the\n\nchallenger must show that the arbitration award complained of is:\n\n(1) unfounded in reason and fact; (2) based on reasoning so\n\npalpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, could ever\n\nconceivably have made such a ruling; or (3) mistakenly based on a\n\ncrucial assumption that is concededly a non-fact.              McCarthy v.\n\nCitigroup Global Mkts., Inc., 463 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 2006).          To\n\nsucceed, there must be \"some showing in the record, other than the\n\nresult obtained, that the arbitrator[] knew the law and expressly\n\ndisregarded it.\"   Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (quoting O.R. Secs., Inc. v. Prof'l Planning Assoc., Inc.,\n\n857 F.2d 742, 747 (11th Cir. 1988)).3\n\n            Ramos argues that this is the type of extraordinary case\n\nthat warrants our vacating the arbitral decision because the\n\narbitrator who issued it acted in manifest disregard of the law by\n\nknowingly   applying   the   wrong   provision   of   the   CBA.   Ramos's\n\n\n3\n  We acknowledge the Supreme Court's recent holding in Hall Street\nAssocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., No. 06-989, 2008 WL 762537, at *4-\n5 (March 25, 2008), that manifest disregard of the law is not a\nvalid ground for vacating or modifying an arbitral award in cases\nbrought under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"). Because the\ncase at hand is not an FAA case -- neither party has invoked the\nFAA's expedited review provisions, and the original complaint was\nfiled in Puerto Rico state court under a mechanism provided by\nstate law -- we decline to reach the question of whether Hall\nStreet precludes a manifest disregard inquiry in this setting.\nWhether or not Hall Street applies, Ramos's claim fails.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fargument is unavailing.   UPS terminated Ramos's employment under\n\nArticle 11, § 3 of the CBA, which by its text allows for the\n\nsummary discharge or suspension of an employee who declares \"an\n\nauthorized strike, work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or . . . other\n\naction that paralyzes, obstructs or interrupts the operations of\n\nthe Company.\" The arbitrator properly found that Ramos's dismissal\n\nwas justified under this provision.\n\n          Ramos argues that his actions cannot be characterized as\n\na strike, work stoppage, slowdown or walkout for the sole reason\n\nthat he did not engage in any concerted activity with other\n\nemployees.   While Ramos is correct that the existence of a strike\n\nrequires concerted action, see 29 U.S.C. § 142 (2000), this Court\n\nhas stated that concerted action may be carried out by a single\n\nemployee under certain circumstances.   Five Star Transp. v. NLRB,\n\nNo. 07-1316, 2008 WL 839758, at *4 (1st Cir. Mar. 31, 2008)\n\n(holding that the critical inquiry in determining whether action by\n\na single employee constitutes concerted activity is whether such\n\naction is in furtherance of a group concern).   More to the point,\n\nthe very text of Article 11, § 3 contemplates actions carried out\n\nby \"any employee or delegate,\" and does not institute a group\n\naction requirement.   Thus, though concerted action does not by\n\nitself constitute a strike, the fact that Ramos acted alone does\n\nnot render the application of Article 11, § 3 improper.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f           Furthermore, the fact that Ramos delivered packages other\n\nthan those scheduled for delivery at Centro Médico on the Friday\n\nand Monday in question does not make his discharge under Article\n\n11, § 3 unwarranted.     Ramos's decision to not deliver the thirty-\n\nseven packages on the assigned days clearly obstructed and/or\n\ninterrupted UPS's operations in contravention of Article 11, § 3.\n\nAs developed in arbitration, UPS's regular mode of operation is\n\nthat packages be delivered to the recipient on the day they are\n\nsent out from the UPS processing center for delivery.          Even if it\n\nis understood that some low number of packages might miss their\n\ndelivery date due to extenuating circumstances, that that number\n\nshould be as high as thirty-seven is clearly a departure from the\n\nnorm.\n\n           Based   on   Ramos's   admission   during   arbitration,    the\n\narbitrator found that this departure from UPS's normal operations\n\nwas caused by Ramos's conscious decision to not deliver the thirty-\n\nseven   packages   to   Centro    Médico.     As   such,   Ramos's   action\n\nobstructed and/or interrupted UPS's operations and the arbitrator's\n\ndecision is a plausible construction of Article 11, § 3.             It is\n\nalso clear that the arbitrator's decision draws its essence from\n\nthe CBA.   Because the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard\n\nof the law, and her opinion is supported in reason and fact and is\n\nnot based on faulty reasoning or a crucial assumption that is\n\nconcededly a non-fact, the arbitral award is allowed to stand.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           B. Bill of Costs\n\n                    1. Standard of Review\n\n           We ordinarily review a district court's award of costs\n\nfor abuse of discretion.      In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\n\nLit., 111 F.3d 220, 228 (1st Cir. 1997); see also García-Goyco v.\n\nLaw Envtl. Consultants, Inc., 428 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2005).         In\n\ndoing so, we remember that an award of costs is the type of\n\ndiscretionary   ruling   to   which   appellate   courts    should   give\n\n\"'virtually complete'\" deference.       Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire, 111\n\nF.3d at 228 (quoting Estate of Borst v. O'Brien, 979 F.2d 511, 517\n\n(7th Cir. 1992)).\n\n                    2. Review of the Award of Costs\n\n           Ramos alleges that the district court erred in awarding\n\nUPS litigation costs because it did so before the ten-day period to\n\nfile an objection to a bill of costs had run out.          See D.P.R. R.\n\n54(b).   Specifically, UPS filed its brief in support of its bill of\n\ncosts on October 24, 2006, and the district court granted its award\n\nof costs within the ten-day period on November 2, 2006.        Yet Ramos\n\nnever filed his objection to the bill of costs either before or\n\nafter it was awarded.    As such, and according to the text of Puerto\n\nRico Local Rule 54(b), Ramos has waived his objection.                Id.\n\n(\"Unless within ten (10) days after the filing of a bill of costs\n\nthe opposing party files a written objection thereto, incorporating\n\na memorandum of law, the opposing party shall be deemed to have\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fwaived objection and the Clerk shall tax the costs which appear\n\nproperly claimed.\"\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment enforcing the arbitration award is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 514 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir.2008). Petitioner Ramos had been a UPS employee for the past twelve years, most recently as a driver. He is a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"Union\"), which, along with UPS, is party to a CBA; the CBA outlines the procedure to be followed in carrying out disciplinary actions against union members. On Friday, January 24, and Monday, January 27, 2003, Ramos failed to deliver thirty-seven packages to Centro Médico, a medical institution in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.<sup>[1]</sup> As a result, UPS terminated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> Ramos's employment pursuant to Article 11, § 3 of the CBA.<sup>[2]</sup> The Union then filed a grievance challenging Ramos's discharge, arguing that UPS had failed to follow the disciplinary procedure mandated by the CBA, which requires the application of progressive discipline before a final dismissal. The grievance was submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator assigned to adjudicate Ramos's grievance held hearings at the Puerto Rico Department of Labor on September 29, 2003, and August 13, 2004. At these hearings, Ramos stated that he had engaged in an \"error of judgment\" when he \"made the decision\" not to deliver the packages to Centro Médico. After reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator held in favor of UPS, finding that the failure to deliver the packages was \"not about mere negligence nor failure of procedures,\" but was instead a \"deliberate action.\" As such, Ramos had violated Article 11, § 3 of the CBA and UPS had properly terminated his employment.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Ramos filed a complaint in Puerto Rico state court challenging the arbitrator's decision. UPS promptly removed the case to the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico based on jurisdiction granted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. 29 U.S.C. § 185(a) (2000). On August 7, 2006, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment, which Ramos opposed. The district court granted the motion on October 2, 2006, finding that the arbitral award was a plausible interpretation of the CBA. Subsequently, the district court granted UPS's request for costs on November 2, 2006. Ramos now appeals the district court's decision, as well as its award of costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Arbitration Award</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.

Ramos's argument is unavailing. UPS terminated Ramos's employment under Article 11, § 3 of the CBA, which by its text allows for the summary discharge or suspension of an employee who declares \"an unauthorized strike, work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or . . . other action that paralyzes, obstructs or interrupts the operations of the Company.\" The arbitrator properly found that Ramos's dismissal was justified under this provision.</p>\n<p>Ramos argues that his actions cannot be characterized as a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or walkout for the sole reason that he did not engage in any concerted activity with other employees. While Ramos is correct that the existence of a strike requires concerted action, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. § 142 (2000), this Court has stated that concerted action may be carried out by a single employee under certain circumstances. <i>Five Star Transp. v. NLRB,</i> 522 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that the critical inquiry in determining whether action by a single employee constitutes concerted activity is whether such action is in furtherance of a group concern). More to the point, the very text of Article 11, § 3 contemplates actions carried out by \"any employee or delegate,\" and does not institute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> a group action requirement. Thus, though concerted action does not by itself constitute a strike, the fact that Ramos acted alone does not render the application of Article 11, § 3 improper.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that Ramos delivered packages other than those scheduled for delivery at Centro Médico on the Friday and Monday in question does not make his discharge under Article 11, § 3 unwarranted. Ramos's decision to not deliver the thirty-seven packages on the assigned days clearly obstructed and/or interrupted UPS's operations in contravention of Article 11, § 3. As developed in arbitration, UPS's regular mode of operation is that packages be delivered to the recipient on the day they are sent out from the UPS processing center for delivery. Even if it is understood that some low number of packages might miss their delivery date due to extenuating circumstances, that that number should be as high as thirty-seven is clearly a departure from the norm.</p>\n<p>Based on Ramos's admission during arbitration, the arbitrator found that this departure from UPS's normal operations was caused by Ramos's conscious decision to not deliver the thirty-seven packages to Centro Médico. As such, Ramos's action obstructed and/or interrupted UPS's operations and the arbitrator's decision is a plausible construction of Article 11, § 3. It is also clear that the arbitrator's decision draws its essence from the CBA. Because the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard of the law, and her opinion is supported in reason and fact and is not based on faulty reasoning or a crucial assumption that is concededly a non-fact, the arbitral award is allowed to stand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.

For this incident, UPS terminated his employment and Ramos, through his union representative, filed a grievance challenging the termination. Pursuant to the controlling collective-bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), Ramos's grievance was submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator found that under Article 11, § 3 of the CBA, UPS was justified in terminating him. Ramos now seeks judicial review. Applying the high degree of deference generally accorded arbitral decisions, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment enforcing the arbitration award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Ramos, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203122\"><a href=\"/opinion/203122/franceschi-v-us-dept-of-veterans-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2008). Petitioner Ramos had been a UPS employee for the past twelve years, most recently as a driver. He is a member of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"Union\"), which, along with UPS, is party to a CBA; the CBA outlines the procedure to be followed in carrying out disciplinary actions against union members. On Friday, January 24, and Monday, January 27, 2003, Ramos failed to deliver thirty-seven packages to Centro Médico, a medical institution in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.<sup>[1]</sup> As a result, UPS terminated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> Ramos's employment pursuant to Article 11, § 3 of the CBA.<sup>[2]</sup> The Union then filed a grievance challenging Ramos's discharge, arguing that UPS had failed to follow the disciplinary procedure mandated by the CBA, which requires the application of progressive discipline before a final dismissal. The grievance was submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator assigned to adjudicate Ramos's grievance held hearings at the Puerto Rico Department of Labor on September 29, 2003, and August 13, 2004. At these hearings, Ramos stated that he had engaged in an \"error of judgment\" when he \"made the decision\" not to deliver the packages to Centro Médico. After reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator held in favor of UPS, finding that the failure to deliver the packages was \"not about mere negligence nor failure of procedures,\" but was instead a \"deliberate action.\" As such, Ramos had violated Article 11, § 3 of the CBA and UPS had properly terminated his employment.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Ramos filed a complaint in Puerto Rico state court challenging the arbitrator's decision. UPS promptly removed the case to the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico based on jurisdiction granted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. 29 U.S.C. § 185(a) (2000). On August 7, 2006, UPS filed a motion for summary judgment, which Ramos opposed. The district court granted the motion on October 2, 2006, finding that the arbitral award was a plausible interpretation of the CBA. Subsequently, the district court granted UPS's request for costs on November 2, 2006. Ramos now appeals the district court's decision, as well as its award of costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Arbitration Award</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.
