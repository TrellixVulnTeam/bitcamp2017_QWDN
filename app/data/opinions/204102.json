Burke for appellants.\n     John Schumann, Tax Division, U.S. Department of Justice,\nwith whom John A. DiCicco and Bridget M. Rowan were on briefs,\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        December 14, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                              - 2 -\n\f           Tashima, Senior Circuit Judge.                In 2002, the United\n\nStates brought an action in district court against taxpayers Robert\n\nand   Kathleen    Haag   to   reduce     to   judgment   federal     income    tax\n\nliabilities.      In her answer, Kathleen Haag asserted an innocent\n\nspouse defense under 26 U.S.C. § 6015, which the district court\n\nsubsequently rejected by granting partial summary judgment to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           Meanwhile, in November 2003, during the pendency of the\n\ngovernment action, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) filed a\n\nnotice of federal tax liens against the Haags. The Haags responded\n\nby filing suit against the United States, alleging that they had\n\nbeen deprived of their statutory right to a Collection Due Process\n\n(“CDP”) hearing with respect to the tax liens, because the IRS\n\nfailed properly to notify them of their right to such a hearing\n\nunder 26 U.S.C. § 6320.\n\n           The    district    court    consolidated      the   two   actions   in\n\nDecember 2004.\n\n           With respect to the government’s collection action, the\n\ndistrict court eventually entered judgment against the Haags in\n\nJanuary 2006 in the amount of approximately $1.85 million, a\n\njudgment the Haags did not appeal.\n\n           With    respect    to   the    Haags’   action,     the   government\n\ninitially conceded that the Internal IRS had failed to send proper\n\nnotice of the tax liens, and thus agreed to provide the Haags with\n\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\fa substitute CDP hearing.       That hearing was held in August 2005,\n\nand Kathleen Haag again asserted an innocent spouse defense.\n\n           Shortly    after    the   hearing,       however,   the   government\n\ndiscovered evidence that it had in fact sent the proper notice, and\n\nthereafter moved for summary judgment on the Haags’ complaint. The\n\ndistrict court agreed and granted judgment to the United States on\n\nAugust 1, 2006, from which the Haags timely appealed.1\n\n           This court affirmed, concluding that the government had\n\nprovided the proper notice.          Consequently, the Haags “were not\n\nentitled to the hearing at all.”            Haag v. United States, 485 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2007) (“Haag I”).\n\n           Haag I did not, however, end the saga.              The controversy\n\nspawned two more actions that are the subject of the present\n\nappeals.   On these appeals, we have little trouble concluding that\n\nthese actions are foreclosed by the res judicata effects of Haag I.\n\n           First, following the district court’s August 1, 2006,\n\njudgment (but prior to our decision in Haag I), the Haags filed a\n\nsecond action against the United States in district court, again\n\nalleging   improper   notice    —    this    time    because   their   attorney\n\nsupposedly failed to receive notice of the tax liens (“Haag II”).\n\nThe district court administratively closed the case in late 2006 on\n\n\n     1\n          Notwithstanding the district court’s judgment, the IRS\nsubsequently issued a decision letter on August 31, 2006,\nsustaining enforcement of the tax liens and rejecting all claims\nraised by the Haags at the CDP hearing, including Kathleen Haag’s\ninnocent spouse defense.\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\faccount of Robert Haag’s bankruptcy, then denied several motions to\n\nreopen, on the ground that Haag I barred the action under res\n\njudicata. The Haags timely appealed from the last such denial, and\n\nwe have construed it as a final order terminating the case subject\n\nto our appellate jurisdiction.\n\n          Second, in October 2007, Kathleen Haag filed a third\n\naction against the United States in district court (“Haag III”),\n\nalleging that in her August 2005 CDP hearing — the one to which she\n\nwas not entitled — the IRS improperly failed to consider her\n\ninnocent spouse defense.   The district court also dismissed that\n\naction on res judicata grounds in January 2008.       Kathleen Haag\n\ntimely appealed.   She then filed a motion for relief from judgment\n\nin September 2008, which the district court denied, and from which\n\nKathleen Haag again appealed.\n\n          After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that\n\nneither of these appeals has merit.\n\n\n\n                           I. Discussion\n\n\n\n          We review dismissals based on res judicata de novo.   See\n\nGray v. Evercore Restructuring, L.L.C. (In re High Voltage Eng’g\n\nCorp.), 544 F.3d 315, 318 (1st Cir. 2008).   The other orders of the\n\ndistrict court are based on similar conclusions of law grounded in\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fres judicata.       We therefore review those orders under a de novo\n\nstandard as well. See id.\n\n            Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on\n\nthe merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating\n\nclaims that were or could have been raised in the prior action.\n\nSee Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   “Accordingly, the elements of res judicata are (1) a final\n\njudgment    on    the     merits    in   an   earlier      suit,    (2)    sufficient\n\nidenticality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier\n\nand later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the\n\nparties in the two suits.”           Id.\n\n            With respect to the claims raised in Haag II, each of\n\nthese elements is met.\n\n            There    is    little    dispute     as   to   the     first   and   third\n\nelements.    In Haag I, the district court entered a final judgment\n\non the merits against the Haags that, inter alia, rejected their\n\nclaim of improper notice, a judgment this court subsequently\n\naffirmed.        Both Kathleen and Robert Haag were parties to the\n\nearlier suit, as was the United States.                    Thus, identicality of\n\nparties and the final judgment requirement are easily met.\n\n            On the second element, identicality of causes of action,\n\nthis court employs a transactional analysis whereby identity exists\n\n“if both sets of claims — those asserted in the earlier action and\n\nthose asserted in the subsequent action — derive from a common\n\n\n                                         - 6 -\n\fnucleus of operative facts.”   Id.   Put another way, “as long as the\n\nnew complaint grows out of the same transaction or series of\n\nconnected transactions as the old complaint, the causes of action\n\nare considered to be identical.”      Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924\n\nF.2d 1161, 1166 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n           The claims in Haag I and II satisfy this standard and are\n\nessentially identical: Both allege that the IRS failed to provide\n\nproper notice of the November 2003 tax liens under 26 U.S.C. §\n\n6320.   The only conceivable difference is that in Haag I, the Haags\n\nclaimed they personally did not receive effective notice, while in\n\nHaag II they claim their attorney did not receive such notice.\n\nThis is a distinction without a difference.       The Haag II claim,\n\nwhether tied to the taxpayers or their attorney, “grows out of the\n\nsame transaction” as the old complaint and arises from a “common\n\nnucleus of operative facts:” the notice provisions triggered by the\n\nNovember 2003 tax liens, and whether the IRS complied with those\n\nprovisions.\n\n           Moreover, the Haags could have and should have brought\n\ntheir “notice to counsel” argument as part of Haag I. Nothing\n\nprevented them from doing so.        Whether their attorney received\n\nnotice in November of 2003 was instantly discernible to them and\n\ntheir lawyer, and they needed nothing further from the courts or\n\nany other party to press this claim in Haag I.      Essentially, the\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\fHaags want to litigate the notice issue piecemeal, but such a\n\nstrategy is barred by res judicata.\n\n          A similar conclusion attends the claims in Haag III.   In\n\nHaag III, Kathleen Haag asserts that she was improperly prevented\n\nfrom raising an innocent spouse defense at the CDP hearing held in\n\nAugust 2005. However, both Kathleen Haag’s innocent spouse defense\n\nand the contours of her right, if any, to a hearing were fully\n\nadjudicated in Haag I and resulted in a final judgment on the\n\nmerits against her. Further, Kathleen Haag is attacking a supposed\n\ndefect in a hearing to which she was not entitled in the first\n\nplace and, as in Haag I, we fail to understand “why the allegedly\n\nunsatisfactory hearing left [her] worse off than no hearing at\n\nall.” 485 F.3d at 4.\n\n          Because the complaint in Haag III concerns the “same\n\nnucleus of operative facts” as in Haag I, it is barred by res\n\njudicata, as is the complaint in Haag II.\n\n\n\n                         II.   Conclusion\n\n\n\n          The orders of the district court are therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 8 -\n\f",

(In re High Voltage Eng'g Corp.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1313917\"><a href=\"/opinion/1313917/in-re-high-voltage-engineering-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 318 (1st Cir. 2008). The other orders of the district court are based on similar conclusions of law grounded in res judicata. We therefore review those orders under a de novo standard as well. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in the prior action. <i>See </i><i>Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195467\"><a href=\"/opinion/195467/gonzalez-abreau-v-banco-central/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 755 (1st Cir.1994). \"Accordingly, the elements of res judicata are (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two suits.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the claims raised in <i>Haag II,</i> each of these elements is met.</p>\n<p>There is little dispute as to the first and third elements. In <i>Haag I,</i> the district court entered a final judgment on the merits against the Haags that, <i>inter alia,</i> rejected their claim of improper notice, a judgment this court subsequently affirmed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> Both Kathleen and Robert Haag were parties to the earlier suit, as was the United States. Thus, identicality of parties and the final judgment requirement are easily met.</p>\n<p>On the second element, identicality of causes of action, this court employs a transactional analysis whereby identity exists \"if both sets of claimsthose asserted in the earlier action and those asserted in the subsequent actionderive from a common nucleus of operative facts.\" <i>Id.</i> Put another way, \"as long as the new complaint grows out of the same transaction or series of connected transactions as the old complaint, the causes of action are considered to be identical.\" <i>Kale v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555434\"><a href=\"/opinion/555434/carl-kale-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1166 (1st Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The claims in <i>Haag I</i> and <i>II</i> satisfy this standard and are essentially identical: Both allege that the IRS failed to provide proper notice of the November 2003 tax liens under 26 U.S.C. § 6320. The only conceivable difference is that in <i>Haag I,</i> the Haags claimed they personally did not receive effective notice, while in <i>Haag II</i> they claim their <i>attorney</i> did not receive such notice. This is a distinction without a difference. The <i>Haag II</i> claim, whether tied to the taxpayers or their attorney, \"grows out of the same transaction\" as the old complaint and arises from a \"common nucleus of operative facts:\" the notice provisions triggered by the November 2003 tax liens, and whether the IRS complied with those provisions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Haags could have and should have brought their \"notice to counsel\" argument as part of <i>Haag I.</i> Nothing prevented them from doing so. Whether their attorney received notice in November of 2003 was instantly discernible to them and their lawyer, and they needed nothing further from the courts or any other party to press this claim in <i>Haag I.</i> Essentially, the Haags want to litigate the notice issue piecemeal, but such a strategy is barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p>A similar conclusion attends the claims in <i>Haag III.</i> In <i>Haag III,</i> Kathleen Haag asserts that she was improperly prevented from raising an innocent spouse defense at the CDP hearing held in August 2005. However, both Kathleen Haag's innocent spouse defense and the contours of her right, if any, to a hearing were fully adjudicated in <i>Haag I</i> and resulted in a final judgment on the merits against her. Further, Kathleen Haag is attacking a supposed defect in a hearing to which she was not entitled in the first place and, as in <i>Haag I,</i> we fail to understand \"why the allegedly unsatisfactory hearing left [her] worse off than no hearing at all.\" 485 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>Because the complaint in <i>Haag III</i> concerns the \"same nucleus of operative facts\" as in <i>Haag I,</i> it is barred by res judicata, as is the complaint in <i>Haag II.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The orders of the district court are therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Notwithstanding the district court's judgment, the IRS subsequently issued a decision letter on August 31, 2006, sustaining enforcement of the tax liens and rejecting all claims raised by the Haags at the CDP hearing, including Kathleen Haag's innocent spouse defense.</p>\n\n</div>",
