Evans\non brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                            January 9, 2008\n\n\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales as the respondent herein.\n\f           STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.             The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, without opinion, an Immigration Judge's\n\n(IJ's) denial of Raymond Maramis's claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT).   Maramis,1 a native and citizen of Indonesia, now petitions\n\nthis court for a review of the BIA's denial of his claims for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal. Maramis does not argue error in\n\nthe BIA's affirmation of the IJ's denial of relief under the CAT,\n\nthus waiving that issue.          See Wijaya v. Gonzales, 201 F. App'x 791,\n\n792 (1st   Cir. 2006) (unpublished opinion).              Because a reasonable\n\nfact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that Maramis has met\n\nhis   burden   of    proof   to    establish     eligibility   for   asylum   or\n\nwithholding of removal, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Maramis     entered      the    United   States   via   Los   Angeles,\n\nCalifornia, on or about May 1, 2002, as a nonimmigrant visitor with\n\nauthorization to remain in the United States until October 31,\n\n2002.    In a Notice to Appear dated May 23, 2003, the former\n\nImmigration     and     Naturalization          Service   instituted     removal\n\nproceedings.        At a hearing before the IJ, Maramis admitted the\n\nfactual allegations within the Notice to Appear and conceded\n\n\n\n1\n Maramis's wife, Sellyna Ombuh, also a native and citizen of\nIndonesia, is a derivative applicant for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and protection under the CAT, based on Maramis's\napplication.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fremovability     as    charged,    but    argued   entitlement     to    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           The IJ denied Maramis's asylum application and other\n\nattendant claims, finding that, while credible, Maramis did not\n\nadequately corroborate his status as a lifelong Christian, that the\n\nevents described by him did not amount to past persecution, and\n\nthat he failed to present a sufficient basis to substantiate a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ also perfunctorily\n\ndenied Maramis's claims for withholding of removal and protection\n\nunder the CAT.        A detailed discussion of the underlying facts is\n\nunnecessary, because Maramis bases his appeal entirely on a pattern\n\nor practice theory in his attempt at establishing a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution.       As evidence, Maramis relies exclusively upon\n\nthe State Department's 2005 International Religious Freedom Report\n\non Indonesia.2\n\n                              II.    DISCUSSION\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of asylum for substantial\n\nevidence   and   accept    the    BIA's    findings   of   fact   if    they   are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\n\n2\n Although Maramis presented additional evidence          concerning\nconditions in Indonesia to the IJ, including the State Department's\n2004 Country Report on Indonesia as well as letters from a\nChristian pastor located in Indonesia and Maramis's sister in\nIndonesia, his brief on appeal focuses solely on the 2005\nInternational Religious Freedom Report for purposes of establishing\nthe existence of a pattern or practice of religious persecution in\nIndonesia. We note, however, that the result would not change were\nthe court to consider the additional information.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthe record considered as a whole.\"     Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).    With respect\n\nto factual conclusions, we will reverse the decision below only if\n\n\"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"    8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B).    Where, as here, \"the BIA\n\nadopts an IJ's decision, we review the relevant portion of the IJ's\n\nopinion as though it were the decision of the BIA.\"     Guillaume v.\n\nGonzales, 504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The petitioner bears the burden of proof to establish\n\neligibility for asylum. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).   This burden can be met by proving past persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion, which then gives rise to an\n\ninference of future persecution, or by establishing a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on the same grounds.   Id.   \"A well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution can be shown in either of two ways.\"   Wijaya,\n\n201 F. App'x at 794.    \"First, the petitioner may show a genuine\n\nsubjective fear of persecution, along with 'credible, direct, and\n\nspecific evidence' that would objectively support a reasonable fear\n\nof future individualized persecution.\" Id. (quoting Guzman v. INS,\n\n327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003)).     \"Second, a petitioner need not\n\nprovide evidence that he would be singled out for persecution if he\n\nestablishes that there is a 'pattern or practice in his or her\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcountry of nationality . . . of persecution of a group of persons\n\nsimilarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.'\"       Id.    (alteration   in    original)   (quoting     8   C.F.R.\n\nยง 1208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A)).\n\n           Thus, our review of the decision below regarding whether\n\nMaramis    has   a     well-founded   fear    of    persecution    is    highly\n\ncircumscribed.       We can only reverse if the evidence compels the\n\nopposite   conclusion.       In   this     case,   Maramis   has   waived   his\n\narguments related to past persecution and his fear of future\n\npersecution based on his own, specific circumstances.              See Berrio-\n\nBarrera v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 168 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(holding that issues not presented on appeal or adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner are deemed waived).             In this appeal, Maramis\n\nmaintains only that the IJ erred by holding that he had failed to\n\npresent sufficient corroboratory evidence that he had been a\n\nChristian since birth and by failing to address Maramis's evidence\n\nsupporting the existence of a pattern or practice of persecution\n\nagainst Christians in Indonesia.           Because we rule against Maramis\n\non the latter ground, we need not consider the question of whether\n\nthe IJ erred by requiring Maramis to present corroboratory evidence\n\nregarding his alleged Christian faith.\n\n           The record evidence does not compel the conclusion that\n\nMaramis has established a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fon the basis of his professed religious identity.               In support of\n\nthis aspect of his claim on appeal, Maramis points to the 2005\n\nInternational     Religious   Freedom        Report   issued    by   the   State\n\nDepartment.      Maramis contends that the IJ neglected to consider\n\nwhether this evidence proved the existence of a pattern or practice\n\nof persecution of Christians in Indonesia.                 This argument is\n\nlargely semantic, based on the IJ's failure to use the precise\n\nphrase \"pattern or practice,\" which is a term of art.                \"We do not\n\nrequire an IJ to intone any magic words before we will review [his]\n\ndetermination.\"     Sulaiman v. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 351 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n            As a substantive matter, the IJ described the general\n\nconditions in Indonesia as presented in the State Department report\n\nin his summary of facts, specifically noting that despite the\n\npresence of some ongoing conflict, \"the [Indonesian] government\n\nmade significant efforts to reduce interreligious violence . . . .\"\n\nAgain, in his findings and analysis, the IJ acknowledged the\n\nexistence   of    some   degree   of   religious      turmoil   in   Indonesia.\n\nMoreover, we note that counsel for Maramis likewise did not use the\n\nphrase \"pattern or practice\" during oral argument before the IJ,\n\nopting for less precise diction.             Even if Maramis did adequately\n\nmake a pattern or practice claim to the IJ, the IJ's conclusion is\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f              Although the IJ recognized that Indonesia is not devoid\n\nof religious conflict, he nonetheless determined that Maramis\n\nfailed   to    adduce   sufficient   evidence   to   form   an   objectively\n\nreasonable basis for fearing harm in Indonesia because of his\n\npurported Christian faith.       This conclusion is amply supported by\n\nthe record.       Indeed, in recent cases, we have repeatedly and\n\nuniformly rejected nearly identical appeals from petitioners based\n\non the supposed existence of an ongoing pattern or practice of\n\npersecution against Christians in Indonesia.           See, e.g., Kho v.\n\nKeisler, 505 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Sipayung v.\n\nGonzales, 491 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 2007); Wijaya, 201 F. App'x at\n\n795; Teja v. Gonzales, 196 F. App'x 4, 7 (1st Cir. 2006) (per\n\ncuriam) (unpublished opinion); Jaya v. Gonzales, 169 F. App'x 596,\n\n598 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished opinion)).\n\n              Maramis did not supply either the IJ or the BIA with any\n\nnew information substantiating worsening conditions in Indonesia\n\nthat would warrant a different result.           A perusal of the 2005\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report reinforces, rather than\n\nrefutes, the IJ's rejection of Maramis's pattern or practice\n\nargument.     Besides praising the Indonesian government's efforts to\n\ncurb religious violence, the report reveals only sporadic and\n\nisolated      incidents   of   religious   turmoil    in    a    country   of\n\napproximately 240 million inhabitants.          The overall tenor of the\n\nreport reflects measured progress rather than increasing conflict.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fThus, Maramis has failed to prove that he has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution and, consequently, his claim for asylum is\n\nwithout merit.\n\n          Maramis, \"having failed to establish [his] eligibility\n\nfor asylum, necessarily fails in [his] claim for withholding of\n\nremoval,\" which is subject to a more stringent burden of proof.\n\nSee Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing\n\nBerrio-Barrera 460 F.3d at 168; Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\n\nF.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005)).    Thus, we reject Maramis's claim\n\nfor withholding of removal as well.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Maramis's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

We can only reverse if the evidence compels the\n\nopposite   conclusion.       In   this     case,   Maramis   has   waived   his\n\narguments related to past persecution and his fear of future\n\npersecution based on his own, specific circumstances.              See Berrio-\n\nBarrera v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202382\"><a href=\"/opinion/202382/berrio-barrera-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(holding that issues not presented on appeal or adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner are deemed waived).             In this appeal, Maramis\n\nmaintains only that the IJ erred by holding that he had failed to\n\npresent sufficient corroboratory evidence that he had been a\n\nChristian since birth and by failing to address Maramis's evidence\n\nsupporting the existence of a pattern or practice of persecution\n\nagainst Christians in Indonesia.           Because we rule against Maramis\n\non the latter ground, we need not consider the question of whether\n\nthe IJ erred by requiring Maramis to present corroboratory evidence\n\nregarding his alleged Christian faith.\n\n           The record evidence does not compel the conclusion that\n\nMaramis has established a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fon the basis of his professed religious identity.               In support of\n\nthis aspect of his claim on appeal, Maramis points to the 2005\n\nInternational     Religious   Freedom        Report   issued    by   the   State\n\nDepartment.      Maramis contends that the IJ neglected to consider\n\nwhether this evidence proved the existence of a pattern or practice\n\nof persecution of Christians in Indonesia.                 This argument is\n\nlargely semantic, based on the IJ's failure to use the precise\n\nphrase \"pattern or practice,\" which is a term of art.                \"We do not\n\nrequire an IJ to intone any magic words before we will review [his]\n\ndetermination.\"     Sulaiman v.

Even if Maramis did adequately\n\nmake a pattern or practice claim to the IJ, the IJ's conclusion is\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f              Although the IJ recognized that Indonesia is not devoid\n\nof religious conflict, he nonetheless determined that Maramis\n\nfailed   to    adduce   sufficient   evidence   to   form   an   objectively\n\nreasonable basis for fearing harm in Indonesia because of his\n\npurported Christian faith.       This conclusion is amply supported by\n\nthe record.       Indeed, in recent cases, we have repeatedly and\n\nuniformly rejected nearly identical appeals from petitioners based\n\non the supposed existence of an ongoing pattern or practice of\n\npersecution against Christians in Indonesia.

A perusal of the 2005\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report reinforces, rather than\n\nrefutes, the IJ's rejection of Maramis's pattern or practice\n\nargument.     Besides praising the Indonesian government's efforts to\n\ncurb religious violence, the report reveals only sporadic and\n\nisolated      incidents   of   religious   turmoil    in    a    country   of\n\napproximately 240 million inhabitants.          The overall tenor of the\n\nreport reflects measured progress rather than increasing conflict.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fThus, Maramis has failed to prove that he has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution and, consequently, his claim for asylum is\n\nwithout merit.\n\n          Maramis, \"having failed to establish [his] eligibility\n\nfor asylum, necessarily fails in [his] claim for withholding of\n\nremoval,\" which is subject to a more stringent burden of proof.\n\nSee Wang v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203033\"><a href=\"/opinion/203033/wang-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing\n\nBerrio-Barrera 460 F.3d at 168; Rodriguez-Ramirez v.

Thus, we reject Maramis's claim\n\nfor withholding of removal as well.\n\n                         III.
