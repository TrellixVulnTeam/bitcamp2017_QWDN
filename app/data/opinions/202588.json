Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, Civil Division, and Carol Federighi, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         January 10, 2007\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     Thomas Payne-Barahona is a citizen\n\nof Honduras and was a legal permanent resident of the United\n\nStates.     In July 1997, Payne was convicted of felony domestic\n\nassault in Rhode Island and received a sentence of three years,\n\nwhich the court suspended.      In July 2003, removal proceedings were\n\nbegun against Payne, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (E)(i) (2000),\n\nas one convicted of an aggravated felony and a crime of domestic\n\nviolence.    Payne applied for cancellation of removal and voluntary\n\ndeparture.    Id. §§ 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(b)(1)(C).\n\n            The crime in question was indisputedly an aggravated\n\nfelony    under   8    U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(43)(F),      making     petitioner\n\nstatutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal or voluntary\n\ndeparture.    8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(b)(1)(C).            Payne argued\n\nto the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") that the statutory provisions that\n\nbarred him from cancellation of removal were unconstitutional. The\n\nIJ denied the petition on September 16, 2004, stating that he was\n\nwithout jurisdiction to decide any constitutional claims.                 The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed on the same basis.\n\n            On appeal, Payne–-who has two children born in the United\n\nStates--argues    that    the   Fifth   Amendment   of    the     Constitution\n\nprovides his children the right to have their father reside in the\n\nUnited States.    Payne goes on to cite numerous studies documenting\n\nthe harm suffered by children raised by only one parent.                 Payne\n\nalso   appeals    to   international    law   and   cites    language    from\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\finternational treaties.     Our jurisdiction to review the BIA's\n\ndecision is based on 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).\n\n          The government objects that Payne lacks standing to\n\nassert his children's rights.   The restriction as to assertion of\n\nthird-party rights is merely prudential rather than based on\n\nArticle III, Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101,\n\n104-06 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-\n\n11 (1990); but, says the government, Payne has not troubled to\n\nbring himself within the jus tertii exceptions which courts have\n\ncustomarily recognized.\n\n          Nevertheless, the requirements in Powers, 499 U.S. at\n\n410-11, appear easily met in this instance: potential injury in\n\nfact to the children and to Payne; a close relationship (here,\n\nparental); and \"some hindrance to the third party's ability to\n\nprotect his or her own interest\"–-rather obvious in the case of\n\nminor children.   And no conflict exists here between the interests\n\nof parent and child.   Cf. Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow,\n\n542 U.S. 1, 15-16 (2004).   We choose to follow the path of other\n\ncourts and address the issues on the merits.   See, e.g., Robles v.\n\nINS, 485 F.2d 100, 102 (10th Cir. 1973); Newton v. INS, 736 F.2d\n\n336, 342 (6th Cir. 1984).\n\n          The circuits that have addressed the constitutional issue\n\n(under varying incarnations of the immigration laws and in varying\n\nprocedural postures) have uniformly held that a parent's otherwise\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fvalid deportation does not violate a child's constitutional right.1\n\nNor does deportation necessarily mean separation since the children\n\ncould be relocated during their minority. See Ayala-Flores, 662\n\nF.2d at 445-46.\n\n          Payne cites several Supreme Court cases recognizing in\n\nvarious contexts some kind of protection-worthy interest in family\n\n\n     1\n      See, e.g., Gallanosa v. United States, 785 F.2d 116, 120 (4th\nCir. 1986) (\"The courts of appeals that have addressed this issue\nhave uniformly held that deportation of the alien parents does not\nviolate any constitutional rights of the citizen children.\");\nCortez-Flores v. INS, 500 F.2d 178, 180 (5th Cir. 1974)\n(\"[D]eportation of a parent does not deprive the child of any\nconstitutional rights.\"); Gonzalez-Cuevas v. INS, 515 F.2d 1222,\n1224 (5th Cir. 1975) (\"Legal orders of deportation to their parents\ndo not violate any constitutional right of citizen children . . .\n.\"); Ayala-Flores v. INS, 662 F.2d 444, 445 (6th Cir. 1981) (per\ncuriam) (\"While we recognize that the Ayalas' child enjoys all the\nrights of United States citizenship . . . we do not agree that\ndeportation of her parents is an unconstitutional abridgement of\nthose rights.\"); Newton, 736 F.2d at 342 (stating that circuit\ncourts have \"uniformly\" held that the deportation of parents does\nnot deprive their children of constitutional rights); Singh v.\nMagee, 165 F.3d 917, 1998 WL 904715, at *3 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(unpublished opinion) (in Bivens action, accepting a broad\nrejection of any challenge \"to a deportation based upon the rights\nof affected family members\"); Flores-Quezada v. Gonzales, No. 04-\n72636, 2005 WL 1413864 (9th Cir. June 17, 2005) (unpublished\nopinion) (holding that deportation does not result in deprivation\nof due process where a child would be denied the Arizona\nconstitutional right to education); Robles, 485 F.2d at 102\n(rejecting the argument that it is unconstitutional to break up a\nfamily and deprive children of \"constitutional right to a\ncontinuation of the family unit\"); Cervantes v. INS, 510 F.2d 89,\n92 (10th Cir. 1975) (\"The incidental impact on aliens' minor\nchildren caused by the enforcement of duly-enacted conditions on\naliens' entrance and residence does not create constitutional\nproblems.\"); Delgado v. INS, 637 F.2d 762, 764 (10th Cir. 1980)\n(\"This Court has repeatedly held that the incidental impact visited\nupon the children of deportable, illegal aliens does not raise\nconstitutional problems.\").\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fintegrity and the right of parents to raise their children.   Cited\n\ncases include Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); Santosky\n\nv. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S.\n\n494 (1977); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972).     The\n\nfamiliar antecedent decisions include Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S.\n\n390 (1923); Pierce v. Society of the Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925);\n\nand Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944).    But the cases\n\nare widely diverse–-some involving procedural or equal protection\n\nclaims not pertinent here, e.g., Stanley, Santosky–-and are notable\n\nfor the division of views in most of the cases and for the\n\ndifficulty of fitting the analyses or results into a coherent\n\npattern.\n\n           Nothing in these Supreme Court cases points directly\n\ntoward the result Payne seeks nor does his brief try to build the\n\nbridge.    If what were happening here was conscience shocking by\n\ncontemporary American standards, the lack of precedent would not\n\nbar a new departure by a lower court; but deportations of parents\n\nare routine and do not of themselves dictate family separation. If\n\nthere were such a right, it is difficult to see why children would\n\nnot also have a constitutional right to object to a parent being\n\nsent to prison or, during periods when the draft laws are in\n\neffect, to the conscription of a parent for prolonged and dangerous\n\nmilitary service.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f              The treaties cursorily relied on by petitioner either\n\nhave been held to be non-self executing (the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights) or are non-ratified (the Convention\n\non the Rights of the Child).2         They thus do not have the force of\n\ndomestic law.         Guaylupo-Moya v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 121, 133 (2d\n\nCir. 2005); see also Igartua-De La Rosa v. United States, 417 F.3d\n\n145, 148-49 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1569 (2006).     And, even if (as Payne claims but we do not decide)\n\ncustomary international law conflicted with the statutes, the clear\n\nintent of Congress would control.           Guaylupo-Moya, 423 F.3d at 135-\n\n36.\n\n             Payne quotes heavily from Beharry v. Reno, 183 F. Supp.\n\n2d    584,   604-05    (E.D.N.Y.   2002),   which   held   that   U.S.    treaty\n\nobligations     required    providing   all    aliens   who   met   the    other\n\nrequirements of the waiver provision at issue the opportunity to\n\napply for a waiver of removal where their crimes were committed\n\nprior to being defined as aggravated felonies.             The Second Circuit\n\nreversed the decision on other grounds, Beharry v. Ashcroft, 329\n\nF.3d 51 (2003), and the language of the district court on which\n\nPayne relies was later disavowed.           Guaylupo-Moya, 423 F.3d at 125.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n       2\n      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights art. 23,\nopened for signature Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S 171, reprinted in\n6 I.L.M. 360; Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted Nov.\n20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3, reprinted in 28 I.L.M. 1448 (quoted\nwithout full citation by petitioner).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",

But the cases\n\nare widely diverse–-some involving procedural or equal protection\n\nclaims not pertinent here, e.g., Stanley, Santosky–-and are notable\n\nfor the division of views in most of the cases and for the\n\ndifficulty of fitting the analyses or results into a coherent\n\npattern.\n\n           Nothing in these Supreme Court cases points directly\n\ntoward the result Payne seeks nor does his brief try to build the\n\nbridge.    If what were happening here was conscience shocking by\n\ncontemporary American standards, the lack of precedent would not\n\nbar a new departure by a lower court; but deportations of parents\n\nare routine and do not of themselves dictate family separation. If\n\nthere were such a right, it is difficult to see why children would\n\nnot also have a constitutional right to object to a parent being\n\nsent to prison or, during periods when the draft laws are in\n\neffect, to the conscription of a parent for prolonged and dangerous\n\nmilitary service.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f              The treaties cursorily relied on by petitioner either\n\nhave been held to be non-self executing (the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights) or are non-ratified (the Convention\n\non the Rights of the Child).2         They thus do not have the force of\n\ndomestic law.
