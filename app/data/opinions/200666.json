This     appeal     challenges   a\n\nsubstantial    verdict     against    an     abortion    clinic     for   medical\n\nmalpractice.     The defendants ask us to vacate the jury verdict in\n\nfavor of the plaintiffs, claiming that the court made a number of\n\nerroneous evidentiary rulings during the trial.                  After a careful\n\nreview of the record, we affirm the verdict for the plaintiffs.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             Plaintiffs-appellees Olga Gaydar and Oleksandr Stepanov\n\nvisited     Sociedad    Instituto     Gineco-Quirurgico      y     Planificacion\n\nFamiliar     d/b/a     Clinica   Gineco-Quirurgica        (\"the     clinic\"     or\n\n\"Clinica\") on April 24, 2000, for the purpose of obtaining an\n\nabortion for Gaydar.        Taking into consideration the date of her\n\nlast menstrual period, Gaydar estimated that she was five weeks\n\npregnant.    After arriving at the clinic and completing the medical\n\nhistory     forms    provided    to   her,    Gaydar    underwent     a   pelvic\n\nexamination, followed by a suction curettage1 procedure intended to\n\nterminate her pregnancy.         Following the procedure, she was given\n\ntwo instruction sheets that contained information outlining what\n\nsymptoms could be expected after an abortion and what symptoms\n\nshould be considered abnormal.             The instructions also indicated\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       A suction curettage is a method of early abortion in which\na small tube attached to a suction machine is inserted through the\npatient's dilated cervix into the uterus, after which the contents\nof the uterus are emptied into the tube.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthat she should return to the clinic two weeks after the procedure\n\nfor a follow-up appointment.\n\n           In the days after the procedure, Gaydar continued to\n\nexperience nausea and breast tenderness; as she testified at trial,\n\nshe \"felt like [she] was still pregnant.\"         She purchased and\n\nperformed a home pregnancy test, which returned a positive result.\n\nShe also began experiencing pain in the lower area of her abdomen.\n\nOn May 5, 2000, eleven days after the procedure, Gaydar and\n\nStepanov returned to the clinic, and explained to a nurse and the\n\nreceptionist that Gaydar was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy,\n\nhad received a positive result on a home pregnancy test, and was in\n\npain.    The clinic employees explained to Gaydar and Stepanov that\n\nsuch reactions were normal following an abortion.         Gaydar and\n\nStepanov returned home without having seen a doctor that day.\n\n            On the morning of May 9, Gaydar began experiencing severe\n\npain in her abdomen.     She was unable to get out of bed and was\n\nnauseated.    Stepanov took Gaydar to the emergency room at Pavia\n\nHospital where she was initially diagnosed as suffering from septic\n\nshock, which the emergency room doctors attributed to her abortion.\n\nDr. Natalio Bayonet, a gynecologist on staff at the hospital,\n\narrived to treat Gaydar.    After reviewing a sonogram, he diagnosed\n\nher as suffering from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.2      Gaydar was\n\n\n     2\n       An ectopic pregnancy is a form of pregnancy in which\nimplantation of the fertilized egg occurs outside of the uterus,\noftentimes in one of the fallopian tubes.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fstabilized in the emergency room and given a series of blood\n\ntransfusions, after which Dr. Bayonet performed emergency surgery\n\non her, extracting the remains of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy\n\nand removing her right fallopian tube. Gaydar was hospitalized for\n\nseven days following the surgery, five days of which were spent in\n\nthe intensive care unit.        As a result of the rupture and the\n\nsurgery, Gaydar now has only one healthy fallopian tube and also\n\nhas a scar on her abdomen.\n\n          Gaydar and Stepanov3 brought a diversity action against\n\nthe clinic, Dr. Hector Ortiz-Perez,4 the owner of the clinic and\n\nthe doctor who allegedly performed the attempted abortion, and the\n\nclinic's insurance carrier, Sindicato de Aseguradores para la\n\nSuscripcion   Conujunta   de    Seguro   de   Responsabilidad   Medico-\n\nHospitalaria (\"SIMED\").        Gaydar alleged, inter alia, that the\n\nclinic and Dr. Ortiz-Perez negligently failed to detect her ectopic\n\npregnancy on April 24 and May 5, thereby leading to the rupture of\n\nher fallopian tube and her need for emergency surgery on May 9.      At\n\ntrial, Gaydar called Dr. Jose Rodriguez as an expert witness.        He\n\ntestified that the clinic's conduct varied from the applicable\n\nstandard of care when its employees failed to give Gaydar any\n\n\n     3\n       Gaydar and Stepanov are married. Other plaintiffs included\nGaydar's mother, Ludmilla, her brother Oleg, and her sisters Daria\nand Julia.    Prior to trial, all plaintiffs except Gaydar and\nStepanov dismissed their claims voluntarily.\n     4\n       The plaintiffs also named Iris Maldonado, Dr. Ortiz-Perez's\nwife, and their conjugal partnership as defendants.\n\n                                   -4-\n\flaboratory   tests,      including    a    pregnancy    test,   prior   to   the\n\nattempted abortion.       Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the clinic\n\nemployees with whom Gaydar spoke on May 5 should have called a\n\ndoctor to examine her, given her symptoms.             As part of her case-in-\n\nchief,   Gaydar   also    called     Dr.   Bayonet,    the   gynecologist    who\n\nperformed her emergency surgery at Pavia Hospital.              We discuss his\n\ntestimony more fully in Part II.A, infra.                 In opposition, the\n\ndefendants called Dr. Carlos Roure, who testified that there was\n\nnothing wrong with the care Gaydar received on April 24 and May 5\n\nat the clinic because her symptoms did not indicate the presence of\n\nan ectopic pregnancy. After the presentation of evidence, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict finding the defendants jointly and severally\n\nliable to Gaydar for $550,000 and to Stepanov for $75,000.                   The\n\ndefendants now appeal from the entry of judgment on that verdict.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           The defendants allege a series of trial errors: (1) the\n\ndistrict court erred in permitting Dr. Bayonet, listed by the\n\nplaintiffs as a witness who would testify about his treatment of\n\nGaydar, to also testify as an expert witness; (2) the district\n\ncourt should have excluded plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Jose\n\nRodriguez, because he was not a gynecologist; (3) the district\n\ncourt showed bias against the defendants and abortion clinics; and\n\n(4) Dr. Rodriguez exceeded the bounds of his expert knowledge when\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fhe testified that medical records had been altered.               We address\n\nthese arguments in turn.\n\nA. Inappropriate Expert Testimony\n\n            1.   Dr. Bayonet's Testimony\n\n            The testimony at issue involved colloquies between Dr.\n\nBayonet    and   plaintiffs'     counsel   on   direct   examination,      and\n\nsubsequently between Dr. Bayonet and defendants' counsel on cross-\n\nexamination, as well as some questions posed by the Court.                  On\n\ndirect    examination,   after    Dr.   Bayonet   answered    a   series    of\n\nquestions regarding Gaydar's condition in the emergency room, her\n\neventual diagnosis, and her emergency surgery, Gaydar's counsel\n\nbegan the following exchange:\n\n            Q: Before she was taken to Pavia, what type\n            of exams could have been performed on her to\n            detect the ectopic pregnancy?\n\n            MS. DIEPA [Defendants' counsel]:         Objection.\n            Way beyond the scope.\n\n            THE COURT: Why do you say it is beyond the\n            scope? So what. He's a physician. He is a\n            gynecologist. He can answer those questions\n            perfectly. I don't see the problem with this.\n            Overruled.\n\n            MR. MIRANDA [Defendants' co-counsel]:      And\n            then, Your Honor, he has been offered to\n            render testimony on his treatment of this lady\n            at the time of the treatment, not before.\n\n            THE COURT:   It doesn't matter.       Go ahead.\n\n            [DR. BAYONET]:     Can you repeat the question,\n            please?\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            Q: First of all, was it possible before May 9\n            when she was taken to the Pavia Hospital,\n            whether it was possible to detect that\n            [Gaydar] had developed an ectopic pregnancy?\n\n            A: Well, certainly a positive pregnancy test\n            is usually done. You could probably have done\n            an ultrasound examination.    And this would\n            probably have detected either a pregnancy in\n            the tube or a dual pregnancy.5 But I wasn't\n            there,   so  I  don't   know   what  standard\n            procedures they do in the facility where the\n            abortion was done.\n\nThis was the extent of this line of inquiry of Dr. Bayonet on\n\ndirect examination by Gaydar's counsel.    At the end of the cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Bayonet, defendants' counsel had this exchange\n\nwith him:\n\n            Q: And when [Gaydar] went to Clinica on April\n            24, 2000, she was approximately five weeks\n            [pregnant]?\n\n            A:   Yes.\n\n            Q:   Is it possible to palpate an ectopic\n            pregnancy five weeks old with no other signs\n            or symptoms?\n\n            A: Well, if you do a real good pelvic exam,\n            perhaps you could, but it could be easily\n            missed.\n\n            The defendants argue on appeal that the court erred in\n\noverruling their \"beyond the scope\" objection during the direct\n\nexamination of Dr. Bayonet because this objection advised the court\n\nthat the questions posed by Gaydar's counsel required Dr. Bayonet\n\n\n     5\n       A dual pregnancy is a pregnancy in which one embryo gestates\nin the uterus while another embryo gestates in the fallopian tube.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto provide expert testimony when he was only called as a fact\n\nwitness.   The defendants also contend that the court exacerbated\n\nits initial error by asking Dr. Bayonet a number of questions that\n\nalso   called   for   the    testimony    of   an   expert   witness.   This\n\nquestioning came after defendants' counsel had completed the cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Bayonet with the inquiry, quoted above, about\n\nthe possibility of missing, during a pelvic exam, an ectopic\n\npregnancy at five weeks gestation.             The judge then immediately\n\nstarted his own line of questioning, which we set forth fully:\n\n           THE COURT: Let me ask you something, Doctor,\n           myself, because I have doubt. If you had been\n           called -- this is hypothetical, of course. If\n           you had been called to make this abortion\n           yourself, what would you have considered doing\n           under the circumstances in April? What would\n           be the right thing to do?\n\n           THE WITNESS [Dr. Bayonet]: Well, I'm speaking\n           from the point of view of a gynecologist.\n\n           THE COURT:       Sure.\n\n           THE WITNESS:     Number one, I would have\n           verified that the pregnancy test was positive.\n           If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, perhaps\n           you could do -- if your pelvic exam\n           demonstrated an adnexal mass, then probably an\n           ultrasound would be in order.          If the\n           ultrasound   demonstrated    an   intrauterine\n           pregnancy, then there is no need to go any\n           further, and you could go ahead and do the\n           abortion.\n                  A dual pregnancy would s[h]ow an\n           ectopic pregnancy in the tube and/or in the\n           uterus with a gestational sac and a fetal\n           pole. In that case you could go ahead and do\n           the abortion if you had that information. If\n           you had an ultrasound, that would help in\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\forder to establish whether this pregnancy is\nin the uterus or not.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. Would you take a look at\n[Gaydar's medical record from Clinica on April\n24], if you are so kind, and let me know\nwhether that information was developed by the\nphysician.\n\nTHE WITNESS: The record -- I don't see any\nlaboratories here.   There is no laboratory\nindicating that she has a positive pregnancy\ntest. It is probably just by history that she\nhad her last period in March 5, 2000. But I\ncan't see any evidence of a pregnancy test.\n\nTHE COURT:   What about --\n\nTHE WITNESS: Also there is no mention of any\nultrasound or anything like that.\n\nTHE COURT:   Okay.   Thank you.\n\nMS. DIEPA [Defendants' Counsel]: Your Honor,\nmay we ask a few questions regarding that last\nline of testimony[?]\n\nTHE COURT:   Sure.\n\nBY MS. DIEPA:\nQ:   Doctor, I'm showing you -- you have in\nyour hands . . . the original records from\nClinica Gineco-Quirurgica, and I direct your\nattention to the line where it says \"ovaries\nand adnexa.\" Are you there, Doctor? Isn't it\na fact that it says, \"no masses palpable\"?\n\nA: It said \"free, no tenderness.    No masses\npalpable.\"\n\nQ:    And you just testified here that an\nultrasound   will  be   appropriate  if  the\nphysicians palpate a mass; am I correct?\n\nA:   Yes, that would be an indication of that.\n\n\n\n\n                      -9-\n\f          THE COURT: Doctor, is the information on that\n          record complete for you to decide whether this\n          doctor did the right thing?\n\n          THE WITNESS:   Well, he says that he didn't\n          find any masses. He says that there was no\n          tenderness in the adnexa.   He says that the\n          uterus was five weeks gestational size. From\n          what it said here in this record, all that I\n          can say is that probably he suspected that\n          there was an intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n          MS. DIEPA [Defendants' Counsel]:        We have no\n          further questions, Your Honor.\n\n          THE COURT: Was that enough to go ahead with\n          the abortion without more?\n\n          THE WITNESS:   I would have liked to see a\n          pregnancy test, number one. I know in these\n          clinics they don't do other tests.\n\n           THE COURT: I'm not asking you about what they\n           do   in  the   clinics.     I'm   asking   the\n           gynecologist, Dr. Bayonet, would you have gone\n           ahead   with   this   abortion   under   those\n           circumstances.\n\n           THE WITNESS:    No, I would not.\n\nThe   defendants   never   raised    any   objections   to   the   court's\n\nquestions.\n\n           2.   Plain Error Review.\n\n          In objecting to plaintiffs' question to Dr. Bayonet about\n\nthe tests that the abortion clinic could have performed to detect\n\nGaydar's ectopic pregnancy, the defendants never explained to the\n\ndistrict court the argument that they now make on appeal – namely,\n\nthat such a question converted Dr. Bayonet from a fact witness to\n\nan expert witness, and hence ran afoul of Fed. R. Evid. 701 and\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 26 (requiring the designation of expert witnesses\n\nprior to trial).6    Therefore, even if the question posed to Dr.\n\nBayonet by plaintiffs' counsel called for expert testimony (a\n\nquestion we do not decide), the defendants did not preserve their\n\nobjection to this question.       Moreover, defendants cannot object to\n\nany expert witness questions posed by the court to Dr. Bayonet\n\nbecause defendants adopted Dr. Bayonet as an expert witness in\n\ntheir    cross-examination   of   him   after   the   questions   posed   by\n\nplaintiffs' counsel and the court.         Hence, we review the argument\n\nabout the testimony of Dr. Bayonet only for plain error.7\n\n\n     6\n        Fed. R. Evid. 701 provides:\n     If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the\n     witness' testimony in the form of opinions or inferences\n     is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a)\n     rationally based on the perception of the witness, and\n     (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'\n     testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and\n     (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other\n     specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2) provides in relevant part:\n     (A) In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph\n     (1), a party shall disclose to other parties the identity\n     of any person who may be used at trial to present\n     evidence under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal\n     Rules of Evidence.\n\n     7\n         I have set forth here the respected views of my two\ncolleagues on the reasons for plain error review of the entire\ncolloquy with Dr. Bayonet.       I view the situation somewhat\ndifferently, believing that defendants adequately apprised the\ncourt of the basis for their objection to the question from\nplaintiffs' counsel to Dr. Bayonet about the tests that the\nabortion clinic could have performed, and that the court erred in\noverruling their objection. Hence, I would subject this ruling to\nharmless error review. I also disagree that defendants adopted Dr.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            To demonstrate plain error, the defendants must show \"(1)\n\nan error was committed; (2) the error was 'plain' (i.e. obvious and\n\nclear under current law); (3) the error was prejudicial (i.e.\n\naffected substantial rights); and (4) review is needed to prevent\n\na miscarriage of justice.\"    Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     We will reverse only if the error \"seriously\n\naffected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings.\"    Id. (quoting Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico,\n\nInc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 519 U.S. 927 (1996)).        We apply the plain error\n\ndoctrine \"stringently\" in civil cases. Trull v. Volkswagen of Am.,\n\nInc., 320 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).    Without suggesting that there\n\nwas any error in the court's ruling on the testimony of Dr.\n\nBayonet, we focus on the prejudice element of the plain error\n\ndoctrine.\n\n\n\nBayonet as an expert witness, believing that their questions to him\nwere prompted by the court's decision to allow Dr. Bayonet to offer\nexpert testimony. Nevertheless, I agree that plain error review\napplies to the questions posed by the court because the defendants\nwere required to object separately to the court's questions\npursuant to Rule 614, which provides that \"objections to . . .\ninterrogation by [the court] may be made at the time or at the next\navailable opportunity when the jury is not present.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n614(c).   Defendants never made such an objection.     In the end,\nhowever, the differing views of my colleagues and me on these\nprocedural niceties do not matter.      Even where I would apply\nharmless error review, I find no prejudice justifying a new trial.\nI further agree with my colleagues on their application of plain\nerror review to the court's questioning of Dr. Bayonet. Hence we\nfocus on the prejudice element of plain error review in evaluating\nDr. Bayonet's testimony.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f           Even    though    Dr.   Bayonet's   testimony   supported   the\n\nplaintiffs' theory of the case, including the testimony objected to\n\nby   defendants,   the   defendants   immediately   established   through\n\ncross-examination of Dr. Bayonet that it would be easy to miss an\n\nectopic pregnancy at five weeks through a pelvic exam.                 The\n\ndefendants also used Dr. Bayonet's training and experience as a\n\ngynecologist for their own benefit with their questions to him\n\nafter the inquiries of the court.       Moreover, Dr. Bayonet's opinion\n\ntestimony was only a brief supplement to the testimony of Dr.\n\nRodriguez, plaintiffs' expert, who testified at length that before\n\nperforming the abortion, the doctor at the clinic should have\n\nordered a number of laboratory tests, including a CBC (Complete\n\nBlood Count) test, pregnancy test, and urine test.                He also\n\ntestified that Gaydar should have been referred to a doctor on May\n\n5 when she returned to the clinic complaining of abdominal pains\n\nand pregnancy-related symptoms.        In Dr. Rodriguez's opinion, if a\n\ndoctor had examined Gaydar on May 5, he reasonably could have\n\ndetected her ectopic pregnancy.\n\n           In opposition, defendants' expert, Dr. Roure, testified\n\nthat Gaydar's ectopic pregnancy could not have been discovered on\n\nthe day she went in for her abortion because the fetus was too\n\nsmall and would not have been noticed during the course of a\n\nroutine pelvic exam.        He also stated that on neither April 24 nor\n\nMay 5 did Gaydar present symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy that\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fwould have prompted a doctor to order a non-routine test, such as\n\na sonogram, that may have detected the pregnancy in the fallopian\n\ntube.\n\n            Viewed in context, the testimony Dr. Bayonet gave in\n\nresponse to plaintiffs' questions and those of the court was\n\nminimal in comparison to the substantial testimony given by Dr.\n\nRodriguez and Dr. Roure.        Additionally, Dr. Bayonet's response --\n\nthat he believed a positive pregnancy test is usually done and that\n\nan ultrasound could probably have been done that may have detected\n\nthe     ectopic    pregnancy    --   did     not   specifically   indict    the\n\ndefendants' procedures or choices. On cross-examination, as noted,\n\nDr. Bayonet offered some opinion testimony that was helpful to\n\ndefendants.       We are confident, therefore, that his limited opinion\n\ntestimony in response to plaintiffs' question and the questions\n\nposed by the court did not affect the substantial rights of the\n\nparties and, therefore, did not rise to the level of prejudice\n\nrequired by plain error review.\n\nB.    Judicial Bias\n\n            In a related argument, the defendants contend that the\n\ndistrict    court     engaged   in   improper      \"judicial   activism    which\n\ndisplayed a predisposition and bias in favor of the Plaintiffs and\n\nagainst abortion clinics, such as the defendants [sic] facility.\"\n\nDefendants suggest that this bias was illustrated in the court's\n\nquestioning of Dr. Bayonet, and also in a number of comments the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcourt made to defendants' counsel during sidebars.                 In these\n\ncomments, the court suggested to defendants' counsel that the\n\nclinic had committed negligence and should have settled the case\n\nprior to trial.8\n\n             The defendants never raised this bias argument with the\n\ndistrict court. See Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d\n\n848, 857 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Claims of judicial partiality must be\n\nraised at the earliest moment that a litigant becomes cognizant of\n\nthe purported bias, and certainly not for the first time on\n\nappeal.\").      Therefore, we also review this contention only for\n\nplain error.\n\n           It    is   within   the   court's   discretion   to   question   a\n\nwitness.   See Fed. R. Evid. 614(b).         The questions themselves were\n\nphrased in a neutral manner.         The judge permitted follow-up cross-\n\nexamination.     The comments of concern, while reflecting skepticism\n\nabout defendants' theories and evidence, were made only at sidebar.\n\nSee Rodriguez-Hernandez, 132 F.3d at 857 (dismissing defendants'\n\nargument of judicial bias and citing fact that allegedly biased\n\ncomments were made away from the jury).          In his jury instructions,\n\nthe judge specifically instructed the jury that \"if you felt that\n\n\n\n     8\n        For example, at sidebar, the court told Ms. Diepa,\ndefendants' counsel: \"I think you should have settled this case.\nLet me tell you, you have a big problem on your hands.\" Later,\nduring that same sidebar, the court stated to Ms. Diepa: \"Don't be\nsurprised by the kind of verdict that you are going to get in this\ncase.\"\n\n                                      -15-\n\fI became impatient with the attorneys at some point in time or that\n\nI scolded them or that I had some sort of colloquy with them, you\n\nshould not be influenced by that.\"                   We credit the value of such\n\ninstructions on plain error review.              United States v. Houlihan, 92\n\nF.3d 1271, 1286 (1st Cir. 1996) (concluding that absent some\n\nevidence that the jurors ignored those instructions, \"the trial\n\ncourt's instructions . . .           precluded a finding of plain error\").\n\nWe find no plain error warranting a new trial.\n\nC.   Qualifications of Plaintiffs' Expert Witness\n\n              In their pre-trial disclosures, the plaintiffs designated\n\nDr. Jose Rodriguez Crespo as their expert witness.                    Dr. Rodriguez\n\nis a medical doctor and general practitioner who acknowledged that\n\nhe was not a specialist in gynecology or obstetrics.                     Defendants\n\nfiled a motion in limine to exclude his testimony, arguing that he\n\nwas not       qualified   to    testify    as    an    expert   regarding      ectopic\n\npregnancies      because       he   was   not    a    doctor    of   obstetrics     or\n\ngynecology.      The court denied the motion, ruling that \"the issues\n\nraised [by the defendants] go to the weight of the testimony and\n\nnot to the Daubert exclusion of the same.\"                      Defendants renewed\n\ntheir objection at trial, and the judge again denied it.                          \"We\n\nreview    a    trial   court's      decision     to    admit    or   exclude   expert\n\ntestimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\" United States v.\n\nDiaz, 300 F.3d 66, 84 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            The trial court must determine that the proffered expert\n\nwitness is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\n\ntraining, or education\" before permitting his testimony to be\n\npresented to the jury.             Fed. R. Evid. 702.         This gatekeeping\n\nfunction requires the trial court to determine, given the proffered\n\nexpert's background, whether the scientific, technical, or other\n\nspecialized knowledge he offers \"will assist the trier better to\n\nunderstand a fact in issue.\"            United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d\n\n994, 1005 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d 1161, 1183 (1st Cir. 1993)).          The mere fact that Dr. Rodriguez\n\nwas not a gynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to\n\ngive expert testimony regarding Gaydar's pregnancy.              The proffered\n\nexpert physician need not be a specialist in a particular medical\n\ndiscipline to render expert testimony relating to that discipline.\n\nMitchell v. United States, 141 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1998); Payton\n\nv. Abbott Labs, 780 F.2d 147, 155 (1st Cir. 1985).                   In fact, it\n\nwould have been an abuse of discretion for the court to exclude Dr.\n\nRodriguez's testimony on the sole basis that his medical speciality\n\nwas something other than gynecology or obstetrics. See Holbrook v.\n\nLykes Bros. S.S. Corp., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he\n\ndistrict   court      erred   by    finding    that   Dr.   Carpenter   was    not\n\nqualified to render a diagnosis or to discuss the pathology report\n\nbecause    he   was    not    a    pathologist,    oncologist   or    expert    in\n\n'definitive cancer diagnosis.'\").             Although defendants also argued\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fthat Dr. Rodriguez \"had only performed two [pelvic examinations]\n\nsince   his    internship,    and   he    had   never   palpated    an   ectopic\n\npregnancy,\" we cannot say that, given Dr. Rodriguez's education and\n\ntraining, the district court abused its discretion in holding that\n\nhis testimony would still be helpful to the jury in resolving this\n\ncase.\n\nD. Testimony on Record Alteration\n\n              The defendants argue that the district court also erred\n\nin permitting Dr. Rodriguez to testify as \"a calligraphy expert.\"\n\nDr. Rodriguez testified that the copy of Gaydar's medical records\n\nproduced by the defendants for trial contained more information\n\nthan the copy Gaydar herself received from the clinic after her\n\nabortion. Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the records the clinic\n\nproduced      for   trial   appeared     to   have   more   than   one   type   of\n\nhandwriting on them.         He stated that these modifications to the\n\nrecord were not done in an appropriate manner:              \"If there is going\n\nto be any alteration or modification made by a doctor or any\n\nmedical personnel to a patient's record, to a hospital record or a\n\nrecord of any medical procedure, it has to be made with the\n\ninitials of the person who has made those alterations in order to\n\nkeep a record of the alteration that was actually made.\"\n\n              The observations of Dr. Rodriguez regarding Gaydar's\n\nmedical records required no expertise in calligraphy. One does not\n\nneed expertise in handwriting analysis to recognize the handwriting\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fof two different people on the same document.      Defendants have\n\ncited absolutely no case law holding otherwise.   Dr. Rodriguez was\n\nalso qualified to testify about the appropriate procedures for\n\naltering or modifying hospital or patient records.   We reject the\n\ncontention that Dr. Rodriguez's testimony was improper.\n\n                              III.\n\n          Finding no basis for undoing the work of the jury, we\n\naffirm the entry of judgment on the jury's verdict in favor of\n\nGaydar and Stepanov.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

Taking into consideration the date of her last menstrual period, Gaydar estimated that she was five weeks pregnant. After arriving at the clinic and completing the medical history forms provided to her, Gaydar underwent a pelvic examination, followed by a suction curettage<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> procedure intended to terminate her pregnancy. Following the procedure, she was given two instruction sheets that contained information outlining what symptoms could be expected after an abortion and what symptoms should be considered abnormal. The instructions also indicated that she should return to the clinic two weeks after the procedure for a follow-up appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after the procedure, Gaydar continued to experience nausea and breast tenderness; as she testified at trial, she \"felt like [she] was still pregnant.\" She purchased and performed a home pregnancy test, which returned a positive result. She also began experiencing pain in the lower area of her abdomen. On May 5, 2000, eleven days after the procedure, Gaydar and Stepanov returned to the clinic, and explained to a nurse and the receptionist that Gaydar was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy, had received a positive result on a home pregnancy test, and was in pain. The clinic employees explained to Gaydar and Stepanov that such reactions were normal following an abortion. Gaydar and Stepanov returned home without having seen a doctor that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of May 9, Gaydar began experiencing severe pain in her abdomen. She was unable to get out of bed and was nauseated. Stepanov took Gaydar to the emergency room at Pavia Hospital where she was initially diagnosed as suffering from septic shock, which the emergency room doctors attributed to her abortion. Dr. Natalio Bayonet, a gynecologist on staff at the hospital, arrived to treat Gaydar. After reviewing a sonogram, he diagnosed her as suffering from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Gaydar was stabilized in the emergency room and given a series of blood transfusions, after which Dr. Bayonet performed emergency surgery on her, extracting the remains of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy and removing her right fallopian tube. Gaydar was hospitalized for seven days following the surgery, five days of which were spent in the intensive care unit. As a result of the rupture and the surgery, Gaydar now has only one healthy fallopian tube and also has a scar on her abdomen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gaydar and Stepanov<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> brought a diversity action against the clinic, Dr. Hector Ortiz-Perez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the owner of the clinic and the doctor who allegedly performed the attempted abortion, and the clinic's insurance carrier, Sindicato de Aseguradores para la Suscripcion Conujunta de Seguro de Responsabilidad Medico-Hospitalaria (\"SIMED\"). Gaydar alleged, inter alia, that the clinic and Dr. Ortiz-Perez negligently failed to detect her ectopic pregnancy on April 24 and May 5, thereby leading to the rupture of her fallopian tube and her need for emergency surgery on May 9. At trial, Gaydar called Dr. Jose Rodriguez as an expert witness. He testified that the clinic's conduct varied from the applicable standard of care when its employees failed to give Gaydar any laboratory tests, including a pregnancy test, prior to the attempted abortion. Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the clinic employees with whom Gaydar spoke on May 5 should have called a doctor to examine her, given her symptoms. As part of her case-in-chief, Gaydar also called Dr. Bayonet, the gynecologist who performed her emergency surgery at Pavia Hospital. We discuss his testimony more fully in Part II.A, infra. In opposition, the defendants called Dr. Carlos Roure, who testified that there was nothing wrong with the care Gaydar received on April 24 and May 5 at the clinic because her symptoms did not indicate the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. After the presentation of evidence, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants jointly and severally liable to Gaydar for $550,000 and to Stepanov for $75,000. The defendants now appeal from the entry of judgment on that verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants allege a series of trial errors: (1) the district court erred in permitting Dr. Bayonet, listed by the plaintiffs as a witness who would testify about his treatment of Gaydar, to also testify as an expert witness; (2) the district court should have excluded plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Jose Rodriguez, because he was not a gynecologist; (3) the district court showed bias against the defendants and abortion clinics; and (4) Dr. Rodriguez exceeded the bounds of his expert knowledge when he testified that medical records had been altered. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Inappropriate Expert Testimony</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Dr. Bayonet's Testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony at issue involved colloquies between Dr. Bayonet and plaintiffs' counsel on direct examination, and subsequently between Dr. Bayonet and defendants' counsel on cross-examination, as well as some questions posed by the Court. On direct examination, after Dr. Bayonet answered a series of questions regarding Gaydar's condition in the emergency room, her eventual diagnosis, and her emergency surgery, Gaydar's counsel began the following exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Before she was taken to Pavia, what type of exams could have been performed on her to detect the ectopic pregnancy?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

MIRANDA [Defendants' co-counsel]: And then, Your Honor, he has been offered to render testimony on his treatment of this lady at the time of the treatment, not before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: It doesn't matter.

You could probably have done an ultrasound examination. And this would probably have detected either a pregnancy in the tube or a dual pregnancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But I wasn't there, so I don't know what standard procedures they do in the facility where the abortion was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was the extent of this line of inquiry of Dr. Bayonet on direct examination by Gaydar's counsel. At the end of the cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet, defendants' counsel had this exchange with him:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And when [Gaydar] went to Clinica on April 24, 2000, she was approximately five weeks [pregnant]?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Is it possible to palpate an ectopic pregnancy five weeks old with no other signs or symptoms?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, if you do a real good pelvic exam, perhaps you could, but it could be easily missed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue on appeal that the court erred in overruling their \"beyond the scope\" objection during the direct examination of Dr. Bayonet because this objection advised the court that the questions posed by Gaydar's counsel required Dr. Bayonet to provide expert testimony when he was only called as a fact witness. The defendants also contend that the court exacerbated its initial error by asking Dr. Bayonet a number of questions that also called for the testimony of an expert witness. This questioning came after defendants' counsel had completed the cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet with the inquiry, quoted above, about the possibility of missing, during a pelvic exam, an ectopic pregnancy at five weeks gestation. The judge then immediately started his own line of questioning, which we set forth fully:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Let me ask you something, Doctor, myself, because I have doubt. If you had been called &#8212; this is hypothetical, of course. If you had been called to make this abortion yourself, what would you have considered doing under the circumstances in April? What would be the right thing to do?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS [Dr. Bayonet]: Well, I'm speaking from the point of view of a gynecologist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Sure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: Number one, I would have verified that the pregnancy test was positive. If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, perhaps you could do &#8212; if your pelvic exam demonstrated an adnexal mass, then probably an ultrasound would be in order. If the ultrasound demonstrated an intrauterine pregnancy, then there is no need to go any further, and you could go ahead and do the abortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dual pregnancy would s[h]ow an ectopic pregnancy in the tube and/or in the uterus with a gestational sac and a fetal pole.

Moreover, defendants cannot object to any expert witness questions posed by the court to Dr. Bayonet because defendants adopted Dr. Bayonet as an expert witness in their cross-examination of him after the questions posed by plaintiffs' counsel and the court. Hence, we review the argument about the testimony of Dr. Bayonet only for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate plain error, the defendants must show \"(1) an error was committed; (2) the error was `plain' (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error was prejudicial (i.e. affected substantial rights); and (4) review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.1999). We will reverse only if the error \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp.,</i> 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 519 U.S. 927, 117 S.Ct. 294, 136 L.Ed.2d 214 (1996)). We apply the plain error doctrine \"stringently\" in civil cases. <i>Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 320 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2002). Without suggesting that there was any error in the court's ruling on the testimony of Dr. Bayonet, we focus on the prejudice element of the plain error doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Dr. Bayonet's testimony supported the plaintiffs' theory of the case, including the testimony objected to by defendants, the defendants immediately established through cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet that it would be easy to miss an ectopic pregnancy at five weeks through a pelvic exam. The defendants also used Dr. Bayonet's training and experience as a gynecologist for their own benefit with their questions to him after the inquiries of the court. Moreover, Dr. Bayonet's opinion testimony was only a brief supplement to the testimony of Dr. Rodriguez, plaintiffs' expert, who testified at length that before performing the abortion, the doctor at the clinic should have ordered a number of laboratory tests, including a CBC (Complete Blood Count) test, pregnancy test, and urine test. He also testified that Gaydar should have been referred to a doctor on May 5 when she returned to the clinic complaining of abdominal pains and pregnancy-related symptoms. In Dr. Rodriguez's opinion, if a doctor had examined Gaydar on May 5, he reasonably could have detected her ectopic pregnancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposition, defendants' expert, Dr. Roure, testified that Gaydar's ectopic pregnancy could not have been discovered on the day she went in for her abortion because the fetus was too small and would not have been noticed during the course of a routine pelvic exam. He also stated that on neither April 24 nor May 5 did Gaydar present symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy that would have prompted a doctor to order a non-routine test, such as a sonogram, that may have detected the pregnancy in the fallopian tube.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, the testimony Dr. Bayonet gave in response to plaintiffs' questions and those of the court was minimal in comparison to the substantial testimony given by Dr. Rodriguez and Dr. Roure. Additionally, Dr. Bayonet's response &#8212; that he believed a positive pregnancy test is usually done and that an ultrasound could probably have been done that may have detected the ectopic pregnancy &#8212; did not specifically indict the defendants' procedures or choices. On cross-examination, as noted, Dr. Bayonet offered some opinion testimony that was helpful to defendants. We are confident, therefore, that his limited opinion testimony in response to plaintiffs' question and the questions posed by the court did not affect the substantial rights of the parties and, therefore, did not rise to the level of prejudice required by plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Judicial Bias</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related argument, the defendants contend that the district court engaged in improper \"judicial activism which displayed a predisposition and bias in favor of the Plaintiffs and against abortion clinics, such as the defendants [sic] facility.\" Defendants suggest that this bias was illustrated in the court's questioning of Dr. Bayonet, and also in a number of comments the court made to defendants' counsel during sidebars. In these comments, the court suggested to defendants' counsel that the clinic had committed negligence and should have settled the case prior to trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants never raised this bias argument with the district court. <i>See Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez,</i> 132 F.3d 848, 857 (1st Cir.1998) (\"Claims of judicial partiality must be raised at the earliest moment that a litigant becomes cognizant of the purported bias, and certainly not for the first time on appeal.\"). Therefore, we also review this contention only for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is within the court's discretion to question a witness. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 614(b). The questions themselves were phrased in a neutral manner. The judge permitted follow-up cross-examination. The comments of concern, while reflecting skepticism about defendants' theories and evidence, were made only at sidebar. <i>See Rodriguez-Hernandez,</i> 132 F.3d at 857 (dismissing defendants' argument of judicial bias and citing fact that allegedly biased comments were made away from the jury). In his jury instructions, the judge specifically instructed the jury that \"if you felt that I became impatient with the attorneys at some point in time or that I scolded them or that I had some sort of colloquy with them, you should not be influenced by that.\" We credit the value of such instructions on plain error review. <i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1286 (1st Cir.1996) (concluding that absent some evidence that the jurors ignored those instructions, \"the trial court's instructions... precluded a finding of plain error\"). We find no plain error warranting a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Qualifications of Plaintiffs' Expert Witness</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their pre-trial disclosures, the plaintiffs designated Dr. Jose Rodriguez Crespo as their expert witness. Dr. Rodriguez is a medical doctor and general practitioner who acknowledged that he was not a specialist in gynecology or obstetrics. Defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude his testimony, arguing that he was not qualified to testify as an expert regarding ectopic pregnancies because he was not a doctor of obstetrics or gynecology. The court denied the motion, ruling that \"the issues raised [by the defendants] go to the weight of the testimony and not to the <i>Daubert</i> exclusion of the same.\" Defendants renewed their objection at trial, and the judge again denied it. \"We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.\" <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court must determine that the proffered expert witness is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" before permitting his testimony to be presented to the jury. Fed.R.Evid. 702. This gatekeeping function requires the trial court to determine, given the proffered expert's background, whether the scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge he offers \"will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.\" <i>United States v. Alzanki,</i> 54 F.3d 994, 1005 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1183 (1st Cir.1993)). The mere fact that Dr. Rodriguez was not a gynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to give expert testimony regarding Gaydar's pregnancy. The proffered expert physician need not be a specialist in a particular medical discipline to render expert testimony relating to that discipline. <i>Mitchell v. United States,</i> 141 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Payton v. Abbott Labs,</i> 780 F.2d 147, 155 (1st Cir.1985). In fact, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the court to exclude Dr. Rodriguez's testimony on the sole basis that his medical speciality was something other than gynecology or obstetrics. <i>See Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Corp.,</i> 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (\"[T]he district court erred by finding that Dr. Carpenter was not qualified to render a diagnosis or to discuss the pathology report because he was not a pathologist, oncologist or expert in `definitive cancer diagnosis.'\"). Although defendants also argued that Dr. Rodriguez \"had only performed two [pelvic examinations] since his internship, and he had never palpated an ectopic pregnancy,\" we cannot say that, given Dr. Rodriguez's education and training, the district court abused its discretion in holding that his testimony would still be helpful to the jury in resolving this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Testimony on Record Alteration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the district court also erred in permitting Dr. Rodriguez to testify as \"a calligraphy expert.\" Dr. Rodriguez testified that the copy of Gaydar's medical records produced by the defendants for trial contained more information than the copy Gaydar herself received from the clinic after her abortion. Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the records the clinic produced for trial appeared to have more than one type of handwriting on them. He stated that these modifications to the record were not done in an appropriate manner: \"If there is going to be any alteration or modification made by a doctor or any medical personnel to a patient's record, to a hospital record or a record of any medical procedure, it has to be made with the initials of the person who has made those alterations in order to keep a record of the alteration that was actually made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The observations of Dr. Rodriguez regarding Gaydar's medical records required no expertise in calligraphy. One does not need expertise in handwriting analysis to recognize the handwriting of two different people on the same document. Defendants have cited absolutely no case law holding otherwise. Dr. Rodriguez was also qualified to testify about the appropriate procedures for altering or modifying hospital or patient records. We reject the contention that Dr. Rodriguez's testimony was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no basis for undoing the work of the jury, we <i>affirm</i> the entry of judgment on the jury's verdict in favor of Gaydar and Stepanov.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A suction curettage is a method of early abortion in which a small tube attached to a suction machine is inserted through the patient's dilated cervix into the uterus, after which the contents of the uterus are emptied into the tube</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> An ectopic pregnancy is a form of pregnancy in which implantation of the fertilized egg occurs outside of the uterus, oftentimes in one of the fallopian tubes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Gaydar and Stepanov are married.

I view the situation somewhat differently, believing that defendants adequately apprised the court of the basis for their objection to the question from plaintiffs' counsel to Dr. Bayonet about the tests that the abortion clinic could have performed, and that the court erred in overruling their objection. Hence, I would subject this ruling to harmless error review. I also disagree that defendants adopted Dr. Bayonet as an expert witness, believing that their questions to him were prompted by the court's decision to allow Dr. Bayonet to offer expert testimony. Nevertheless, I agree that plain error review applies to the questions posed by the court because the defendants were required to object separately to the court's questions pursuant to Rule 614, which provides that \"objections to ... interrogation by [the court] may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\" Fed.R.Evid. 614(c). Defendants never made such an objection. In the end, however, the differing views of my colleagues and me on these procedural niceties do not matter. Even where I would apply harmless error review, I find no prejudice justifying a new trial. I further agree with my colleagues on their application of plain error review to the court's questioning of Dr. Bayonet. Hence we focus on the prejudice element of plain error review in evaluating Dr. Bayonet's testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For example, at sidebar, the court told Ms. Diepa, defendants' counsel: \"I think you should have settled this case.

Taking into consideration the date of her last menstrual period, Gaydar estimated that she was five weeks pregnant. After arriving at the clinic and completing the medical history forms provided to her, Gaydar underwent a pelvic examination, followed by a suction curettage<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> procedure intended to terminate her pregnancy. Following the procedure, she was given two instruction sheets that contained information outlining what symptoms could be expected after an abortion and what symptoms should be considered abnormal. The instructions also indicated that she should return to the clinic two weeks after the procedure for a follow-up appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after the procedure, Gaydar continued to experience nausea and breast tenderness; as she testified at trial, she \"felt like [she] was still pregnant.\" She purchased and performed a home pregnancy test, which returned a positive result. She also began experiencing pain in the lower area of her abdomen. On May 5, 2000, eleven days after the procedure, Gaydar and Stepanov returned to the clinic, and explained to a nurse and the receptionist that Gaydar was experiencing symptoms of pregnancy, had received a positive result on a home pregnancy test, and was in pain. The clinic employees explained to Gaydar and Stepanov that such reactions were normal following an abortion. Gaydar and Stepanov returned home without having seen a doctor that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of May 9, Gaydar began experiencing severe pain in her abdomen. She was unable to get out of bed and was nauseated. Stepanov took Gaydar to the emergency room at Pavia Hospital where she was initially diagnosed as suffering from septic shock, which the emergency room doctors attributed to her abortion. Dr. Natalio Bayonet, a gynecologist on staff at the hospital, arrived to treat Gaydar. After reviewing a sonogram, he diagnosed her as suffering from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Gaydar was stabilized in the emergency room and given a series of blood transfusions, after which Dr. Bayonet performed emergency surgery on her, extracting the remains of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy and removing her right fallopian tube. Gaydar was hospitalized for seven days following the surgery, five days of which were spent in the intensive care unit.

Gaydar alleged, inter alia, that the clinic and Dr. Ortiz-Perez negligently failed to detect her ectopic pregnancy on April 24 and May 5, thereby leading to the rupture of her fallopian tube and her need for emergency surgery on May 9. At trial, Gaydar called Dr. Jose Rodriguez as an expert witness. He testified that the clinic's conduct varied from the applicable standard of care when its employees failed to give Gaydar any laboratory tests, including a pregnancy test, prior to the attempted abortion. Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the clinic employees with whom Gaydar spoke on May 5 should have called a doctor to examine her, given her symptoms. As part of her case-in-chief, Gaydar also called Dr. Bayonet, the gynecologist who performed her emergency surgery at Pavia Hospital. We discuss his testimony more fully in Part II.A, infra. In opposition, the defendants called Dr. Carlos Roure, who testified that there was nothing wrong with the care Gaydar received on April 24 and May 5 at the clinic because her symptoms did not indicate the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. After the presentation of evidence, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants jointly and severally liable to Gaydar for $550,000 and to Stepanov for $75,000. The defendants now appeal from the entry of judgment on that verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants allege a series of trial errors: (1) the district court erred in permitting Dr. Bayonet, listed by the plaintiffs as a witness who would testify about his treatment of Gaydar, to also testify as an expert witness; (2) the district court should have excluded plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Jose Rodriguez, because he was not a gynecologist; (3) the district court showed bias against the defendants and abortion clinics; and (4) Dr. Rodriguez exceeded the bounds of his expert knowledge when he testified that medical records had been altered.

On direct examination, after Dr. Bayonet answered a series of questions regarding Gaydar's condition in the emergency room, her eventual diagnosis, and her emergency surgery, Gaydar's counsel began the following exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Before she was taken to Pavia, what type of exams could have been performed on her to detect the ectopic pregnancy?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

You could probably have done an ultrasound examination. And this would probably have detected either a pregnancy in the tube or a dual pregnancy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> But I wasn't there, so I don't know what standard procedures they do in the facility where the abortion was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was the extent of this line of inquiry of Dr. Bayonet on direct examination by Gaydar's counsel. At the end of the cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet, defendants' counsel had this exchange with him:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: And when [Gaydar] went to Clinica on April 24, 2000, she was approximately five weeks [pregnant]?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Is it possible to palpate an ectopic pregnancy five weeks old with no other signs or symptoms?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, if you do a real good pelvic exam, perhaps you could, but it could be easily missed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue on appeal that the court erred in overruling their \"beyond the scope\" objection during the direct examination of Dr. Bayonet because this objection advised the court that the questions posed by Gaydar's counsel required Dr. Bayonet to provide expert testimony when he was only called as a fact witness. The defendants also contend that the court exacerbated its initial error by asking Dr. Bayonet a number of questions that also called for the testimony of an expert witness. This questioning came after defendants' counsel had completed the cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet with the inquiry, quoted above, about the possibility of missing, during a pelvic exam, an ectopic pregnancy at five weeks gestation. The judge then immediately started his own line of questioning, which we set forth fully:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Let me ask you something, Doctor, myself, because I have doubt.

If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, perhaps you could do &#8212; if your pelvic exam demonstrated an adnexal mass, then probably an ultrasound would be in order. If the ultrasound demonstrated an intrauterine pregnancy, then there is no need to go any further, and you could go ahead and do the abortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dual pregnancy would s[h]ow an ectopic pregnancy in the tube and/or in the uterus with a gestational sac and a fetal pole. In that case you could go ahead and do the abortion if you had that information.

Moreover, defendants cannot object to any expert witness questions posed by the court to Dr. Bayonet because defendants adopted Dr. Bayonet as an expert witness in their cross-examination of him after the questions posed by plaintiffs' counsel and the court.

Without suggesting that there was any error in the court's ruling on the testimony of Dr. Bayonet, we focus on the prejudice element of the plain error doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though Dr. Bayonet's testimony supported the plaintiffs' theory of the case, including the testimony objected to by defendants, the defendants immediately established through cross-examination of Dr. Bayonet that it would be easy to miss an ectopic pregnancy at five weeks through a pelvic exam. The defendants also used Dr. Bayonet's training and experience as a gynecologist for their own benefit with their questions to him after the inquiries of the court. Moreover, Dr. Bayonet's opinion testimony was only a brief supplement to the testimony of Dr. Rodriguez, plaintiffs' expert, who testified at length that before performing the abortion, the doctor at the clinic should have ordered a number of laboratory tests, including a CBC (Complete Blood Count) test, pregnancy test, and urine test. He also testified that Gaydar should have been referred to a doctor on May 5 when she returned to the clinic complaining of abdominal pains and pregnancy-related symptoms. In Dr. Rodriguez's opinion, if a doctor had examined Gaydar on May 5, he reasonably could have detected her ectopic pregnancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposition, defendants' expert, Dr. Roure, testified that Gaydar's ectopic pregnancy could not have been discovered on the day she went in for her abortion because the fetus was too small and would not have been noticed during the course of a routine pelvic exam. He also stated that on neither April 24 nor May 5 did Gaydar present symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy that would have prompted a doctor to order a non-routine test, such as a sonogram, that may have detected the pregnancy in the fallopian tube.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, the testimony Dr. Bayonet gave in response to plaintiffs' questions and those of the court was minimal in comparison to the substantial testimony given by Dr. Rodriguez and Dr. Roure. Additionally, Dr. Bayonet's response &#8212; that he believed a positive pregnancy test is usually done and that an ultrasound could probably have been done that may have detected the ectopic pregnancy &#8212; did not specifically indict the defendants' procedures or choices. On cross-examination, as noted, Dr. Bayonet offered some opinion testimony that was helpful to defendants. We are confident, therefore, that his limited opinion testimony in response to plaintiffs' question and the questions posed by the court did not affect the substantial rights of the parties and, therefore, did not rise to the level of prejudice required by plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Judicial Bias</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related argument, the defendants contend that the district court engaged in improper \"judicial activism which displayed a predisposition and bias in favor of the Plaintiffs and against abortion clinics, such as the defendants [sic] facility.\" Defendants suggest that this bias was illustrated in the court's questioning of Dr. Bayonet, and also in a number of comments the court made to defendants' counsel during sidebars. In these comments, the court suggested to defendants' counsel that the clinic had committed negligence and should have settled the case prior to trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants never raised this bias argument with the district court. <i>See Rodriguez-Hernandez v.

Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715786\"><a href=\"/opinion/715786/grace-a-holbrook-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-john-p-holbrook-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (\"[T]he district court erred by finding that Dr. Carpenter was not qualified to render a diagnosis or to discuss the pathology report because he was not a pathologist, oncologist or expert in `definitive cancer diagnosis.'\"). Although defendants also argued that Dr. Rodriguez \"had only performed two [pelvic examinations] since his internship, and he had never palpated an ectopic pregnancy,\" we cannot say that, given Dr. Rodriguez's education and training, the district court abused its discretion in holding that his testimony would still be helpful to the jury in resolving this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Testimony on Record Alteration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the district court also erred in permitting Dr. Rodriguez to testify as \"a calligraphy expert.\" Dr. Rodriguez testified that the copy of Gaydar's medical records produced by the defendants for trial contained more information than the copy Gaydar herself received from the clinic after her abortion. Dr. Rodriguez also testified that the records the clinic produced for trial appeared to have more than one type of handwriting on them. He stated that these modifications to the record were not done in an appropriate manner: \"If there is going to be any alteration or modification made by a doctor or any medical personnel to a patient's record, to a hospital record or a record of any medical procedure, it has to be made with the initials of the person who has made those alterations in order to keep a record of the alteration that was actually made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The observations of Dr. Rodriguez regarding Gaydar's medical records required no expertise in calligraphy. One does not need expertise in handwriting analysis to recognize the handwriting of two different people on the same document. Defendants have cited absolutely no case law holding otherwise. Dr. Rodriguez was also qualified to testify about the appropriate procedures for altering or modifying hospital or patient records. We reject the contention that Dr. Rodriguez's testimony was improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no basis for undoing the work of the jury, we <i>affirm</i> the entry of judgment on the jury's verdict in favor of Gaydar and Stepanov.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A suction curettage is a method of early abortion in which a small tube attached to a suction machine is inserted through the patient's dilated cervix into the uterus, after which the contents of the uterus are emptied into the tube</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> An ectopic pregnancy is a form of pregnancy in which implantation of the fertilized egg occurs outside of the uterus, oftentimes in one of the fallopian tubes</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Gaydar and Stepanov are married.

I view the situation somewhat differently, believing that defendants adequately apprised the court of the basis for their objection to the question from plaintiffs' counsel to Dr. Bayonet about the tests that the abortion clinic could have performed, and that the court erred in overruling their objection. Hence, I would subject this ruling to harmless error review. I also disagree that defendants adopted Dr. Bayonet as an expert witness, believing that their questions to him were prompted by the court's decision to allow Dr. Bayonet to offer expert testimony. Nevertheless, I agree that plain error review applies to the questions posed by the court because the defendants were required to object separately to the court's questions pursuant to Rule 614, which provides that \"objections to ... interrogation by [the court] may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\" Fed.R.Evid. 614(c). Defendants never made such an objection. In the end, however, the differing views of my colleagues and me on these procedural niceties do not matter. Even where I would apply harmless error review, I find no prejudice justifying a new trial. I further agree with my colleagues on their application of plain error review to the court's questioning of Dr. Bayonet. Hence we focus on the prejudice element of plain error review in evaluating Dr. Bayonet's testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> For example, at sidebar, the court told Ms. Diepa, defendants' counsel: \"I think you should have settled this case.
