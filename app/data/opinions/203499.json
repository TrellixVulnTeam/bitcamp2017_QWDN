Palau, Trial Attorney, Jeffrey S. Bucholz, Acting\nAssistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant\nDirector, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         September 30, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam.   Petitioner Sidikiba Magasouba, a native\n\nand citizen of Guinea, seeks review of a decision of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which declared him removable as\n\nan aggravated felon and denied his application for withholding\n\nof removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").   In cases involving aggravated felons, this court has\n\njurisdiction    to     review   only   \"colorable\"   claims   of\n\nconstitutional or legal error, i.e., claims that have \"some\n\npotential validity.\" Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)).    Two of petitioner's\n\nclaims arguably satisfy this standard, but each in the end\n\nproves unavailing.    We therefore deny the petition for review.\n\n           First.    Whether petitioner's state-court conviction\n\nactually constitutes an aggravated felony, as defined in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), is a question of law over which this\n\ncourt has jurisdiction.     See, e.g., Aguiar v. Gonzales, 438\n\nF.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1251\n\n(2007).    In conducting this inquiry, we employ a \"modified\n\ncategorical approach,\" which focuses on the elements of the\n\nstate conviction. Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 55 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 3003 (2007).    When the statute\n\nof conviction necessarily involves all the elements of a §\n\n1101(a)(43) offense, \"proof of the fact of conviction suffices\n\nto discharge the government's burden.\"     Id. at 56.   But when\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe state provision is broader in scope, \"the government ...\n\nmust demonstrate, by reference only to facts that can be mined\n\nfrom the record of conviction, that the putative predicate\n\noffense     constitutes    a   crime    designated    as   an   aggravated\n\nfelony.\"     Id.\n\n             In 2006, after being caught selling pirated copies of\n\nDVDs and CDs, petitioner was convicted in a Rhode Island state\n\ncourt of two offenses.         Of relevance here is his conviction\n\nunder   a   provision     entitled     \"[f]orgery,   counterfeiting,     or\n\nalteration of trademark, service mark, or identification mark,\"\n\nwhich provides as follows:\n\n             Any person who knowingly and willfully\n             sells, offer[s] to sell, or possesses with\n             the intent to sell goods which contain a\n             counterfeit trademark, service mark, or\n             identification mark ... shall be guilty of\n             the offense of trafficking in trademark\n             counterfeits.\n\nR.I.G.L. § 11-17-13(c)(1). The BIA concluded that this offense\n\nconstituted        an   aggravated      felony   under     8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1101(a)(43)(R), which refers to\n\n             an offense relating to commercial bribery,\n             counterfeiting, forgery, or trafficking in\n             vehicles the identification numbers of\n             which have been altered for which the term\n             of imprisonment is at least one year.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(R).\n\n             We agree that subsection (a)(43)(R) subsumes all the\n\nelements of the Rhode Island offense.                The state provision\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\finvolves a relatively narrow category of conduct; indeed, it is\n\nbut one of fourteen provisions outlawing different forms of\n\ncounterfeiting or forgery. Subsection (a)(43)(R), by contrast,\n\nis much more encompassing, as is made particularly evident by\n\nits use of the term \"relating to.\"             By employing that phrase,\n\n\"Congress evidenced an intent to define [the listed offenses]\n\nin [their] broadest sense.\" Park v. Attorney General, 472 F.3d\n\n66, 72 (3d Cir. 2006) (brackets in original) (quoting Drakes v.\n\nZimski, 240 F.3d 246, 249 (3d Cir. 2001)); see Kamagate v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir. 2004) (use of that phrase\n\n\"suggest[s] Congress's intent to reach more broadly than any\n\nsingle statute\"); Albillo-Figueroa v. INS, 221 F.3d 1070, 1073\n\n(9th   Cir.    2000)    (by   using    that     phrase,     subsection    (R)\n\n\"necessarily covers a range of activities beyond those of\n\ncounterfeiting or forgery itself\").             Accordingly, the fact of\n\nconviction      alone   establishes         petitioner's    status   as    an\n\naggravated felon.\n\n              In disputing this conclusion, petitioner contends\n\nthat his conviction is instead, or is also, encompassed by 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M).         That provision, in relevant part,\n\nrefers to an offense that \"involves fraud or deceit in which\n\nthe loss to the ... victims exceeds $10,000,\" a loss amount\n\nthat allegedly was not involved here.              Petitioner appears to\n\nadvance several arguments in this regard.                 First, he asserts\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat, since subsection (M) is applicable, subsection (R) must\n\nbe inapplicable.        Yet he does not explain why this should be\n\nso,     nor    does     he    otherwise    contest   subsection   (R)'s\n\napplicability.\n\n              Second, he suggests that even if both subsections\n\napply, the government was obligated to proceed under subsection\n\n(M).    In rejecting an analogous argument involving these same\n\ntwo provisions, the Third Circuit held that the government had\n\nthe discretion to proceed \"under either or both subsections.\"\n\nBobb v. Attorney General, 458 F.3d 213, 217 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nSuch discretion would be limited only if one provision was a\n\nsubset of the other, which it found not to be the case.            See\n\nid. at 224.\n\n              Third, by describing the offense here as a \"hybrid\"\n\ncrime and by earlier referring to Nugent v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d\n\n162 (3d Cir. 2004), petitioner possibly is attempting to argue\n\nthat both subsections needed to be satisfied.           But Nugent has\n\nbeen \"restricted to classificational schemes in which one\n\nclassification is entirely a subset of another.\"             Bobb, 458\n\nF.3d at 226.      As previously mentioned, that is not the case\n\nhere.\n\n              Second.        Petitioner's next claim involves a due\n\nprocess challenge to the manner in which the charges against\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhim were amended.           This claim only barely, if at all, rises to\n\nthe level of \"colorable.\"\n\n             The notice to appear alleged that petitioner was\n\nremovable for having been convicted of (1) an aggravated felony\n\nin   the    form       of    a    \"theft      offense\"      under    8     U.S.C.     §\n\n1101(a)(43)(G),         and      (2)   two    crimes     of      moral    turpitude.\n\nThereafter, in response to petitioner's motion to terminate\n\nproceedings, the government acknowledged that neither rationale\n\nwas viable.        As a result, it issued a Form I-261, entitled\n\n\"Additional Charges of Inadmissibility/Deportability,\" which\n\nset forth an amended charge based solely on subsection (R).\n\n             Petitioner did not object to the filing of this new\n\ncharge,    and    he    received       an    extension      of   time     to    respond\n\nthereto.    Nonetheless, he now argues that the government could\n\nnot repair the defective notice to appear simply by filing a\n\nnew charge on Form I-261; rather, it was required to dismiss\n\nthe original notice to appear and issue a new one.                             Had that\n\nsequence been followed, he contends, the government would have\n\nbeen barred by res judicata from seeking removal based on the\n\nsame conviction.            The BIA perceived no error, even while\n\ndescribing       the   presentation          of   charges     here   as    \"slightly\n\nawkward.\"\n\n             We agree that this claim falls short. By regulation,\n\nthe government is entitled to lodge \"additional or substituted\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fcharges\" of removability \"[a]t any time during the proceeding.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(e); accord 8 C.F.R. § 1003.30.             We have\n\nstated that \"there is no requirement that the [government]\n\nadvance   every   conceivable   basis   for   deportability   in   the\n\noriginal show cause order.\"     De Faria v. INS, 13 F.3d 422, 424\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (allowing reopening by government\n\nto file substitute charges after conviction underlying original\n\ncharge was vacated by state court); accord Park, 472 F.3d at 73\n\n(declining to apply \"judicial estoppel\" to prevent lodging of\n\nadditional charge on remand after validity of original charge\n\nwas called into question).\n\n            In the case at hand, the BIA determined that the\n\nfiling of an amended charge on Form I-261 was the \"functional\n\nequivalent\" of filing the same charge on the notice to appear.\n\nIt also held that petitioner had been given adequate notice of\n\nthe new charge and ample time to respond thereto (findings that\n\npetitioner has not disputed). And, finally, the application of\n\nres judicata in this context would require \"a final judgment,\n\nrendered on the merits in a separate action.\" Valencia-Alvarez\n\nv. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 1319, 1323-24 (9th Cir. 2006) (emphasis\n\ndeleted).\n\n            Third.   Petitioner's remaining claims involve fact-\n\nbased challenges to the withholding and CAT rulings.            These\n\nprincipally consist of challenges to the immigration judge's\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fcredibility assessments, evidentiary rulings, and other factual\n\ndeterminations.         Because       of     petitioner's     status   as     an\n\naggravated     felon,    we    lack        jurisdiction     to   review     such\n\nassignments of error.          See, e.g., Conteh, 461 F.3d at 63\n\n(\"[J]udicial    review    of   the     factual     findings      underlying   a\n\nremoval order based on an aggravated felony conviction remains\n\nforeclosed....     This proscription extends to review of the\n\nBIA's factual findings as to credibility, evidentiary weight,\n\nand satisfaction of a correctly framed burden of proof.\")\n\n(citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C)).\n\n             The petition for review is dismissed in part for lack\n\nof jurisdiction.     What remains is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

Scadron, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Sidikiba Magasouba, a native and citizen of Guinea, seeks review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which declared him removable as an aggravated felon and denied his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). In cases involving aggravated felons, this court has jurisdiction to review only \"colorable\" claims of constitutional or legal error, i.e., claims that have \"some potential validity.\" <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)). Two of petitioner's claims arguably satisfy this standard, but each in the end proves unavailing. We therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p><i>First.</i> Whether petitioner's state-court conviction actually constitutes an aggravated felony, as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), is a question of law over which this court has jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Aguiar v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793346\"><a href=\"/opinion/793346/pedro-aguiar-v-alberto-r-gonzales-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span> (2007). In conducting this inquiry, we employ a \"modified categorical approach,\" which focuses on the elements of the state conviction. <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3003</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></span> (2007). When the statute of conviction necessarily involves all the elements of a § 1101(a)(43) offense, \"proof of the fact of conviction suffices to discharge the government's burden.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56. But when the state provision is broader in scope, \"the government... must demonstrate, by reference only to facts that can be mined from the record of conviction, that the putative predicate offense constitutes a crime designated as an aggravated felony.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In 2006, after being caught selling pirated copies of DVDs and CDs, petitioner was convicted in a Rhode Island state court of two offenses. Of relevance here is his conviction under a provision entitled \"[f]orgery, counterfeiting, or alteration of trademark, service mark, or identification mark,\" which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Any person who knowingly and willfully sells, offer[s] to sell, or possesses with the intent to sell goods which contain a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> counterfeit trademark, service mark, or identification mark ... shall be guilty of the offense of trafficking in trademark counterfeits.</blockquote>\n<p>R.I.G.L. § 11-17-13(c)(1). The BIA concluded that this offense constituted an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(R), which refers to</p>\n<blockquote>an offense relating to commercial bribery, counterfeiting, forgery, or trafficking in vehicles the identification numbers of which have been altered for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.</blockquote>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(R).</p>\n<p>We agree that subsection (a)(43)(R) subsumes all the elements of the Rhode Island offense. The state provision involves a relatively narrow category of conduct; indeed, it is but one of fourteen provisions outlawing different forms of counterfeiting or forgery. Subsection (a)(43)(R), by contrast, is much more encompassing, as is made particularly evident by its use of the term \"relating to.\" By employing that phrase, \"Congress evidenced an intent to define [the listed offenses] in [their] broadest sense.\" <i>Park v. Attorney General,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796328\"><a href=\"/opinion/796328/yong-wong-park-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72 (3d Cir.2006) (brackets in original) (quoting <i>Drakes v. Zimski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772082\"><a href=\"/opinion/772082/trevor-drakes-v-charles-w-zimski-acting-director-of-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 249 (3d Cir.2001)); <i>see </i><i>Kamagate v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787942\"><a href=\"/opinion/787942/karamokotie-kamagate-v-john-ashcroft-united-states-attorney-general-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 154 (2d Cir.2004) (use of that phrase \"suggest[s] Congress's intent to reach more broadly than any single statute\"); <i>Albillo-Figueroa v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769810\"><a href=\"/opinion/769810/fredy-paul-albillo-figueroa-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1073 (9th Cir.2000) (by using that phrase, subsection (R) \"necessarily covers a range of activities beyond those of counterfeiting or forgery itself\"). Accordingly, the fact of conviction alone establishes petitioner's status as an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p>In disputing this conclusion, petitioner contends that his conviction is instead, or is also, encompassed by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). That provision, in relevant part, refers to an offense that \"involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the ... victims exceeds $10,000,\" a loss amount that allegedly was not involved here. Petitioner appears to advance several arguments in this regard. First, he asserts that, since subsection (M) is applicable, subsection (R) must be inapplicable. Yet he does not explain why this should be so, nor does he otherwise contest subsection (R)'s applicability.</p>\n<p>Second, he suggests that even if both subsections apply, the government was obligated to proceed under subsection (M). In rejecting an analogous argument involving these same two provisions, the Third Circuit held that the government had the discretion to proceed \"under either or both subsections.\" <i>Bobb v. Attorney General,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795262\"><a href=\"/opinion/795262/alvin-bobb-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 217 (3d Cir.2006). Such discretion would be limited only if one provision was a subset of the other, which it found not to be the case. <i>See id.</i> at 224.</p>\n<p>Third, by describing the offense here as a \"hybrid\" crime and by earlier referring to <i>Nugent v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786073\"><a href=\"/opinion/786073/errol-oneil-nugent-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span> (3d Cir.2004), petitioner possibly is attempting to argue that both subsections needed to be satisfied. But <i>Nugent</i> has been \"restricted to classificational schemes in which one classification is entirely a subset of another.\" <i>Bobb,</i> 458 F.3d at 226. As previously mentioned, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p><i>Second.</i> Petitioner's next claim involves a due process challenge to the manner in which the charges against him were amended. This claim only barely, if at all, rises to the level of \"colorable.\"</p>\n<p>The notice to appear alleged that petitioner was removable for having been convicted of (1) an aggravated felony in the form of a \"theft offense\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G), and (2) two crimes of moral turpitude. Thereafter, in response to petitioner's motion to terminate proceedings, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> the government acknowledged that neither rationale was viable. As a result, it issued a Form I-261, entitled \"Additional Charges of Inadmissibility/Deportability,\" which set forth an amended charge based solely on subsection (R).</p>\n<p>Petitioner did not object to the filing of this new charge, and he received an extension of time to respond thereto. Nonetheless, he now argues that the government could not repair the defective notice to appear simply by filing a new charge on Form I-261; rather, it was required to dismiss the original notice to appear and issue a new one. Had that sequence been followed, he contends, the government would have been barred by res judicata from seeking removal based on the same conviction. The BIA perceived no error, even while describing the presentation of charges here as \"slightly awkward.\"</p>\n<p>We agree that this claim falls short. By regulation, the government is entitled to lodge \"additional or substituted charges\" of removability \"[a]t any time during the proceeding.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(e); <i>accord</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.30. We have stated that \"there is no requirement that the [government] advance every conceivable basis for deportability in the original show cause order.\" <i>De Faria v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660161\"><a href=\"/opinion/660161/alberto-cabral-de-faria-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 424 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (allowing reopening by government to file substitute charges after conviction underlying original charge was vacated by state court); <i>accord </i><i>Park,</i> 472 F.3d at 73 (declining to apply \"judicial estoppel\" to prevent lodging of additional charge on remand after validity of original charge was called into question).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the BIA determined that the filing of an amended charge on Form I-261 was the \"functional equivalent\" of filing the same charge on the notice to appear. It also held that petitioner had been given adequate notice of the new charge and ample time to respond thereto (findings that petitioner has not disputed). And, finally, the application of res judicata in this context would require \"a final judgment, rendered on the merits in a separate action.\" <i>Valencia-Alvarez v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796122\"><a href=\"/opinion/796122/daniel-valencia-alvarez-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1323-24 (9th Cir. 2006) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p><i>Third.</i> Petitioner's remaining claims involve fact-based challenges to the withholding and CAT rulings. These principally consist of challenges to the immigration judge's credibility assessments, evidentiary rulings, and other factual determinations. Because of petitioner's status as an aggravated felon, we lack jurisdiction to review such assignments of error. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Conteh,</i> 461 F.3d at 63 (\"[J]udicial review of the factual findings underlying a removal order based on an aggravated felony conviction remains foreclosed.... This proscription extends to review of the BIA's factual findings as to credibility, evidentiary weight, and satisfaction of a correctly framed burden of proof.\") (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C)).</p>\n<p><i>The petition for review is dismissed in part for lack of jurisdiction. What remains is denied.</i></p>\n</div>",
