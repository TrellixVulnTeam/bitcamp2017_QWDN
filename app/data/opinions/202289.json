García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Evelyn Quinoñes-Carrasquillo on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Mariana\nE. Bauzá-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, and H.S.\nGarcia, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 28, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.     Santos Abad-Reyes (\"Abad\") pled guilty to\n\nreentering the United States illegally after being deported, in\n\nviolation 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) (2002), and was sentenced--after\n\nUnited   States   v.   Booker,   543    U.S.   220   (2005)--to   24   months'\n\nimprisonment, the statutory maximum for that offense.             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1326(a).   He now appeals from that sentence, arguing that it is\n\nunreasonably high in light of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a) and in light of the plea agreement, in which the parties\n\nstipulated to guideline calculations that resulted in a sentencing\n\nrange of only one to seven months' imprisonment.            For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm.\n\n           Even after Booker, \"a sentencing court is still required\n\nto 'consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when\n\nsentencing.'\" United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (quoting Booker, 543 U.S. at 264).         \"In most cases, this will\n\nmean that the district court will have to calculate the applicable\n\nguidelines range including the resolution of any factual or legal\n\ndisputes necessary to that calculation . . . before deciding\n\nwhether to exercise its new-found discretion to impose a non-\n\nguidelines sentence.\"      United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\n514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n           In this case, the district court did not independently\n\ncalculate the guidelines range but, instead, relied on the parties'\n\nstipulation in their plea agreement, which excluded a 16-level\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fenhancement that may have been applicable because Abad was deported\n\nafter     being   convicted     of   domestic        violence.          See    U.S.S.G.\n\n§   2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)     (requiring         such    an         enhancement    if    the\n\ndefendant was deported after a conviction for \"a felony that is .\n\n. . a crime of violence\").           Such reliance is permissible, absent\n\nexceptions not relevant here. United States v. Rodríguez-Gonzáles,\n\n433 F.3d 165, 169 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing United States v. Teeter,\n\n257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n             In deciding to impose a sentence above the parties'\n\nstipulated guidelines range, the court adequately explained its\n\nreasons as required by Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.                               In\n\nparticular, the court took into account the seriousness of the\n\noffense of illegal reentry, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A); the need to\n\ndeter future crimes and promote respect for the law, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)(2)(A) & (B) (the instant offense was Abad's second illegal\n\nreentry); and the defendant's criminal history and the need to\n\nprotect the public, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1) & (2)(C) (Abad's prior\n\ndomestic violence conviction involved his repeatedly hitting his\n\ncommon-law    wife   in   the   face,    grabbing          her    by   the    neck,   and\n\nthreatening to kill her, all in front of their young children).1\n\nBecause the district court did not rely on any impermissible\n\n\n      1\n      Abad waived his claim of entitlement to a more developed\npresentence investigation of the factual basis for the aggravating\nfactors relied upon by the district court by affirmatively\nrequesting an abbreviated presentence report in order to expedite\nhis sentencing.\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffactors in determining the appropriate sentence, United States v.\n\nScherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 95 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), gave plausible\n\nreasons, and reached a defensible result,      Jiménez-Beltre,   440\n\nF.3d at 519, we defer to its on-the-scene judgment, id.\n\n            For much the same reasons, we reject Abad's remaining\n\nargument--that the district court unreasonably declined to follow\n\nthe prosecutor's recommendation, pursuant to the plea agreement, to\n\nsentence him to three months' imprisonment, the middle of the\n\nparties' stipulated guidelines range.      Except where the parties\n\nenter into a binding plea agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C), which\n\ndid not happen here, the sentencing court is not bound by the\n\nparties' agreement as to an appropriate sentence. Teeter, 257 F.3d\n\nat 28.     Indeed, Abad acknowledged the non-binding nature of the\n\nagreement, both in the agreement itself and at his change of plea\n\nhearing.    For the same reasons that we find the sentence imposed to\n\nbe reasonable, we reject Abad's argument that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in declining to follow the prosecutor's\n\nagreed-upon sentencing recommendation.\n\n            Accordingly, the sentence is summarily affirmed.
