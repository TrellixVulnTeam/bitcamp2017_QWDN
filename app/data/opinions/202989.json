Andrews for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 23, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.      On April 9, 2001, after pleading\n\nguilty     to   possession   of     child   pornography,     18    U.S.C.   ยง\n\n2252A(a)(5)(B) (2000), Billy Roy was sentenced to 24 months in\n\nprison and three years of supervised release. Among the conditions\n\nof Roy's supervised release were that he participate in a mental\n\nhealth program and avoid contact with children under age 18 without\n\nthe approval of his supervisor.1\n\n            Since   his   release    from   prison   on    the    pornography\n\nconviction, Roy's supervised release has been revoked on three\n\noccasions for, among other things, having contact with the two\n\nyoung children of his girlfriend, Jennifer Woodward.             On the first\n\noccasion, Roy was sentenced in 2004 to four months in prison and 32\n\nmonths of supervised release; one of the conditions of supervised\n\nrelease required Roy to spend three months in community confinement\n\nafter release from prison.\n\n            Roy's supervised release was revoked a second time in\n\nJuly 2005, for his failure to comply with the terms of his mental\n\nhealth treatment program by continuing to have contact with his\n\ngirlfriend and her children.        This time he was sentenced to eight\n\nmonths in prison and an additional term of 24 months of supervised\n\nrelease.    United States v. Roy, 438 F.3d 140, 142 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 126 S. Ct. 2945 (2006).       Shortly after his release, Roy was\n\n\n     1\n      The condition is readily explained: Roy was also convicted in\n1998 of unlawful sexual conduct. The victim was a 14-year-old girl\nwho had been babysitting for Roy's nephews.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fonce again arrested for violating the terms of supervision by again\n\nhaving contact with Woodward's young children; he was sentenced to\n\n12 months in prison.\n\n           Roy now appeals the third revocation sentence.   His main\n\nargument is that he was protected by a 24-month aggregate limit on\n\nprison time for violations of supervised release; that his three\n\nmonths of community confinement imposed as part of the first\n\nrevocation sentence should count toward that aggregate cap; and\n\ntherefore that--counting the first as seven months and second as\n\neight--his sentence on the third revocation could be no more than\n\nnine months (24-(7+8)=9).\n\n           Roy did not raise this objection in the district court.\n\nThe probation report on the third revocation assumed that the\n\nmaximum sentence was 12 months, as did the sentencing judge and the\n\nparties.   The government now says that the applicable aggregate\n\nmaximum was 36 months; Roy says it was 24 but that community\n\nconfinement counts.    We do not need to resolve either contention\n\nbecause Roy's claim of error does not meet the requirements for\n\nplain error review.\n\n           Under United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993),\n\nthe formal requirements for recognizing plain error are that the\n\nclaimant satisfy each of four different tests by showing: \"(1) that\n\nan error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only\n\n(3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"    United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Combined, these requirements set a very high threshold\n\nand deliberately so.     The job of the lawyer is to tell the judge\n\nwhen a mistake is being made while it can readily be corrected; the\n\ncost of undoing a mistake raised for the first time on appeal can\n\nbe very high.      Even in criminal cases, mistakes by counsel not\n\nmeeting plain error standards are tolerated--unless counsel is\n\ndeficient to the point of incompetence prejudicing the defendant.\n\nUnited States v. Torres-Rosario, 447 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)).\n\n          That the error be \"plain\" is a central part of the Olano\n\nrequirements but its rationale may be less evident than the other\n\nthree requirements.    Probably one reason for requiring \"plainness\"\n\nis the notion that a judge even without objection should respond to\n\nobvious errors; but a more prudential reason is that \"close cases\"\n\ninvolve issues that could be decided either way, while blatant\n\nerrors, when left uncorrected, are more disturbing to public\n\nconfidence in the trial process.\n\n          The last of these reasons may explain why, contrary to\n\none's first instinct, the Supreme Court has ruled that an error not\n\n\"plain\" or previously settled at the time the district court ruled\n\ncan become \"plain\" where, prior to appellate review, intervening\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\flaw has resolved the issue clearly.     Johnson v. United States, 520\n\nU.S. 461, 468 (1997).   But the   requirement of \"plain\" error would\n\nbe abolished if the issue is still debatable before the appeals\n\ncourt hears the case and becomes plain only because the court then\n\nresolves it.   An error is normally plain after the court has ruled.\n\n          Here, it was not \"plain\" when the district court acted,\n\nand is not now \"plain\" on appeal, whether the time spent in\n\ncommunity confinement as a part of supervised release following an\n\nearlier revocation should or should not count toward an aggregate\n\nlimit on the maximum period of imprisonment for a series of\n\nrevocations.    Neither statutory text, substantial precedent or\n\npolicy considerations clearly answer the question in Roy's favor.\n\nArguably, there was no error; if error existed, it was not plain.\n\n          Under the statute, the district court is permitted for\n\nviolation of conditions to \"revoke a term of supervised release,\n\nand require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the\n\nterm of supervised release authorized by statute,\" 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n3583(e)(3), subject to a statutory cap,2 which we read as applied\n\nto the aggregate of all time served for such violations.      United\n\n\n     2\n      Section 3583(e)(3) says in relevant part that \"a defendant\nwhose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to\nserve . . . more than 3 years in prison if [the underlying] offense\nis a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is\na class C or D felony, or more than one year in any other case.\"\nWe do not reach the question, which is in dispute, of whether Roy's\ncase is affected by the PROTECT Act of 2003's modification of this\nsection. PROTECT ACT, Pub. L. No. 108-21, tit. I, ยง 101, 117 Stat.\n650, 651 (2003).\n\n                                  -5-\n\fStates v. Tapia-Escalera, 356 F.3d 181, 187-88 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWhether time in community confinement counts as time \"in prison\" is\n\nnot answered by text or further definition.\n\n            Neither do policy considerations settle the issue: prison\n\nmight be conceived of as the most restrictive form of punishment;\n\nwhere community confinement or home detention fall on a spectrum\n\nbetween    incarceration     and    complete      freedom      of     movement    is   a\n\nquestion    with    no    precise    answer;         neither     is      the   relative\n\nrelationship between the former two.            And, both community and home\n\nconfinement can be more or less restrictive depending on the\n\nfacilities themselves or the type of monitoring required by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n            Roy cites to no authority supporting his contention that\n\ntime spent in community confinement must be credited toward the\n\nstatutory maximum; indeed, precedent seems to weigh in favor of the\n\ngovernment.    See United States v. Horek, 137 F.3d 1226, 1229 (10th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 88 (1998) (holding that community\n\nconfinement need not be deducted from maximum term of imprisonment\n\nwhen sentencing a defendant whose probation has been revoked); cf.\n\nUnited States v. Adler, 52 F.3d 20, 21 (2d Cir. 1995) (recognizing\n\nthat   community     confinement     does      not    qualify       as    imprisonment\n\ncounting toward minimum term).\n\n            Our    view   would    not   change      were   we   to      accept   Roy's\n\nargument    that    community       confinement        should       be    treated      no\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdifferently from home detention.                Though some circuits have held\n\nthat credit for home detention is required toward the statutory\n\ncap,3 other courts have come out the other way, see United States\n\nv. Hager, 288 F.3d 136, 138 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 962\n\n(2002), and we have yet to resolve the issue, cf. United States v.\n\nMartin, 363 F.3d 25, 37-39 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that, for\n\npurposes of double jeopardy, defendant must receive credit--though\n\nnot day-to-day credit--for time spent in community confinement or\n\nhome detention).           Anyway, the equation of home detention and\n\ncommunity confinement is itself an open question.\n\n                  In short, we think the 12-month term was not plain error\n\nand turn to Roy's remaining argument, which was preserved.                    Roy\n\nargued in the district court, and again on appeal, that he should\n\nhave       been    sentenced   to   a   halfway    house   because   his   medical\n\ncondition (high cholesterol) could not be well treated in prison.\n\nThe district court's decision turns on factual and discretionary\n\njudgments where the standard of review is weighted against Roy.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      United States v. Ferguson, 369 F.3d 847, 851 (5th Cir. 2004);\nsee also United States v. Kravchuk, 335 F.3d 1147, 1159 (10th\nCir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 941 (2003) (finding that sentence of\n27 months imprisonment plus three months of home detention required\nas part of supervised release constituted an upward departure where\nthe guidelines permitted a maximum sentence of 27 months); United\nStates v. Leaphart, 98 F.3d 41, 43 (2d Cir. 1996) (precluding\nimposition of the maximum term of incarceration under section\n3583(e)(3) in addition to a period of home detention under\nsubsection (e)(4)).\n\n                                          -7-\n\f          Roy   offers   a    colorable   argument   that   community\n\nconfinement may be imposed under section 3583 despite the statute's\n\nfailure to so explicitly provide, but the question is not whether\n\nthe court could have sentenced Roy to a halfway house but instead\n\nwhether its failure to do so was an abuse of discretion.          See\n\nUnited States v. Ramirez-Rivera, 241 F.3d 37, 40-41 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Indeed, Roy argues only that \"direct placement in Pharos\n\nHouse may be imposed in this case\" and supports this claim by\n\nreference to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3563(b), which sets forth \"[d]iscretionary\n\nconditions\" of probation.\n\n          The district judge balanced the extremely serious nature\n\nof Roy's conduct against the medical concerns and the prospect that\n\nbetter treatment might be available in a halfway house environment.\n\nWeighing these factors, the court concluded that the proper balance\n\nwas a 12-month sentence accompanied by a recommendation that Roy\n\nreceive proper medical treatment in the prison setting.     This was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Among the conditions of Roy's supervised release were that he participate in a mental health program and avoid contact with children under age 18 without the approval of his supervisor.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Since his release from prison on the pornography conviction, Roy's supervised release has been revoked on three occasions for, among other things, having contact with the two young children of his girlfriend, Jennifer Woodward.

This time he was sentenced to eight months in prison and an additional term of 24 months of supervised release. <i>United States v.

Shortly after his release, Roy was once again arrested for violating the terms of supervision by again having contact with Woodward's young children; he was sentenced to 12 months in prison.</p>\n<p>Roy now appeals the third revocation sentence.

Andrews, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, LYNCH, Circuit Judge, and SCHWARZER,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>On April 9, 2001, after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. ยง 2252A(a)(5)(B) (2000), Billy Roy was sentenced to 24 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Among the conditions of Roy's supervised release were that he participate in a mental health program and avoid contact with children under age 18 without the approval of his supervisor.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Since his release from prison on the pornography conviction, Roy's supervised release has been revoked on three occasions for, among other things, having contact with the two young children of his girlfriend, Jennifer Woodward. On the first occasion, Roy was sentenced in 2004 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> to four months in prison and 32 months of supervised release; one of the conditions of supervised release required Roy to spend three months in community confinement after release from prison.</p>\n<p>Roy's supervised release was revoked a second time in July 2005, for his failure to comply with the terms of his mental health treatment program by continuing to have contact with his girlfriend and her children. This time he was sentenced to eight months in prison and an additional term of 24 months of supervised release. <i>United States v. Roy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202078\"><a href=\"/opinion/202078/united-states-v-roy/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2945</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></span> (2006). Shortly after his release, Roy was once again arrested for violating the terms of supervision by again having contact with Woodward's young children; he was sentenced to 12 months in prison.</p>\n<p>Roy now appeals the third revocation sentence. His main argument is that he was protected by a 24-month aggregate limit on prison time for violations of supervised release; that his three months of community confinement imposed as part of the first revocation sentence should count toward that aggregate cap; and therefore thatยcounting the first as seven months and second as eightยhis sentence on the third revocation could be no more than nine months (24-(7+8)=9).</p>\n<p>Roy did not raise this objection in the district court. The probation report on the third revocation assumed that the maximum sentence was 12 months, as did the sentencing judge and the parties. The government now says that the applicable aggregate maximum was 36 months; Roy says it was 24 but that community confinement counts. We do not need to resolve either contention because Roy's claim of error does not meet the requirements for plain error review.</p>\n<p>Under <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993), the formal requirements for recognizing plain error are that the claimant satisfy each of four different tests by showing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Combined, these requirements set a very high threshold and deliberately so. The job of the lawyer is to tell the judge when a mistake is being made while it can readily be corrected; the cost of undoing a mistake raised for the first time on appeal can be very high. Even in criminal cases, mistakes by counsel not meeting plain error standards are toleratedยunless counsel is deficient to the point of incompetence prejudicing the defendant. <i>United States v. Torres-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984)).</p>\n<p>That the error be \"plain\" is a central part of the <i>Olano</i> requirements but its rationale may be less evident than the other three requirements. Probably one reason for requiring \"plainness\" is the notion that a judge even without objection should respond to obvious errors; but a more prudential reason is that \"close cases\" involve issues that could be decided either way, while blatant errors, when left uncorrected, are more disturbing to public confidence in the trial process.</p>\n<p>The last of these reasons may explain why, contrary to one's first instinct, the Supreme Court has ruled that an error not \"plain\" or previously settled at the time the district court ruled can become \"plain\" where, prior to appellate review, intervening law has resolved the issue clearly. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 468, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></span> (1997). But the requirement of \"plain\" error would be abolished if the issue is still debatable before the appeals court hears the case and becomes plain only because the court then resolves it. An error is normally plain <i>after</i> the court has ruled.</p>\n<p>Here, it was not \"plain\" when the district court acted, and is not now \"plain\" on appeal, whether the time spent in community confinement as a part of supervised release following an earlier revocation should or should not count toward an aggregate limit on the maximum period of imprisonment for a series of revocations. Neither statutory text, substantial precedent or policy considerations clearly answer the question in Roy's favor. Arguably, there was no error; if error existed, it was not plain.</p>\n<p>Under the statute, the district court is permitted for violation of conditions to \"revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute,\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 3583(e)(3), subject to a statutory cap,<sup>[2]</sup> which we read as applied to the aggregate of all time served for such violations. <i>United States v. Tapia-Escalera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200834\"><a href=\"/opinion/200834/united-states-v-tapia-escalera/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 187-88 (1st Cir.2004). Whether time in community confinement counts as time \"in prison\" is not answered by text or further definition.</p>\n<p>Neither do policy considerations settle the issue: prison might be conceived of as the most restrictive form of punishment; where community confinement or home detention fall on a spectrum between incarceration and complete freedom of movement is a question with no precise answer; neither is the relative relationship between the former two. And, both community and home confinement can be more or less restrictive depending on the facilities themselves or the type of monitoring required by the district court.</p>\n<p>Roy cites to no authority supporting his contention that time spent in community confinement must be credited toward the statutory maximum; indeed, precedent seems to weigh in favor of the government. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Horek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751910\"><a href=\"/opinion/751910/united-states-v-mark-a-horek/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span>, 1229 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span> (1998) (holding that community confinement need not be deducted from maximum term of imprisonment when sentencing a defendant whose probation has been revoked); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v.

Though some circuits have held that credit for home detention is required toward the statutory cap,<sup>[3]</sup> other courts have come out the other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> way, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Hager,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777435\"><a href=\"/opinion/777435/united-states-v-gary-z-hager/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 138 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></span> (2002), and we have yet to resolve the issue, <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200941\"><a href=\"/opinion/200941/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 37-39 (1st Cir.2004) (holding that, for purposes of double jeopardy, defendant must receive creditยthough not day-to-day creditยfor time spent in community confinement or home detention). Anyway, the equation of home detention and community confinement is itself an open question.</p>\n<p>In short, we think the 12-month term was not plain error and turn to Roy's remaining argument, which was preserved. Roy argued in the district court, and again on appeal, that he should have been sentenced to a halfway house because his medical condition (high cholesterol) could not be well treated in prison. The district court's decision turns on factual and discretionary judgments where the standard of review is weighted against Roy.</p>\n<p>Roy offers a colorable argument that community confinement may be imposed under section 3583 despite the statute's failure to so explicitly provide, but the question is not whether the court <i>could</i> have sentenced Roy to a halfway house but instead whether its failure to do so was an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ramirez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199285\"><a href=\"/opinion/199285/united-states-v-ramirez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.2001). Indeed, Roy argues only that \"direct placement in Pharos House <i>may</i> be imposed in this case\" and supports this claim by reference to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3563(b), which sets forth \"[d]iscretionary conditions\" of probation.</p>\n<p>The district judge balanced the extremely serious nature of Roy's conduct against the medical concerns and the prospect that better treatment might be available in a halfway house environment. Weighing these factors, the court concluded that the proper balance was a 12-month sentence accompanied by a recommendation that Roy receive proper medical treatment in the prison setting. This was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The condition is readily explained: Roy was also convicted in 1998 of unlawful sexual conduct.
