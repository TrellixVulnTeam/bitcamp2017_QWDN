Hayden for appellant.\n     David H. Hennessy, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 24, 2004\n\f           CAMPBELL,   Senior   Circuit   Judge.     Jose   Sanchez   was\n\nconvicted in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts upon his plea of guilty to charges of drug-related\n\noffenses   and   criminal   forfeiture.    Because   Sanchez   had    been\n\npreviously convicted of felony drug offenses in the Pennsylvania\n\nstate courts, the district court imposed the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of twenty years' imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(b) and 851. Sanchez argues that the mandatory minimum sentence\n\nprovision does not apply to him because his prior state convictions\n\nwere not prosecuted by indictment nor did he waive indictment for\n\nthose offenses.    For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           The relevant facts are not in dispute. On July 24, 2002,\n\na federal grand jury indicted Sanchez and three co-defendants, who\n\nare not parties to this appeal, for conspiring to distribute 50\n\ngrams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.\n\nThe grand jury also indicted Sanchez on two counts of distribution\n\nof 50 grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a); two counts of distribution of five\n\ngrams or more of a substance containing cocaine base, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a); and one count of criminal forfeiture, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 853(a).\n\n           On February 7, 2003, the United States filed a previous\n\noffender information under 21 U.S.C. § 851(a), giving notice of the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fprosecution's intention to seek the enhanced penalties prescribed\n\nin 21 U.S.C. § 841, based on prior state convictions for a felony\n\ndrug offense.     The information alleged that Sanchez had been\n\npreviously convicted of drug felonies in the Court of Common Pleas\n\nof Berks County, Pennsylvania.         The parties agree that those\n\nfelonies were not prosecuted by indictment nor was there a waiver\n\nof indictment.\n\n          On September 25, 2003, Sanchez pleaded guilty.           In\n\naccordance with 21 U.S.C. § 851(b), the district court inquired of\n\nSanchez whether he affirmed or denied the prior convictions alleged\n\nin the information.    Sanchez affirmed the existence of the prior\n\nconvictions, but argued that they should not be used to enhance his\n\nsentence because, in Sanchez's view, enhancement was appropriate\n\nonly where the prior state felonies were prosecuted by indictment\n\nor he had waived indictment for those offenses, pursuant to a\n\nprovision in 21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(2), infra.        At sentencing, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the indictment requirement set out in §\n\n851(a)(2) applied to the present federal offenses, and not to the\n\nprior predicate convictions.      Accordingly, the district court\n\nimposed   the    mandatory   minimum   sentence   of   twenty   years'\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fimprisonment based on Sanchez's prior drug felony convictions.1\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B).2\n\n                               II.\n\n          Disputes regarding the interpretation of a statute give\n\nrise to legal questions subject to de novo review.   United States\n\nv. Rosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2003).   The statute here\n\nin issue, 21 U.S.C. § 851(a), provides in pertinent part:\n\n     (1) No person who stands convicted of an offense under\n     this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by\n     reason of one or more prior convictions, unless . . .\n     before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States\n     attorney files an information with the court . . .\n     stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied\n     upon. . . .\n\n     (2) An information may not be filed under this section if\n     the increased punishment which may be imposed is\n     imprisonment for a term in excess of three years unless\n     the person either waived or was afforded prosecution by\n     indictment for the offense for which such increased\n     punishment may be imposed.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 851(a) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court also ordered Sanchez to forfeit         his\ninterest in certain property, consisting of cash exchanged       for\ncrack cocaine, held jointly and severally with the three         co-\ndefendants.   Sanchez does not challenge this portion of         the\nsentencing decision.\n     2\n      21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) imposes a 20-year mandatory minimum\nsentence for cases involving 50 or more grams of crack cocaine if\nthe defendant commits the violation after a prior conviction for a\nfelony drug offense.     Section 841(b)(1)(B) imposes a 10-year\nmandatory minimum for cases involving five or more grams of cocaine\nbase if the defendant commits the violation after a prior\nconviction for a felony drug offense.\n\n                               -4-\n\f           On appeal, Sanchez renews his argument, rejected by the\n\ndistrict court, that the phraseology in § 851(a)(2) requiring that\n\nthe person subject to increased punishment be afforded prosecution\n\nby indictment, or else have waived indictment, \"for the offense for\n\nwhich such increased punishment may be imposed,\" is ambiguous as to\n\nwhether it refers to the present offense or to the prior predicate\n\nconvictions.    Because of this ambiguity, Sanchez contends the rule\n\nof lenity should be applied in his favor and his case remanded for\n\nresentencing.     The United States argues that the phrase \"the\n\noffense for which such increased punishment may be imposed\" refers\n\nlogically to the federal offenses for which Sanchez has been\n\ncurrently sentenced, and not to the prior state convictions used to\n\nenhance the current sentence.     It is undisputed that the instant\n\nfederal offenses were prosecuted by indictment.\n\n           The question posed is one of first impression in this\n\ncircuit.   Sanchez concedes, however, that of the several other\n\nfederal courts of appeal that have construed 21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(2),\n\nall have held that the indictment requirement applies to the\n\npresent offense of conviction, and not to the one or more prior\n\nconvictions that may be used to enhance the sentence.    See United\n\nStates v. Brown, 191 F.3d 486, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1999); United States\n\nv. Lampton, 158 F.3d 251, 256 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nLynch, 158 F.3d 195, 198-99 (3d Cir. 1998); United States v. Ortiz,\n\n143 F.3d 728, 732 (2d Cir. 1998), overruling United States v.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fCollado,   106    F.3d   1097   (2d    Cir.   1997);   United    States   v.\n\nGaitan-Acevedo, 148 F.3d 577, 594 (6th Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nHarden, 37 F.3d 595, 601 (11th Cir. 1994); United States v.\n\nTrevino-Rodriguez, 994 F.2d 533, 536 (8th Cir. 1993); United States\n\nv. Burrell, 963 F.2d 976, 992-93 (7th Cir. 1992); United States v.\n\nAdams, 914 F.2d 1404, 1407 (10th Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nEspinosa, 827 F.2d 604, 617 (9th Cir. 1987).\n\n           In the earliest of those decisions, Espinosa, the Ninth\n\nCircuit gave three reasons for concluding that the indictment\n\nrequirement in § 851(a)(2) referred to the current offense of\n\nconviction.      Espinosa, 827 F.2d at 617.      First, the court noted\n\nthat \"although one may not be punished twice for the same crime,\n\npunishment for a second crime may be enhanced by reason of a second\n\nconviction.\"     Id.   It then concluded that \"a common-sense reading\n\nof the phrase 'offense for which such increased punishment may be\n\nimposed' is the current, or latest, offense.\"           Id.3    Second, the\n\n\n     3\n      The Ninth Circuit does not actually say, as has sometimes\nbeen inferred and as the government implies here, that there would\nbe a double jeopardy or ex post facto concern with applying the\nstatute to the prior conviction. See, e.g., Harden, 37 F.3d at\n601; Burrell, 963 F.2d at 992; Adams, 914 F.2d at 1407. Rather,\nthe Espinosa court seems to be saying simply that the language of\n§ 851(a)(2) is most reasonably parsed to indicate that the\nindictment requirement refers to the present offense, the sentence\nfor which is being enhanced because of the prior conviction. We\nagree with others who have pointed out that there is no evident\ndouble jeopardy or ex post facto problem with construing §\n851(a)(2) as applying to the prior offenses.     As stated by the\nSecond Circuit in Ortiz,\n\n     Enhanced sentencing for recidivism has long been approved\n\n                                      -6-\n\fNinth Circuit noted that the two other usages of the word \"offense\"\n\nin § 851 refer to the current offense while the terms \"prior\n\nconviction\" and \"previous conviction\" are employed to refer to the\n\nearlier conviction.          Id.     Finally, the Ninth Circuit stated that\n\nthe    defendant's        proposed    interpretation      would   result   in    an\n\nanomalous situation.          \"Despite Congress's evident attempt in 1984\n\nto broaden the scope of § 841(b) prior convictions to include state\n\nand foreign convictions (in addition to federal convictions), [the\n\ndefendant's] interpretation would exclude from the statute's ambit\n\nprior convictions in those states or foreign countries that happen\n\nto    use   a    felony    complaint    system   rather    than   a   grand     jury\n\nindictment system.\"          Id.\n\n                Other circuit courts have followed much the same path to\n\na similar result.         See, e.g., Brown, 191 F.3d at 487 (agreeing with\n\nthe circuit courts that have interpreted the indictment requirement\n\nto refer to the present offense); Lynch, 158 F.3d at 197-98 (same);\n\nGaitan-Acevedo, 148 F.3d at 594 (same); Harden, 37 F.3d at 601\n\n(agreeing with        Burrell, Adams and Espinosa); Trevino-Rodriguez,\n\n994 F.2d at 536 (same); Burrell, 963 F.2d at 992-93 (adopting the\n\n\n       notwithstanding that the prior offenses occurred prior to\n       passage of the enhancement provision; the lawfulness of\n       the procedure cannot depend on the semantic factor of\n       whether a recidivism statute refers to the first\n       conviction, or the second, or the combination of the two\n       as requiring the enhancement. In each case, the effect\n       would be exactly the same.\n\nOrtiz, 143 F.3d at 730 (citation omitted).\n\n                                         -7-\n\f\"careful reasoning set forth in Adams and Espinosa\"); Adams, 914\n\nF.2d at 1407 (adopting the reasoning in Espinosa).\n\n          Although Sanchez concedes that precedent is now entirely\n\nagainst him, he relies upon the reasoning employed in a since-\n\nabandoned case that supports his interpretation, to wit, United\n\nStates v. Collado.   There, the defendant successfully argued to a\n\npanel of the Second Circuit that the indictment requirement would\n\nbe \"mere surplusage\" if it referred to the present offense, because\n\n\"[a]ll federal felony prosecutions are required to proceed by\n\nindictment.\"   Collado, 106 F.3d at 1103.    The panel agreed that the\n\nlanguage in § 851(a)(2) was ambiguous.   Id.    It invoked the rule of\n\nlenity to hold that the defendant's sentence in that case should\n\nnot be enhanced based on a prior conviction prosecuted without\n\nindictment or waiver of indictment.    Id.\n\n          The Second Circuit, however, has since rejected the\n\ndecision in Collado.   See Ortiz, 143 F.3d at 731-32.     Writing for\n\nthe court in Ortiz, Judge Leval (a member of the earlier Collado\n\npanel) explained the departure from Collado as being based upon\n\nupdated information presented by the government that \"at the time\n\n§ 851(a)(2) was formulated in 1970, federal felony narcotics\n\nviolations were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin\n\nIslands, and the Panama Canal Zone.\"   Id. at 731.   This information\n\nundermined the Collado court's belief that all relevant federal\n\nprosecutions were by indictment, a mistaken assumption that would\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fhave rendered § 851(a)(2) surplusage if applied to the current\n\noffense.   See id.   The Ortiz panel went on to state that \"[t]he\n\napparent   redundancy   of   §   851(a)(2)   as    applied   to   federal\n\nprosecutions evaporates in light of this information, because the\n\nprovision confers a procedural safeguard for offenders facing\n\ncharges eligible for enhancement . . . in territorial jurisdictions\n\nwhere federal prosecution by information is possible.\"         Id.   While\n\nin Ortiz the Second Circuit characterized § 851(a)(2) as being \"not\n\nfree of ambiguity,\" it found \"it far more sensible in terms of the\n\nstructure and purpose of the statute that the grand jury guarantee\n\nrefers to the instant felony offense.\"       Id.   We agree.\n\n           Sanchez argues, however, that the updated information\n\ndiscussed in Ortiz has done no more than continue to demonstrate\n\nthe inherent ambiguity of § 851(a)(2). Even if federal felony drug\n\noffenses were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin Islands\n\nand the Panama Canal Zone in 1970, it is nonetheless still unclear,\n\nhe argues, whether Congress intended the indictment requirement to\n\napply to the present offense or to the prior convictions.         In light\n\nof the purported ambiguity, Sanchez insists we should invoke the\n\nrule of lenity to preclude the enhancement of his sentence.\n\n           We disagree. \"The rule of lenity applies only if, 'after\n\nseizing everything from which aid can be derived,' we can make 'no\n\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.'\"        Reno v. Koray,\n\n515 U.S. 50, 65 (1995) (citations omitted).        While the language of\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f§ 851(a)(2) is less than crystal clear, it is not so unclear that\n\nresort to the rule of lenity should follow.         See Brown, 191 F.3d at\n\n487 (\"Nor is this section ambiguous such that the rule of lenity\n\nwould preclude the enhancement of [the defendant's] sentence.\");\n\nLampton, 158 F.3d at 256 (rejecting defendant's rule of lenity\n\nargument).      The statutory language, \"unless the person either\n\nwaived or was . . . [indicted] . . . for the offense for which such\n\nincreased    punishment   may    be    imposed,\"   21   U.S.C.   §   851(a)(2)\n\n(emphasis added), points most naturally to the current offense (the\n\noffense for which the increased punishment will be imposed on\n\naccount of the prior convictions) rather than to the enhancing\n\nprior convictions themselves.          And we agree with the Ortiz court\n\nthat it is more reasonable to infer that Congress intended to\n\nensure that the instant prosecution, in which the defendant stands\n\nin jeopardy of an enhanced punishment, is safeguarded by the grand\n\njury guarantee. Ortiz, 143 F.3d at 731-32. Given Congress' intent\n\nto enhance sentences for second offenders, it is also unlikely that\n\nCongress intended to create a varied system that would shield from\n\nenhanced punishment those defendants, such as Sanchez, who commit\n\nserious drug felony offenses simply because of the nature of the\n\ncharging     instrument   used    in    a    particular   state      or   other\n\njurisdiction.     See id. at 732; Lynch, 158 F.3d at 198; Espinosa,\n\n827 F.2d at 617.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            We see no need to say more, given the extensive analysis\n\nalready appearing in Ortiz and the other circuit opinions. We hold\n\nthat the district court's reading of 21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(2) was the\n\ncorrect one, and that the indictment condition in § 851(a)(2)\n\nrefers to the current offense.         Because Sanchez's current offenses\n\nof conviction were prosecuted by indictment, § 851(a)(2) does not\n\npreclude the use of the prior Pennsylvania convictions that were\n\nnot   so   prosecuted   to   trigger    the   enhanced   mandatory   minimum\n\npenalty.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

First, the court noted that \"although one may not be punished twice for the same crime, punishment for a second crime may be enhanced by reason of a second conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> It then concluded that \"a common-sense reading of the phrase `offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed' is the current, or latest, offense.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, the Ninth Circuit noted that the two other usages of the word \"offense\" in &#167; 851 refer to the current offense while the terms \"prior conviction\" and \"previous conviction\" are employed to refer to the earlier conviction. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Ninth Circuit stated that the defendant's proposed interpretation would result in an anomalous situation. \"Despite Congress's evident attempt in 1984 to broaden the scope of &#167; 841(b) prior convictions to include state and foreign convictions (in addition to federal convictions), [the defendant's] interpretation would exclude from the statute's ambit prior convictions in those states or foreign countries that happen to use a felony complaint system rather than a grand jury indictment system.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuit courts have followed much the same path to a similar result. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 191 F.3d at 487 (agreeing with the circuit courts that have interpreted the indictment requirement to refer to the present offense); <i>Lynch,</i> 158 F.3d at 197-98 (same); <i>Gaitan-Acevedo,</i> 148 F.3d at 594 (same); <i>Harden,</i> 37 F.3d at 601 (agreeing with <i>Burrell, Adams</i> and <i>Espinosa</i>); <i>Trevino-Rodriguez,</i> 994 F.2d at 536 (same); <i>Burrell,</i> 963 F.2d at 992-93 (adopting the \"careful reasoning set forth in <i>Adams</i> and <i>Espinosa</i>\"); <i>Adams,</i> 914 F.2d at 1407 (adopting the reasoning in <i>Espinosa</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Sanchez concedes that precedent is now entirely against him, he relies upon the reasoning employed in a since-abandoned case that supports his interpretation, to wit, <i>United States v. Collado.</i> There, the defendant successfully argued to a panel of the Second Circuit that the indictment requirement would be \"mere surplusage\" if it referred to the present offense, because \"[a]ll federal felony prosecutions are required to proceed by indictment.\" <i>Collado,</i> 106 F.3d at 1103. The panel agreed that the language in &#167; 851(a)(2) was ambiguous. <i>Id.</i> It invoked the rule of lenity to hold that the defendant's sentence in that case should not be enhanced based on a prior conviction prosecuted without indictment or waiver of indictment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit, however, has since rejected the decision in <i>Collado. See Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 731-32. Writing for the court in <i>Ortiz,</i> Judge Leval (a member of the earlier <i>Collado</i> panel) explained the departure from <i>Collado</i> as being based upon updated information presented by the government that \"at the time &#167; 851(a)(2) was formulated in 1970, federal felony narcotics violations were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin Islands, and the Panama Canal Zone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 731. This information undermined the <i>Collado</i> court's belief that <i>all</i> relevant federal prosecutions were by indictment, a mistaken assumption that would have rendered &#167; 851(a)(2) surplusage if applied to the current offense. <i>See id.</i> The <i>Ortiz</i> panel went on to state that \"[t]he apparent redundancy of &#167; 851(a)(2) as applied to federal prosecutions evaporates in light of this information, because the provision confers a procedural safeguard for offenders facing charges eligible for enhancement ... in territorial jurisdictions where federal prosecution by information is possible.\" <i>Id.</i> While in <i>Ortiz</i> the Second Circuit characterized &#167; 851(a)(2) as being \"not free of ambiguity,\" it found \"it far more sensible in terms of the structure and purpose of the statute that the grand jury guarantee refers to the instant felony offense.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez argues, however, that the updated information discussed in <i>Ortiz</i> has done no more than continue to demonstrate the inherent ambiguity of &#167; 851(a)(2). Even if federal felony drug offenses were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin Islands and the Panama Canal Zone in 1970, it is nonetheless still unclear, he argues, whether Congress intended the indictment requirement to apply to the present offense or to the prior convictions. In light of the purported ambiguity, Sanchez insists we should invoke the rule of lenity to preclude the enhancement of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. \"The rule of lenity applies only if, `after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,' we can make `no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.'\" <i>Reno v. Koray,</i> 515 U.S. 50, 65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995) (citations omitted). While the language of &#167; 851(a)(2) is less than crystal clear, it is not so unclear that resort to the rule of lenity should follow. <i>See Brown,</i> 191 F.3d at 487 (\"Nor is this section ambiguous such that the rule of lenity would preclude the enhancement of [the defendant's] sentence.\"); <i>Lampton,</i> 158 F.3d at 256 (rejecting defendant's rule of lenity argument). The statutory language, \"unless the person either waived or was ... [indicted]... <i>for the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed,</i>\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(2) (emphasis added), points most naturally to the current offense (the offense for which the increased punishment will be imposed on account of the prior convictions) rather than to the enhancing prior convictions themselves. And we agree with the <i>Ortiz</i> court that it is more reasonable to infer that Congress intended to ensure that the instant prosecution, in which the defendant stands in jeopardy of an enhanced punishment, is safeguarded by the grand jury guarantee. <i>Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 731-32. Given Congress' intent to enhance sentences for second offenders, it is also unlikely that Congress intended to create a varied system that would shield from enhanced punishment those defendants, such as Sanchez, who commit serious drug felony offenses simply because of the nature of the charging instrument used in a particular state or other jurisdiction. <i>See id.</i> at 732; <i>Lynch,</i> 158 F.3d at 198; <i>Espinosa,</i> 827 F.2d at 617.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need to say more, given the extensive analysis already appearing in <i>Ortiz</i> and the other circuit opinions. We hold that the district court's reading of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(2) was the correct one, and that the indictment condition in &#167; 851(a)(2) refers to the current offense. Because Sanchez's current offenses of conviction were prosecuted by indictment, &#167; 851(a)(2) does not preclude the use of the prior Pennsylvania convictions that were not so prosecuted to trigger the enhanced mandatory minimum penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court also ordered Sanchez to forfeit his interest in certain property, consisting of cash exchanged for crack cocaine, held jointly and severally with the three co-defendants.

Rather, the <i>Espinosa</i> court seems to be saying simply that the language of &#167; 851(a)(2) is most reasonably parsed to indicate that the indictment requirement refers to the present offense, the sentence for which is being enhanced because of the prior conviction. We agree with others who have pointed out that there is no evident double jeopardy or <i>ex post facto</i> problem with construing &#167; 851(a)(2) as applying to the prior offenses. As stated by the Second Circuit in <i>Ortiz,</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Enhanced sentencing for recidivism has long been approved notwithstanding that the prior offenses occurred prior to passage of the enhancement provision; the lawfulness of the procedure cannot depend on the semantic factor of whether a recidivism statute refers to the first conviction, or the second, or the combination of the two as requiring the enhancement. In each case, the effect would be exactly the same.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 730 (citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Because Sanchez had been previously convicted of felony drug offenses in the Pennsylvania state courts, the district court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b) and 851. Sanchez argues that the mandatory minimum sentence provision does not apply to him because his prior state convictions were not prosecuted by indictment nor did he waive indictment for those offenses. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On July 24, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted Sanchez and three co-defendants, who are not parties to this appeal, for conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The grand jury also indicted Sanchez on two counts of distribution of 50 grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a); two counts of distribution of five grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a); and one count of criminal forfeiture, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2003, the United States filed a previous offender information under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a), giving notice of the prosecution's intention to seek the enhanced penalties prescribed in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, based on prior state convictions for a felony drug offense. The information alleged that Sanchez had been previously convicted of drug felonies in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Pennsylvania. The parties agree that those felonies were not prosecuted by indictment nor was there a waiver of indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 2003, Sanchez pleaded guilty. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(b), the district court inquired of Sanchez whether he affirmed or denied the prior convictions alleged in the information. Sanchez affirmed the existence of the prior convictions, but argued that they should not be used to enhance his sentence because, in Sanchez's view, enhancement was appropriate only where the prior state felonies were prosecuted by indictment or he had waived indictment for those offenses, pursuant to a provision in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(2), <i>infra.</i> At sentencing, the district court ruled that the indictment requirement set out in &#167; 851(a)(2) applied to the present federal offenses, and not to the prior predicate convictions.

First, the court noted that \"although one may not be punished twice for the same crime, punishment for a second crime may be enhanced by reason of a second conviction.\" <i>Id.</i> It then concluded that \"a common-sense reading of the phrase `offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed' is the current, or latest, offense.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Second, the Ninth Circuit noted that the two other usages of the word \"offense\" in &#167; 851 refer to the current offense while the terms \"prior conviction\" and \"previous conviction\" are employed to refer to the earlier conviction. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Ninth Circuit stated that the defendant's proposed interpretation would result in an anomalous situation. \"Despite Congress's evident attempt in 1984 to broaden the scope of &#167; 841(b) prior convictions to include state and foreign convictions (in addition to federal convictions), [the defendant's] interpretation would exclude from the statute's ambit prior convictions in those states or foreign countries that happen to use a felony complaint system rather than a grand jury indictment system.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuit courts have followed much the same path to a similar result. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 191 F.3d at 487 (agreeing with the circuit courts that have interpreted the indictment requirement to refer to the present offense); <i>Lynch,</i> 158 F.3d at 197-98 (same); <i>Gaitan-Acevedo,</i> 148 F.3d at 594 (same); <i>Harden,</i> 37 F.3d at 601 (agreeing with <i>Burrell, Adams</i> and <i>Espinosa</i>); <i>Trevino-Rodriguez,</i> 994 F.2d at 536 (same); <i>Burrell,</i> 963 F.2d at 992-93 (adopting the \"careful reasoning set forth in <i>Adams</i> and <i>Espinosa</i>\"); <i>Adams,</i> 914 F.2d at 1407 (adopting the reasoning in <i>Espinosa</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Sanchez concedes that precedent is now entirely against him, he relies upon the reasoning employed in a since-abandoned case that supports his interpretation, to wit, <i>United States v. Collado.</i> There, the defendant successfully argued to a panel of the Second Circuit that the indictment requirement would be \"mere surplusage\" if it referred to the present offense, because \"[a]ll federal felony prosecutions are required to proceed by indictment.\" <i>Collado,</i> 106 F.3d at 1103. The panel agreed that the language in &#167; 851(a)(2) was ambiguous. <i>Id.</i> It invoked the rule of lenity to hold that the defendant's sentence in that case should not be enhanced based on a prior conviction prosecuted without indictment or waiver of indictment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit, however, has since rejected the decision in <i>Collado. See Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 731-32. Writing for the court in <i>Ortiz,</i> Judge Leval (a member of the earlier <i>Collado</i> panel) explained the departure from <i>Collado</i> as being based upon updated information presented by the government that \"at the time &#167; 851(a)(2) was formulated in 1970, federal felony narcotics violations were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin Islands, and the Panama Canal Zone.\" <i>Id.</i> at 731. This information undermined the <i>Collado</i> court's belief that <i>all</i> relevant federal prosecutions were by indictment, a mistaken assumption that would have rendered &#167; 851(a)(2) surplusage if applied to the current offense. <i>See id.</i> The <i>Ortiz</i> panel went on to state that \"[t]he apparent redundancy of &#167; 851(a)(2) as applied to federal prosecutions evaporates in light of this information, because the provision confers a procedural safeguard for offenders facing charges eligible for enhancement ... in territorial jurisdictions where federal prosecution by information is possible.\" <i>Id.</i> While in <i>Ortiz</i> the Second Circuit characterized &#167; 851(a)(2) as being \"not free of ambiguity,\" it found \"it far more sensible in terms of the structure and purpose of the statute that the grand jury guarantee refers to the instant felony offense.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez argues, however, that the updated information discussed in <i>Ortiz</i> has done no more than continue to demonstrate the inherent ambiguity of &#167; 851(a)(2). Even if federal felony drug offenses were prosecutable without indictment in the Virgin Islands and the Panama Canal Zone in 1970, it is nonetheless still unclear, he argues, whether Congress intended the indictment requirement to apply to the present offense or to the prior convictions. In light of the purported ambiguity, Sanchez insists we should invoke the rule of lenity to preclude the enhancement of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. \"The rule of lenity applies only if, `after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,' we can make `no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.'\" <i>Reno v. Koray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117943\"><a href=\"/opinion/117943/reno-v-koray/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117943\"><a href=\"/opinion/117943/reno-v-koray/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2021</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117943\"><a href=\"/opinion/117943/reno-v-koray/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span> (1995) (citations omitted). While the language of &#167; 851(a)(2) is less than crystal clear, it is not so unclear that resort to the rule of lenity should follow. <i>See Brown,</i> 191 F.3d at 487 (\"Nor is this section ambiguous such that the rule of lenity would preclude the enhancement of [the defendant's] sentence.\"); <i>Lampton,</i> 158 F.3d at 256 (rejecting defendant's rule of lenity argument). The statutory language, \"unless the person either waived or was ... [indicted]... <i>for the offense for which such increased punishment may be imposed,</i>\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(2) (emphasis added), points most naturally to the current offense (the offense for which the increased punishment will be imposed on account of the prior convictions) rather than to the enhancing prior convictions themselves. And we agree with the <i>Ortiz</i> court that it is more reasonable to infer that Congress intended to ensure that the instant prosecution, in which the defendant stands in jeopardy of an enhanced punishment, is safeguarded by the grand jury guarantee. <i>Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 731-32. Given Congress' intent to enhance sentences for second offenders, it is also unlikely that Congress intended to create a varied system that would shield from enhanced punishment those defendants, such as Sanchez, who commit serious drug felony offenses simply because of the nature of the charging instrument used in a particular state or other jurisdiction. <i>See id.</i> at 732; <i>Lynch,</i> 158 F.3d at 198; <i>Espinosa,</i> 827 F.2d at 617.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need to say more, given the extensive analysis already appearing in <i>Ortiz</i> and the other circuit opinions. We hold that the district court's reading of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(2) was the correct one, and that the indictment condition in &#167; 851(a)(2) refers to the current offense. Because Sanchez's current offenses of conviction were prosecuted by indictment, &#167; 851(a)(2) does not preclude the use of the prior Pennsylvania convictions that were not so prosecuted to trigger the enhanced mandatory minimum penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court also ordered Sanchez to forfeit his interest in certain property, consisting of cash exchanged for crack cocaine, held jointly and severally with the three co-defendants. Sanchez does not challenge this portion of the sentencing decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) imposes a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence for cases involving 50 or more grams of crack cocaine if the defendant commits the violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense. Section 841(b)(1)(B) imposes a 10-year mandatory minimum for cases involving five or more grams of cocaine base if the defendant commits the violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Ninth Circuit does not actually say, as has sometimes been inferred and as the government implies here, that there would be a double jeopardy or<i>ex post facto</i> concern with applying the statute to the prior conviction. <i>See, e.g., Harden,</i> 37 F.3d at 601; <i>Burrell,</i> 963 F.2d at 992; <i>Adams,</i> 914 F.2d at 1407. Rather, the <i>Espinosa</i> court seems to be saying simply that the language of &#167; 851(a)(2) is most reasonably parsed to indicate that the indictment requirement refers to the present offense, the sentence for which is being enhanced because of the prior conviction. We agree with others who have pointed out that there is no evident double jeopardy or <i>ex post facto</i> problem with construing &#167; 851(a)(2) as applying to the prior offenses. As stated by the Second Circuit in <i>Ortiz,</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Enhanced sentencing for recidivism has long been approved notwithstanding that the prior offenses occurred prior to passage of the enhancement provision; the lawfulness of the procedure cannot depend on the semantic factor of whether a recidivism statute refers to the first conviction, or the second, or the combination of the two as requiring the enhancement. In each case, the effect would be exactly the same.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ortiz,</i> 143 F.3d at 730 (citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
