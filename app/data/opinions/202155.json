Uribe-Londono on brief pro se.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa and\nGermán A. Rieckenhoff, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 12, 2006\n\f                Per Curiam.     Appellant Jesus Alberto Uribe-Londono is\n\ncurrently serving a 120-month sentence after having been convicted\n\nof two counts of sexual exploitation of children, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2251.       We affirmed the conviction and sentence on May\n\n20, 2005.        See United States v. Uribe-Londono, No. 02-2027, slip\n\nop. (1st Cir. May 20, 2005) (per curiam).                While the direct appeal\n\nwas    pending,     appellant    filed   a     motion   in   the   district    court\n\nrequesting the return of seized property pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 41(g).1        Appellant now challenges the district court's denial\n\nboth       of   that   motion    and     of     his     subsequent    motion    for\n\nreconsideration.2\n\n                Rule 41(g) provides that \"[a] person aggrieved by an\n\nunlawful search and seizure or by the deprivation of property may\n\nmove the district court . . . for the return of property on the\n\nground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of the\n\n\n       1\n      Although the parties cite Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e), the\nprovision authorizing motions to return seized property is now\nfound at Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g).\n       2\n      The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review\nthese rulings because the notice of appeal was not filed within the\nten-day period for filing an appeal in a criminal case. See Fed.\nR. App. P. 4(b).    We will assume, without deciding, that this\nappeal is timely. First, even if the ten-day period applies, the\nprisoner mailbox rule, Fed. R. App. P. 4(c), would make the appeal\ntimely. Second, it may be that the Rule 41(g) motion should be\ntreated as a civil complaint for equitable relief, see United\nStates v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995), the denial of\nwhich is subject to the sixty-day appeal deadline applicable in\ncivil cases under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). See United States v.\nPotes Ramirez, 260 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir. 2001); United States\nv. Bein, 214 F.3d 408, 412 n.3 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n                                         -2-\n\fproperty.      The court shall receive evidence on any issue of fact\n\nnecessary to the decision of the motion.\"        A criminal defendant is\n\npresumed to have the right to the return of his property once it is\n\nno longer needed as evidence.       United States v. Dean, 100 F.3d 19,\n\n20 (5th Cir. 1996); United States v. Mills, 991 F.2d 609, 612 (9th\n\nCir. 1993).     However, \"[a] Rule 41[(g)] motion is properly denied\n\nif the defendant is not entitled to lawful possession of the seized\n\nproperty, the property is contraband or subject to forfeiture or\n\nthe government's need for the property as evidence continues.\"\n\nMills, 991 F.2d at 612 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see United States v. Duncan, 918 F.2d 647, 654 (6th Cir.\n\n1990) (explaining that \"a defendant's right to the return of\n\nlawfully seized property is subject to any continuing interest the\n\ngovernment has in the property\")           The government's interest may\n\ntake a variety of different forms; what matters is that it is a\n\nlegitimate interest.      Duncan, 918 F.2d at 654.\n\n              Oddly, the arguments both parties assert on appeal are\n\nsubstantially different than those raised in the district court.\n\nThe government maintains that the documentary evidence and camera\n\nequipment appellant seeks to have returned constitute derivative\n\ncontraband (and is, therefore, subject to forfeiture).               In the\n\nproceedings     below,   the    government   objected   to   returning   the\n\nproperty on the ground that it constituted evidence related to the\n\ncase,   but    it   neither    characterized   the   items   as   derivative\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcontraband       nor     expressly        claimed      that    they   were     subject       to\n\nforfeiture.\n\n             Appellant seems to view the June 2, 2005, denial of his\n\nmotion    for    reconsideration           as    the   equivalent        of   an    order    of\n\nforfeiture and argues in his brief that the government's retention\n\nof the items in question without initiating forfeiture proceedings\n\nviolates his due process rights.                  In the district court, however,\n\nappellant seemed to concede that the government had a right to\n\nretain case-related material and only disputed the government's\n\ncharacterization of the items in question as such.                                 Since both\n\nparties failed to raise their forfeiture arguments before the\n\ndistrict court, they are not properly before us on appeal.                                  See\n\nTeamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it\n\nis   that,      absent       the   most    extraordinary         circumstances,         legal\n\ntheories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached\n\nfor the first time on appeal\").\n\n             Given that the government did not expressly assert below\n\nthat the property was derivative contraband or otherwise subject to\n\nforfeiture, the district court's failure to explain its denial of\n\nappellant's motions or hold an evidentiary hearing to determine\n\nwhether the property in dispute was case-related would seem to\n\nsuggest      that      its    rulings      were       not     intended    to       adjudicate\n\nappellant's ownership rights.               Since at least some of the property\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fappellant sought--e.g., the camera equipment used in committing the\n\ncrime and documentary materials that were found to contain contact\n\ninformation for minors--obviously related to the underlying case,\n\nit seems more likely that the district court simply concluded that\n\nappellant's requests were premature and that the government had\n\nadequately shown a need to retain the items as evidence until the\n\ncriminal proceedings had concluded.        We see no error in that\n\nruling.   See United States v. Saunders, 957 F.2d 1488, 1495 (8th\n\nCir. 1992)(holding that \"[t]he motion for the return of paperwork,\n\neven papers that were not introduced at trial, was premature\n\nbecause defendant's direct appeal was still pending\").         Now that\n\nthe criminal proceedings have concluded, appellant can renew his\n\nrequest for return of property in the district court.           To the\n\nextent    the   government   suggests   that,   even   after   criminal\n\nproceedings have terminated, it may retain non-contraband items\n\nwithout instituting forfeiture proceedings, we do not pass on that\n\nargument as it has not been sufficiently briefed.\n\n           Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
