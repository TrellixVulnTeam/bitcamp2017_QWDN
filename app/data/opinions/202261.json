Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nDefender Office, for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 13, 2006\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.     Following a two-day trial, a\n\njury convicted defendant-appellant Gilberto Brown (\"Brown\") of two\n\ncounts of distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1).    Brown was sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment.         The\n\ndistrict court based the sentence on a finding that the substance\n\nBrown distributed was crack cocaine and that, given the nature of\n\nhis offense and his criminal history, 70 months was a reasonable\n\nsentence to impose.     Brown now challenges both his conviction and\n\nsentence.     After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n             Brown was arrested after an investigation in which he\n\nmade   two   drug   sales    to   government   informant   Steven   Rheaume\n\n(\"Rheaume\"). Rheaume initiated the purchases from Brown in January\n\nand February 2004.          On both occasions, Rheaume called Brown's\n\ncellular phone to arrange the deal at a specific gas station.         Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (\"DEA\") officers recorded the calls and\n\nsubsequently observed a beige Kia Sephia, registered to Brown,\n\nleave Brown's apartment and return shortly thereafter. Rheaume was\n\ndriven to the meeting place in a van by Detective Mark Newport\n\n(\"Detective Newport\") of the Portsmouth Police Department. On both\n\noccasions, the same beige Kia identified at Brown's apartment\n\npulled into the gas station in front of the van.       Detective Newport\n\ntestified that he recognized the driver as Brown from a photograph.\n\nHe also made an in-court identification of Brown as the man he had\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fseen in the beige Kia.         For each purchase, Rheaume went for a short\n\nride in the beige Kia and the DEA received body wire recordings of\n\nthe conversations taking place between Rheaume and the driver of\n\nthe Kia. After the two purchases, Rheaume handed over to Detective\n\nNewport   4.2    grams   and    2.2   grams,     respectively,       of    a   mixture\n\ncontaining cocaine base.          Detective Newport, in turn, handed the\n\nsubstance over to the DEA.\n\n              Brown was indicted for two counts of distribution of\n\ncocaine   base    in    violation     of    21   U.S.C.   §    841(a)(1)       and   was\n\nconvicted of both counts following a two-day trial.                       He received\n\nthe minimum sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines of 70 months'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n              Brown now appeals, raising several issues.                   First, he\n\ncontends that the district court twice erred in admitting testimony\n\nfrom DEA Agent Edward Bals (\"Agent Bals\"), who identified Brown as\n\nthe person with whom Rheaume had spoken over the phone and in the\n\nbeige Kia even though the agent lacked sufficient knowledge of\n\nBrown's voice.         Second, Brown contends that the district court\n\nerred    in   determining      his    offense     level       by   ruling,     without\n\nexplicitly finding, that the \"cocaine-based\" substance at issue was\n\ncrack.    Third, Brown contends that the district court imposed an\n\nunreasonable sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f                           II.   Discussion\n\n          A.   Evidentiary Issues\n\n          1.   Agent Bals's Testimony Regarding the Phone Calls\n\n          The district court admitted testimony from Agent Bals,\n\nthe coordinator of the investigation against Brown, in which Bals\n\ndescribed the recorded telephone calls that took place prior to\n\neach of the two purchases between Rheaume and the person who sold\n\nRheaume the cocaine.    Agent Bals indicated that Brown was the\n\nperson who made statements to Rheaume during the calls as to where\n\nand when the deal would take place.      However, Agent Bals did not\n\nfirst demonstrate that he could identify Brown's voice.           The\n\ndistrict court denied Brown's objection that Agent Bals's testimony\n\ncontravened the Federal Rules of Evidence, which prohibit a witness\n\nfrom testifying to a matter in which he lacks personal knowledge or\n\nqualifying expertise.      See Fed. R. Evid. 602.     Because Brown\n\nobjected below, we review the admission of Agent Bals's testimony\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    United States v. Gilbert, 181 F.3d 152,\n\n160 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          In its brief, the government argued that the admission of\n\nAgent Bals's testimony was not error because it was offered not for\n\nthe purpose of identifying Brown as the speaker in the telephone\n\nconversations, but rather to explain the actions taken by the DEA\n\nin its investigation of Brown.      The government argued that Agent\n\nBals's reference to the phone calls served to corroborate the\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fsurveillance of Brown and his vehicle going to and from Brown's\n\napartment.   The government also argued that, even if admission of\n\nthe testimony was error, it was harmless.              At oral argument,\n\nhowever, the government changed its approach and conceded that\n\nAgent Bals's testimony as elicited was error but went on to argue\n\nthat the error was harmless.     For purposes of this appeal, we will\n\nassume that admission of the testimony was error.\n\n           When a court errs in admitting evidence, we will not\n\nreverse if the error is harmless, i.e., \"if it is highly probable\n\nthat the error did not influence the verdict.\"          United States v.\n\nGarcía-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2004).        We find that this\n\nis such a case.   At trial, and prior to any testimony from Agent\n\nBals, Rheaume testified from first-hand knowledge that Brown was\n\nthe other person on the phone. Further, both Rheaume and Detective\n\nNewport made in-court identifications of Brown as the person who\n\narrived in the brown Kia.       Since the challenged testimony from\n\nAgent Bals added little to the testimony already provided by\n\nRheaume and Detective Newport, we see no reason to believe that a\n\nre-trial   excluding   the   impermissible   portion    of    Agent   Bals's\n\ntestimony would result in a different outcome.         See id.\n\n           2.   Agent Bals's Testimony Regarding the Body Wire\n           Recordings\n\n           At trial, Agent Bals also testified about the mini-disc\n\nrecordings of the conversations that took place between Rheaume and\n\nBrown in the beige Kia during the two drug deals.            Brown contests\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe admissibility of this testimony, claiming that Agent Bals\n\nlacked   appropriate   knowledge   to    identify     the   speaker   in   the\n\nrecordings as Brown.   Since this issue is raised for the first time\n\non appeal, we review for plain error.      United States v. Medina, 427\n\nF.3d 88, 91 (1st Cir. 2005).       To successfully argue plain error,\n\n\"the challenging party has the burden of showing (1) an error, (2)\n\nthat is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (i.e. the error\n\nwas not harmless), and (4) that seriously undermines the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"             United\n\nStates v. Glenn, 389 F.3d 283, 288 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The   government   conceded    at   oral    argument   that     the\n\nadmission of this testimony was error. However, even assuming that\n\nthe admission of the testimony was error and that the error was\n\nplain, we find that it did not affect substantial rights because it\n\nwas harmless. Brown therefore cannot meet the third prong of plain\n\nerror review.\n\n           The inclusion of Agent Bals's testimony cannot be said to\n\nhave affected the outcome of the case.         Agent Bals described the\n\nrecordings on the mini-disc as between Rheaume and Brown only after\n\nRheaume had testified to the same.         In light of the first-hand\n\nidentification testimony provided by both Rheaume and Detective\n\nNewport, along with the corroborating circumstantial evidence that\n\nthe seller was in Brown's vehicle, traveled to and from Brown's\n\napartment at the time of the drug deals, and employed Brown's\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcellular phone, we find that the admission of Agent Bals' testimony\n\nwas not plain error.\n\n            B.    Cocaine Base versus \"Crack\"\n\n            Brown was convicted for distributing 6.4 grams of cocaine\n\nbase in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).            We have held that the\n\nterm \"cocaine base\" in 21 U.S.C. § 841 \"includes all forms of\n\ncocaine base, including but not limited to crack.\"              United States\n\nv. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).               However, as used\n\nin   the   Sentencing    Guidelines,      \"cocaine    base\"   has     a    narrower\n\nmeaning.    Id.    Under the Guidelines\n\n            \"Cocaine base,\" for the purposes of this\n            guideline, means \"crack.\"     \"Crack\" is the\n            street name for a form of cocaine base,\n            usually   prepared   by  processing   cocaine\n            hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and\n            usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c), Note (D).          Thus, under the Guidelines, \"forms\n\nof   cocaine     base   other   than    crack   are   treated    as       cocaine.\"\n\nRichardson, 225 F.3d at 49.            The district court found that Brown\n\nwas responsible for cocaine base as that term is used by the\n\nGuidelines and assigned him a total offense level of twenty-six.1\n\nBecause Brown \"was sentenced under the Guideline provision for\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The base level for an offense involving a quantity of \"cocaine\nbase\" -- as that term is defined by the Guidelines, i.e., crack --\nis equivalent to that for an offense involving 100 times that\nquantity of \"cocaine.\" U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcocaine base[,] his sentence . . . depended on a finding that the\n\nsubstance attributed to him was crack.\"       Id. at 50.2\n\n          Brown appeals the district court's finding that the\n\n\"cocaine-based\" substance in the instant case is \"crack\" and\n\ncontends that he should have received an offense level consistent\n\nwith the distribution of \"cocaine.\"3          We review the district\n\ncourt's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its factual\n\nfindings for clear error.   United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 24\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          The district court based its finding that Brown was\n\nresponsible for crack on the fact that he was convicted for\n\ndistribution of \"cocaine base.\"        The district court (and the\n\ngovernment) believed that \"cocaine base,\" as used in 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841, had the same meaning as \"cocaine base\" as used in the\n\nGuidelines.   The   court   believed   that   because   Brown   had   been\n\nconvicted of distributing \"cocaine base\" under 21 U.S.C. § 841, he\n\nwas necessarily responsible for \"cocaine base\" -- i.e., crack --\n\nunder the Guidelines. However, as the government admits on appeal,\n\nthis view was erroneous and contrary to our holding in Richardson.\n\n\n\n2\n   At sentencing, Brown argued that the government had failed to\nprove that he distributed crack.\n3\n   The Sentencing Guidelines distinguish only between \"cocaine\nbase,\" defined as \"crack,\" and \"cocaine.\" The latter, undefined,\ncould therefore include other forms of cocaine base and certainly\nincludes cocaine hydrochloride (powder cocaine).     See U.S.S.G.\n§ 2D1.1(c).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           Nevertheless, if there is sufficient evidence to support\n\nan   alternative   explanation    for   the   court's   finding   that   the\n\nsubstance at issue was crack, the error is harmless and there would\n\nbe no reason to remand to the district court when the result would\n\nbe the same.   See, e.g., United States v. Pizarro-Berríos, __ F.3d\n\n__, 2006 WL 1195664, at *5 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).           We therefore\n\nturn to whether the district court's finding that the substance in\n\nquestion was crack is supported by the record.\n\n           In Richardson, we stated that the distinction in the form\n\nof cocaine base lies not in its chemical profile, as crack is\n\nchemically identical to other forms of cocaine base, but rather its\n\nphysical properties. 225 F.3d at 50. While laboratory testing and\n\nexpert testimony can specifically identify when sodium bicarbonate\n\n-- which is often used in making crack -- is present, crack is also\n\nuniquely identified by its \"rock-like\" texture and yellowish or\n\noff-white color.    See id.      Lay opinion as to the appearance of a\n\nsubstance to this effect may be used to prove that the substance is\n\ncrack.   Id.\n\n           A survey of the record reveals the following evidence in\n\nsupport of a finding that the substance Brown sold was crack: (1)\n\na forensic chemist testified that the substance given to her for\n\ntests was cocaine base in \"rock-like form\"; (2) Rheaume testified\n\nthat he ordered crack from Brown, and the two discussed Brown\n\ngetting \"those things\" for Rheaume, which Rheaume explained meant\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f\"crack\"; (3) Detective Newport testified that Rheaume gave him a\n\n\"hard   rock-like   substance,\"    and   identified   the   substance     as\n\n\"crack\";   and   (4)   Agent   Bals,   with   twenty-one    years   of   law\n\nenforcement experience, testified that each bag of drugs turned\n\nover to the DEA contained a \"rock, off-white substance,\" which\n\nappeared to him to be crack cocaine.            In view of all of the\n\ntestimony presented at trial, see id., and in light of the \"'utter\n\nabsence' of evidence that the substance was anything other than\n\ncrack cocaine,\" United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), we discern no clear error in the district court's\n\ndetermination that the substance at issue in this case was crack.4\n\n           C.    The Reasonableness of the Sentence\n\n           We now turn to Brown's only remaining claim, that his\n\nsentence was unreasonable.      Given an offense level of twenty-six,\n\nand a Criminal History Category of II, the Guidelines range for\n\nBrown's sentence was 70-87 months.        The district court imposed a\n\nsentence at the low end of the range, 70 months' imprisonment on\n\neach distribution count, to run concurrently, to be followed by\n\nthree years of supervised release.       We evaluate the reasonableness\n\n\n\n4\n    Brown argues that the record does not support a finding of\n\"crack\" because the evidence does not indicate that the substance\nat issue was \"smokable.\" We have never held that the government\nmust prove that a substance is smokable in order for there to be a\nproper finding that the substance was crack, and we decline to do\nso here. While smokability might be relevant to the inquiry, we do\nnot think that it is a necessary element for finding a substance to\nbe crack.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fof this within-Guidelines sentence according to the methodology set\n\nforth in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 516-19 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc) (holding that regardless of whether a sentence\n\nfalls inside or outside the applicable Guideline range, we use the\n\ndistrict      court's       reasons     for     a   sentence     to       assess   its\n\nreasonableness).\n\n              After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt's sentencing procedure did not run afoul of Jiménez-Beltre.\n\nThe   court    consulted      the     Guidelines    along    with     the    relevant\n\nstatutory factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) prior to handing down its\n\nfinal decision.       See United States v. Sagendorf,           445 F.3d 515, 517\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (in affirming the defendant's sentence, noting that\n\nthe district court had consulted the § 3553(a) factors and the\n\nGuidelines before deciding that sentence at the bottom of the\n\nGuidelines range was reasonable and just).               The court also stated\n\nthat it took into account the statutory factors, along with Brown's\n\n\"record as a whole,\" specifically noting Brown's \"troubled history\"\n\nand that the offenses were \"deliberate sales\" of \"highly addictive\n\ndrugs.\"    With these facts in mind, the district court stated that\n\n\"60 to 75, 80 months is where I would be absent the advisory\n\nguidelines,     and    70    months    certainly     seems     like   a    reasonable\n\nsentence.\"\n\n              Brown also argues that the court's reference to the\n\nreasonableness of the sentence it was choosing to impose is an\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\findication that the court treated the Guidelines as presumptively\n\nreasonable, in contravention with Jiménez-Beltre.                We disagree.\n\nThe district court is required to give due weight to the Guidelines\n\nrange in providing justification for the sentence. Jiménez-Beltre,\n\n440 F.3d at 518; Booker, 543 U.S. at 264 (\"The district courts,\n\nwhile not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult [them] and\n\ntake them into account when sentencing.\").            By indicating that a\n\n70-month sentence would have been appropriate even in the absence\n\nof the Guidelines, the court dispelled any suspicion that the\n\nGuidelines were the determinative, or even controlling, factor.5\n\nIn other words, the district court determined where it would be\n\nwithout the Guidelines.     Then, taking the Guidelines into account\n\nas   an   additional   factor,   it    decided     that   70   months   was   an\n\nappropriate sentence.      We do not think that the district court\n\nconsidered the Guidelines to be presumptively reasonable.\n\n            The court provided a \"plausible,\" and therefore at least\n\n\"defensible,\" explanation for the sentence.               See Sagendorf, 445\n\nF.3d at 518.    We therefore find that the sentence was reasonable.\n\n                            III.      Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Brown's conviction\n\nand sentence.\n\n\n\n5\n    Brown also argues that his sentence was unfair and thus\n\"unreasonable\" because the Guidelines treat one gram of crack as\nequivalent to 100 grams of cocaine. We reject this argument. See\nUnited States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                      -12-\n\f",

Rheaume was driven to the meeting place in a van by Detective Mark Newport (\"Detective Newport\") of the Portsmouth Police Department. On both occasions, the same beige Kia identified at Brown's apartment pulled into the gas station in front of the van. Detective Newport testified that he recognized the driver as Brown from a photograph. He also made an in-court identification of Brown as the man he had seen in the beige Kia. For each purchase, Rheaume went for a short ride in the beige Kia and the DEA received body wire recordings of the conversations taking place between Rheaume and the driver of the Kia. After the two purchases, Rheaume handed over to Detective Newport 4.2 grams and 2.2 grams, respectively, of a mixture containing cocaine base.

Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Agent Bals's Testimony Regarding the Phone Calls</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted testimony from Agent Bals, the coordinator of the investigation against Brown, in which Bals described the recorded telephone calls that took place prior to each of the two purchases between Rheaume and the person who sold Rheaume the cocaine. Agent Bals indicated that Brown was the person who made statements to Rheaume during the calls as to where and when the deal would take place. However, Agent Bals did not first demonstrate that he could identify Brown's voice. The district court denied Brown's objection that Agent Bals's testimony contravened the Federal Rules of Evidence, which prohibit a witness from testifying to a matter in which he lacks personal knowledge or qualifying expertise. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 602. Because Brown objected below, we review the admission of Agent Bals's testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Gilbert,</i> 181 F.3d 152, 160 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, the government argued that the admission of Agent Bals's testimony was not error because it was offered not for the purpose of identifying Brown as the speaker in the telephone conversations, but rather to explain the actions taken by the DEA in its investigation of Brown. The government argued that Agent Bals's reference to the phone calls served to corroborate the surveillance of Brown and his vehicle going to and from Brown's apartment. The government also argued that, even if admission of the testimony was error, it was harmless. At oral argument, however, the government changed its approach and conceded that Agent Bals's testimony as elicited was error but went on to argue that the error was harmless. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that admission of the testimony was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court errs in admitting evidence, we will not reverse if the error is harmless, i.e., \"if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2004). We find that this is such a case. At trial, and prior to any testimony from Agent Bals, Rheaume testified from first-hand knowledge that Brown was the other person on the phone. Further, both Rheaume and Detective Newport made in-court identifications of Brown as the person who arrived in the brown Kia. Since the challenged testimony from Agent Bals added little to the testimony already provided by Rheaume and Detective Newport, we see no reason to believe that a re-trial excluding the impermissible portion of Agent Bals's testimony would result in a different outcome. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Agent Bals's Testimony Regarding the Body Wire Recordings</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Agent Bals also testified about the mini-disc recordings of the conversations that took place between Rheaume and Brown in the beige Kia during the two drug deals. Brown contests the admissibility of this testimony, claiming that Agent Bals lacked appropriate knowledge to identify the speaker in the recordings as Brown. Since this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 427 F.3d 88, 91 (1st Cir.2005). To successfully argue plain error, \"the challenging party has the burden of showing (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (i.e. the error was not harmless), and (4) that seriously undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Glenn,</i> 389 F.3d 283, 288 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government conceded at oral argument that the admission of this testimony was error. However, even assuming that the admission of the testimony was error and that the error was plain, we find that it did not affect substantial rights because it was harmless. Brown therefore cannot meet the third prong of plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inclusion of Agent Bals's testimony cannot be said to have affected the outcome of the case. Agent Bals described the recordings on the mini-disc as between Rheaume and Brown only after Rheaume had testified to the same. In light of the first-hand identification testimony provided by both Rheaume and Detective Newport, along with the corroborating circumstantial evidence that the seller was in Brown's vehicle, traveled to and from Brown's apartment at the time of the drug deals, and employed Brown's cellular phone, we find that the admission of Agent Bals' testimony was not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Cocaine Base versus \"Crack\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown was convicted for distributing 6.4 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). We have held that the term \"cocaine base\" in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 \"includes all forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to crack.\" <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.2000). However, as used in the Sentencing Guidelines, \"cocaine base\" has a narrower meaning. <i>Id.</i> Under the Guidelines</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Cocaine base,\" for the purposes of this guideline, means \"crack.\" \"Crack\" is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c), Note (D). Thus, under the Guidelines, \"forms of cocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d at 49. The district court found that Brown was responsible for cocaine base as that term is used by the Guidelines and assigned him a total offense level of twenty-six.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because Brown \"was sentenced under the Guideline provision for cocaine base[,] his sentence. . . depended on a finding that the substance attributed to him was crack.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown appeals the district court's finding that the \"cocaine-based\" substance in the instant case is \"crack\" and contends that he should have received an offense level consistent with the distribution of \"cocaine.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Meada,</i> 408 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its finding that Brown was responsible for crack on the fact that he was convicted for distribution of \"cocaine base.\" The district court (and the government) believed that \"cocaine base,\" as used in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, had the same meaning as \"cocaine base\" as used in the Guidelines. The court believed that because Brown had been convicted of distributing \"cocaine base\" under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, he was necessarily responsible for \"cocaine base\" &#8212; i.e., crack &#8212; under the Guidelines. However, as the government admits on appeal, this view was erroneous and contrary to our holding in <i>Richardson.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, if there is sufficient evidence to support an alternative explanation for the court's finding that the substance at issue was crack, the error is harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result would be the same. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pizarro-Berr&#237;os,</i> 448 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2006). We therefore turn to whether the district court's finding that the substance in question was crack is supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Richardson,</i> we stated that the distinction in the form of cocaine base lies not in its chemical profile, as crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base, but rather its physical properties. 225 F.3d at 50. While laboratory testing and expert testimony can specifically identify when sodium bicarbonate &#8212; which is often used in making crack &#8212; is present, crack is also uniquely identified by its \"rock-like\" texture and yellowish or off-white color. <i>See id.</i> Lay opinion as to the appearance of a substance to this effect may be used to prove that the substance is crack. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A survey of the record reveals the following evidence in support of a finding that the substance Brown sold was crack: (1) a forensic chemist testified that the substance given to her for tests was cocaine base in \"rock-like form\"; (2) Rheaume testified that he ordered crack from Brown, and the two discussed Brown getting \"those things\" for Rheaume, which Rheaume explained meant \"crack\"; (3) Detective Newport testified that Rheaume gave him a \"hard rock-like substance,\" and identified the substance as \"crack\"; and (4) Agent Bals, with twenty-one years of law enforcement experience, testified that each bag of drugs turned over to the DEA contained a \"rock, off-white substance,\" which appeared to him to be crack cocaine. In view of all of the testimony presented at trial, <i>see id.,</i> and in light of the \"`utter absence' of evidence that the substance was anything other than crack cocaine,\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.1998), we discern no clear error in the district court's determination that the substance at issue in this case was crack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to Brown's only remaining claim, that his sentence was unreasonable. Given an offense level of twenty-six, and a Criminal History Category of II, the Guidelines range for Brown's sentence was 70-87 months. The district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the range, 70 months' imprisonment on each distribution count, to run concurrently, to be followed by three years of supervised release. We evaluate the reasonableness of this within-Guidelines sentence according to the methodology set forth in <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 516-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc) (holding that regardless of whether a sentence falls inside or outside the applicable Guideline range, we use the district court's reasons for a sentence to assess its reasonableness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court's sentencing procedure did not run afoul of <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> The court consulted the Guidelines along with the relevant statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) prior to handing down its final decision. <i>See United States v. Sagendorf,</i> 445 F.3d 515, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (in affirming the defendant's sentence, noting that the district court had consulted the &#167; 3553(a) factors and the Guidelines before deciding that sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was reasonable and just). The court also stated that it took into account the statutory factors, along with Brown's \"record as a whole,\" specifically noting Brown's \"troubled history\" and that the offenses were \"deliberate sales\" of \"highly addictive drugs.\" With these facts in mind, the district court stated that \"60 to 75, 80 months is where I would be absent the advisory guidelines, and 70 months certainly seems like a reasonable sentence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown also argues that the court's reference to the reasonableness of the sentence it was choosing to impose is an indication that the court treated the Guidelines as presumptively reasonable, in contravention with <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> We disagree. The district court is required to give due weight to the Guidelines range in providing justification for the sentence. <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518; <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738 (\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult [them] and take them into account when sentencing.\"). By indicating that a 70-month sentence would have been appropriate even in the absence of the Guidelines, the court dispelled any suspicion that the Guidelines were the determinative, or even controlling, factor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In other words, the district court determined where it would be without the Guidelines. Then, taking the Guidelines into account as an additional factor, it decided that 70 months was an appropriate sentence. We do not think that the district court considered the Guidelines to be presumptively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court provided a \"plausible,\" and therefore at least \"defensible,\" explanation for the sentence. <i>See Sagendorf,</i> 445 F.3d at 518. We therefore find that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Brown's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The base level for an offense involving a quantity of \"cocaine base\" &#8212; as that term is defined by the Guidelines, i.e., crack &#8212; is equivalent to that for an offense involving 100 times that quantity of \"cocaine.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At sentencing, Brown argued that the government had failed to prove that he distributed crack</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Guidelines distinguish only between \"cocaine base,\" defined as \"crack,\" and \"cocaine.\" The latter, undefined, could therefore include other forms of cocaine base and certainly includes cocaine hydrochloride (powder cocaine)<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Brown argues that the record does not support a finding of \"crack\" because the evidence does not indicate that the substance at issue was \"smokable.\" We have never held that the government must prove that a substance is smokable in order for there to be a proper finding that the substance was crack, and we decline to do so here. While smokability might be relevant to the inquiry, we do not think that it is a necessary element for finding a substance to be crack</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Brown also argues that his sentence was unfair and thus \"unreasonable\" because the Guidelines treat one gram of crack as equivalent to 100 grams of cocaine.

To successfully argue plain error, \"the challenging party has the burden of showing (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (i.e. the error was not harmless), and (4) that seriously undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Glenn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201354\"><a href=\"/opinion/201354/united-states-v-glenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span>, 288 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government conceded at oral argument that the admission of this testimony was error. However, even assuming that the admission of the testimony was error and that the error was plain, we find that it did not affect substantial rights because it was harmless. Brown therefore cannot meet the third prong of plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inclusion of Agent Bals's testimony cannot be said to have affected the outcome of the case. Agent Bals described the recordings on the mini-disc as between Rheaume and Brown only after Rheaume had testified to the same. In light of the first-hand identification testimony provided by both Rheaume and Detective Newport, along with the corroborating circumstantial evidence that the seller was in Brown's vehicle, traveled to and from Brown's apartment at the time of the drug deals, and employed Brown's cellular phone, we find that the admission of Agent Bals' testimony was not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Cocaine Base versus \"Crack\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown was convicted for distributing 6.4 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). We have held that the term \"cocaine base\" in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 \"includes all forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to crack.\" <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199073\"><a href=\"/opinion/199073/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2000). However, as used in the Sentencing Guidelines, \"cocaine base\" has a narrower meaning. <i>Id.</i> Under the Guidelines</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Cocaine base,\" for the purposes of this guideline, means \"crack.\" \"Crack\" is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c), Note (D). Thus, under the Guidelines, \"forms of cocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d at 49. The district court found that Brown was responsible for cocaine base as that term is used by the Guidelines and assigned him a total offense level of twenty-six.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because Brown \"was sentenced under the Guideline provision for cocaine base[,] his sentence. . . depended on a finding that the substance attributed to him was crack.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown appeals the district court's finding that the \"cocaine-based\" substance in the instant case is \"crack\" and contends that he should have received an offense level consistent with the distribution of \"cocaine.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Meada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201597\"><a href=\"/opinion/201597/united-states-v-meada/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court based its finding that Brown was responsible for crack on the fact that he was convicted for distribution of \"cocaine base.\" The district court (and the government) believed that \"cocaine base,\" as used in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, had the same meaning as \"cocaine base\" as used in the Guidelines. The court believed that because Brown had been convicted of distributing \"cocaine base\" under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, he was necessarily responsible for \"cocaine base\" &#8212; i.e., crack &#8212; under the Guidelines. However, as the government admits on appeal, this view was erroneous and contrary to our holding in <i>Richardson.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, if there is sufficient evidence to support an alternative explanation for the court's finding that the substance at issue was crack, the error is harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result would be the same. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pizarro-Berr&#237;os,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202191\"><a href=\"/opinion/202191/united-states-v-pizarro-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2006). We therefore turn to whether the district court's finding that the substance in question was crack is supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Richardson,</i> we stated that the distinction in the form of cocaine base lies not in its chemical profile, as crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base, but rather its physical properties. 225 F.3d at 50. While laboratory testing and expert testimony can specifically identify when sodium bicarbonate &#8212; which is often used in making crack &#8212; is present, crack is also uniquely identified by its \"rock-like\" texture and yellowish or off-white color. <i>See id.</i> Lay opinion as to the appearance of a substance to this effect may be used to prove that the substance is crack. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A survey of the record reveals the following evidence in support of a finding that the substance Brown sold was crack: (1) a forensic chemist testified that the substance given to her for tests was cocaine base in \"rock-like form\"; (2) Rheaume testified that he ordered crack from Brown, and the two discussed Brown getting \"those things\" for Rheaume, which Rheaume explained meant \"crack\"; (3) Detective Newport testified that Rheaume gave him a \"hard rock-like substance,\" and identified the substance as \"crack\"; and (4) Agent Bals, with twenty-one years of law enforcement experience, testified that each bag of drugs turned over to the DEA contained a \"rock, off-white substance,\" which appeared to him to be crack cocaine. In view of all of the testimony presented at trial, <i>see id.,</i> and in light of the \"`utter absence' of evidence that the substance was anything other than crack cocaine,\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197938\"><a href=\"/opinion/197938/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1998), we discern no clear error in the district court's determination that the substance at issue in this case was crack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to Brown's only remaining claim, that his sentence was unreasonable. Given an offense level of twenty-six, and a Criminal History Category of II, the Guidelines range for Brown's sentence was 70-87 months. The district court imposed a sentence at the low end of the range, 70 months' imprisonment on each distribution count, to run concurrently, to be followed by three years of supervised release. We evaluate the reasonableness of this within-Guidelines sentence according to the methodology set forth in <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 516-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc) (holding that regardless of whether a sentence falls inside or outside the applicable Guideline range, we use the district court's reasons for a sentence to assess its reasonableness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court's sentencing procedure did not run afoul of <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> The court consulted the Guidelines along with the relevant statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) prior to handing down its final decision. <i>See United States v. Sagendorf,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202175\"><a href=\"/opinion/202175/united-states-v-sagendorf/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (in affirming the defendant's sentence, noting that the district court had consulted the &#167; 3553(a) factors and the Guidelines before deciding that sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was reasonable and just). The court also stated that it took into account the statutory factors, along with Brown's \"record as a whole,\" specifically noting Brown's \"troubled history\" and that the offenses were \"deliberate sales\" of \"highly addictive drugs.\" With these facts in mind, the district court stated that \"60 to 75, 80 months is where I would be absent the advisory guidelines, and 70 months certainly seems like a reasonable sentence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown also argues that the court's reference to the reasonableness of the sentence it was choosing to impose is an indication that the court treated the Guidelines as presumptively reasonable, in contravention with <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> We disagree. The district court is required to give due weight to the Guidelines range in providing justification for the sentence. <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518; <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 264, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137739\"><a href=\"/opinion/137739/united-states-v-booker/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span> (\"The district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult [them] and take them into account when sentencing.\"). By indicating that a 70-month sentence would have been appropriate even in the absence of the Guidelines, the court dispelled any suspicion that the Guidelines were the determinative, or even controlling, factor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In other words, the district court determined where it would be without the Guidelines. Then, taking the Guidelines into account as an additional factor, it decided that 70 months was an appropriate sentence. We do not think that the district court considered the Guidelines to be presumptively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court provided a \"plausible,\" and therefore at least \"defensible,\" explanation for the sentence. <i>See Sagendorf,</i> 445 F.3d at 518. We therefore find that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

While smokability might be relevant to the inquiry, we do not think that it is a necessary element for finding a substance to be crack</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Brown also argues that his sentence was unfair and thus \"unreasonable\" because the Guidelines treat one gram of crack as equivalent to 100 grams of cocaine.
