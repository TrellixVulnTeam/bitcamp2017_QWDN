McGaughey,  Assistant  United States  Attorney,\n                           \nwith whom Jay  P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Jonathan\n                                                                 \nChapman, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for the\n       \nUnited States.\n\n                                              \n\n                          June 18, 1993\n                                             \n\n          Per  Curiam.    In  this  criminal  appeal,  defendant-\n          Per  Curiam.\n                     \n\nappellant  Stephen Dyer challenges his sentence.   He makes three\n\nclaims.\n\n          1.   Dyer contends that the career offender guidelines,\n\nU.S.S.G.     4B1.1, 4B1.2, impermissibly  exceed the scope  of 28\n\nU.S.C.   994(h),  the pertinent enabling statute  and, therefore,\n\ncould not validly be employed to enhance his sentence.  The Third\n\nCircuit  repudiated  precisely  the same  asseveration  in United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v. Whyte, 892 F.2d 1170 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 1070 (1990).  We think  the Whyte court correctly upheld the\n                                      \n\ncareer offender guidelines, and we reject appellant's argument on\n\nthe basis of Whyte.  See id. at 1174.\n                            \n\n          2.    Next,  Dyer contends  that  his  criminal record,\n\nthough extensive,  does not include two predicate offenses of the\n\ntype necessary to animate  the career offender guidelines.   This\n\nargument  was  not  presented  to  the  district  court  and  is,\n\ntherefore, waived.   See United States v. Dietz,  950 F.2d 50, 55\n                                               \n\n(1st Cir.  1991) (stating,  in connection  with sentencing,  that\n\n\"arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be\n\nraised for the first time in an appellate venue\").\n\n          Moreover, even if we were  to reach the point, we would\n\nreject it on the merits.  Dyer concedes that he was  convicted of\n\na  controlled  substance  offense  coming  within  the  ambit  of\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(2).1  In  addition, he was convicted of burglary\n\n                    \n\n     1This   offense  is  described   in  paragraph  78   of  the\npresentence investigation report (PSI Report).\n\n                                2\n\nunder 17-A M.R.S.A.   401(1) (a statute that criminalizes illegal\n\nentry into a structure).2  We  have made it abundantly clear that\n\nsuch a  crime is properly  includable as a predicate  offense for\n\npurposes  of the career  offender guidelines.   See, e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113\n                                                            \n\nS. Ct. 1850 (1993).   And, moreover, consistent with the caselaw,\n\ne.g., id. at 3; United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d 703,  705-06 (1st\n                                     \n\nCir. 1992), we decline appellant's  invitation to peek behind the\n\nconviction  and  examine its  particular  facts.   See  Taylor v.\n                                                              \n\nUnited States, 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990).3\n             \n\n          3.   Finally,  Dyer contends  that  the district  court\n\nimpermissibly  withheld  an  offense-level   reduction  based  on\n\nacceptance of  responsibility.   See U.S.S.G.    3E1.1.   The key\n                                    \n\nquestion  under section  3E1.1  is not  whether  a defendant  has\n\nmouthed  \"a  pat recital  of the  vocabulary of  contrition,\" but\n\nwhether he has  accepted full responsibility for his  part in the\n\noffense  of conviction  by  demonstrating  \"candor and  authentic\n\nremorse.\"   United States  v. Royer,  895 F.2d  28, 30 (1st  Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990);  accord, e.g., United  States v.  Uricoechea-Casallas, 946\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 162, 167 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n601, 606 (1st Cir. 1990).  The  defendant has the task of proving\n\n                    \n\n     2This  offense  is  described in  paragraph  52  of  the PSI\nReport.\n\n     3We note in passing that  appellant does not come within the\nnarrow exception to Taylor, see 495 U.S. at 602, as  he proffered\n                               \nneither the indictment nor the jury instructions for the district\ncourt's perusal.   The appellate record is,  of course, similarly\nbarren.\n\n                                3\n\nhis  entitlement to  an acceptance-of-responsibility  credit, see\n                                                                 \n\nBradley,   917  F.2d   at  606,   and   the  sentencing   court's\n       \n\ndetermination to withhold the credit may be set aside only  if it\n\nis clearly erroneous.  See Royer, 895 F.2d at 29.\n                                \n\n          We discern no  clear error in this instance.   Dyer did\n\nnot  appear  for his  appointed  sentencing.   He  was thereafter\n\napprehended  in a  hotel  room,  under an  alias.   Given  Dyer's\n\nboycotting of the scheduled day  of reckoning, the district court\n\nacted  well within  its lawful  power in  declining to  award him\n\ncredit  for  acceptance  of responsibility.    See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Yeo, 936 F.2d 628, 628-29 (1st Cir. 1991).\n             \n\n          We need go  no further.4  Having carefully reviewed the\n\nentire  record, we conclude,  without serious question,  that the\n\ndistrict  court  imposed  an  appropriate,  lawfully  constituted\n\nsentence.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                    \n\n     4Since career  offender status  requires proof  of only  two\nprior  convictions for predicate  offenses, we need  not consider\nwhether,  as the lower court  ruled, the convictions described in\nparagraphs 50, 59a and 60, respectively, of the PSI, also qualify\nas predicate offense convictions.\n\n                                4\n",

The  defendant has the task of proving\n\n                    \n\n     2This  offense  is  described in  paragraph  52  of  the PSI\nReport.\n\n     3We note in passing that  appellant does not come within the\nnarrow exception to Taylor, see 495 U.S. at 602, as  he proffered\n                               \nneither the indictment nor the jury instructions for the district\ncourt's perusal.   The appellate record is,  of course, similarly\nbarren.\n\n                                3\n\nhis  entitlement to  an acceptance-of-responsibility  credit, see\n                                                                 \n\nBradley,   917  F.2d   at  606,   and   the  sentencing   court's\n       \n\ndetermination to withhold the credit may be set aside only  if it\n\nis clearly erroneous.  See Royer, 895 F.2d at 29.\n                                \n\n          We discern no  clear error in this instance.   Dyer did\n\nnot  appear  for his  appointed  sentencing.   He  was thereafter\n\napprehended  in a  hotel  room,  under an  alias.   Given  Dyer's\n\nboycotting of the scheduled day  of reckoning, the district court\n\nacted  well within  its lawful  power in  declining to  award him\n\ncredit  for  acceptance  of responsibility.    See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v.
