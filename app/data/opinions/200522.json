Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                           Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                      Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                        and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Manuel Verissimo on brief pro se.\n     Ethan B. Kanter, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice,\nRobert D. McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, and Michael P. Lindemann, Assistant Director, on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                                June 26, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.     Petitioner Manuel Verissimo appeals pro se\n\nfrom the district court's dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. § 2241\n\npetition.    We have reviewed the parties' briefs and the record on\n\nappeal.     We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the\n\nmagistrate judge's August 7, 2002, report and recommendation, which\n\nthe district court accepted on August 28, 2002.          We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n            The government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction\n\nover Petitioner's claims because Petitioner failed to exhaust these\n\nclaims before the administrative agency pursuant to Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\") § 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).               We\n\nhave not yet decided whether the exhaustion requirement in INA §\n\n242(d)(1) applies to § 2241 habeas petitions.           We certainly have\n\njurisdiction over purely constitutional issues.          See Ravindran v.\n\nINS, 976 F.2d 754, 762 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Assuming,     without   deciding,   that    this    court    has\n\njurisdiction over all of Petitioner's claims, we agree with the\n\nlower court that these claims are meritless.             With respect to\n\nPetitioner's equal protection challenge, to the extent Petitioner\n\ncontinues to pursue it, the lower court correctly determined that\n\nPetitioner failed to state a claim because an alien convicted of\n\nPetitioner's    narcotics    violation    (possession    with   intent   to\n\ndistribute heroin) is ineligible for a waiver under INA § 212(h),\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), regardless of whether or not the alien is a\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\flawful permanent resident.              Because lawful permanent residents and\n\nnon-lawful residents in Petitioner's situation are treated the same\n\nunder    INA    §    212(h),      there     is    no   disparate      treatment,    and,\n\naccordingly, no equal protection violation.\n\n               With respect to Petitioner's claimed rights under the\n\nInternational Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (\"ICCPR\"), the\n\nlower court correctly determined that INA § 212(h) trumps the\n\nICCPR.     \"[A]n Act of Congress . . . is on a full parity with a\n\ntreaty    [and]      when    a    statute    which     is   subsequent    in    time    is\n\ninconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict\n\nrenders the treaty null.\"                 Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 376\n\n(1998).     Congress amended INA § 212(h) in 1996 (disqualifying\n\naggravated          felons       like     Petitioner        from   eligibility         for\n\ndiscretionary cancellation of removal), see Illegal Immigration\n\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-594, well after the ICCPR was signed in\n\n1992.     Taveras-Lopez v. Reno, 127 F. Supp.2d 598, 609 (M.D. Pa.\n\n2000).    The IIRIRA thus \"displaces any obligation assumed by the\n\nUnited States as a 1992 signatory to the ICCPR.\"                       Id.     Moreover,\n\n\"no enactment of Congress can be challenged on the ground that it\n\nviolates customary international law.\"                  Id. (quoting Committee of\n\nU.S. Citizens Living in Nicaragua v. Reagan, 859 F.2d 929, 939\n\n(D.C. Cir.       1988)).          Thus,   even    assuming     that    Petitioner      has\n\njudicially enforceable rights under the ICCPR, an issue we do not\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fdecide, because Congress has precluded the possibility of a waiver\n\nof removal for aliens in Petitioner's position, Petitioner cannot\n\nrely on the ICCPR and customary international law to request a\n\nhearing on why he should not be removed. Petitioner's request that\n\nthis court rewrite INA § 212(h) to accord with the ICCPR is beyond\n\nour province.   See, e.g., United States v. Charles George Trucking\n\nCo., 823 F.2d 685, 689 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that court has no\n\nwarrant to rewrite statute).\n\n          With respect to Petitioner's claimed rights under Article\n\n36 of the Vienna Convention, we agree with the lower court that,\n\neven assuming that Petitioner has actionable rights under the\n\nVienna Convention and that those rights were violated, Petitioner\n\nis not entitled to have his prior conviction and subsequent removal\n\norder vacated because there is no \"express, or undeniably implied,\n\nprovision for such remedies in [the] treaty's text.\" United States\n\nv. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2000); see United States v.\n\nAdemaj, 170 F.3d 58, 67 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"the Vienna\n\nConvention itself prescribes no judicial remedy or other recourse\n\nfor its violation\").      Accordingly, the lower court correctly\n\ndismissed the petition.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
