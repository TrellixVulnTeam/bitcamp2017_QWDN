William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                      Before\n\n                           Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                        Hug,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                        and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James R. Knudsen, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                                 April 26, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.      The path to this sentencing appeal began on\n\nDecember 27, 2004, when defendant-appellant Matthew Jones entered\n\na guilty plea to a two-count indictment charging (i) possession of\n\na firearm as a convicted felon, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and (ii)\n\nsimple possession of over five grams of cocaine base, see 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 844(a).   Certain key facts are undisputed.          After a chase, police\n\nfound   Jones     on   the   ground,   with   his   hands   behind   his   head.\n\nConcealed under nearby leaves was a pistol with the clip removed.\n\nThe police discovered the clip, which contained four rounds, in an\n\nadjacent manhole and three more rounds in the same vicinity.                  A\n\nsearch of Jones's person disclosed that he had over five grams of\n\ncrack cocaine in his pocket.\n\n            The    presentence     investigation      report    (PSI   Report)\n\nrecommended a two-level reckless-endangerment enhancement, see USSG\n\n§3C1.2, because Jones had fled from the arresting officer while\n\nholding the pistol and, as he ran, had turned toward the officer\n\nwith the pistol in his hand.           On Jones's objection, the probation\n\nofficer amended the PSI Report to delete the reckless-endangerment\n\nenhancement.      The government then filed a sentencing memorandum in\n\nwhich it argued in favor of restoring the enhancement.\n\n            The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nApril 4, 2005.         The PSI Report stated that there were no factors\n\nwarranting a departure from the guideline sentencing range (GSR),\n\nand neither side questioned that conclusion. The government argued\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fsuccessfully in favor of the reckless-endangerment enhancement.\n\nWith the inclusion of that enhancement, Jones's total offense level\n\nwas 27.      The court placed him, without objection, in criminal\n\nhistory category IV.        This combination yielded a GSR of 100-125\n\nmonths.\n\n             When the district court inquired why the government had\n\nnot sought some form of upward variation or adjustment based on the\n\nfact that Jones had jumped bail and fled to Alabama after state\n\nauthorities had charged him with a crime in connection with the\n\nsame incident, the Assistant United States Attorney — not the same\n\nindividual who argued the case before us on the government's behalf\n\n— responded that the possibility of such a variation or adjustment\n\nhad never occurred to him.         The court then asked defense counsel\n\nwhether an upward variance would be appropriate in light of the\n\nbail-jumping incident.       Counsel objected to any consideration of\n\nsuch a variance based on the absence of prior notice that the court\n\nmight embrace this option.        The government agreed with the defense\n\nthat the lack of prior notice prevented immediate consideration of\n\nthe issue.     The court overruled the prior notice objection, citing\n\nits discretion under the advisory guidelines. See United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 233 (2005).\n\n             The district court thereafter suggested, for the first\n\ntime,   that   it   might   run   the    two   components   of   the   sentence\n\nconsecutively. As with the possibility of an upward variance based\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fon the bail-jumping incident, this sentence-lengthening possibility\n\nhad neither been discussed in the PSI Report nor advanced by the\n\ngovernment in its pre-hearing memorandum.        The defense again\n\nobjected on notice grounds.\n\n            In due course, the district court proceeded to impose\n\nsentence.   The statutory maximum for the gun count was ten years,\n\nwhile the drug count carried a statutory mandatory minimum of five\n\nyears and a statutory maximum of twenty years.    The court imposed\n\nthe maximum ten-year sentence on the gun count and the mandatory\n\nminimum five-year sentence on the drug count.    If run concurrently\n\nthe sentence would have been within the GSR for the crimes of\n\nconviction, but running the terms consecutively resulted in an\n\naggregate period of incarceration that exceeded the top of the GSR\n\nby fifty-five months.    It seems clear that, in arriving at this\n\nresult, the court factored in some grounds that had not been\n\ncontemplated in either the PSI Report or the prosecution's pre-\n\nhearing submissions.\n\n            Jones appeals his sentence.    He challenges (i) the\n\npropriety of the reckless-endangerment enhancement; (ii) the lack\n\nof notice with respect to several grounds relied on by the court\n\nand, particularly, with respect to the imposition of consecutive\n\nterms of immurement; and (iii) the reasonableness of the overall\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          This case comes to us in an odd posture.         Jones argues —\n\nand the government concedes — that the sentence should be vacated\n\nand the case remanded for resentencing because, among other things,\n\nthe district court deviated from the GSR based on unexpected\n\ngrounds and without giving any advance notice.          We are not bound,\n\nof course, to accept the government's confession of error, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), but we choose to do so here.\n\n          Our    rationale   is   multifaceted.     First,   because   the\n\nchange-of-plea   colloquy    predated    the   Booker   Court's   watershed\n\ndecision but the sentencing itself post-dated that decision, the\n\napplicable sentencing regime changed mid-stream (from mandatory\n\nguidelines to advisory guidelines); hence, the case falls into a\n\npeculiar time warp.    Second, as Jones points out, the sentencing\n\ntranscript indicates that the district court mis-recollected what\n\nit had told Jones at the change-of-plea hearing and may have acted\n\non that mis-recollection.     Third, since the district court imposed\n\nsentence in this case, we decided United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,\n\n440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir. 2006), in which we clarified how sentencing\n\nshould proceed under the advisory guidelines.             Because Jones's\n\nobjections were preserved and there is some question whether the\n\ndistrict court correctly anticipated the Jiménez-Beltre protocol,\n\nit makes sense to eliminate any doubt and allow the court to act\n\nwith full knowledge of that protocol.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                Last — but surely not least — the two legal points on\n\nwhich this appeal ordinarily would turn — whether the running of\n\nthe two components of the sentence consecutively constituted a\n\ndeparture rather than a variance and, if not, whether the advance\n\nnotice requirement of Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 131\n\n(1991), and Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(h) should apply by analogy to\n\ndeviations from the advisory guidelines (as opposed to departures)\n\n— are freighted with uncertainty.2            We are reluctant to decide so\n\nnuanced     a    set   of   questions   where,   as   here,   the   adversarial\n\nrelationship has been compromised.               After all, both sides are\n\nagreed that the sentence should be vacated and the case remanded\n\nfor resentencing, and no amici have filed briefs.              We think that,\n\nunder these unusual circumstances, the course of prudence, in\n\nfairness both to the parties and to the able district judge, is to\n\nallow the court to make a fresh start and formulate the sentence\n\nanew.\n\n                We need go no further. For the reasons alluded to above,\n\nwe honor the parties' joint request, vacate Jones's sentence, and\n\nremand for resentencing.         We take no view as to the reasonableness\n\n\n        2\n      For example, the circuits are divided on the issue of whether\nprior notice is required before a sentencing court, operating under\nadvisory guidelines, may deviate from the GSR on a ground neither\nargued by the government in its pre-sentencing memorandum nor\nelaborated in the PSI Report. Compare, e.g., United States v. Long\nSoldier, 431 F.3d 1120, 1122 (8th Cir. 2005) (holding that no such\nprior notice is required), with, e.g., United States v. Dozier, ___\nF.3d ___, ___ (10th Cir. 2006) [2006 WL 864877, at *2] (holding to\nthe contrary).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fof the sentence previously imposed, the sustainability of any of\n\nthe lower court's sentencing determinations,3 or the contested\n\n\"prior notice\" issue.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Jones invites us to pass upon the validity of the reckless-\nendangerment enhancement before remanding to the district court.\nWe decline the invitation. It seems to us more efficient, in the\npeculiar circumstances of this case, to afford the district court\nas much flexibility as possible in refashioning the sentence. Cf.\nUnited States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1989)\n(en banc) (noting, in the context of a partial reversal of a\nmulticount conviction, that the district court is in the best\nposition to tailor an overall sentence suitable to the offense and\nthe offender).\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",
