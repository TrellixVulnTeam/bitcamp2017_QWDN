(1952) &#167; 3670, against four parcels of real estate in Massachusetts, which it alleged that certain of the defendants as delinquent income tax payers had transferred subject to the lien to two other defendants as trustees. The various defendants answered and following a pre-trial hearing at which all counsel were present, the court entered an order directing the two trustee-defendants to pay $200 per month from the income of the property to each of two transferor-defendants who, the court found, were in dire financial need.
