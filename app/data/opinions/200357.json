Appellant Harry Yohe is a\n\nretired member of the Army Green Berets.     In May of 1997, Yohe\n\nresided in Townsend, Massachusetts and was stationed at Fort\n\nDevens.   On the evening of May 11, 1997, police responded to a\n\nreport of a domestic disturbance involving Yohe.        The police\n\ninterviewed Yohe's spouse at the neighbor's residence and she told\n\nthem that, Yohe was threatening suicide and had amassed an arsenal\n\nof weapons.   Yohe's wife informed police that her husband had been\n\nacting irrationally and had armed himself with two AK-47 rifles, a\n\nKevlar helmet and 400 rounds of ammunition. She also reported that\n\nYohe, who was on antidepressants, had been drinking since the\n\nprevious day and was home alone with his seventeen year-old son.\n\n          Townsend Police and Massachusetts State Police evidently\n\ntook Mrs. Yohe's report very seriously, because they dispatched a\n\nsmall army to Yohe's house.    Thirty police vehicles, including a\n\nSWAT team and a hostage negotiator converged on the Yohe home, only\n\nto find that Yohe had left the residence.   Police later found Yohe\n\nat Fort Devens, where he was arrested at approximately 1:30 A.M. on\n\nMay 12, 1997.\n\n          After his arrest at Fort Devens, Yohe was transported to\n\nNashoba Deaconess Hospital for a medical evaluation.   He was then\n\ntransferred to St. Elizabeth's hospital in Brighton for further\n\ntreatment and psychiatric evaluation.   Although the record is less\n\nthan clear on this point, it appears that both hospitals discharged\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fYohe   shortly   after   admitting   him,   finding   no   evidence   of\n\nintoxication or suicidal ideation.\n\n          On May 13th and 14th, two local newspapers printed\n\nstories about the arrest.     Peter Nugent of the Worcester Telegram\n\n& Gazette and Kate Walsh, a reporter for the Townsend Times\n\npublished articles about the arrest, without identifying Yohe by\n\nname. The two articles were substantially similar and we reproduce\n\nthe Townsend Times article in full here.\n\n                   DOMESTIC SITUATION TURNS UGLY\n\n          TOWNSEND--Many local residents were alarmed Sunday night\nwith the sight of up to 30 state police vehicles traveling through\nthe streets of Townsend. Police Chief William May had called in\nthe extra forces when a woman reported a drunk and suicidal husband\nin possession of deadly fire power and hundreds of rounds of\nammunition.\n\n          The domestic dispute between husband and wife began at\nabout 7 p.m. on Mother's Day, stated May. Police were called at\napproximately 8:30 p.m. when the woman reported that she and her\nchildren had left the house with a drunk and suicidal husband still\ninside. The unidentified woman alerted police of the presence of\ntwo AK47s and 500 rounds of ammunition in the house, with her\nhusband identified as a former soldier connected with special\nforces units.\n\n          \"He had been drinking all weekend,\" stated May. \"She\nalso told us that her older son was either in the house or on his\nway there . . . We determined that he was there.\"\n\n          With the unidentified man in custody by midnight, police\nconfirmed that he had been drinking. May stated it was his belief\nthat the man was suicidal. No charges have been brought against\nhim.\n\n          The operation was secured at 4 a.m. Monday morning.\n\n          The Nugent and Walsh articles were published one and two\n\ndays after Yohe's arrest, hospitalization and discharge.        Each of\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe articles was based entirely on interviews with Chief May.\n\nNugent and Walsh had each interviewed May in the past, and finding\n\nhim to be a credible source, did not conduct an independent\n\ninvestigation before publishing the articles.                      Consequently,\n\nneither article contained any information about Yohe's eventual\n\ndischarge     from   the   hospital,     or   about       the   results     of   any\n\nexaminations he underwent.         It is undisputed that the articles\n\naccurately recounted Chief May's statements to Nugent and Walsh.\n\n            As for May himself, his statements were based on the\n\npolice incident report, which memorialized the telephone report and\n\nrequest for assistance by Yohe's spouse.                  There is no also no\n\ndispute about the accuracy of Chief May's statements regarding\n\nYohe's spouse's domestic dispute report.\n\n            Yohe sued Nugent and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette,\n\nand   Walsh     of   Nashoba     Publications,        Inc.      [the   \"Newspaper\n\ndefendants\"] for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress.     Yohe also sued Chief May for defamation and intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.             Additionally, he brought an\n\naction   against     May   and   the   town   for     a    variety     of   alleged\n\nconstitutional violations connected with Yohe's arrest and May's\n\nstatements to the media.           The district court granted summary\n\njudgment to the Newspaper defendants on the ground that the reports\n\nwere either truthful or protected by the fair report privilege.\n\nThe court also granted summary judgment for Chief May, finding that\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhis statements were not defamatory because they simply conveyed\n\n\"information he received in his official capacity and which served\n\nas the basis for the arrest.\"           Further, his statements could not\n\ngive rise to a suit for intentional infliction for emotional\n\ndistress because the statements were not extreme and outrageous.\n\nYohe now appeals the district court's summary dismissal of his\n\ndefamation and infliction of emotional distress claims.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\n              We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nfor Chief May and the Newspaper defendants de novo.                 We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment only if there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and if the appellees are entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.       Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287\n\nF.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              Defamation    is   the   publication,       either    orally    or   in\n\nwriting, of a statement          concerning the plaintiff which is false\n\nand causes damage to the plaintiff.            McAvoy v. Shufrin, 401 Mass.\n\n593, 587 (1988). To establish a claim of defamation, a plaintiff\n\nmust    satisfy     the   following    elements.      First,       the    defamatory\n\nstatement must \"hold the plaintiff up to contempt, hatred, scorn,\n\nor ridicule or tend to impair his standing in the community, at\n\nleast    to   his   discredit    in    the   minds   of    a   considerable        and\n\nrespectable class in the community.\"               Tartaglia v. Townsend, 19\n\nMass. App. Ct. 693, 696 (1985) (quotation omitted).                      Second, the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fstatement must have been to at least one other individual other\n\nthan the one defamed. Brauer v. Globe Newspaper Company, 351 Mass.\n\n53, 56 (1966).        Third, where the speech is a matter of public\n\nconcern, a defamation plaintiff must prove not only that the\n\nstatements    were    defamatory,    but    also   that      they   were   false.1\n\nDulgarian     v.   Stone,    420   Mass.    843,    847      (1995);   see    also\n\nPhiladelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 776 (1986)\n\n(holding that where plaintiff is a private figure and newspaper\n\narticles are a matter of public concern, there is a \"constitutional\n\nrequirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity,\n\nas well as fault, before recovering damages\").                      Finally, the\n\nplaintiff must show that he suffered special damages and must set\n\nforth these damages specifically.           Lynch v. Lyons, 303 Mass. 116,\n\n119 (1939).\n\n            With     that   background     in   mind,   we    now   analyze   the\n\nstatements of Chief May and the Newspaper defendants to determine\n\nwhether any of these statements can support a claim of defamation\n\nor intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Ordinarily, the standard of fault in defamation cases turns on\nwhether the plaintiff is a private figure or a public official.\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). Here, there is\nsome question about whether or not Yohe's former position as\n\"second in command at Fort Devens Reserve Forces Training Area\"\nelevates him into public official status. Nevertheless because we\ndecide Yohe's defamation claims against the Newspaper defendants on\ngrounds of privilege, we do not reach the issue of whether Yohe is\na private figure for defamation purposes.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          A.     Chief May's Statements\n\n          Yohe alleges that Chief May's statements defamed him and\n\nintentionally inflicted emotional distress.             Specifically, Yohe\n\nchallenged the following statements that May made to the press: (1)\n\nthat Yohe \"was a retired member of the Army Special Forces of Green\n\nBerets and has been trained as a sniper;\" (2) that Yohe had\n\n\"threatened to kill himself and was reported to be armed with\n\nseveral large caliber weapons;\" and (3) \"it was [May's] belief that\n\n[Yohe] was suicidal.\"\n\n          As the district court judge noted,\n\n          Reading the newspaper articles in their\n          entirety, it is clear that May was simply\n          reporting information he received in his\n          official capacity and which served as the\n          basis for the arrest. He makes clear that the\n          information    was   derived   from    witness\n          statements, and qualifies his recitation of\n          facts   with   phrases  like   \"according   to\n          witnesses,\" \"it was [my] belief,\" and \"it was\n          reported.\"    While plaintiff challenges the\n          veracity of the underlying information May\n          gathered from witnesses, he does not refute\n          that those facts were reported to May, or that\n          they were the premise of his conduct.\n\nYohe v.   May,    No.   CIV.A.   00-10802-RWZ,   2002    WL   924225   at   *1\n\n(D.Mass., March 14, 2002).\n\n          May's statements referring to Yohe's military background,\n\nto the fact that he was heavily armed and that he was in a\n\ndisturbed mental state on May 11, 1997 amount to nothing more than\n\nunrefuted statements of fact. Although Yohe now challenges these\n\nstatements, the fact is that most of them are either true or have\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnever been shown to be false.     Yohe carries the burden of showing\n\nthat each allegedly defamatory statement is materially false.\n\nDulgarian, 420 Mass. at 847; see also Phantom Touring Inc. v.\n\nAffiliated Publ'ns, 953 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that\n\n\"statements made by a media defendant must be provable as false\n\nbefore there can be defamation liability\").\n\n             Moreover, other statements referring to Yohe's background\n\ncould not -- even if they were proven false -- amount to defamatory\n\nlanguage.      For instance, Yohe now claims that although he was a\n\nGreen Beret, he did not receive \"sniper training.\"         While this\n\naspect of the articles may be inaccurate, inaccuracy by itself does\n\nnot make a statement defamatory.        It is inconceivable that this\n\ninaccurate account of Yohe's Special Forces training could hold\n\nYohe \"up to contempt, hatred, scorn, or ridicule or tend to impair\n\nhis standing in the community.\"     See Tartaglia, 19 Mass. App. Ct.\n\nat 696.\n\n             The only other statement Yohe characterizes as defamatory\n\nis the statement \"May stated it was his belief that [Yohe] was\n\nsuicidal.\"     Unlike the other challenged statements which recited\n\nbasic facts about Yohe's background and his conduct on May 11, this\n\nstatement plainly constitutes Chief May's opinion about Yohe's\n\nmental state the night of the arrest.     May's opinion was of obvious\n\nrelevance to the reporters' stories because, as the Telegram\n\narticle explained, Yohe \"was arrested under a state law that allows\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fpolice to take into custody anyone who is considered at risk of\n\nharming himself.\"\n\n            To determine whether or not a statement is an opinion,\n\na court \"must 'examine the statement in its totality and in the\n\ncontext in which it was uttered or published.                            The court must\n\nconsider all the words used . . . [and] must give weight to\n\ncautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement.'\n\nFinally,     the    court    must    consider       all       of   the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding the statement.\"           Lyons v. Globe Newspaper Co.,                    415\n\nMass. 258, 263 (1993), quoting Fleming v. Benzaquin, 390 Mass. 175,\n\n180-81 (1983).      Here, the qualified language of the statement (\"it\n\nwas his belief\") makes clear that May was expressing his own\n\nopinion about Yohe's mental state on May 11 and 12, 1997.\n\n            Of course, the fact that a statement is an opinion does\n\nnot automatically shield it from a defamation claim.                          After all,\n\n\"expressions of 'opinion' may often imply an assertion of objective\n\nfact.\"     Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 18 (1990);\n\nDulgarian,    420    Mass.    at    849.         Thus,    a   cause      of   action   for\n\ndefamation may still be sustained where an opinion \"implies the\n\nallegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the\n\nopinion.\" Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Inc. v. Central Broad.\n\nCorp., 379 Mass. 220, 227-28 (1979). Chief May's opinion, however,\n\nwas based on disclosed nondefamatory facts.                    As the district court\n\ncorrectly noted, May \"makes clear that the information was derived\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\ffrom witness statements, and qualifies his recitation of facts with\n\nphrases like 'according to witnesses' . . . and 'it was reported.'\"\n\nYohe v. May, 2002 WL 924225 at *1.            Since the articles establish\n\nthat May's opinion was based on witness statements and reports he\n\nreceived, the \"logical nexus between the facts and the opinion\n\nsufficiently apparent to render unreasonable any inference that the\n\nderogatory opinion was must have been based on undisclosed facts.\"\n\nDulgarian, 420 Mass. at 850-51, quoting Lyons, 415 Mass. at 266.\n\nAn   \"expression      of   opinion    based       on   disclosed   or   assumed\n\nnondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of\n\ndefamation, no matter how unjustified or unreasonable the opinion\n\nmay be or how derogatory it is.\"            Id.    Consequently, Chief May's\n\nopinion about Yohe's mental state is not actionable.\n\n          In sum, the statements challenged by Yohe all fall into\n\none of three categories: (1) unrefuted statements of fact; (2)\n\nstatements which -- although likely false -- could not reasonably\n\nbe considered offensive to the average person in the community; and\n\n(3) statements of opinion based upon disclosed facts.               As none of\n\nthese types of statements provides a basis for a defamation cause\n\nof action, Yohe's defamation claim against Chief May fails.\n\n             Yohe   also   alleges   that     Chief    May's    statements    are\n\nsufficient    to    find   May   liable   for     intentional    infliction   of\n\nemotional distress.        This claim is premised on precisely the same\n\nfacts as his defamation claim.            To prevail, Yohe must show: (1)\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthat May intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or\n\nshould have known that emotional distress was the likely result of\n\nhis conduct; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous, was\n\nbeyond all possible bounds of decency and was utterly intolerable\n\nin a civilized community; (3) that May's actions were the cause of\n\nYohe's distress; and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by\n\nYohe was severe.    Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140, 144-45\n\n(1976) (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n           Two reporters asked Chief May why thirty police cruisers\n\nand   a   SWAT   team   descended     on   a    residence   in   Townsend,\n\nMassachusetts.     May explained, in the most professional manner\n\npossible, that the officers were dispatched to ensure a calm\n\nresolution in a domestic dispute involving a heavily armed and\n\npotentially suicidal ex-Green Beret.           He provided the public with\n\nan accurate summary of the facts as they had been reported to him,\n\nand, without identifying Yohe by name, justified his decision to\n\narrest him by explaining that he believed Yohe might be suicidal.\n\nMay's conduct cannot in any way be described as \"extreme and\n\noutrageous.\"     Consequently, Yohe's emotional distress claim fails.\n\n           Finally, Yohe claims that Chief May made defamatory\n\nstatements to other law enforcement officials about Yohe being\n\nsuicidal and dangerous, and that these statements resulted in the\n\nfalse arrest, physical beating, invasion of privacy and warrantless\n\nsearch of Yohe's home.    He claims that May's actions violated his\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fconstitutional rights and seeks relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.    These claims have been briefed by the parties and reviewed\n\nby this Court, and we find them to be without merit.\n\n            B.     The Newspaper Defendants\n\n            Yohe's claim against the Newspaper defendants is premised\n\non the same facts and statements as his claim against Chief May.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to the Newspaper\n\ndefendants on the ground that, as a matter of law, the news account\n\nof Yohe's arrest was a privileged fair report of governmental\n\nconduct.    We agree.\n\n            The fair report privilege \"allows those who fairly and\n\naccurately report certain types of official or governmental action\n\nto   be   immune    from   liability    for   claims   arising   out   of   such\n\nreports.\"    ELM Medical Laboratory, Inc. v. RKO General Inc., 403\n\nMass. 779, 782 (1989).        The purpose of the privilege is to ensure\n\nthat publications may perform the important function of informing\n\nthe public of actions taken by government agencies and officials.\n\nSee Sibley v. Holyoke Transcript-Telegram Publ'g Co., 391 Mass.\n\n468, 472 (1984).       As set forth in ELM Medical,\n\n            The [fair report privilege] recognizes that\n            (1) the public has a right to know of official\n            government actions that affect the public\n            interest, (2) the only practical way many\n            citizens can learn of these actions is through\n            a report by the news media, and (3) the only\n            way news outlets would be willing to make such\n            a report is if they are free from liability,\n            provided that their report was fair and\n            accurate.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fELM Medical, 403 Mass. at 782 (internal quotations and citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            To qualify for the fair report privilege the report must\n\nbe a fair and accurate portrayal of the official action.    The test\n\nis whether a reporter's \"rough-and-ready summary\" of an official\n\naction is \"substantially correct.\"     Id. at 783.   \"A statement is\n\nconsidered a fair report if its 'gist' or 'sting' is true, that is,\n\nif it produces the same effect on the mind of the recipient which\n\nthe precise truth would have produced.\"    Id.\n\n            The fair report privilege protects published reports of\n\narrests by police.   Jones v. Taibbi, 400 Mass. 786, 796 (1987)(\"An\n\narrest by an officer is an official action, . . . a report of the\n\nfact of the arrest or the charge of crime made by the officer in\n\nmaking or returning the arrest is therefore within the [fair report\n\nprivilege].\").    Thus, a newspaper's \"publication of the fact that\n\none has been arrested, and upon what accusation, is not actionable,\n\nif true.\" Thompson v. Globe Newspaper Co., 279 Mass. 176, 188\n\n(1932).     Therefore, so long as a newspaper's \"rough and ready\n\nsummary\" of the arrest is \"substantially correct,\" the newspaper's\n\nreport is protected by the privilege.     Cf. MiGi, Inc. v. Gannett\n\nMassachusetts Broadcasters, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 394, 396\n\n(1988).\n\n            The Telegram & Gazette and Times articles fall squarely\n\nwithin this privilege.     The report of Chief May was clearly an\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f\"official statement,\" and the information in the articles was\n\nexpressly and repeatedly attributed to Chief May.                            There is no\n\ndispute that the articles in question faithfully and accurately\n\nrecounted       May's      official    statement;         the    articles     were,       at   a\n\nminimum,       a     \"substantially      correct\"          summary    of     an     official\n\nstatement.         There is also no evidence that the facts in either\n\nstory    were      manipulated,       enlarged       or    embellished       upon    by    the\n\nreporters; had there been, the privilege might not apply.                                  See\n\nBrown v. Hearst Corp., 54 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1995); see also\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 611 (2002) (\"The reporter is not\n\nprivileged under this Section to make additions of his own that\n\nwould convey a defamatory impression, nor to impute corrupt motives\n\nto anyone, nor to indict expressly or by innuendo the veracity or\n\nintegrity of any of the parties.\").\n\n               The    only   question     then       is    whether    any    inaccuracies\n\ncontained in the articles should cause the defendants to lose the\n\nbenefit     of       the   privilege.          Yohe       now   argues     that     material\n\ninaccuracies in the articles, as well as negligent reporting on the\n\nappellees'         part    should     result    in    the       newspapers    losing       the\n\nprotection of the privilege.              Specifically, Yohe argues that the\n\nfair report privilege is vitiated here because: (1) the articles\n\ninaccurately reported that he was drunk and suicidal at the time of\n\nhis arrest; and (2) the Newspaper defendants were negligent and\n\nfailed    to       conduct    an    independent       investigation,         which,       Yohe\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcontends, would have caused them to discover that the hospitals had\n\n\"exonerated\" him of being intoxicated and suicidal.\n\n          The fair report privilege is not absolute. It is limited\n\nin scope to accurate (i.e. \"substantially correct\") reports of an\n\nofficial statement or action.    Assuming arguendo that there are\n\nfactual inaccuracies in the articles, the question here is whether\n\nthe Times and Telegram & Gazette articles are still \"accurate\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the fair report privilege. Because Yohe does\n\nnot dispute that the articles are faithful and accurate accounts of\n\nChief May's actual statements, he is essentially asking us to\n\nconclude whether \"accuracy\" is to be determined by comparing a\n\n\"fair report\" article to the official statement upon which it is\n\nbased, or by comparing it to the events which actually transpired.\n\nThat is, can a newspaper reporter who \"accurately\" publishes the\n\ncontents of an objectively inaccurate report of government activity\n\nstill benefit from the fair report privilege?\n\n          To qualify as \"fair and accurate\" for purposes of the\n\nfair report privilege, an article reporting an official statement\n\nneed only give a \"rough-and-ready\" summary of the official's\n\nreport; it is not necessary that the article provide an accurate\n\nrecounting of the events that actually transpired.    Cf. ELM, 403\n\nMass. at 783.   That is, \"accuracy\" for fair report purposes refers\n\nonly to the factual correctness of the events reported and not to\n\nthe truth about the events that actually transpired. Indeed, it is\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fwell established that the fair report privilege \"should not be\n\nforfeited even if the party making the report knew the statement to\n\nbe false.\" MiGi, 25 Mass. App. Ct. at 397; Roketenetz v. Woburn\n\nDaily Times, Inc., 1 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 161-62 (1973) (holding\n\nthat \"at common law falsehood is insufficient to overcome [the fair\n\nreport privilege]\"); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 611\n\ncmt. b (2002) (\"The [fair report privilege] permits a person to\n\npublish a report of an official action or proceeding or of a public\n\nmeeting that deals with a matter of public concern, even though the\n\nreport   contains   what    he   knows   to    be   a   false   and   defamatory\n\nstatement.\").\n\n           The privilege might still be vitiated by misconduct on\n\nthe newspapers' part, but that misconduct must amount to more than\n\nnegligent, or even knowing, republication of an inaccurate official\n\nstatement.   To defeat the privilege, a plaintiff must either show\n\nthat the publisher does not give a fair and accurate report of the\n\nofficial statement, or malice.           However, as the Appeals Court of\n\nMassachusetts   has    pointed      out,      malice    must    \"require    some\n\nredefinition if it were taken not to comprehend knowing falsehood;\n\nperhaps repetition of such falsehood with a purpose to do the\n\ncomplainant maximum injury would still qualify as malice.\"                 MiGi,\n\n25 Mass. App. Ct. at 397.\n\n           Yohe has provided no evidence of malice, no matter how\n\nthe term is defined.       Moreover, as noted above, it has never been\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fdisputed that the newspaper stories accurately reported Chief May's\n\nstatements.     The district court was correct to find that the\n\narticles are protected by the fair report privilege. Consequently,\n\nwe affirm its decision to grant summary judgment to the Newspaper\n\ndefendants on the defamation claim.\n\n             As he did against Chief May, Yohe has also sued the\n\nNewspaper    defendants     for   intentional      infliction     of    emotional\n\ndistress.    Once again, Yohe's emotional distress claim is premised\n\non precisely the same facts as his defamation claim; that is, on\n\nthe publication of Chief May's official statements.                    However, a\n\nplaintiff cannot evade the protections of the fair report privilege\n\nmerely by re-labeling his claim.          Correllas v. Viveiros, 410 Mass.\n\n314, 324 (1991) (\"A privilege which protected an individual from\n\nliability for defamation would be of little value if the individual\n\nwere subject to liability under a different theory of tort\"); see\n\nalso Hustler     Magazine    v.   Falwell,   485    U.S.    46,   56-57    (1988)\n\n(holding that a plaintiff cannot make an end-run around the First\n\nAmendment by suing for emotional distress rather than defamation);\n\nBrown v. Hearst Corp., 54 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"it is not\n\nimaginable    that   [a   false   light   claim]    could    escape     the   same\n\nconstitutional constraint as [a] defamation claim\").\n\n            In short, while Chief May's statements regarding Yohe's\n\narrest may have contained inaccuracies, and while the subsequent\n\nrepublication of those statements in local newspapers may have\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fperpetuated those inaccuracies and caused Yohe some distress, we\n\ncannot see how the challenged statements and articles constitute\n\nanything other than the legitimate and nondefamatory flow of\n\ninformation from a government official to an interested public.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

Appellant Harry Yohe is a\n\nretired member of the Army Green Berets.     In May of 1997, Yohe\n\nresided in Townsend, Massachusetts and was stationed at Fort\n\nDevens.   On the evening of May 11, 1997, police responded to a\n\nreport of a domestic disturbance involving Yohe.        The police\n\ninterviewed Yohe's spouse at the neighbor's residence and she told\n\nthem that, Yohe was threatening suicide and had amassed an arsenal\n\nof weapons.   Yohe's wife informed police that her husband had been\n\nacting irrationally and had armed himself with two AK-47 rifles, a\n\nKevlar helmet and 400 rounds of ammunition. She also reported that\n\nYohe, who was on antidepressants, had been drinking since the\n\nprevious day and was home alone with his seventeen year-old son.\n\n          Townsend Police and Massachusetts State Police evidently\n\ntook Mrs. Yohe's report very seriously, because they dispatched a\n\nsmall army to Yohe's house.    Thirty police vehicles, including a\n\nSWAT team and a hostage negotiator converged on the Yohe home, only\n\nto find that Yohe had left the residence.   Police later found Yohe\n\nat Fort Devens, where he was arrested at approximately 1:30 A.M. on\n\nMay 12, 1997.\n\n          After his arrest at Fort Devens, Yohe was transported to\n\nNashoba Deaconess Hospital for a medical evaluation.   He was then\n\ntransferred to St. Elizabeth's hospital in Brighton for further\n\ntreatment and psychiatric evaluation.   Although the record is less\n\nthan clear on this point, it appears that both hospitals discharged\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fYohe   shortly   after   admitting   him,   finding   no   evidence   of\n\nintoxication or suicidal ideation.\n\n          On May 13th and 14th, two local newspapers printed\n\nstories about the arrest.     Peter Nugent of the Worcester Telegram\n\n& Gazette and Kate Walsh, a reporter for the Townsend Times\n\npublished articles about the arrest, without identifying Yohe by\n\nname. The two articles were substantially similar and we reproduce\n\nthe Townsend Times article in full here.\n\n                   DOMESTIC SITUATION TURNS UGLY\n\n          TOWNSEND--Many local residents were alarmed Sunday night\nwith the sight of up to 30 state police vehicles traveling through\nthe streets of Townsend. Police Chief William May had called in\nthe extra forces when a woman reported a drunk and suicidal husband\nin possession of deadly fire power and hundreds of rounds of\nammunition.\n\n          The domestic dispute between husband and wife began at\nabout 7 p.m. on Mother's Day, stated May. Police were called at\napproximately 8:30 p.m. when the woman reported that she and her\nchildren had left the house with a drunk and suicidal husband still\ninside. The unidentified woman alerted police of the presence of\ntwo AK47s and 500 rounds of ammunition in the house, with her\nhusband identified as a former soldier connected with special\nforces units.\n\n          \"He had been drinking all weekend,\" stated May. \"She\nalso told us that her older son was either in the house or on his\nway there . . . We determined that he was there.\"\n\n          With the unidentified man in custody by midnight, police\nconfirmed that he had been drinking. May stated it was his belief\nthat the man was suicidal. No charges have been brought against\nhim.\n\n          The operation was secured at 4 a.m. Monday morning.\n\n          The Nugent and Walsh articles were published one and two\n\ndays after Yohe's arrest, hospitalization and discharge.        Each of\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe articles was based entirely on interviews with Chief May.\n\nNugent and Walsh had each interviewed May in the past, and finding\n\nhim to be a credible source, did not conduct an independent\n\ninvestigation before publishing the articles.                      Consequently,\n\nneither article contained any information about Yohe's eventual\n\ndischarge     from   the   hospital,     or   about       the   results     of   any\n\nexaminations he underwent.         It is undisputed that the articles\n\naccurately recounted Chief May's statements to Nugent and Walsh.\n\n            As for May himself, his statements were based on the\n\npolice incident report, which memorialized the telephone report and\n\nrequest for assistance by Yohe's spouse.                  There is no also no\n\ndispute about the accuracy of Chief May's statements regarding\n\nYohe's spouse's domestic dispute report.\n\n            Yohe sued Nugent and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette,\n\nand   Walsh     of   Nashoba     Publications,        Inc.      [the   \"Newspaper\n\ndefendants\"] for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress.     Yohe also sued Chief May for defamation and intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.             Additionally, he brought an\n\naction   against     May   and   the   town   for     a    variety     of   alleged\n\nconstitutional violations connected with Yohe's arrest and May's\n\nstatements to the media.           The district court granted summary\n\njudgment to the Newspaper defendants on the ground that the reports\n\nwere either truthful or protected by the fair report privilege.\n\nThe court also granted summary judgment for Chief May, finding that\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhis statements were not defamatory because they simply conveyed\n\n\"information he received in his official capacity and which served\n\nas the basis for the arrest.\"           Further, his statements could not\n\ngive rise to a suit for intentional infliction for emotional\n\ndistress because the statements were not extreme and outrageous.\n\nYohe now appeals the district court's summary dismissal of his\n\ndefamation and infliction of emotional distress claims.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\n              We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nfor Chief May and the Newspaper defendants de novo.                 We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment only if there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and if the appellees are entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.

Specifically, Yohe\n\nchallenged the following statements that May made to the press: (1)\n\nthat Yohe \"was a retired member of the Army Special Forces of Green\n\nBerets and has been trained as a sniper;\" (2) that Yohe had\n\n\"threatened to kill himself and was reported to be armed with\n\nseveral large caliber weapons;\" and (3) \"it was [May's] belief that\n\n[Yohe] was suicidal.\"\n\n          As the district court judge noted,\n\n          Reading the newspaper articles in their\n          entirety, it is clear that May was simply\n          reporting information he received in his\n          official capacity and which served as the\n          basis for the arrest. He makes clear that the\n          information    was   derived   from    witness\n          statements, and qualifies his recitation of\n          facts   with   phrases  like   \"according   to\n          witnesses,\" \"it was [my] belief,\" and \"it was\n          reported.\"    While plaintiff challenges the\n          veracity of the underlying information May\n          gathered from witnesses, he does not refute\n          that those facts were reported to May, or that\n          they were the premise of his conduct.\n\nYohe v.

Although Yohe now challenges these\n\nstatements, the fact is that most of them are either true or have\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnever been shown to be false.

For instance, Yohe now claims that although he was a\n\nGreen Beret, he did not receive \"sniper training.\"         While this\n\naspect of the articles may be inaccurate, inaccuracy by itself does\n\nnot make a statement defamatory.

May's opinion was of obvious\n\nrelevance to the reporters' stories because, as the Telegram\n\narticle explained, Yohe \"was arrested under a state law that allows\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fpolice to take into custody anyone who is considered at risk of\n\nharming himself.\"\n\n            To determine whether or not a statement is an opinion,\n\na court \"must 'examine the statement in its totality and in the\n\ncontext in which it was uttered or published.

Since the articles establish\n\nthat May's opinion was based on witness statements and reports he\n\nreceived, the \"logical nexus between the facts and the opinion\n\nsufficiently apparent to render unreasonable any inference that the\n\nderogatory opinion was must have been based on undisclosed facts.\"\n\nDulgarian, 420 Mass. at 850-51, quoting Lyons, 415 Mass. at 266.\n\nAn   \"expression      of   opinion    based       on   disclosed   or   assumed\n\nnondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of\n\ndefamation, no matter how unjustified or unreasonable the opinion\n\nmay be or how derogatory it is.\"            Id.    Consequently, Chief May's\n\nopinion about Yohe's mental state is not actionable.\n\n          In sum, the statements challenged by Yohe all fall into\n\none of three categories: (1) unrefuted statements of fact; (2)\n\nstatements which -- although likely false -- could not reasonably\n\nbe considered offensive to the average person in the community; and\n\n(3) statements of opinion based upon disclosed facts.               As none of\n\nthese types of statements provides a basis for a defamation cause\n\nof action, Yohe's defamation claim against Chief May fails.\n\n             Yohe   also   alleges   that     Chief    May's    statements    are\n\nsufficient    to    find   May   liable   for     intentional    infliction   of\n\nemotional distress.        This claim is premised on precisely the same\n\nfacts as his defamation claim.            To prevail, Yohe must show: (1)\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthat May intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or\n\nshould have known that emotional distress was the likely result of\n\nhis conduct; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous, was\n\nbeyond all possible bounds of decency and was utterly intolerable\n\nin a civilized community; (3) that May's actions were the cause of\n\nYohe's distress; and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by\n\nYohe was severe.

May explained, in the most professional manner\n\npossible, that the officers were dispatched to ensure a calm\n\nresolution in a domestic dispute involving a heavily armed and\n\npotentially suicidal ex-Green Beret.           He provided the public with\n\nan accurate summary of the facts as they had been reported to him,\n\nand, without identifying Yohe by name, justified his decision to\n\narrest him by explaining that he believed Yohe might be suicidal.\n\nMay's conduct cannot in any way be described as \"extreme and\n\noutrageous.\"     Consequently, Yohe's emotional distress claim fails.\n\n           Finally, Yohe claims that Chief May made defamatory\n\nstatements to other law enforcement officials about Yohe being\n\nsuicidal and dangerous, and that these statements resulted in the\n\nfalse arrest, physical beating, invasion of privacy and warrantless\n\nsearch of Yohe's home.    He claims that May's actions violated his\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fconstitutional rights and seeks relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.

Yohe       now   argues     that     material\n\ninaccuracies in the articles, as well as negligent reporting on the\n\nappellees'         part    should     result    in    the       newspapers    losing       the\n\nprotection of the privilege.              Specifically, Yohe argues that the\n\nfair report privilege is vitiated here because: (1) the articles\n\ninaccurately reported that he was drunk and suicidal at the time of\n\nhis arrest; and (2) the Newspaper defendants were negligent and\n\nfailed    to       conduct    an    independent       investigation,         which,       Yohe\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcontends, would have caused them to discover that the hospitals had\n\n\"exonerated\" him of being intoxicated and suicidal.\n\n          The fair report privilege is not absolute. It is limited\n\nin scope to accurate (i.e. \"substantially correct\") reports of an\n\nofficial statement or action.    Assuming arguendo that there are\n\nfactual inaccuracies in the articles, the question here is whether\n\nthe Times and Telegram & Gazette articles are still \"accurate\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the fair report privilege. Because Yohe does\n\nnot dispute that the articles are faithful and accurate accounts of\n\nChief May's actual statements, he is essentially asking us to\n\nconclude whether \"accuracy\" is to be determined by comparing a\n\n\"fair report\" article to the official statement upon which it is\n\nbased, or by comparing it to the events which actually transpired.\n\nThat is, can a newspaper reporter who \"accurately\" publishes the\n\ncontents of an objectively inaccurate report of government activity\n\nstill benefit from the fair report privilege?\n\n          To qualify as \"fair and accurate\" for purposes of the\n\nfair report privilege, an article reporting an official statement\n\nneed only give a \"rough-and-ready\" summary of the official's\n\nreport; it is not necessary that the article provide an accurate\n\nrecounting of the events that actually transpired.    Cf. ELM, 403\n\nMass. at 783.   That is, \"accuracy\" for fair report purposes refers\n\nonly to the factual correctness of the events reported and not to\n\nthe truth about the events that actually transpired.
