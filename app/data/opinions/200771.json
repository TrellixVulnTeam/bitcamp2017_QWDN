William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William J. Hunt, with whom Michael B. Newman and Clark, Hunt\n& Embry were on brief, for appellants.\n     Kenneth Ira Spigle for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 12, 2003\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        This is an appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of a removed state court action in which\n\nseveral residents of the town of Boxborough, Massachusetts, sought\n\nto undo a decision of the Boxborough Zoning Board of Appeals. The\n\ndecision in question occurred in May 2002, when the Board settled\n\na federal lawsuit brought against it by Omnipoint Communications,\n\nInc., by issuing a variance permitting Omnipoint to construct a\n\nwireless telecommunications tower on a parcel of land within the\n\ntown.      The   complaint   underlying   this   lawsuit,   filed   against\n\nOmnipoint and the individual Board members in the Massachusetts\n\nLand Court and styled as an \"appeal\" of the Board's decision, set\n\nforth five counts alleging abuses of discretion under Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 40A, § 17 (2002), the Commonwealth statute permitting\n\njudicial review of local zoning board actions.         Collectively, the\n\ncounts alleged that the Board had abused its discretion and thus\n\nviolated Commonwealth law in failing to follow certain procedures\n\nin connection with its decisionmaking, in failing to contest\n\nOmnipoint's entitlement to the variance and permit under the\n\nfederal Telecommunications Act, and in acceding to the entry of a\n\nfederal judgment that it had violated the Act after initially and\n\nproperly denying Omnipoint's variance request.         Omnipoint removed\n\nthe case to the district court, explaining in its notice of\n\nremoval:\n\n             The Land Court action is one over which [the\n        district court] has federal question jurisdiction under\n\n                                   -2-\n\f       28 U.S.C. § 1331, and which may be removed pursuant to 28\n       U.S.C. § 1441. It arises directly from, and constitutes\n       a collateral challenge to, the Judgment of [the district\n       court] in Civil Action No. 01-cv-12019-WGY, [the\n       previous] civil action brought [by Omnipoint against the\n       Town of Boxborough and the Boxborough Zoning Board of\n       Appeals] pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 332.       Further, the\n       resolution of the challenge to the Land Court case is\n       likely to involve the issuance of writs \"necessary or\n       appropriate   in   aid   of   [the    district   court's]\n       jurisdiction\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651.\n\nThereafter, Omnipoint secured a merits dismissal under the doctrine\n\nof res judicata.\n\n             Following     oral   argument,    we   asked    for   supplemental\n\nbriefing on whether the removal had been improper because of a lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction.            See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c);\n\nCaterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 69 (1996).             Our concern was\n\ndriven by the fact that the most obvious bases for removal were\n\nlacking.     That the case might be regarded as an improper attack on\n\na prior federal judgment does not provide grounds for removal. See\n\nRivet v. Regions Bank, 522 U.S. 470, 474-77 (1998).                The existence\n\nof the consent decree in the prior judgment does not authorize\n\nremoval under the All Writs Act.            See Sygenta Crop Prot., Inc. v.\n\nHenson, 537 U.S. 28, 31-34 (2002).            The parties are non-diverse.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act, which provides the ground rules for\n\nassessing the lawfulness of the Board's actions and preempts state\n\nlaws imposing inconsistent requirements, see Brehmer v. Planning\n\nBd.,   238   F.3d   117,   120-22   (1st    Cir.    2001),   contemplates   the\n\napplication of at least some local procedures in zoning decisions\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fconcerning   wireless   communications   towers,   see   47    U.S.C.   §\n\n332(c)(7)(A), and lacks a federal enforcement mechanism by which\n\nplaintiffs may proceed with claims of the type asserted in this\n\naction.   Thus, there is little reason to believe that, in passing\n\nthe Act, Congress has so completely preempted plaintiffs' claims\n\nthat the artful pleading doctrine is called into play (at least on\n\ncomplete preemption grounds -- see generally infra).          See, e.g.,\n\nBeneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson, 123 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2003);\n\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 65-66 (1987);\n\nAvco Corp. v. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, 390\n\nU.S. 557, 560 (1968); see also TCG N.Y., Inc. v. City of White\n\nPlains, 305 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 1582\n\n(2002); APT Pittsburgh Ltd. P'ship v. Penn Township, 196 F.3d 469,\n\n478-79 (3d Cir. 1999).       Finally, at least on its face, the\n\ncomplaint sounded only in Commonwealth law.\n\n           We say \"on its face\" because, in its supplemental brief,\n\nOmnipoint argues that two of plaintiffs' claims -- a claim alleging\n\nthat Omnipoint had failed to bring before the Board sufficient\n\nevidence that there was a significant gap in its own coverage\n\nwithin the geographical area in question (claim 1) and a claim that\n\nOmnipoint also had failed to prove that no other carrier was\n\nservicing the area (claim 2) -- actually raise questions about the\n\nmeaning of the Act and thus \"arise under\" federal law pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1331.   See Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d 20,\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f23-24    (1st      Cir.     2000)     (elaborating           the   \"unclear\"    and\n\n\"controversial\" doctrine sometimes called \"federal ingredient\"\n\njurisdiction and often associated with Smith v. Kansas City Title\n\n& Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 201-02 (1921)); see also Penobscot\n\nNation v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 254 F.3d 317, 321 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(similar).1     This doctrine, which remains vibrant in this circuit\n\nbut \"should be applied with caution,\" Almond, 212 F.3d at 23,\n\npermits removal of a well pleaded claim sounding in state law which\n\n\"necessarily 'requires resolution of a substantial question of\n\nfederal law.'\" Id. (quoting Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction\n\nLaborers Vacation         Trust,    463   U.S.    1,    13   (1983)).     Omnipoint\n\ncontends that there is federal ingredient jurisdiction because\n\naddressing the merits of the two claims described above necessarily\n\nwould entail determinations about the scope of the Act.\n\n           We think that this is too much of a stretch to support\n\nremoval.      If we were to regard as a \"substantial question of\n\nfederal law\" within the meaning of Franchise Tax Board the question\n\nimplicated    by   plaintiffs'       first      claim   --   whether    Omnipoint's\n\nevidentiary showing was sufficient to meet standards supplied by\n\nestablished federal law -- it is difficult to see how any issue of\n\nfederal law implicated by a state law claim could fail to support\n\nfederal ingredient jurisdiction.             And yet, as set forth above, our\n\n\n\n     1\n      In their supplemental brief, plaintiffs argued that removal\nwas improper because of an absence of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fprecedent    tells     us    that   the   doctrine   is   not       to    be   applied\n\nexpansively.      See id.\n\n             In our view, the only claim that even arguably brings a\n\n\"substantial\" issue of federal law into play is the second one,\n\nwhich alleges that Omnipoint failed to establish before the Board\n\nthat other carriers also had a coverage gap in the geographical\n\narea in question.           This claim appears to implicate the question\n\nwhether a provider with a coverage gap can obtain relief under the\n\nAct's     \"effective    prohibition\"        provision,     see       47    U.S.C.   §\n\n332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) (2000), where another carrier provides some\n\ncoverage in the same area.2         But removal on the basis of this claim\n\nfails because it does not appear that resolution of the claim\n\n\"necessarily\" requires resolution of the federal issue (which we\n\nshall assume dubitante to be \"substantial\").               Under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, \"[t]he decision of the [B]oard cannot be disturbed unless it\n\nis   based   on   a   legally    untenable      ground,   or   is    unreasonable,\n\nwhimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\"             Roberts v. Southwestern Bell\n\nMobile Systems, Inc., 709 N.E.2d 798, 804 (Mass. 1999) (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).             This deferential standard\n\ncalls into serious question the premise of plaintiffs' claim: that\n\n\n\n      2\n      This question was an open one at the time plaintiffs filed\ntheir complaint, but we have since concluded that a provider is not\nprecluded from obtaining relief under the Act simply because some\nother provider services the gap in question. See Second Generation\nProperties, Inc. v. Town of Pelham, 313 F.3d 620, 632-35 (1st Cir.\n2002).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fa finding of an abuse of discretion under state law necessarily\n\nwould follow from a determination that the Board misapprehended the\n\nrequirements of the federal statute. Certainly, we can imagine the\n\nstate courts concluding that the issuance of the variance was\n\nwithin the Board's discretion, especially in light of possible\n\nuncertainties as to federal law.\n\n          In this case, it appears that Omnipoint may have removed\n\n(and plaintiffs may have failed to contest removal) on the basis of\n\na dictum in our Brehmer decision that can be read to support the\n\nview that, without more, the potentially preemptive effect of the\n\nAct on state law claims seeking to undo a federal consent judgment\n\nis sufficient to support removal.    See 238 F.3d at 119.3   But the\n\ndictum was immediately followed by a citation to City of Chicago v.\n\nInt'l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 164 (1997) -- a case\n\ninvolving federal ingredient jurisdiction.   Thus, read in context,\n\nthe dictum appears to stand for a more case-specific proposition\n\nthan the parties may have inferred: namely, that resolution of the\n\nBrehmer plaintiffs' multifarious state law claims, see 238 F.3d at\n\n119 (summarizing those claims), necessarily entailed resolution of\n\nthe as-of-then unresolved and important question whether the Act\n\ndisplaces inconsistent state law. In any event, Brehmer should not\n\n\n\n     3\n      The statement in question was unnecessary to the finding of\nsubject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs in Brehmer also\nasserted   federal   statutory  claims   that   rendered   removal\nunquestionably appropriate. See id.\n\n                               -7-\n\fbe read to support removal whenever a state law claim might be\n\npreempted under the Act or call into question a prior federal\n\njudgment.    As set forth above, settled Supreme Court precedent\n\nprecludes such a construction.\n\n            In closing, we note that Omnipoint's ability to have a\n\nfederal court rule on the preclusive effect of its prior federal\n\njudgment is not necessarily limited to the (remote) possibility of\n\nSupreme Court review of the state court's disposition.      \"[U]nder\n\nthe relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2283, a federal court may enjoin state-court proceedings 'where\n\nnecessary . . . to protect or effectuate its judgment.'\" Rivet, 522\n\nU.S. at 478 n.3 (quoting the statute).     Of course, the plaintiffs\n\nwere not parties to the earlier judgment.    Nevertheless, although\n\nwe do not wish to decide the matter without briefing and argument,\n\nwe see no obvious reason why abutting landowners who fail to\n\nintervene in a federal action brought under the Act, cf. Brehmer,\n\n238 F.3d at 119 n.2 & 122 (suggesting that interested abutters\n\nmight be able to intervene), should not be able to be joined as\n\nparties under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2).\n\n            For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment and remand with instructions that the district\n\ncourt remand this matter to state court.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

The decision in question occurred in May 2002, when the Board settled a federal lawsuit brought against it by Omnipoint Communications, Inc., by issuing a variance permitting Omnipoint to construct a wireless telecommunications tower on a parcel of land within the town. The complaint underlying this lawsuit, filed against Omnipoint and the individual Board members in the Massachusetts Land Court and styled as an \"appeal\" of the Board's decision, set forth five counts alleging abuses of discretion under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 17 (2002), the Commonwealth statute permitting judicial review of local zoning board actions. Collectively, the counts alleged that the Board had abused its discretion and thus violated Commonwealth law in failing to follow certain procedures in connection with its decision making, in failing to contest Omnipoint's entitlement to the variance and permit under the federal Telecommunications Act, and in acceding to the entry of a federal judgment that it had violated the Act after initially and properly denying Omnipoint's variance request.

The decision in question occurred in May 2002, when the Board settled a federal lawsuit brought against it by Omnipoint Communications, Inc., by issuing a variance permitting Omnipoint to construct a wireless telecommunications tower on a parcel of land within the town. The complaint underlying this lawsuit, filed against Omnipoint and the individual Board members in the Massachusetts Land Court and styled as an \"appeal\" of the Board's decision, set forth five counts alleging abuses of discretion under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 17 (2002), the Commonwealth statute permitting judicial review of local zoning board actions. Collectively, the counts alleged that the Board had abused its discretion and thus violated Commonwealth law in failing to follow certain procedures in connection with its decision making, in failing to contest Omnipoint's entitlement to the variance and permit under the federal Telecommunications Act, and in acceding to the entry of a federal judgment that it had violated the Act after initially and properly denying Omnipoint's variance request. Omnipoint removed the case to the district court, explaining in its notice of removal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Land Court action is one over which [the district court] has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, and which may be removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441. It arises directly from, and constitutes a collateral challenge to, the Judgment of [the district court] in Civil Action No. 01-cv-12019-WGY, [the previous] civil action brought [by Omnipoint against the Town of Boxborough and the Boxborough Zoning Board of Appeals] pursuant to 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332. Further, the resolution of the challenge to the Land Court case is likely to involve the issuance of writs \"necessary or appropriate in aid of [the district court's] jurisdiction\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Omnipoint secured a merits dismissal under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following oral argument, we asked for supplemental briefing on whether the removal had been improper because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c); <i>Caterpillar Inc. v.

As set forth above, settled Supreme Court precedent precludes such a construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we note that Omnipoint's ability to have a federal court rule on the preclusive effect of its prior federal judgment is not necessarily limited to the (remote) possibility of Supreme Court review of the state court's disposition. \"[U]nder the relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2283, a federal court may enjoin state-court proceedings `where necessary ... to protect or effectuate its judgment.'\" <i>Rivet,</i> 522 U.S. at 478 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118173\"><a href=\"/opinion/118173/rivet-v-regions-bank-of-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, although we do not wish to decide the matter without briefing and argument, we see no obvious reason why abutting landowners who fail to intervene in a federal action brought under the Act, <i>cf. Brehmer,</i> 238 F.3d at 119 n. 2 &amp; 122 (suggesting that interested abutters might be able to intervene), should not be able to be joined as parties under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we <i>vacate</i> the district court's judgment and <i>remand</i> with instructions that the district court remand this matter to state court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In their supplemental brief, plaintiffs argued that removal was improper because of an absence of subject matter jurisdiction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This question was an open one at the time plaintiffs filed their complaint, but we have since concluded that a provider is not precluded from obtaining relief under the Act simply because some other provider services the gap in question<i>See Second Generation Properties, L.P. v.
