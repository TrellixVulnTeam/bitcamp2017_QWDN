We must determine whether substantial\n\nevidence   supports    the   summary       affirmance    by    the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (“BIA”) of a denial by an Immigration Judge\n\n(“hearing officer”) of the application for political asylum filed\n\nby petitioner, Romilton C. Martins (“Martins”).                 After careful\n\nreview of the record, we conclude that the hearing officer’s\n\ndetermination   was    sufficiently    supported        and   deny    Martins’s\n\npetition for review.\n\n\n\nI.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           Martins is a citizen and native of Brazil.                He entered\n\nthe United States on September 22, 2002 in Tecate, California. The\n\nfollowing day, September 23, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (“INS”) served Martins with a Notice to Appear charging\n\nthat he was subject to removal as an alien who was neither admitted\n\nnor paroled after inspection by the INS.            On February 12, 2003,\n\nMartins acknowledged the Notice to Appear, admitted the truth of\n\nthe   factual   allegations     it     contained,       and     conceded     his\n\nremovability.    Martins     subsequently      filed    an    application    for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (the “Convention”).\n\n           A hearing was held in Boston before Immigration Judge\n\nLeonard Shapiro on February 10, 2004.           At that hearing, Martins\n\ntestified that he had owned a clothing factory and several stores\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fin Brazil.      He stated that these businesses were doing well until\n\nhe began having problems with union representatives.                Martins\n\nexplained that the union was against him because of his membership\n\nand   support    for    the   Partido   Movemento   Democratico   Brasileiro\n\n(PMDB), the Brazilian Social Democratic political party.            Martins\n\ntestified that the union was opposed to the activities of the PMDB\n\nand supported the party that had just won power in Brazil.\n\n           Martins testified that the union would lure his workers\n\naway with false promises of higher pay, and as a result, he would\n\nhave to cancel orders that he could not fill.           He claimed that he\n\nreceived threats from the union in the form of calls and letters\n\nwith no return address, and although he notified the police,\n\n“nothing would happen” because there was no way to prove anything\n\nand because the police “[didn’t] really try to help anyone with\n\nanything.”\n\n           Martins also testified that in July or August 2002, union\n\nmembers went to his home, knocked on his front door, and discharged\n\ntheir firearms.        Martins stated that he was not home at the time.\n\nHe informed the police of this incident, but said they refused to\n\nassign an officer to him or to offer him any protection.           On cross-\n\nexamination, however, Martins testified that there were actually\n\ntwo shooting incidents in his home -- one in July and one in August\n\n2002.   He described the July 2002 incident as a minor one which he\n\ndid not report to the police.           Martins confirmed that the August\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f2002 shooting was the same incident that was described in a\n\ndocument he submitted to the hearing officer as a police report of\n\nan August 21, 2002 shooting at his house.      On cross-examination,\n\nMartins admitted that although he testified that he was not at home\n\nduring the August incident, the document he submitted as a police\n\nreport stated that he and his wife were home.\n\n            Martins also testified on cross-examination that, in\n\nfact, two incidents occurred on August 21, 2002 -- an armed robbery\n\nattempt and the shooting at his home.      Martins submitted to the\n\nhearing officer documents and translations of those documents,\n\nwhich he represented to be police reports he filed in relation to\n\nthe incidents.    The hearing officer admitted those documents in\n\nevidence.\n\n            Martins admitted at the hearing to having been present in\n\nthe United States illegally in the past, from 1989 to 1993.\n\n            The hearing officer issued an oral decision denying\n\nMartins’s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder the Convention.     The hearing officer determined, noting the\n\nnumerous inconsistencies in Martins’s testimony, that Martins was\n\nnot a credible witness.    The hearing officer concluded that “[t]he\n\ncircumstances surrounding what any reasonable person would consider\n\nto be a very serious occurrence are so garbled and inconsistent\n\nthat I cannot rely on the incident ever having occurred.”        The\n\nhearing officer also indicated that he believed the documents\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fsubmitted by Martins to be fraudulent, noting that “[i]n reviewing\n\nthe document which purports to be a translation of a report stating\n\na   death   attempt[,]   the   report    is   so   irrational   that    it   is\n\nunbelievable.”    The hearing officer questioned how a claim that\n\nunion   representatives    trying   to    hire     away   Martins’s    workers\n\nproperly could morph into a claim of political asylum from the\n\nactivities of the Brazilian government.            The hearing officer also\n\nfound “no evidence that anyone from the government of Brazil is\n\nseeking to torture the respondent.”\n\n            On July 26, 2005, the BIA affirmed the hearing officer’s\n\ndecision without issuing an opinion.          Martins filed his petition\n\nfor review by this Court on August 25, 2005.          On September 9, 2005,\n\nMartins’s removal was stayed pending his appeal.\n\n\n\nII.   Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n            We have jurisdiction over Martins’s timely petition for\n\nreview pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(1).               Where\n\nthe BIA has summarily affirmed the hearing officer’s decision, we\n\nturn to that decision to review.          See Chen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d\n\n110, 113 (1st Cir. 2005).       We must uphold determinations of the\n\nhearing officer if “supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.”               INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    This “substantial evidence” standard applies to claims\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ffor   asylum,    withholding      of    removal,      and     relief    under     the\n\nConvention. Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe hearing officer’s denial must stand unless “the petitioner’s\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that\n\nrelief was warranted.”           Id.    Absent an error of law, we can\n\noverrule   the    hearing    officer     only    “if    the     evidence       points\n\nunerringly in the opposite direction.”           Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427\n\nF.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n           We also review adverse credibility findings under the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.           Chen, 418 F.3d at 113.              “[I]f we\n\ncannot say a finding that the alien is credible is compelled - then\n\nthe   decision   must   be   affirmed.”         Id.      “Matters       of    witness\n\ncredibility     and   demeanor    are   peculiarly      for    the     factfinder,”\n\nRodriguez Del Carmen v. Gonzales, 441 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\nand credibility determinations supported with specific factual\n\nfindings are treated with “great respect,” Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359\n\nF.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\nIII. Discussion\n\n           Martins does not challenge the denial of his application\n\nfor withholding of removal in his brief.              Therefore, any claim for\n\nwithholding is considered waived. See Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421\n\nF.3d 64, 65 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              In order to establish an entitlement to asylum, Martins\n\nmust   show    that   he   is   a   refugee       within    the   meaning   of   the\n\nimmigration laws.          A refugee is an alien “who is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself\n\nor herself of the protection of, [his home] country because of\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,   or    political    opinion.”         8    U.S.C.    §    1101(a)(42).    A\n\npetitioner must show “that race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be\n\nat least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”                       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).          The burden of proof is on the alien to\n\nestablish that he is a refugee.          Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).\n\n              Martins argues that the hearing officer improperly relied\n\non “minor” discrepancies in Martins’s testimony to determine that\n\nMartins was not a credible witness -- specifically, discrepancies\n\nconcerning the dates of the two shooting incidents and whether he\n\nhad reported both incidents to the police.                  The hearing officer,\n\nhowever, based his credibility determination on Martins’s differing\n\ntestimony on direct and cross-examination as to the number of\n\nshooting incidents at his home, not the dates of those incidents.\n\nFurther, the hearing officer noted contradictions between Martins’s\n\ntestimony that he was not home during the August shooting at his\n\nhome and the report he submitted, which described Martins as being\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\finside the residence at the time of the shooting and seeing the\n\nperpetrators attempt to enter his home.               The hearing officer also\n\nfound that Martins asserted that he reported both incidents to the\n\npolice, but later testified that he never reported the July 2002\n\nincident.     While the latter arguably could be labeled as a “minor”\n\ndiscrepancy,       the     former   are     discrepancies     that    relate    to\n\nsignificant details of the incidents of alleged persecution that\n\nform   the    basis   of    Martins’s     petition.      Unquestionably,       such\n\ndiscrepancies are reasonably considered in assessing the veracity\n\nof the petitioner’s testimony.                  Those two discrepancies alone\n\nadequately support the hearing officer’s credibility determination.\n\nAlthough we need not address whether reliance on any additional\n\n“minor” inconsistencies was proper, we do note that any inaccuracy\n\nor falsehood in a witness’s testimony may be considered by the\n\nhearing officer, “without regard to whether an inconsistency,\n\ninaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s\n\nclaim.”      8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n              The hearing officer’s decision to give no weight to the\n\ndocuments submitted by Martins is also adequately supported by the\n\nrecord.       As   the   hearing    officer       observed,   both   reports   are\n\ninconsistent with Martins’s testimony regarding the August incident\n\nthat he was not at home during the shooting.             Further, the document\n\nlabeled “Incident Report from the Military Police of Minas Girais,\n\nBrazil” lists Martins and three other males as victims on the first\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpage and then, on the second page, seemingly describes the shooting\n\nincident at Martins’s home referring only to the victim and his\n\nwife.1    As to the second “police report,” which also describes the\n\nAugust shooting, the hearing officer found, based on a review of\n\nthe document, that        the report was “so irrational that it is\n\nunbelievable.”     Indeed, this document contains statements that\n\nstrongly suggest it is not even a police report.                The document\n\nrefers to “[o]ur reporters” being “at the scene and verif[ying]\n\nthrough the common citizens that there was an attempt of ‘a gun\n\ncrime.’”    It indicates that details of the incident were garnered\n\nfrom the “Police Occurrence Bulletin No. 31.031\".2            In short, this\n\ndocument reads like a news article and not the police report\n\nMartins    represented   it    to   be.     The   hearing   officer   properly\n\nconcluded that both these documents were not credible.\n\n            We conclude, based on the record, that the hearing\n\nofficer’s credibility determination was substantially supported by\n\nthe record and as a result, Martins failed to establish eligibility\n\nfor asylum.      We further note that Martins failed to show any\n\nconnection    between    his   alleged    persecution   and   the     Brazilian\n\n\n\n     1\n        It is not clear from the testimony and these documents\nwhether the shooting at Martins’s residence and the attempted\nrobbery were the same incident or whether the attempted robbery was\na separate incident involving Martins and the other men listed in\nthe report.\n     2\n       The other document submitted by Martins is titled Bulletin\nNo. 31.013.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fgovernment.    Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121 (“[A]n applicant qualifies\n\nfor asylum only when he suffers persecution that is the direct\n\nresult of government action, government-supported action, or [the]\n\ngovernment’s    unwillingness   or   inability   to   control   private\n\nconduct.”).\n\n            Given the lack of any credible evidence in support of\n\nthis petition, we conclude that the hearing officer’s determination\n\nthat there was no evidence to justify relief under the Convention\n\nwas also reasonable and substantially supported by the record.\n\nAgain, even accepting all of Martins’s evidence as credible,\n\nMartins would still fail to show a likelihood that, if removed to\n\nBrazil, he would be tortured3 “with the consent or acquiescence of\n\na public official who has custody or physical control [over him].”\n\nSettenda, 377 F.3d at 94 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        To obtain relief under the Convention, Martins must show\n“that it is more likely than not that he . . . would be tortured if\nremoved” to Brazil. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2). Torture is defined\nas “(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering;\n(2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by\nor at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a\npublic official who has custody or physical control of the victim;\nand (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.” Settenda, 377 F.3d at\n94 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           Martins is a citizen and native of Brazil.                He entered\n\nthe United States on September 22, 2002 in Tecate, California.

On cross-examination,\n\nMartins admitted that although he testified that he was not at home\n\nduring the August incident, the document he submitted as a police\n\nreport stated that he and his wife were home.\n\n            Martins also testified on cross-examination that, in\n\nfact, two incidents occurred on August 21, 2002 -- an armed robbery\n\nattempt and the shooting at his home.      Martins submitted to the\n\nhearing officer documents and translations of those documents,\n\nwhich he represented to be police reports he filed in relation to\n\nthe incidents.    The hearing officer admitted those documents in\n\nevidence.\n\n            Martins admitted at the hearing to having been present in\n\nthe United States illegally in the past, from 1989 to 1993.\n\n            The hearing officer issued an oral decision denying\n\nMartins’s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder the Convention.     The hearing officer determined, noting the\n\nnumerous inconsistencies in Martins’s testimony, that Martins was\n\nnot a credible witness.    The hearing officer concluded that “[t]he\n\ncircumstances surrounding what any reasonable person would consider\n\nto be a very serious occurrence are so garbled and inconsistent\n\nthat I cannot rely on the incident ever having occurred.”        The\n\nhearing officer also indicated that he believed the documents\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fsubmitted by Martins to be fraudulent, noting that “[i]n reviewing\n\nthe document which purports to be a translation of a report stating\n\na   death   attempt[,]   the   report    is   so   irrational   that    it   is\n\nunbelievable.”    The hearing officer questioned how a claim that\n\nunion   representatives    trying   to    hire     away   Martins’s    workers\n\nproperly could morph into a claim of political asylum from the\n\nactivities of the Brazilian government.            The hearing officer also\n\nfound “no evidence that anyone from the government of Brazil is\n\nseeking to torture the respondent.”\n\n            On July 26, 2005, the BIA affirmed the hearing officer’s\n\ndecision without issuing an opinion.          Martins filed his petition\n\nfor review by this Court on August 25, 2005.          On September 9, 2005,\n\nMartins’s removal was stayed pending his appeal.\n\n\n\nII.   Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n            We have jurisdiction over Martins’s timely petition for\n\nreview pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(1).               Where\n\nthe BIA has summarily affirmed the hearing officer’s decision, we\n\nturn to that decision to review.          See Chen v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201763\"><a href=\"/opinion/201763/chen-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (1st Cir. 2005).

This “substantial evidence” standard applies to claims\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ffor   asylum,    withholding      of    removal,      and     relief    under     the\n\nConvention.

Absent an error of law, we can\n\noverrule   the    hearing    officer     only    “if    the     evidence       points\n\nunerringly in the opposite direction.”           Nikijuluw v.

Discussion\n\n           Martins does not challenge the denial of his application\n\nfor withholding of removal in his brief.              Therefore, any claim for\n\nwithholding is considered waived. See Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              In order to establish an entitlement to asylum, Martins\n\nmust   show    that   he   is   a   refugee       within    the   meaning   of   the\n\nimmigration laws.          A refugee is an alien “who is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself\n\nor herself of the protection of, [his home] country because of\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,   or    political    opinion.”         8    U.S.C.    §    1101(a)(42).    A\n\npetitioner must show “that race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be\n\nat least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”                       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).          The burden of proof is on the alien to\n\nestablish that he is a refugee.          Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).\n\n              Martins argues that the hearing officer improperly relied\n\non “minor” discrepancies in Martins’s testimony to determine that\n\nMartins was not a credible witness -- specifically, discrepancies\n\nconcerning the dates of the two shooting incidents and whether he\n\nhad reported both incidents to the police.                  The hearing officer,\n\nhowever, based his credibility determination on Martins’s differing\n\ntestimony on direct and cross-examination as to the number of\n\nshooting incidents at his home, not the dates of those incidents.\n\nFurther, the hearing officer noted contradictions between Martins’s\n\ntestimony that he was not home during the August shooting at his\n\nhome and the report he submitted, which described Martins as being\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\finside the residence at the time of the shooting and seeing the\n\nperpetrators attempt to enter his home.               The hearing officer also\n\nfound that Martins asserted that he reported both incidents to the\n\npolice, but later testified that he never reported the July 2002\n\nincident.     While the latter arguably could be labeled as a “minor”\n\ndiscrepancy,       the     former   are     discrepancies     that    relate    to\n\nsignificant details of the incidents of alleged persecution that\n\nform   the    basis   of    Martins’s     petition.      Unquestionably,       such\n\ndiscrepancies are reasonably considered in assessing the veracity\n\nof the petitioner’s testimony.                  Those two discrepancies alone\n\nadequately support the hearing officer’s credibility determination.\n\nAlthough we need not address whether reliance on any additional\n\n“minor” inconsistencies was proper, we do note that any inaccuracy\n\nor falsehood in a witness’s testimony may be considered by the\n\nhearing officer, “without regard to whether an inconsistency,\n\ninaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s\n\nclaim.”      8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n              The hearing officer’s decision to give no weight to the\n\ndocuments submitted by Martins is also adequately supported by the\n\nrecord.       As   the   hearing    officer       observed,   both   reports   are\n\ninconsistent with Martins’s testimony regarding the August incident\n\nthat he was not at home during the shooting.             Further, the document\n\nlabeled “Incident Report from the Military Police of Minas Girais,\n\nBrazil” lists Martins and three other males as victims on the first\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpage and then, on the second page, seemingly describes the shooting\n\nincident at Martins’s home referring only to the victim and his\n\nwife.1    As to the second “police report,” which also describes the\n\nAugust shooting, the hearing officer found, based on a review of\n\nthe document, that        the report was “so irrational that it is\n\nunbelievable.”     Indeed, this document contains statements that\n\nstrongly suggest it is not even a police report.                The document\n\nrefers to “[o]ur reporters” being “at the scene and verif[ying]\n\nthrough the common citizens that there was an attempt of ‘a gun\n\ncrime.’”    It indicates that details of the incident were garnered\n\nfrom the “Police Occurrence Bulletin No. 31.031\".2            In short, this\n\ndocument reads like a news article and not the police report\n\nMartins    represented   it    to   be.     The   hearing   officer   properly\n\nconcluded that both these documents were not credible.\n\n            We conclude, based on the record, that the hearing\n\nofficer’s credibility determination was substantially supported by\n\nthe record and as a result, Martins failed to establish eligibility\n\nfor asylum.      We further note that Martins failed to show any\n\nconnection    between    his   alleged    persecution   and   the     Brazilian\n\n\n\n     1\n        It is not clear from the testimony and these documents\nwhether the shooting at Martins’s residence and the attempted\nrobbery were the same incident or whether the attempted robbery was\na separate incident involving Martins and the other men listed in\nthe report.\n     2\n       The other document submitted by Martins is titled Bulletin\nNo. 31.013.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fgovernment.    Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121 (“[A]n applicant qualifies\n\nfor asylum only when he suffers persecution that is the direct\n\nresult of government action, government-supported action, or [the]\n\ngovernment’s    unwillingness   or   inability   to   control   private\n\nconduct.”).\n\n            Given the lack of any credible evidence in support of\n\nthis petition, we conclude that the hearing officer’s determination\n\nthat there was no evidence to justify relief under the Convention\n\nwas also reasonable and substantially supported by the record.\n\nAgain, even accepting all of Martins’s evidence as credible,\n\nMartins would still fail to show a likelihood that, if removed to\n\nBrazil, he would be tortured3 “with the consent or acquiescence of\n\na public official who has custody or physical control [over him].”\n\nSettenda, 377 F.3d at 94 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        To obtain relief under the Convention, Martins must show\n“that it is more likely than not that he . . . would be tortured if\nremoved” to Brazil. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2). Torture is defined\nas “(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering;\n(2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by\nor at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a\npublic official who has custody or physical control of the victim;\nand (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.” Settenda, 377 F.3d at\n94 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n                                 -10-\n\f</pre>",
