Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, Mariana\nNegrón-Vargas and Maite D. Oronoz-Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitors\nGeneral, and Susana I. Peñagaricano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor\nGeneral, on brief for remaining appellees.\n\n\n                                 May 25, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam. It is trite, but true, that civil trials are\n\nmost often won or lost in the district court.           This appeal involves\n\na plaintiff who paid scant attention to the ground rules that\n\ngoverned the district court proceedings. He now belatedly attempts\n\nto right his sinking ship.        His effort founders.\n\n           The dispute between the parties had its genesis in an\n\nincident   that   occurred   at   the   Puerto   Rico    Medical   Center,   a\n\ngovernment-run facility, on June 26, 2003.              The details of that\n\nincident are chronicled in Monge v. Cortés, 413 F. Supp. 2d 42, 45-\n\n49 (D.P.R. 2006) (Monge I), and we assume the reader's familiarity\n\nwith that rescript.\n\n           In brief, the plaintiff, Alexander Monge, alleges that\n\nsix named defendants — five security guards (one an officer) and a\n\npoliceman — accosted him because they were disgruntled with his\n\nchoice of a parking spot at the medical center.                According to\n\nMonge, four of the defendants used excessive force against him\n\nwhile the other two failed to intervene (and, thus, all six\n\nviolated his constitutional rights).\n\n           Monge made those allegations the centerpiece of a federal\n\ncivil rights suit that he filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on\n\nJune 23, 2004.1    The defendants denied the pivotal allegations of\n\nthe complaint.\n\n\n     1\n      The suit also contained supplemental statements of claim\nunder Puerto Rico law, but Monge has eschewed any separate\ndiscussion of those claims.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f             In the ordinary course, the district court issued a case-\n\nmanagement order and set a finite period for pretrial discovery.\n\nFollowing the expiration of that period, all six defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment.      The plaintiff secured an extension of time\n\nfor responding but then permitted the new deadline to pass without\n\nobtaining a further extension.2\n\n             The record reflects that the plaintiff — contrary to the\n\nassertions    in   his   appellate   brief   —   did   not   file   a   timely\n\nopposition to the summary judgment motion.             The district court\n\ndeemed the motion unopposed; adopted the movants' facts as stated,\n\nsee D.P.R. R. 56(e); and granted summary judgment in favor of two\n\nmovants (Juan Matos and José Torres).        See Monge I, 413 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 52-54.3     However, the court denied the motion as to the four\n\nremaining defendants, namely, Angel Cortés, Miguel Marín, Carlos\n\nAquino, and Gilberto Díaz.      See id. at 50-52.\n\n             The case against those four defendants went to trial on\n\nFebruary 8, 2006.    The jury heard the evidence and, on February 15,\n\nreturned a take-nothing verdict.       Monge moved for a new trial, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(a), and for relief from judgment, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b).     The trial court denied both entreaties.          See Monge\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiff did belatedly seek a further extension of time\nbut never received one.\n     3\n      In a subsequent opinion, issued during the trial, the\ndistrict court explained in some detail why it had accepted the\nmovants' facts. See Monge v. Cortés 413 F. Supp. 2d 54 (D.P.R.\n2005) (Monge II).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fv.   Cortés,     No.    04-1596,    slip      op.     (D.P.R.    July    21,     2006)\n\n(unpublished) (Monge III). This timely appeal followed.\n\n            We abjure the temptation to write at length but, rather,\n\nexplain briefly why we find this appeal to be utterly without\n\nmerit.\n\n            First: The plaintiff vigorously attacks the entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants Matos and Torres, the\n\nlower court's acceptance of the defendants' statement of material\n\nfacts,     and   the     court's    denial      of     his      two   motions      for\n\nreconsideration.         This attack is futile.              On this record, the\n\ndistrict    court      was   entitled   to    treat    the   motion     for    summary\n\njudgment as unopposed and, therefore, to take the movants' properly\n\nsupported statements of undisputed fact as true.                      See D.P.R. R.\n\n56(e); see also Cordero-Soto v. Island Fin., Inc., 418 F.3d 114,\n\n118 (1st Cir. 2005); Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35,\n\n41-42 (1st Cir. 2004).4         On this basis, the movants' papers showed\n\nquite clearly that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to\n\neither Matos or Torres.          See Monge I, 413 F. Supp. 2d at 52-54.\n\nAccordingly, both of those defendants were entitled to summary\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Here, moreover, the district court went the extra mile,\nexhibiting considerable discernment in its treatment of the facts.\nSee, e.g., Monge II, 413 F. Supp. 2d at 56-59 (assessing whether\nparticular facts fairly could be deemed uncontested).\n\n                                        -4-\n\f             In all events, we have examined the plaintiff's late-\n\nfiled opposition.        Even had that opposition been considered — but\n\nsetting     to   one    side,     however,      bald    assertions,        unsupported\n\nconclusions, and vituperative epithets — summary judgment still\n\nwould have been warranted for Matos and Torres.                 With that in mind,\n\nwe   are    confident    that     the   district       court   did   not    abuse   its\n\ndiscretion       in     denying     the    plaintiff's         two    motions       for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n             We add that the plaintiff's tardy attempt to invoke\n\nestoppel principles by way of post-trial motions is hopeless.                       To\n\nbe sure, certain of the defendants were convicted on misdemeanor\n\nand/or weapons charges arising out of the fracas at the medical\n\ncenter.      The plaintiff belatedly urged that these convictions\n\nshould have worked an estoppel.            See, e.g., Kowalski v. Gagne, 914\n\nF.2d 299, 303 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n             There are several problems with this argument.                   The most\n\nprominent is that the issues tried in the criminal cases appear to\n\nbe different from the issues involved in this civil case.                      We say\n\n\"appear to be\" because the plaintiff never introduced in the\n\ndistrict court the judgments and related records anent the criminal\n\ncase.      Without those prior judgments and records the plaintiff's\n\nclaim cannot succeed.5\n\n\n      5\n      That is especially so since the judgments and records are in\nthe Spanish language, and only a few isolated pages, none properly\nauthenticated, were produced at trial.     This, in itself, was a\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           Equally   unavailing    is     the   plaintiff's   claim    that   a\n\nprovision of the Victim & Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3664(l), counsels in favor of an estoppel.            On this subject, it\n\nsuffices to say that no such claim was advanced below.                 \"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"\n\nTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union v. Superline\n\nTransp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).                 There are no\n\nextraordinary circumstances here.\n\n           Second: The plaintiff next asserts that, at trial, the\n\ndistrict court improperly limited his cross-examination of Cortés\n\nand Torres.   The record belies that assertion.          For one thing, the\n\ndistrict   court   allowed   the   plaintiff     broad   leeway   in    cross-\n\nexamination. For another thing, the specific \"abridgment\" to which\n\nthe plaintiff adverts relates to his attempt to cross-examine based\n\non material not seasonably identified by him in advance of trial\n\n(as required by the court's case-management order).                    Federal\n\npractice does not favor trial by ambush, and barring the proposed\n\nuse of such previously undisclosed materials was entirely within\n\nthe court's discretion.      See Macaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 50-53\n\n\n\n\nfatal flaw. See Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 359\nF.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                    -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 2003) (holding adherence to temporal parameters relative\n\nto discovery to be within the trial court's discretion).\n\n            Third: The plaintiff's penultimate claim of error relates\n\nto the denial of his motion for a new trial.          The granting or\n\ndenial of such motions is in the trial court's sound discretion,\n\nsee Correia v. Fitzgerald, 354 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir. 2003), and we\n\nsee no hint of any misused discretion here.\n\n            Fourth: The plaintiff's final assignment of error relates\n\nto the denial of his post-trial motion for relief from judgment,\n\nwhich was premised on a claim of fraud and misrepresentation.       See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3).     Such a claim, however, requires more\n\nthan the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.            We have\n\nscoured the record and find this claim to be brazenly asserted but\n\ntotally unsubstantiated.    There is nothing here — and even less in\n\nthe district court record — to suggest anything remotely resembling\n\nfraud or misrepresentation.\n\n            The short of it is that none of the aforementioned\n\narguments is meritorious.      To the extent that the plaintiff's\n\npoorly organized brief can be read as attempting to raise other\n\ncontentions,    those   contentions     are   inadequately   developed,\n\nunconvincing, or both.     The judgment of the district court must,\n\ntherefore, stand.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

With that in mind,\n\nwe   are    confident    that     the   district       court   did   not    abuse   its\n\ndiscretion       in     denying     the    plaintiff's         two    motions       for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n             We add that the plaintiff's tardy attempt to invoke\n\nestoppel principles by way of post-trial motions is hopeless.                       To\n\nbe sure, certain of the defendants were convicted on misdemeanor\n\nand/or weapons charges arising out of the fracas at the medical\n\ncenter.      The plaintiff belatedly urged that these convictions\n\nshould have worked an estoppel.            See, e.g., Kowalski v. Gagne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548343\"><a href=\"/opinion/548343/linda-kowalski-aka-linda-larochelle-etc-v-richard-j-gagne-aetna/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n             There are several problems with this argument.                   The most\n\nprominent is that the issues tried in the criminal cases appear to\n\nbe different from the issues involved in this civil case.                      We say\n\n\"appear to be\" because the plaintiff never introduced in the\n\ndistrict court the judgments and related records anent the criminal\n\ncase.      Without those prior judgments and records the plaintiff's\n\nclaim cannot succeed.5\n\n\n      5\n      That is especially so since the judgments and records are in\nthe Spanish language, and only a few isolated pages, none properly\nauthenticated, were produced at trial.     This, in itself, was a\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           Equally   unavailing    is     the   plaintiff's   claim    that   a\n\nprovision of the Victim & Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3664(l), counsels in favor of an estoppel.            On this subject, it\n\nsuffices to say that no such claim was advanced below.                 \"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"\n\nTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union v. Superline\n\nTransp. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).                 There are no\n\nextraordinary circumstances here.\n\n           Second: The plaintiff next asserts that, at trial, the\n\ndistrict court improperly limited his cross-examination of Cortés\n\nand Torres.   The record belies that assertion.          For one thing, the\n\ndistrict   court   allowed   the   plaintiff     broad   leeway   in    cross-\n\nexamination. For another thing, the specific \"abridgment\" to which\n\nthe plaintiff adverts relates to his attempt to cross-examine based\n\non material not seasonably identified by him in advance of trial\n\n(as required by the court's case-management order).                    Federal\n\npractice does not favor trial by ambush, and barring the proposed\n\nuse of such previously undisclosed materials was entirely within\n\nthe court's discretion.      See Macaulay v. Anas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-53\n\n\n\n\nfatal flaw.

The granting or\n\ndenial of such motions is in the trial court's sound discretion,\n\nsee Correia v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200793\"><a href=\"/opinion/200793/correia-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 2003), and we\n\nsee no hint of any misused discretion here.\n\n            Fourth: The plaintiff's final assignment of error relates\n\nto the denial of his post-trial motion for relief from judgment,\n\nwhich was premised on a claim of fraud and misrepresentation.       See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3).     Such a claim, however, requires more\n\nthan the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.            We have\n\nscoured the record and find this claim to be brazenly asserted but\n\ntotally unsubstantiated.    There is nothing here — and even less in\n\nthe district court record — to suggest anything remotely resembling\n\nfraud or misrepresentation.\n\n            The short of it is that none of the aforementioned\n\narguments is meritorious.      To the extent that the plaintiff's\n\npoorly organized brief can be read as attempting to raise other\n\ncontentions,    those   contentions     are   inadequately   developed,\n\nunconvincing, or both.     The judgment of the district court must,\n\ntherefore, stand.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
