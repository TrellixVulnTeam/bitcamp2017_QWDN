William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n               Porfilio,* Senior Circuit Judge, and\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Steven E.

Kaufman and Ropes\n& Gray were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 12, 2004\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge. This is a case of first impression\n\nfor this circuit on several issues under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1051 et seq.\n\n              The plaintiff, formerly known as the State Compensation\n\nInsurance     Fund,    was    chartered   in     1990   by   the   Rhode    Island\n\nlegislature as the workers' compensation insurer of last resort in\n\nthe state.       In 1992, it adopted the name The Beacon Mutual\n\nInsurance Company (\"Beacon Mutual\") and, since then, has sold\n\nworkers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island under the marks\n\n\"The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company,\" \"Beacon Insurance,\" and \"The\n\nBeacon,\" with an accompanying lighthouse logo. The name change was\n\nbrought about by increased competition following the resolution of\n\na crisis in the state workers' compensation market.\n\n              In June 2001, the defendant OneBeacon Insurance Group\n\n(\"OneBeacon\"), which sells various forms of commercial insurance\n\nnationwide, switched to its current name and adopted a lighthouse\n\nlogo as well, albeit in a different font and arrangement.                  The name\n\nchange resulted from the sale of the company, then called CGU\n\nCorporation, to another company; the terms of the sale required CGU\n\nto change its name.           OneBeacon is a direct competitor of Beacon\n\nMutual   in    the    Rhode    Island   market    for   workers'   compensation\n\ninsurance.\n\n              Beacon Mutual brought suit one month after OneBeacon's\n\nname change, alleging violations of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f1125(a), and state trademark laws.       On November 14, 2003, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of OneBeacon on\n\nall counts on the ground that Beacon Mutual had not demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of confusion.          Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nOneBeacon Ins. Group, 290 F. Supp. 2d 241, 252 (D.R.I. 2003).\n\nBeacon Mutual now appeals.\n\n          For   likelihood   of   confusion    to    be   actionable,   the\n\n\"confusion has to exist in the mind of a relevant person.\"          Astra\n\nPharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F.2d 1201,\n\n1207 (1st Cir. 1983).    The primary issue in this appeal is the\n\nrelevance of evidence submitted by Beacon Mutual showing 249\n\ninstances of confusion between the two companies in the sixteen\n\nmonths following OneBeacon's adoption of its current name. Most of\n\nthe confusion involved misdirected premium checks, claim forms,\n\nmedical records, and legal correspondence.          OneBeacon argues that\n\nthose incidents do not demonstrate confusion among relevant persons\n\nbecause the confused persons were not those who made purchasing\n\ndecisions and there was no evidence that their confusion caused\n\nBeacon Mutual to lose sales.      OneBeacon's argument impermissibly\n\nnarrows the scope of the court's inquiry into both the harm\n\nsuffered by the plaintiff and the persons among whom confusion\n\nexists.\n\n          We hold that the type of commercial injury actionable\n\nunder § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), is not\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\frestricted to the loss of sales to actual and prospective buyers of\n\nthe product in question.     Confusion is relevant when it exists in\n\nthe minds of persons in a position to influence the purchasing\n\ndecision or persons whose confusion presents a significant risk to\n\nthe sales, goodwill, or reputation of the trademark owner.                This\n\nholding is consistent with our existing case law, under which post-\n\nsale confusion is actionable. See I.P. Lund Trading, ApS v. Kohler\n\nCo., 163 F.3d 27, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).         We also hold that relevant\n\ncommercial injury includes not only loss of sales but also harm to\n\nthe trademark holder's goodwill and reputation.          See 3 McCarthy on\n\nTrademarks   and    Unfair   Competition      §   25:5   (4th    ed.     1996)\n\n[hereinafter, McCarthy].\n\n           On summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be\n\ndrawn in favor of the non-moving party, Beacon Mutual.                 Here, a\n\nfactfinder    could    reasonably     infer       that   the    misdirected\n\ncommunications (1) showed confusion among purchasing companies,\n\ntheir covered employees, consulting physicians and other health\n\ncare   providers,   third-party   insurers,       attorneys    for   claimant\n\nemployees, and courts handling such claims, and (2) had caused\n\ncommercial injury to Beacon Mutual in the form of, inter alia,\n\ndelays in claims processing, mistaken cancellations of coverage for\n\nfailure to pay premiums, delayed reimbursements of health care\n\nproviders, improper disclosure of confidential medical records, and\n\nrisk of potential legal penalties for purchasers, covered workers,\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fand providers.       Reasonable inferences could be drawn that these\n\nproblems had damaged Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.\n\nReasonable inferences could also be drawn that these problems had\n\nled or would lead to lost sales, although the drawing of such\n\ninferences is not necessary to survive summary judgment in light of\n\nthe other forms of commercial injury present in this case. Because\n\ninappropriate      legal     standards    were    employed     both    as    to    the\n\nsubstantive application of trademark law and as to the drawing of\n\ninferences on summary judgment, we reverse the grant of summary\n\njudgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            The following facts are described in the light most\n\nfavorable    to   Beacon     Mutual,     the   non-moving     party.        Zyla    v.\n\nWadsworth, 360 F.3d 243, 246 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Beacon     Mutual    is     the    largest    writer      of    workers'\n\ncompensation      insurance     in   Rhode     Island,   collecting        over   $118\n\nmillion in premiums in 2001.           It has used its marks and lighthouse\n\nlogo since June 24, 1992, but never registered them.                        Over the\n\nyears, Beacon Mutual has steadily increased its advertising and\n\npromotional expenditures to build its brand, spending close to $1.4\n\nmillion in     2001.        Beacon    Mutual    says   that   these    promotional\n\nactivities,    most    of    which    involve    displaying     its    marks,      are\n\nnecessary to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive\n\nmarket.   According to a consumer survey submitted by Beacon Mutual\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fon summary judgment, many Rhode Island consumers now associate the\n\nmark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual.          Beacon Mutual offers its\n\nworkers' compensation insurance through agents as well as through\n\ndirect sales.\n\n            OneBeacon, formerly known as CGU Insurance, began using\n\nits current name and lighthouse logo nationally in early June 2001.\n\nA     Boston-based   corporation    that   sells   commercial   insurance\n\nnationwide, OneBeacon offers workers' compensation insurance in\n\nRhode Island on a much smaller scale than Beacon Mutual, collecting\n\naround $1 million in workers' compensation premiums in 2001.\n\nOneBeacon says that workers' compensation insurance is not a\n\nprofitable line of business for it in Rhode Island and that it\n\noffers the product only as a convenience to its existing customers.\n\nThe    workers'   compensation     coverage   offered   by   OneBeacon   is\n\ncomparable to that offered by Beacon Mutual and is sold at rates\n\nthat are the same or higher than Beacon Mutual's.\n\n            Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon share addresses that sound\n\nsimilar.    Beacon Mutual is located at One Beacon Center, Warwick,\n\nRhode Island, and OneBeacon is located at One Beacon Street,\n\nBoston, Massachusetts.     Counsel for OneBeacon informed us at oral\n\nargument that Beacon Mutual was already located at its current\n\naddress when her client began using the name \"OneBeacon\" in June\n\n2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            On July 5, 2001, Beacon Mutual brought a four-count\n\ntrademark infringement action against OneBeacon in the Rhode Island\n\nSuperior Court.        Count I alleged unfair competition under the\n\nLanham    Act,   15    U.S.C.    §   1125(a);     Count    II   alleged   unfair\n\ncompetition under Rhode Island common law; Count III alleged\n\nservice mark infringement under Rhode Island common law; and Count\n\nIV alleged trademark dilution under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-2-12.\n\n            OneBeacon removed the case to federal court and then\n\nmoved for summary judgment, arguing that all four counts should be\n\ndismissed because there was no likelihood of confusion.1 OneBeacon\n\nrelied principally on the fact that it sells workers' compensation\n\ninsurance    exclusively        through     licensed   independent    insurance\n\nagents.   OneBeacon submitted a telephone survey showing that those\n\nagents understand the difference between the two companies and that\n\nthose agents typically guide consumers, whom the agents said do not\n\nordinarily express a preference for a particular brand of workers'\n\ncompensation insurance, through the purchasing process.               OneBeacon\n\nargued that if its agents are not confused, purchasers guided by\n\nthose agents     are    unlikely     to    be   confused   either.    Moreover,\n\n\n\n     1\n          OneBeacon also argued that all four counts should be\ndismissed because Beacon Mutual's unregistered marks were not\nsufficiently \"distinctive\" to warrant legal protection.         The\ndistrict court correctly rejected that argument, stating that there\nwas a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the marks were\ndistinctive, Beacon Mutual Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins. Group, 290 F.\nSupp. 2d 241, 244 (D.R.I. 2003), and OneBeacon does not challenge\nthat holding on appeal.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fOneBeacon argued that to the extent that confusion exists among\n\nnon-purchasers or potential purchasers before the point of sale,\n\nsuch confusion is not actionable because \"it cannot possibly cause\n\nthe harm that the trademark laws are meant to prevent: economic\n\nharm to Beacon Mutual in the form of lost sales.\"\n\n              Beacon Mutual opposed summary judgment, arguing that,\n\ncontrary to OneBeacon's assertion, confusion need not be tied\n\nspecifically to lost sales or to the state of mind of purchasers at\n\nthe point of sale to be actionable.              Confusion, Beacon Mutual\n\nargued, is relevant where it adversely affects the trademark\n\nowner's commercial interests.            Here, Beacon Mutual argued, at a\n\nminimum, the goodwill and reputation of Beacon Mutual were harmed\n\nby actual confusion among Rhode Island employers, workers, health\n\ncare providers, third-party insurance companies, attorneys, and\n\ncourts.\n\n              Beacon Mutual submitted an affidavit by Michael Lynch,\n\nvice president of legal services for Beacon Mutual, stating that\n\nshortly   after      OneBeacon's   name    change,    Beacon    Mutual   began\n\nreceiving misdirected e-mails, telephone calls, checks, and letters\n\nintended for OneBeacon.         Attorney Lynch attached to his affidavit\n\nan exhibit, entitled the \"Confusion Matrix,\" that detailed 249\n\ninstances of confusion between Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon between\n\nJune   2001    and   November    2002,   based   on   Lynch's   own   personal\n\nknowledge and information in Beacon Mutual's business records. The\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fConfusion Matrix documented, inter alia, confusion among four main\n\ngroups:\n\n          (1)    Rhode Island employers (24 instances): mostly,\n\n                 premium checks sent to Beacon Mutual instead of\n\n                 OneBeacon or (in at least one instance) vice\n\n                 versa.\n\n          (2)    Health care providers (95 instances): mostly,\n\n                 insurance claim forms or patient medical records\n\n                 sent to Beacon Mutual instead of OneBeacon or\n\n                 vice versa.\n\n          (3)    Third-party insurance companies (18 instances):\n\n                 mostly, Beacon Mutual was contacted to resolve\n\n                 claims instead of OneBeacon or vice versa.\n\n          (4)    Courts   or   attorneys   (72   instances):   mostly,\n\n                 summonses, complaints, or legal correspondence\n\n                 sent to Beacon Mutual instead of OneBeacon or\n\n                 vice versa.\n\nLynch stated in his affidavit that these instances of confusion had\n\nled to\n\n          claims processing being delayed or not accomplished, both\n          companies being potentially subjected to legal action for\n          breach of contract or individual's privacy rights,\n          injured workers not being timely compensated or notified\n          of court hearings, employers not being notified of court\n          proceedings, providers not being paid in a timely manner,\n          and insureds not being credited for premium payments (and\n          then having their coverage lapse or cancelled, resulting\n          in their being in violation of the state workers'\n          compensation laws).\n\n                                -9-\n\f            Lynch also attached to his affidavit an August 29, 2001\n\nletter    from    the    Chief     Judge    of   the   Rhode    Island    Workers'\n\nCompensation Court to Beacon Mutual complaining about delays caused\n\nby confusion between the two companies:\n\n             The Workers' Compensation Court is concerned as a result\n             of recent confusion arising from the similarity of names\n             between The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company and OneBeacon\n             Insurance Group (formerly CGU Insurance Group) . . . .\n\n             The court has been made aware that service of process and\n             notices   that    are   intended   for    OneBeacon   are\n             unintentionally being sent to The Beacon Mutual Insurance\n             Company's office in Warwick. This confusion impacts our\n             workers' compensation cases, in that notice to parties\n             may be delayed, affecting both the employees['] and\n             employers['] rights and benefits . . . .\n\n             An additional concern is regarding preferred provider\n             networks (PPN). The Beacon Mutual Insurance Carrier does\n             have an approved PPN, while OneBeacon does not. When an\n             injured worker telephones to determine if a PPN is in\n             effect for their employer, some confusion may exi[st] as\n             to the appropriate carrier on the part of the employee,\n             thereby possibly limiting the employee's choice of\n             physician inappropriately.\n\nOneBeacon's response was that these many instances of confusion\n\nwere simply irrelevant because Beacon Mutual had not demonstrated\n\nthat they led to a loss of sales.\n\n             The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nOneBeacon on all counts.           Beacon Mutual, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 242.\n\nAfter first determining that there was a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether Beacon Mutual's marks were distinctive, the\n\ncourt    turned   to    the     relevance   of   the   Confusion    Matrix.      It\n\ndetermined    that      while    the   Confusion   Matrix      showed    that   \"the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fconfusion Plaintiff complains of is real,\" the plaintiff \"has not\n\nestablished that the entities and persons identified in its Matrix\n\nfall into the post-sale confusion category, for the simple reason\n\nthat the confused entities are not consumers of the product, nor\n\nhas Plaintiff shown any commercial relevance as to these entities.\"\n\nId. at 246.\n\n           The court acknowledged that even if the confusion of\n\nactual purchasers       is   always    corrected   at   the   point   of   sale,\n\nconfusion among non-purchasers and potential purchasers can be\n\nrelevant   where   it    affects      the   trademark   owner's   \"commercial\n\ninterests.\"   Id. at 247 (citing CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast\n\nProperties, Inc., 888 F. Supp. 192, 200 (D. Me. 1995), aff'd, 97\n\nF.3d 1504 (1st Cir. 1996)).            At one point, the court described\n\nthose commercial interests as including goodwill, citing other\n\ncases that recognize the confusion of third parties as relevant\n\nwhen \"their views are somehow related to the goodwill of the\n\naggrieved manufacturer.\"        Id. (quoting Landscape Forms, Inc. v.\n\nColumbia Cascade Co., 113 F.3d 373, 382-83 (2d Cir. 1997)).\n\n           In applying this standard, however, the court focused on\n\nwhat it found to be Beacon Mutual's failure to connect the 249\n\ninstances of confusion described in the Confusion Matrix to lost\n\nsales.   It emphasized that \"there is no indication that this type\n\nof confusion has ever played any role in the purchasing calculus.\"\n\nId. at 248.   The theme of the opinion was that \"Plaintiff has put\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fon no evidence that it has lost any business as a result of\n\nconfusion among its insured\" or \"proffered any evidence from which\n\nthis Court reasonably could infer that the confusion has affected\n\nthe decision of any insured to switch providers.\"   Id. at 249.   It\n\ntherefore concluded that there was an \"absence of evidence\" about\n\nthe \"possible nocent effect of this confusion on Plaintiff's market\n\ninterests\" and that it could not find any such effect without\n\nengaging in speculation.   Id. at 248.\n\n          Drawing on its analysis of the relevance of the Confusion\n\nMatrix, the court applied the eight-factor test for likelihood of\n\nconfusion used by this court in Astra, 718 F.2d at 1205 (adopting\n\nthe test articulated in Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v.\n\nPolaroid Corp., 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1981)).    See also I.P.\n\nLund, 163 F.3d at 43; Int'l Ass'n of Machinists & Aero. Workers v.\n\nWinship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir. 1996).    It\n\nconcluded that no reasonable factfinder could find in favor of\n\nBeacon Mutual on the most important factors in the case: evidence\n\nof actual confusion, similarity in the classes of prospective\n\npurchasers, and similarity in the channels of trade.    290 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 252.    The court then held that although Beacon Mutual's\n\nmarks were strong and the two parties' marks were similar, those\n\nfactors could not overcome Beacon Mutual's \"fatal failure to\n\ndemonstrate that the confusion it identifies is connected in any\n\nway to its commercial interests.\"     Id.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          Having found no likelihood of confusion connected to\n\ncommercial interests, the court dismissed the Lanham Act and state\n\ncommon law claims (Counts I-III).      The court also dismissed the\n\nRhode Island statutory dilution claim (Count IV), reasoning that\n\n\"[b]ecause the Court has held that Plaintiff cannot survive summary\n\njudgment on the likelihood of confusion prong of its Lanham Act\n\nclaim, so, too, does its dilution claim fail.\"    Id.\n\n          Beacon Mutual timely appealed from the dismissal of all\n\nfour claims.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is de novo.    Douglas v. York County, 360 F.3d 286, 290\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).   On a motion for summary judgment, all reasonable\n\ninferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party (here,\n\nBeacon Mutual), regardless of who bears the ultimate burden of\n\nproof.   Id.\n\n          Beacon Mutual acknowledges that it must demonstrate a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of confusion to survive summary judgment on\n\nthe Lanham Act and state common law counts.2     Section 43 of the\n\nLanham Act, under which Count I is brought, provides that:\n\n          Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or\n          services . . . uses in commerce any word, term, name,\n\n\n     2\n          It does argue, though, that summary judgment is\ninappropriate on the Rhode Island statutory dilution claim even if\nthere is no likelihood of confusion.       We do not reach this\nargument. See infra note 6.\n\n                                -13-\n\f              symbol, or device . . . which . . . is likely to cause\n              confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the\n              affiliation, connection, or association of such person\n              with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or\n              approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial\n              activities by another person . . . shall be liable in a\n              civil action by any person who believes that he or she is\n              or is likely to be damaged by such act.\n\n15   U.S.C.    §   1125(a)(1).    The   same    likelihood   of   confusion\n\nrequirement applies to Beacon Mutual's claims under Rhode Island\n\ncommon law for unfair competition and service mark infringement.\n\nSee DeCosta v. Viacom Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 602, 606-07 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (applying collateral estoppel to prevent relitigation of\n\nlikelihood of confusion issue under Lanham Act when that issue had\n\nalready been decided in earlier suit under Rhode Island common\n\nlaw).\n\n              Eight factors, outlined most recently in I.P. Lund, are\n\ntypically used to assess the likelihood of confusion:              (1) the\n\nsimilarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods; (3) the\n\nrelationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the\n\nrelationship between the parties' advertising; (5) the classes of\n\nprospective purchasers; (6) evidence of actual confusion; (7) the\n\ndefendant's intent in adopting its mark; and (8) the strength of\n\nthe plaintiff's mark.     163 F.3d at 43.      These factors are not to be\n\napplied mechanically.      Courts may consider other factors and may\n\naccord little weight to factors that are not helpful on the\n\nparticular facts of a case.      See id.\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fA.   Evidence of Actual Confusion\n\n             We turn first to the sixth factor, evidence of actual\n\nconfusion.    On summary judgment, OneBeacon, for its part, has not\n\ndisputed the accuracy of the 249 instances of actual confusion\n\nlisted in the Confusion Matrix.\n\n          Instead, OneBeacon argued to the district court that\n\nconfusion is relevant only if it (1) involved actual or potential\n\npurchasers and (2) caused the trademark holder to lose sales.           The\n\nextent to which the district court accepted these arguments is not\n\nclear.   The    district    court   clearly   rejected   the   notion   that\n\nconfusion is relevant only if it involves actual or potential\n\npurchasers.     Beacon Mutual, 290 F. Supp. 2d at 247.             But the\n\ndistrict court appears at some points to have required Beacon\n\nMutual to demonstrate that the confusion caused lost sales or lost\n\ncustomers, while suggesting at other points that loss of goodwill\n\nis a relevant harm.     Compare id. (requiring only a showing of an\n\neffect on \"goodwill\" (quoting Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 382-83)\n\nor other \"commercial interests\"), with id. at 249 (faulting Beacon\n\nMutual for failing to offer evidence that it \"lost any business\" or\n\nthat \"the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to\n\nswitch providers\").        In any event, we need not determine what\n\nstandard the district court applied, as our review is de novo.\n\n             We join those courts holding that actual confusion is\n\ncommercially relevant if the alleged infringer's use of the mark\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f\"could inflict commercial injury in the form of . . . a diversion\n\nof sales, damage to goodwill, or loss of control over reputation\"\n\non the trademark holder.

The\n\nfact that the injury is to a company's reputation or goodwill,\n\nrather than directly to its sales, does not render the confusion\n\nany less actionable.        Meridian Mutual Ins. Co. v. Meridian Ins.\n\nGroup, Inc., 128 F.3d 1111, 1118 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          Our       holding   is   reinforced    by     the   position    of   the\n\nRestatement    of    Unfair    Competition,     which    treats   confusion    as\n\nrelevant where it presents \"a significant risk to the sales or good\n\nwill of the trademark owner.\"            Restatement (Third) of Unfair\n\nCompetition § 20 cmt. b (1995).              The leading commentators also\n\nagree that harm to goodwill and harm to reputation are actionable.\n\nMcCarthy states that the \"post-sale confusion of a purchaser of an\n\ninsurance policy who mistakenly makes a claim to another company\n\nwith a similar name\" is relevant and quotes Meridian, 128 F.3d at\n\n1118, for the proposition that \"the fact that a company's goodwill,\n\nrather than its pocketbook, is injured by actual confusion does not\n\nrender the confusion meaningless.\"           3 McCarthy § 23:7 & n.12; see\n\nalso 3A Callman on Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies §\n\n21:4 (4th ed. 1981) (\"Even without 'passing off' and diversion of\n\ntrade, the injury [suffered by a trademark owner] may be grievous\"\n\nbecause of harm to reputation). Indeed, OneBeacon, backing off its\n\nassertion to the district court that confusion must be linked to\n\nlost sales, now admits on appeal that confusion is relevant if it\n\n\"threaten[s]    the    sales    or   goodwill    of     the   trademark   owner\"\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n          It is true that when a Lanham Act case involves directly\n\ncompeting goods, as here, the usual harm from confusion is both the\n\npotential purchase of the defendant's product rather than the\n\nplaintiff's and the loss of goodwill and reputation occasioned when\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fthe defendant's product is inferior.3        But nothing in the statute\n\nsuggests   that   demonstrable   harm   to   plaintiff's   goodwill   and\n\nreputation resulting from confusion of marks is restricted to this\n\nclassic situation.\n\n           We also hold that the likelihood of confusion inquiry is\n\nnot limited to actual or potential purchasers, but also includes\n\nothers whose confusion threatens the trademark owner's commercial\n\ninterest in its mark.4    See Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 382-83;\n\nInsty*Bit, Inc. v. Poly-Tech Indus., 95 F.3d 663, 672 (8th Cir.\n\n1996) (confusion under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1125(a), \"include[s] confusion of nonpurchasers as well as direct\n\npurchasers\"); Champions Golf Club, Inc. v.

Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v. Fluid-Quip, Inc., 94 F.3d 376, 382\n(7th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                 -18-\n\fcommercial interests of the owner of the mark, but it is not\n\nlimited to the confusion of persons doing business directly with\n\nthe actor.\").      \"Actual and potential customers of the trademark\n\nowner are the most obvious 'relevant persons,' but other persons\n\nmight be relevant\" if their confusion \"threaten[s] the commercial\n\ninterests of the owner of the mark.\"            CMM Cable, 888 F. Supp. at\n\n200 (internal quotation marks omitted).           Relevant confusion among\n\nnon-purchasers may well extend beyond the confusion of those\n\npersons   positioned      to    influence     directly    the     decisions    of\n\npurchasers.\n\n           OneBeacon argues that summary judgment is appropriate\n\nbecause   Beacon    Mutual     has   not   produced   evidence        specifically\n\ndemonstrating      that   the    confusion     threatened       its    commercial\n\ninterests, including its goodwill.            If OneBeacon means that, in\n\ngeneral, commercial injury may not ever be inferred on summary\n\njudgment, that proposition is flatly wrong.              On summary judgment,\n\nall reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of Beacon Mutual,\n\nthe non-moving party.        Douglas, 360 F.3d at 290; Zyla, 360 F.3d at\n\n247; see also Ferrara & DiMercurio, Inc. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins.\n\nCo., 169 F.3d 43, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that reasonable\n\ninferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party on\n\nsummary judgment and that \"[i]nferences can, of course, properly be\n\ndrawn from circumstantial evidence\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f          If OneBeacon means that as a matter of substantive\n\ntrademark law, only direct evidence (with no room for inference)\n\nmay establish harm to goodwill, that contention is wrong as well.\n\nIn the Title VII context, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected\n\na direct evidence requirement, instead applying the conventional\n\nrule that a plaintiff may amass a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthrough direct or circumstantial evidence.   Desert Palace, Inc. v.\n\nCosta, 539 U.S. 90, 99-100 (2003).    We see no reason for applying\n\na different rule in the trademark context.\n\n          If OneBeacon means only that the evidence of record, even\n\ndrawing all inferences in Beacon Mutual's favor as required on\n\nsummary judgment, is insufficient to support a finding of harm to\n\ngoodwill or reputation, OneBeacon is wrong yet again.      Here, a\n\nfactfinder taking all inferences in favor of Beacon Mutual could\n\nreasonably infer that much of the actual confusion described in the\n\nConfusion Matrix is commercially relevant.\n\n          Misdirected premium payments, one could reasonably infer,\n\ncause delays in crediting those payments.     One could infer that\n\nthose delays, in turn, cause the coverage of Beacon Mutual's\n\ncustomers (i.e., employers) to lapse or to be cancelled if the\n\nerror is not corrected in time.   That, in turn, one could further\n\ninfer, places those employers in violation of Rhode Island laws\n\nrequiring employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-6.   Indeed, according to Lynch's affidavit\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f(which has not been controverted), at least one Beacon Mutual\n\ncustomer has had its policy lapse because of such an error.\n\nMoreover,   even   if   the   error    is    corrected   before   a   lapse   or\n\ncancellation in coverage occurs, it is reasonable to infer that the\n\ncustomer, in many instances, would be displeased by the error or by\n\nbeing wrongly accused of missing a premium payment. Whether or not\n\na particular policy is actually cancelled, one could reasonably\n\ninfer that Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for good service\n\nhas been harmed.\n\n            Similarly, a factfinder could infer that misdirected\n\nclaim forms from health care providers cause delays in payments to\n\nthose providers.        As Chief Judge Arrigan of the Rhode Island\n\nWorkers' Compensation Court noted, Beacon Mutual maintains an\n\napproved preferred provider network.           Delayed payments, one could\n\ninfer, make providers less inclined to remain in that network.\n\nWhen providers drop out of the network, injured workers covered by\n\nBeacon Mutual's workers' compensation insurance have a smaller pool\n\nof doctors and hospitals from which to choose, a result that one\n\ncould infer harms Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for\n\nproviding good coverage.\n\n            A factfinder could further infer that injured workers\n\nwill be upset when their confidential medical records are sent to\n\nthe wrong insurer.       Some health care providers, one could also\n\ninfer, will attempt to avoid such situations, which potentially\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fgive rise to liability under Rhode Island statutes prohibiting the\n\ndisclosure of such information without written consent, R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 5-37.3-4, by refusing to accept patients insured by Beacon\n\nMutual. Either of those consequences could reasonably be viewed as\n\ndetracting from Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.\n\n          Misdirected communications from third-party insurance\n\nagencies, one could also infer, increase the costs of claims\n\nprocessing, leading to lower profits (if premiums stay the same) or\n\nlower sales (if premiums go up).      Where disputes with third-party\n\ninsurers must be resolved before an injured worker is reimbursed,\n\none could also infer that such misdirected communications delay\n\nreimbursement,   again   harming      Beacon   Mutual's      goodwill     and\n\nreputation.\n\n          Further,   a   factfinder    could   infer,   as    Chief     Judge\n\nArrigan did in his letter to Beacon Mutual, that employers and\n\ninjured workers will not receive timely notice of legal proceedings\n\nif service of process and other legal notices are sent to the wrong\n\ninsurer and that those employers' and employees' rights could be\n\ncompromised as a result.    It is no great leap to infer that such\n\nproblems would harm Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.\n\n          Given that reasonable inferences must be drawn in Beacon\n\nMutual's favor on summary judgment, we find that Beacon Mutual has\n\npresented sufficient evidence of actual confusion relevant to its\n\ncommercial interests for this factor to count in its favor on\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fsummary judgment.     That leaves OneBeacon fighting an uphill battle\n\nin arguing that no reasonable factfinder could find a substantial\n\nlikelihood of confusion.          Evidence of actual confusion is often\n\nconsidered the most persuasive evidence of likelihood of confusion\n\nbecause past confusion is frequently a strong indicator of future\n\nconfusion.   See 3 McCarthy § 23:13; see also Kos Pharms., Inc. v.\n\nAndrx Corp., No. 03-3977, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 10165, at *54 (3d\n\nCir. May 24, 2004) (\"even a few incidents\" of actual confusion are\n\n\"highly   probative    of   the    likelihood   of   confusion\"   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Thane Int'l, Inc. v. Trek Bicycle Corp.,\n\n305 F.3d 894, 902 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"Evidence of actual confusion\n\nconstitutes persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nB.   Application of the Remaining Seven Factors\n\n           Nonetheless, we also consider the other factors commonly\n\nused in the eight-part test.           The first factor, similarity of\n\nmarks, weighs in Beacon Mutual's favor.         This factor is evaluated\n\nbased on the \"the designation's total effect.\"             Int'l Ass'n of\n\nMachinists, 103 F.3d at 203.        Here, the marks use different fonts\n\nand colors, but a factfinder could reasonably find the total effect\n\nto be similar.   In both sets of marks, the most salient word is\n\n\"Beacon\" and the only pictorial element is a lighthouse image.\n\nSee 3 McCarthy § 23:44 (\"If the 'dominant' portion of both marks is\n\nthe same, then confusion may be likely, notwithstanding peripheral\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fdifferences.\"). Moreover, OneBeacon's arguments that the marks are\n\nnot confusingly similar are belied by the evidence of actual\n\nconfusion.\n\n            The second factor, similarity of goods and services, also\n\nfavors Beacon Mutual. OneBeacon conceded this point in its summary\n\njudgment papers before the district court and thus has abandoned\n\nany argument to the contrary.             Both parties sell the same basic\n\nworkers'     compensation    coverage       in    Rhode   Island.        Although\n\nOneBeacon's business extends to other states and other forms of\n\ninsurance, a factfinder could reasonably conclude that those other\n\nlines of business do not dispel the potential for confusion in the\n\nRhode   Island     market     for    workers'       compensation    insurance.\n\nSee Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler, 814 F.2d 812, 818\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (finding similarity of goods and services between\n\na shop specializing in Volkswagen repair and distributors that both\n\nsold and repaired Volkswagens).\n\n             Factors three (channels of trade), four (advertising),\n\nand five (classes of prospective purchasers) are often considered\n\ntogether because they tend to be interrelated.             See Int'l Ass'n of\n\nMachinists, 103 F.3d at 204.        It is not clear whether these factors\n\nfavor either party.         OneBeacon does not advertise its workers'\n\ncompensation insurance in Rhode Island. And although Beacon Mutual\n\nand OneBeacon are selling to the same group of customers, i.e.,\n\nemployers    in   Rhode   Island,    it    is    uncontroverted,    on   summary\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fjudgment, that OneBeacon's customers are guided in their decisions\n\nby independent insurance agents who understand the difference\n\nbetween the two companies.\n\n           But the lack of confusion among OneBeacon agents does not\n\nestablish conclusively that employers purchasing the insurance are\n\nnot confused.    Nor does it establish lack of confusion among the\n\nusers of the insurance, i.e., employees, who may influence future\n\npurchases by employers.    See 3 McCarthy § 23:7 (confusion of end-\n\nusers who may influence buying decisions is relevant). Indeed, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that confusion does exist among employees.       We\n\nfurther note that the record does not compel the inference that the\n\ncustomers -- the majority of whom Attorney Lynch described in his\n\naffidavit as being small businesses with less than ten employees\n\nand   premiums   under    $5,000   per    year   --   are   particularly\n\nsophisticated.\n\n           The seventh factor, intent in adopting the mark, is\n\nneutral.   So far, there is no dispute that OneBeacon adopted its\n\nmark in good faith: the name was chosen based, in part, on the\n\naddress of the company's corporate headquarters at One Beacon\n\nStreet in Boston, and although OneBeacon was aware of Beacon\n\nMutual's existence, it had a good-faith belief that the marks would\n\nnot be confused.    Under this circuit's precedents, however, this\n\nfactor usually matters only where an alleged infringer copied a\n\nmark in bad faith; a converse finding of good faith carries \"little\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fweight.\"   I.P. Lund, 163 F.3d at 44; see Chrysler Corp. v. Silva,\n\n118 F.3d 56, 59 n.3 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           The last factor, the strength of the marks, weighs in\n\nBeacon Mutual's favor.   We look to \"the length of time the mark has\n\nbeen used, its renown in the plaintiff's field of business, and the\n\nplaintiff's actions to promote the mark.\"      Star Fin. Servs. v.\n\nAastar Mortg. Corp., 89 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 1996).    Here, Beacon\n\nMutual's marks were in use for nine years before OneBeacon adopted\n\nits current name. Beacon Mutual's marks could reasonably be viewed\n\nas having state-wide recognition based on the company's 65% market\n\nshare and the survey indicating that many Rhode Island consumers\n\nassociate the mark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual.       Moreover,\n\nBeacon Mutual invested over $1.3 million in promoting its marks in\n\nboth 2000 and 2001.5\n\n           The reasonable inferences, on summary judgment, work in\n\nfavor of Beacon Mutual on the most critical factors in this case:\n\nevidence of actual confusion, similarity of marks, similarity of\n\ngoods and services, and strength of marks.      A factfinder could\n\nsupportably conclude that there is a sufficient likelihood of\n\n\n     5\n          OneBeacon argues that the mark is weak because a yellow\npages search shows that the term \"beacon\" is used by other\nfinancial services companies in the Northeast. But none of the\nRhode Island companies listed appear to be insurance companies and\nthere is no evidence that any of the other companies do business in\nRhode Island. Cf. Star Fin. Servs. v. Aastar Mortg. Corp., 89\nF.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"renown in the plaintiff's field of\nbusiness\" is what matters in assessing the strength of a mark\n(emphasis added)).\n\n                                -26-\n\fconfusion between the marks.            The Lanham Act claim (Count I) and\n\nstate common          law   claims   (Counts   II    and   III)   survive   summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                                        III.\n\n                  That leaves Count IV, the Rhode Island trademark dilution\n\ncount.       OneBeacon argued to the district court that even if a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of confusion existed, this count should be\n\ndismissed on the ground that no factfinder could reasonably infer\n\nthat       such    confusion   would   tarnish      or   dilute   Beacon    Mutual's\n\ngoodwill because OneBeacon offers the same coverage and quality of\n\ninsurance as Beacon Mutual.            The district court did not reach this\n\nargument, granting summary judgment on the alternative ground that\n\nthe dilution claim automatically failed because no likelihood of\n\nconfusion existed.6\n\n                  Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-2-12,\n\n                  Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of\n                  dilution of the distinctive quality of . . . a mark valid\n                  at common law . . . shall be a ground for injunctive\n                  relief notwithstanding the absence of competition between\n                  the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source\n                  of goods or services. (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Beacon Mutual takes issue with the district court's\nreasoning on this point. R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-2-12 states that it\napplies \"notwithstanding . . . the absence of confusion as to the\nsource of goods or services.\" Cf. I.P. Lund, 163 F.3d at 48-49\n(under federal anti-dilution statute, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1),\n\"dilution can occur even in the absence of confusion\"). We do not\nreach the validity of the court's reasoning on this point because\nwe find a sufficient showing of likelihood of confusion here.\n\n                                        -27-\n\fWhere, as here, a factfinder could reasonably infer that actual\n\nconfusion injured the trademark holder's goodwill and business\n\nreputation, no further showing of injury is necessary to survive\n\nsummary judgment on a § 6-2-12 claim.   Cf. Astra, 718 F.2d at 1209\n\n(plaintiff may survive summary judgment under identically worded\n\nMassachusetts trademark dilution statute by showing \"injury to the\n\nvalue of the mark caused by actual or potential confusion\").\n\n                                IV.\n\n           Beacon Mutual must still prove its case at trial; this\n\nopinion holds only that it must be given the chance to do so.   The\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of OneBeacon is reversed, and\n\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.   Costs are awarded to Beacon Mutual.\n\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f",

In 1992, it adopted the name The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (\"Beacon Mutual\") and, since then, has sold workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island under the marks \"The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company,\" \"Beacon Insurance,\" and \"The Beacon,\" with an accompanying lighthouse logo. The name change was brought about by increased competition following the resolution of a crisis in the state workers' compensation market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, the defendant OneBeacon Insurance Group (\"OneBeacon\"), which sells various forms of commercial insurance nationwide, switched to its current name and adopted a lighthouse logo as well, albeit in a different font and arrangement. The name change resulted from the sale of the company, then called CGU Corporation, to another company; the terms of the sale required CGU to change its name. OneBeacon is a direct competitor of Beacon Mutual in the Rhode Island market for workers' compensation insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual brought suit one month after OneBeacon's name change, alleging violations of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a), and state trademark laws. On November 14, 2003, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of OneBeacon on all counts on the ground that Beacon Mutual had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of confusion. <i>Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins. Group,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d 241, 252 (D.R.I.2003). Beacon Mutual now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For likelihood of confusion to be actionable, the \"confusion has to exist in the mind of a relevant person.\" <i>Astra Pharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc.,</i> 718 F.2d 1201, 1207 (1st Cir.1983). The primary issue in this appeal is the relevance of evidence submitted by Beacon Mutual showing 249 instances of confusion between the two companies in the sixteen months following OneBeacon's adoption of its current name. Most of the confusion involved misdirected premium checks, claim forms, medical records, and legal correspondence. OneBeacon argues that those incidents do not demonstrate confusion among relevant persons because the confused persons were not those who made purchasing decisions and there was no evidence that their confusion caused Beacon Mutual to lose sales. OneBeacon's argument impermissibly narrows the scope of the court's inquiry into both the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the persons among whom confusion exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the type of commercial injury actionable under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a), is not restricted to the loss of sales to actual and prospective buyers of the product in question. Confusion is relevant when it exists in the minds of persons in a position to influence the purchasing decision or persons whose confusion presents a significant risk to the sales, goodwill, or reputation of the trademark owner. This holding is consistent with our existing case law, under which post-sale confusion is actionable. <i>See I.P. Lund Trading, ApS v. Kohler Co.,</i> 163 F.3d 27, 44 (1st Cir.1998). We also hold that relevant commercial injury includes not only loss of sales but also harm to the trademark holder's goodwill and reputation. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition &#167; 25:5 (4th ed. 1996) [hereinafter, McCarthy].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, Beacon Mutual. Here, a factfinder could reasonably infer that the misdirected communications (1) showed confusion among purchasing companies, their covered employees, consulting physicians and other health care providers, third-party insurers, attorneys for claimant employees, and courts handling such claims, and (2) had caused commercial injury to Beacon Mutual in the form of, <i>inter alia,</i> delays in claims processing, mistaken cancellations of coverage for failure to pay premiums, delayed reimbursements of health care providers, improper disclosure of confidential medical records, and risk of potential legal penalties for purchasers, covered workers, and providers. Reasonable inferences could be drawn that these problems had damaged Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation. Reasonable inferences could also be drawn that these problems had led or would lead to lost sales, although the drawing of such inferences is not necessary to survive summary judgment in light of the other forms of commercial injury present in this case. Because inappropriate legal standards were employed both as to the substantive application of trademark law and as to the drawing of inferences on summary judgment, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are described in the light most favorable to Beacon Mutual, the non-moving party. <i>Zyla v. Wadsworth,</i> 360 F.3d 243, 246 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual is the largest writer of workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island, collecting over $118 million in premiums in 2001. It has used its marks and lighthouse logo since June 24, 1992, but never registered them. Over the years, Beacon Mutual has steadily increased its advertising and promotional expenditures to build its brand, spending close to $1.4 million in 2001. Beacon Mutual says that these promotional activities, most of which involve displaying its marks, are necessary to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive market. According to a consumer survey submitted by Beacon Mutual on summary judgment, many Rhode Island consumers now associate the mark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual. Beacon Mutual offers its workers' compensation insurance through agents as well as through direct sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon, formerly known as CGU Insurance, began using its current name and lighthouse logo nationally in early June 2001. A Boston-based corporation that sells commercial insurance nationwide, OneBeacon offers workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island on a much smaller scale than Beacon Mutual, collecting around $1 million in workers' compensation premiums in 2001. OneBeacon says that workers' compensation insurance is not a profitable line of business for it in Rhode Island and that it offers the product only as a convenience to its existing customers. The workers' compensation coverage offered by OneBeacon is comparable to that offered by Beacon Mutual and is sold at rates that are the same or higher than Beacon Mutual's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon share addresses that sound similar. Beacon Mutual is located at One Beacon Center, Warwick, Rhode Island, and OneBeacon is located at One Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts. Counsel for OneBeacon informed us at oral argument that Beacon Mutual was already located at its current address when her client began using the name \"OneBeacon\" in June 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 5, 2001, Beacon Mutual brought a four-count trademark infringement action against OneBeacon in the Rhode Island Superior Court. Count I alleged unfair competition under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a); Count II alleged unfair competition under Rhode Island common law; Count III alleged service mark infringement under Rhode Island common law; and Count IV alleged trademark dilution under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6-2-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon removed the case to federal court and then moved for summary judgment, arguing that all four counts should be dismissed because there was no likelihood of confusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> OneBeacon relied principally on the fact that it sells workers' compensation insurance exclusively through licensed independent insurance agents. OneBeacon submitted a telephone survey showing that those agents understand the difference between the two companies and that those agents typically guide consumers, whom the agents said do not ordinarily express a preference for a particular brand of workers' compensation insurance, through the purchasing process. OneBeacon argued that if its agents are not confused, purchasers guided by those agents are unlikely to be confused either. Moreover, OneBeacon argued that to the extent that confusion exists among non-purchasers or potential purchasers before the point of sale, such confusion is not actionable because \"it cannot possibly cause the harm that the trademark laws are meant to prevent: economic harm to Beacon Mutual in the form of lost sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual opposed summary judgment, arguing that, contrary to OneBeacon's assertion, confusion need not be tied specifically to lost sales or to the state of mind of purchasers at the point of sale to be actionable. Confusion, Beacon Mutual argued, is relevant where it adversely affects the trademark owner's commercial interests. Here, Beacon Mutual argued, at a minimum, the goodwill and reputation of Beacon Mutual were harmed by actual confusion among Rhode Island employers, workers, health care providers, third-party insurance companies, attorneys, and courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual submitted an affidavit by Michael Lynch, vice president of legal services for Beacon Mutual, stating that shortly after OneBeacon's name change, Beacon Mutual began receiving misdirected e-mails, telephone calls, checks, and letters intended for OneBeacon. Attorney Lynch attached to his affidavit an exhibit, entitled the \"Confusion Matrix,\" that detailed 249 instances of confusion between Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon between June 2001 and November 2002, based on Lynch's own personal knowledge and information in Beacon Mutual's business records. The Confusion Matrix documented, <i>inter alia,</i> confusion among four main groups:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Rhode Island employers (24 instances): mostly, premium checks sent to Beacon Mutual instead of OneBeacon or (in at least one instance) vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Health care providers (95 instances): mostly, insurance claim forms or patient medical records sent to Beacon Mutual instead of OneBeacon or vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Third-party insurance companies (18 instances): mostly, Beacon Mutual was contacted to resolve claims instead of OneBeacon or vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Courts or attorneys (72 instances): mostly, summonses, complaints, or legal correspondence sent to Beacon Mutual instead of OneBeacon or vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch stated in his affidavit that these instances of confusion had led to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">claims processing being delayed or not accomplished, both companies being potentially subjected to legal action for breach of contract or individual's privacy rights, injured workers not being timely compensated or notified of court hearings, employers not being notified of court proceedings, providers not being paid in a timely manner, and insureds not being credited for premium payments (and then having their coverage lapse or cancelled, resulting in their being in violation of the state workers' compensation laws).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lynch also attached to his affidavit an August 29, 2001 letter from the Chief Judge of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Court to Beacon Mutual complaining about delays caused by confusion between the two companies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Workers' Compensation Court is concerned as a result of recent confusion arising from the similarity of names between The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company and OneBeacon Insurance Group (formerly CGU Insurance Group)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has been made aware that service of process and notices that are intended for OneBeacon are unintentionally being sent to The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company's office in Warwick. This confusion impacts our workers' compensation cases, in that notice to parties may be delayed, affecting both the employees['] and employers['] rights and benefits....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional concern is regarding preferred provider networks (PPN). The Beacon Mutual Insurance Carrier does have an approved PPN, while OneBeacon does not. When an injured worker telephones to determine if a PPN is in effect for their employer, some confusion may exi[st] as to the appropriate carrier on the part of the employee, thereby possibly limiting the employee's choice of physician inappropriately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon's response was that these many instances of confusion were simply irrelevant because Beacon Mutual had not demonstrated that they led to a loss of sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of OneBeacon on all counts. <i>Beacon Mutual,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 242. After first determining that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Beacon Mutual's marks were distinctive, the court turned to the relevance of the Confusion Matrix. It determined that while the Confusion Matrix showed that \"the confusion Plaintiff complains of is real,\" the plaintiff \"has not established that the entities and persons identified in its Matrix fall into the post-sale confusion category, for the simple reason that the confused entities are not consumers of the product, nor has Plaintiff shown any commercial relevance as to these entities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court acknowledged that even if the confusion of actual purchasers is always corrected at the point of sale, confusion among non-purchasers and potential purchasers can be relevant where it affects the trademark owner's \"commercial interests.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247 (citing <i>CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc.,</i> 888 F.Supp. 192, 200 (D.Me.1995), <i>aff'd,</i> 97 F.3d 1504 (1st Cir.1996)). At one point, the court described those commercial interests as including goodwill, citing other cases that recognize the confusion of third parties as relevant when \"their views are somehow related to the goodwill of the aggrieved manufacturer.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Landscape Forms, Inc. v. Columbia Cascade Co.,</i> 113 F.3d 373, 382-83 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this standard, however, the court focused on what it found to be Beacon Mutual's failure to connect the 249 instances of confusion described in the Confusion Matrix to lost sales. It emphasized that \"there is no indication that this type of confusion has ever played any role in the purchasing calculus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 248. The theme of the opinion was that \"Plaintiff has put on no evidence that it has lost any business as a result of confusion among its insured\" or \"proffered any evidence from which this Court reasonably could infer that the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to switch providers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 249. It therefore concluded that there was an \"absence of evidence\" about the \"possible nocent effect of this confusion on Plaintiff's market interests\" and that it could not find any such effect without engaging in speculation. <i>Id.</i> at 248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing on its analysis of the relevance of the Confusion Matrix, the court applied the eight-factor test for likelihood of confusion used by this court in <i>Astra,</i> 718 F.2d at 1205 (adopting the test articulated in <i>Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1981)). <i>See also I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 43; <i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aero. Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr.,</i> 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir.1996). It concluded that no reasonable factfinder could find in favor of Beacon Mutual on the most important factors in the case: evidence of actual confusion, similarity in the classes of prospective purchasers, and similarity in the channels of trade. 290 F.Supp.2d at 252. The court then held that although Beacon Mutual's marks were strong and the two parties' marks were similar, those factors could not overcome Beacon Mutual's \"fatal failure to demonstrate that the confusion it identifies is connected in any way to its commercial interests.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no likelihood of confusion connected to commercial interests, the court dismissed the Lanham Act and state common law claims (Counts I-III). The court also dismissed the Rhode Island statutory dilution claim (Count IV), reasoning that \"[b]ecause the Court has held that Plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment on the likelihood of confusion prong of its Lanham Act claim, so, too, does its dilution claim fail.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual timely appealed from the dismissal of all four claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Douglas v. York County,</i> 360 F.3d 286, 290 (1st Cir.2004). On a motion for summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party (here, Beacon Mutual), regardless of who bears the ultimate burden of proof. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual acknowledges that it must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of confusion to survive summary judgment on the Lanham Act and state common law counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Section 43 of the Lanham Act, under which Count I is brought, provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services... uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device... which ... is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person ... shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a)(1). The same likelihood of confusion requirement applies to Beacon Mutual's claims under Rhode Island common law for unfair competition and service mark infringement. <i>See DeCosta v. Viacom Int'l, Inc.,</i> 981 F.2d 602, 606-07 (1st Cir.1992) (applying collateral estoppel to prevent relitigation of likelihood of confusion issue under Lanham Act when that issue had already been decided in earlier suit under Rhode Island common law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eight factors, outlined most recently in <i>I.P. Lund,</i> are typically used to assess the likelihood of confusion: (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods; (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the relationship between the parties' advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6) evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark. 163 F.3d at 43. These factors are not to be applied mechanically. Courts may consider other factors and may accord little weight to factors that are not helpful on the particular facts of a case. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidence of Actual Confusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the sixth factor, evidence of actual confusion. On summary judgment, OneBeacon, for its part, has not disputed the accuracy of the 249 instances of actual confusion listed in the Confusion Matrix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, OneBeacon argued to the district court that confusion is relevant only if it (1) involved actual or potential purchasers and (2) caused the trademark holder to lose sales. The extent to which the district court accepted these arguments is not clear. The district court clearly rejected the notion that confusion is relevant only if it involves actual or potential purchasers. <i>Beacon Mutual,</i> 290 F.Supp.2d at 247. But the district court appears at some points to have required Beacon Mutual to demonstrate that the confusion caused lost sales or lost customers, while suggesting at other points that loss of goodwill is a relevant harm. <i>Compare id.</i> (requiring only a showing of an effect on \"goodwill\" (quoting <i>Landscape Forms,</i> 113 F.3d at 382-83) or other \"commercial interests\"), <i>with id.</i> at 249 (faulting Beacon Mutual for failing to offer evidence that it \"lost any business\" or that \"the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to switch providers\").

The leading commentators also agree that harm to goodwill and harm to reputation are actionable. McCarthy states that the \"post-sale confusion of a purchaser of an insurance policy who mistakenly makes a claim to another company with a similar name\" is relevant and quotes <i>Meridian,</i> 128 F.3d at 1118, for the proposition that \"the fact that a company's goodwill, rather than its pocketbook, is injured by actual confusion does not render the confusion meaningless.\" 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:7 &amp; n. 12; <i>see also</i> 3A Callman on Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies &#167; 21:4 (4th ed. 1981) (\"Even without `passing off' and diversion of trade, the injury [suffered by a trademark owner] may be grievous\" because of harm to reputation).

Relevant confusion among non-purchasers may well extend beyond the confusion of those persons positioned to influence directly the decisions of purchasers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon argues that summary judgment is appropriate because Beacon Mutual has not produced evidence specifically demonstrating that the confusion threatened its commercial interests, including its goodwill. If OneBeacon means that, in general, commercial injury may not ever be inferred on summary judgment, that proposition is flatly wrong. On summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of Beacon Mutual, the non-moving party. <i>Douglas,</i> 360 F.3d at 290; <i>Zyla,</i> 360 F.3d at 247; <i>see also Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio, Inc. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 169 F.3d 43, 56 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party on summary judgment and that \"[i]nferences can, of course, properly be drawn from circumstantial evidence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If OneBeacon means that as a matter of substantive trademark law, only <i>direct</i> evidence (with no room for inference) may establish harm to goodwill, that contention is wrong as well. In the Title VII context, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected a direct evidence requirement, instead applying the conventional rule that a plaintiff may amass a preponderance of the evidence through direct or circumstantial evidence. <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> 539 U.S. 90, 99-100, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). We see no reason for applying a different rule in the trademark context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If OneBeacon means only that the evidence of record, even drawing all inferences in Beacon Mutual's favor as required on summary judgment, is insufficient to support a finding of harm to goodwill or reputation, OneBeacon is wrong yet again. Here, a factfinder taking all inferences in favor of Beacon Mutual could reasonably infer that much of the actual confusion described in the Confusion Matrix is commercially relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misdirected premium payments, one could reasonably infer, cause delays in crediting those payments. One could infer that those delays, in turn, cause the coverage of Beacon Mutual's customers (<i>i.e.,</i> employers) to lapse or to be cancelled if the error is not corrected in time. That, in turn, one could further infer, places those employers in violation of Rhode Island laws requiring employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-29-6. Indeed, according to the Confusion Matrix (the accuracy of which has not been challenged), at least one Beacon Mutual customer has had its policy lapse because of such an error. Moreover, even if the error is corrected before a lapse or cancellation in coverage occurs, it is reasonable to infer that the customer, in many instances, would be displeased by the error or by being wrongly accused of missing a premium payment. Whether or not a particular policy is actually cancelled, one could reasonably infer that Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for good service has been harmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, a factfinder could infer that misdirected claim forms from health care providers cause delays in payments to those providers. As Chief Judge Arrigan of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Court noted, Beacon Mutual maintains an approved preferred provider network. Delayed payments, one could infer, make providers less inclined to remain in that network. When providers drop out of the network, injured workers covered by Beacon Mutual's workers' compensation insurance have a smaller pool of doctors and hospitals from which to choose, a result that one could infer harms Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for providing good coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A factfinder could further infer that injured workers will be upset when their confidential medical records are sent to the wrong insurer. Some health care providers, one could also infer, will attempt to avoid such situations, which potentially give rise to liability under Rhode Island statutes prohibiting the disclosure of such information without written consent, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 5-37.3-4, by refusing to accept patients insured by Beacon Mutual. Either of those consequences could reasonably be viewed as detracting from Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misdirected communications from third-party insurance agencies, one could also infer, increase the costs of claims processing, leading to lower profits (if premiums stay the same) or lower sales (if premiums go up). Where disputes with third-party insurers must be resolved before an injured worker is reimbursed, one could also infer that such misdirected communications delay reimbursement, again harming Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a factfinder could infer, as Chief Judge Arrigan did in his letter to Beacon Mutual, that employers and injured workers will not receive timely notice of legal proceedings if service of process and other legal notices are sent to the wrong insurer and that those employers' and employees' rights could be compromised as a result. It is no great leap to infer that such problems would harm Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that reasonable inferences must be drawn in Beacon Mutual's favor on summary judgment, we find that Beacon Mutual has presented sufficient evidence of actual confusion relevant to its commercial interests for this factor to count in its favor on summary judgment. That leaves OneBeacon fighting an uphill battle in arguing that no reasonable factfinder could find a substantial likelihood of confusion. Evidence of actual confusion is often considered the most persuasive evidence of likelihood of confusion because past confusion is frequently a strong indicator of future confusion. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:13; <i>see also KOS Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp.,</i> 369 F.3d 700, 720 (3d Cir.2004) (\"even a few incidents\" of actual confusion are \"highly probative of the likelihood of confusion\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Thane Int'l, Inc. v. Trek Bicycle Corp.,</i> 305 F.3d 894, 902 (9th Cir.2002) (\"Evidence of actual confusion constitutes persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Application of the Remaining Seven Factors</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we also consider the other factors commonly used in the eight-part test. The first factor, similarity of marks, weighs in Beacon Mutual's favor. This factor is evaluated based on the \"the designation's total effect.\" <i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 103 F.3d at 203. Here, the marks use different fonts and colors, but a factfinder could reasonably find the total effect to be similar. In both sets of marks, the most salient word is \"Beacon\" and the only pictorial element is a lighthouse image. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:44 (\"If the `dominant' portion of both marks is the same, then confusion may be likely, notwithstanding peripheral differences.\"). Moreover, OneBeacon's arguments that the marks are not confusingly similar are belied by the evidence of actual confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, similarity of goods and services, also favors Beacon Mutual. OneBeacon conceded this point in its summary judgment papers before the district court and thus has abandoned any argument to the contrary. Both parties sell the same basic workers' compensation coverage in Rhode Island. Although OneBeacon's business extends to other states and other forms of insurance, a factfinder could reasonably conclude that those other lines of business do not dispel the potential for confusion in the Rhode Island market for workers' compensation insurance. <i>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler,</i> 814 F.2d 812, 818 (1st Cir.1987) (finding similarity of goods and services between a shop specializing in Volkswagen repair and distributors that both sold and repaired Volkswagens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors three (channels of trade), four (advertising), and five (classes of prospective purchasers) are often considered together because they tend to be interrelated. <i>See Int'l Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 103 F.3d at 204. It is not clear whether these factors favor either party. OneBeacon does not advertise its workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island. And although Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon are selling to the same group of customers, <i>i.e.,</i> employers in Rhode Island, it is uncontroverted, on summary judgment, that OneBeacon's customers are guided in their decisions by independent insurance agents who understand the difference between the two companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the lack of confusion among OneBeacon agents does not establish conclusively that employers purchasing the insurance are not confused. Nor does it establish lack of confusion among the users of the insurance, <i>i.e.,</i> employees, who may influence future purchases by employers. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:7 (confusion of end-users who may influence buying decisions is relevant). Indeed, the record demonstrates that confusion does exist among employees. We further note that the record does not compel the inference that the customers &#8212; the majority of whom Attorney Lynch described in his affidavit as being small businesses with less than ten employees and premiums under $5,000 per year &#8212; are particularly sophisticated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seventh factor, intent in adopting the mark, is neutral. So far, there is no dispute that OneBeacon adopted its mark in good faith: the name was chosen based, in part, on the address of the company's corporate headquarters at One Beacon Street in Boston, and although OneBeacon was aware of Beacon Mutual's existence, it had a good-faith belief that the marks would not be confused. Under this circuit's precedents, however, this factor usually matters only where an alleged infringer copied a mark in bad faith; a converse finding of good faith carries \"little weight.\" <i>I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 44; <i>see Chrysler Corp. v. Silva,</i> 118 F.3d 56, 59 n. 3 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last factor, the strength of the marks, weighs in Beacon Mutual's favor. We look to \"the length of time the mark has been used, its renown in the plaintiff's field of business, and the plaintiff's actions to promote the mark.\" <i>Star Fin. Servs. v. Aastar Mortg. Corp.,</i> 89 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.1996). Here, Beacon Mutual's marks were in use for nine years before OneBeacon adopted its current name. Beacon Mutual's marks could reasonably be viewed as having state-wide recognition based on the company's 65% market share and the survey indicating that many Rhode Island consumers associate the mark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual. Moreover, Beacon Mutual invested over $1.3 million in promoting its marks in both 2000 and 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable inferences, on summary judgment, work in favor of Beacon Mutual on the most critical factors in this case: evidence of actual confusion, similarity of marks, similarity of goods and services, and strength of marks. A factfinder could supportably conclude that there is a sufficient likelihood of confusion between the marks. The Lanham Act claim (Count I) and state common law claims (Counts II and III) survive summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves Count IV, the Rhode Island trademark dilution count. OneBeacon argued to the district court that even if a substantial likelihood of confusion existed, this count should be dismissed on the ground that no factfinder could reasonably infer that such confusion would tarnish or dilute Beacon Mutual's goodwill because OneBeacon offers the same coverage and quality of insurance as Beacon Mutual. The district court did not reach this argument, granting summary judgment on the alternative ground that the dilution claim automatically failed because no likelihood of confusion existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under R.I.

The primary issue in this appeal is the relevance of evidence submitted by Beacon Mutual showing 249 instances of confusion between the two companies in the sixteen months following OneBeacon's adoption of its current name. Most of the confusion involved misdirected premium checks, claim forms, medical records, and legal correspondence. OneBeacon argues that those incidents do not demonstrate confusion among relevant persons because the confused persons were not those who made purchasing decisions and there was no evidence that their confusion caused Beacon Mutual to lose sales. OneBeacon's argument impermissibly narrows the scope of the court's inquiry into both the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the persons among whom confusion exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the type of commercial injury actionable under &#167; 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a), is not restricted to the loss of sales to actual and prospective buyers of the product in question. Confusion is relevant when it exists in the minds of persons in a position to influence the purchasing decision or persons whose confusion presents a significant risk to the sales, goodwill, or reputation of the trademark owner. This holding is consistent with our existing case law, under which post-sale confusion is actionable. <i>See I.P. Lund Trading, ApS v.

We also hold that relevant commercial injury includes not only loss of sales but also harm to the trademark holder's goodwill and reputation. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition &#167; 25:5 (4th ed. 1996) [hereinafter, McCarthy].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, Beacon Mutual. Here, a factfinder could reasonably infer that the misdirected communications (1) showed confusion among purchasing companies, their covered employees, consulting physicians and other health care providers, third-party insurers, attorneys for claimant employees, and courts handling such claims, and (2) had caused commercial injury to Beacon Mutual in the form of, <i>inter alia,</i> delays in claims processing, mistaken cancellations of coverage for failure to pay premiums, delayed reimbursements of health care providers, improper disclosure of confidential medical records, and risk of potential legal penalties for purchasers, covered workers, and providers. Reasonable inferences could be drawn that these problems had damaged Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation. Reasonable inferences could also be drawn that these problems had led or would lead to lost sales, although the drawing of such inferences is not necessary to survive summary judgment in light of the other forms of commercial injury present in this case. Because inappropriate legal standards were employed both as to the substantive application of trademark law and as to the drawing of inferences on summary judgment, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are described in the light most favorable to Beacon Mutual, the non-moving party. <i>Zyla v.

It has used its marks and lighthouse logo since June 24, 1992, but never registered them. Over the years, Beacon Mutual has steadily increased its advertising and promotional expenditures to build its brand, spending close to $1.4 million in 2001. Beacon Mutual says that these promotional activities, most of which involve displaying its marks, are necessary to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive market. According to a consumer survey submitted by Beacon Mutual on summary judgment, many Rhode Island consumers now associate the mark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual. Beacon Mutual offers its workers' compensation insurance through agents as well as through direct sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon, formerly known as CGU Insurance, began using its current name and lighthouse logo nationally in early June 2001. A Boston-based corporation that sells commercial insurance nationwide, OneBeacon offers workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island on a much smaller scale than Beacon Mutual, collecting around $1 million in workers' compensation premiums in 2001. OneBeacon says that workers' compensation insurance is not a profitable line of business for it in Rhode Island and that it offers the product only as a convenience to its existing customers. The workers' compensation coverage offered by OneBeacon is comparable to that offered by Beacon Mutual and is sold at rates that are the same or higher than Beacon Mutual's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon share addresses that sound similar. Beacon Mutual is located at One Beacon Center, Warwick, Rhode Island, and OneBeacon is located at One Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

Count I alleged unfair competition under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a); Count II alleged unfair competition under Rhode Island common law; Count III alleged service mark infringement under Rhode Island common law; and Count IV alleged trademark dilution under R.I.

OneBeacon submitted a telephone survey showing that those agents understand the difference between the two companies and that those agents typically guide consumers, whom the agents said do not ordinarily express a preference for a particular brand of workers' compensation insurance, through the purchasing process. OneBeacon argued that if its agents are not confused, purchasers guided by those agents are unlikely to be confused either. Moreover, OneBeacon argued that to the extent that confusion exists among non-purchasers or potential purchasers before the point of sale, such confusion is not actionable because \"it cannot possibly cause the harm that the trademark laws are meant to prevent: economic harm to Beacon Mutual in the form of lost sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual opposed summary judgment, arguing that, contrary to OneBeacon's assertion, confusion need not be tied specifically to lost sales or to the state of mind of purchasers at the point of sale to be actionable. Confusion, Beacon Mutual argued, is relevant where it adversely affects the trademark owner's commercial interests. Here, Beacon Mutual argued, at a minimum, the goodwill and reputation of Beacon Mutual were harmed by actual confusion among Rhode Island employers, workers, health care providers, third-party insurance companies, attorneys, and courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beacon Mutual submitted an affidavit by Michael Lynch, vice president of legal services for Beacon Mutual, stating that shortly after OneBeacon's name change, Beacon Mutual began receiving misdirected e-mails, telephone calls, checks, and letters intended for OneBeacon. Attorney Lynch attached to his affidavit an exhibit, entitled the \"Confusion Matrix,\" that detailed 249 instances of confusion between Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon between June 2001 and November 2002, based on Lynch's own personal knowledge and information in Beacon Mutual's business records.

After first determining that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Beacon Mutual's marks were distinctive, the court turned to the relevance of the Confusion Matrix. It determined that while the Confusion Matrix showed that \"the confusion Plaintiff complains of is real,\" the plaintiff \"has not established that the entities and persons identified in its Matrix fall into the post-sale confusion category, for the simple reason that the confused entities are not consumers of the product, nor has Plaintiff shown any commercial relevance as to these entities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court acknowledged that even if the confusion of actual purchasers is always corrected at the point of sale, confusion among non-purchasers and potential purchasers can be relevant where it affects the trademark owner's \"commercial interests.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247 (citing <i>CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v.

It emphasized that \"there is no indication that this type of confusion has ever played any role in the purchasing calculus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 248. The theme of the opinion was that \"Plaintiff has put on no evidence that it has lost any business as a result of confusion among its insured\" or \"proffered any evidence from which this Court reasonably could infer that the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to switch providers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 249. It therefore concluded that there was an \"absence of evidence\" about the \"possible nocent effect of this confusion on Plaintiff's market interests\" and that it could not find any such effect without engaging in speculation. <i>Id.</i> at 248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing on its analysis of the relevance of the Confusion Matrix, the court applied the eight-factor test for likelihood of confusion used by this court in <i>Astra,</i> 718 F.2d at 1205 (adopting the test articulated in <i>Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v.

If OneBeacon means that, in general, commercial injury may not ever be inferred on summary judgment, that proposition is flatly wrong. On summary judgment, all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of Beacon Mutual, the non-moving party. <i>Douglas,</i> 360 F.3d at 290; <i>Zyla,</i> 360 F.3d at 247; <i>see also Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio, Inc. v.

In the Title VII context, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected a direct evidence requirement, instead applying the conventional rule that a plaintiff may amass a preponderance of the evidence through direct or circumstantial evidence. <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 99-100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We see no reason for applying a different rule in the trademark context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If OneBeacon means only that the evidence of record, even drawing all inferences in Beacon Mutual's favor as required on summary judgment, is insufficient to support a finding of harm to goodwill or reputation, OneBeacon is wrong yet again. Here, a factfinder taking all inferences in favor of Beacon Mutual could reasonably infer that much of the actual confusion described in the Confusion Matrix is commercially relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misdirected premium payments, one could reasonably infer, cause delays in crediting those payments. One could infer that those delays, in turn, cause the coverage of Beacon Mutual's customers (<i>i.e.,</i> employers) to lapse or to be cancelled if the error is not corrected in time. That, in turn, one could further infer, places those employers in violation of Rhode Island laws requiring employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 28-29-6. Indeed, according to the Confusion Matrix (the accuracy of which has not been challenged), at least one Beacon Mutual customer has had its policy lapse because of such an error. Moreover, even if the error is corrected before a lapse or cancellation in coverage occurs, it is reasonable to infer that the customer, in many instances, would be displeased by the error or by being wrongly accused of missing a premium payment. Whether or not a particular policy is actually cancelled, one could reasonably infer that Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for good service has been harmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, a factfinder could infer that misdirected claim forms from health care providers cause delays in payments to those providers. As Chief Judge Arrigan of the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Court noted, Beacon Mutual maintains an approved preferred provider network. Delayed payments, one could infer, make providers less inclined to remain in that network. When providers drop out of the network, injured workers covered by Beacon Mutual's workers' compensation insurance have a smaller pool of doctors and hospitals from which to choose, a result that one could infer harms Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation for providing good coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A factfinder could further infer that injured workers will be upset when their confidential medical records are sent to the wrong insurer. Some health care providers, one could also infer, will attempt to avoid such situations, which potentially give rise to liability under Rhode Island statutes prohibiting the disclosure of such information without written consent, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 5-37.3-4, by refusing to accept patients insured by Beacon Mutual. Either of those consequences could reasonably be viewed as detracting from Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Misdirected communications from third-party insurance agencies, one could also infer, increase the costs of claims processing, leading to lower profits (if premiums stay the same) or lower sales (if premiums go up). Where disputes with third-party insurers must be resolved before an injured worker is reimbursed, one could also infer that such misdirected communications delay reimbursement, again harming Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a factfinder could infer, as Chief Judge Arrigan did in his letter to Beacon Mutual, that employers and injured workers will not receive timely notice of legal proceedings if service of process and other legal notices are sent to the wrong insurer and that those employers' and employees' rights could be compromised as a result. It is no great leap to infer that such problems would harm Beacon Mutual's goodwill and reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that reasonable inferences must be drawn in Beacon Mutual's favor on summary judgment, we find that Beacon Mutual has presented sufficient evidence of actual confusion relevant to its commercial interests for this factor to count in its favor on summary judgment. That leaves OneBeacon fighting an uphill battle in arguing that no reasonable factfinder could find a substantial likelihood of confusion. Evidence of actual confusion is often considered the most persuasive evidence of likelihood of confusion because past confusion is frequently a strong indicator of future confusion. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:13; <i>see also KOS Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786352\"><a href=\"/opinion/786352/kos-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-andrx-corporation-andrx-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 720 (3d Cir.2004) (\"even a few incidents\" of actual confusion are \"highly probative of the likelihood of confusion\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Thane Int'l, Inc. v.

Application of the Remaining Seven Factors</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, we also consider the other factors commonly used in the eight-part test. The first factor, similarity of marks, weighs in Beacon Mutual's favor. This factor is evaluated based on the \"the designation's total effect.\" <i>Int'l Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 103 F.3d at 203. Here, the marks use different fonts and colors, but a factfinder could reasonably find the total effect to be similar. In both sets of marks, the most salient word is \"Beacon\" and the only pictorial element is a lighthouse image. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:44 (\"If the `dominant' portion of both marks is the same, then confusion may be likely, notwithstanding peripheral differences.\"). Moreover, OneBeacon's arguments that the marks are not confusingly similar are belied by the evidence of actual confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, similarity of goods and services, also favors Beacon Mutual. OneBeacon conceded this point in its summary judgment papers before the district court and thus has abandoned any argument to the contrary. Both parties sell the same basic workers' compensation coverage in Rhode Island. Although OneBeacon's business extends to other states and other forms of insurance, a factfinder could reasonably conclude that those other lines of business do not dispel the potential for confusion in the Rhode Island market for workers' compensation insurance. <i>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485241\"><a href=\"/opinion/485241/volkswagenwerk-aktiengesellschaft-v-kenneth-g-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 818 (1st Cir.1987) (finding similarity of goods and services between a shop specializing in Volkswagen repair and distributors that both sold and repaired Volkswagens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors three (channels of trade), four (advertising), and five (classes of prospective purchasers) are often considered together because they tend to be interrelated. <i>See Int'l Ass'n of Machinists,</i> 103 F.3d at 204. It is not clear whether these factors favor either party. OneBeacon does not advertise its workers' compensation insurance in Rhode Island. And although Beacon Mutual and OneBeacon are selling to the same group of customers, <i>i.e.,</i> employers in Rhode Island, it is uncontroverted, on summary judgment, that OneBeacon's customers are guided in their decisions by independent insurance agents who understand the difference between the two companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the lack of confusion among OneBeacon agents does not establish conclusively that employers purchasing the insurance are not confused. Nor does it establish lack of confusion among the users of the insurance, <i>i.e.,</i> employees, who may influence future purchases by employers. <i>See</i> 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:7 (confusion of end-users who may influence buying decisions is relevant). Indeed, the record demonstrates that confusion does exist among employees. We further note that the record does not compel the inference that the customers &#8212; the majority of whom Attorney Lynch described in his affidavit as being small businesses with less than ten employees and premiums under $5,000 per year &#8212; are particularly sophisticated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seventh factor, intent in adopting the mark, is neutral. So far, there is no dispute that OneBeacon adopted its mark in good faith: the name was chosen based, in part, on the address of the company's corporate headquarters at One Beacon Street in Boston, and although OneBeacon was aware of Beacon Mutual's existence, it had a good-faith belief that the marks would not be confused. Under this circuit's precedents, however, this factor usually matters only where an alleged infringer copied a mark in bad faith; a converse finding of good faith carries \"little weight.\" <i>I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 44; <i>see Chrysler Corp. v. Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743480\"><a href=\"/opinion/743480/chrysler-corporation-v-john-c-silva-jr-dba-jc-silva-designs/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 n. 3 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last factor, the strength of the marks, weighs in Beacon Mutual's favor. We look to \"the length of time the mark has been used, its renown in the plaintiff's field of business, and the plaintiff's actions to promote the mark.\" <i>Star Fin. Servs. v. Aastar Mortg. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721476\"><a href=\"/opinion/721476/star-financial-services-inc-dba-star-mortgage-v-aastar-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1996). Here, Beacon Mutual's marks were in use for nine years before OneBeacon adopted its current name. Beacon Mutual's marks could reasonably be viewed as having state-wide recognition based on the company's 65% market share and the survey indicating that many Rhode Island consumers associate the mark \"The Beacon\" with Beacon Mutual. Moreover, Beacon Mutual invested over $1.3 million in promoting its marks in both 2000 and 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable inferences, on summary judgment, work in favor of Beacon Mutual on the most critical factors in this case: evidence of actual confusion, similarity of marks, similarity of goods and services, and strength of marks. A factfinder could supportably conclude that there is a sufficient likelihood of confusion between the marks. The Lanham Act claim (Count I) and state common law claims (Counts II and III) survive summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves Count IV, the Rhode Island trademark dilution count. OneBeacon argued to the district court that even if a substantial likelihood of confusion existed, this count should be dismissed on the ground that no factfinder could reasonably infer that such confusion would tarnish or dilute Beacon Mutual's goodwill because OneBeacon offers the same coverage and quality of insurance as Beacon Mutual. The district court did not reach this argument, granting summary judgment on the alternative ground that the dilution claim automatically failed because no likelihood of confusion existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under R.I.
