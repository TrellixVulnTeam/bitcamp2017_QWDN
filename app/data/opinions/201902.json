BURNETTE,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         ON REMAND FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Cheryl A. Burnette on supplemental brief pro se.\n\n     Peter E. Papps, Assistant United States Attorney, and Thomas\nP. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on supplemental brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 9, 2005\n\f               Lipez, Circuit Judge.       In United States v. Burnette, 375\n\nF.3d 10 (1st Cir. 2004), we affirmed Cheryl Burnette's conviction\n\nfor wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1343, and impersonation of a federal\n\nemployee, 18 U.S.C. ยง 912.          We also affirmed her sentence, which\n\nincluded 24 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised\n\nrelease, with the special condition that she pay almost $50,000 in\n\nrestitution.        Burnette then sought further review in the United\n\nStates Supreme Court.           The Supreme Court vacated judgment and\n\nremanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of United\n\nStates v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), which was decided after we\n\naffirmed Burnette's conviction and sentence.                 See Burnette v.\n\nUnited States, 125 S. Ct. 1406 (2005).                We invited supplemental\n\nbriefing on whether the case should be remanded to the district\n\ncourt for resentencing in accordance with Booker.\n\n               Noting that she has already finished serving her prison\n\nterm and has begun serving her term of supervised release, Burnette\n\nonly       poses   Booker    challenges    to   the   restitution   order   and\n\nconditions of supervised release.1              Burnette failed to preserve\n\neither claim in the district court by arguing that the sentence was\n\nunconstitutional.2          See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\n\n       1\n      Burnette has waived any challenge to her sentence of\nincarceration, stating specifically in her brief that she does not\nwant us to revisit that issue.\n       2\n      In a supplemental brief, Burnette asserts that she preserved\nher Booker claim by arguing \"in the District and the Circuit that\nthe Guidelines and PSI Report were unconstitutional.\"      The two\n\n                                          -2-\n\f68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The argument that a Booker error occurred\n\nis preserved if the defendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely\n\nerror or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\").\n\n           On appeal, Burnette's challenge to the conditions of\n\nsupervised release is so inadequately developed that we deem it\n\nwaived.   See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (noting that \"[w]e have steadfastly deemed waived issues\n\nraised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not accompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation\").3   We review her Booker challenge to the\n\nrestitution order, which is somewhat more developed, for plain\n\nerror.    See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.   To establish plain\n\nerror, an appellant must point to (1) an error (2) that is plain\n\nand that both (3) affects substantial rights and (4) seriously\n\naffects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.    United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 736\n\n(1993).\n\n           Burnette asserts that under the logic of Booker and the\n\nline of cases that preceded it, \"restitution can be imposed only\n\n\ndocuments that Burnette cites as evidence that she preserved her\nclaim, however, do not appear to include any argument that the\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.    In the absence of any other\nindication that Burnette challenged the constitutionality of her\nsentence in the district court, we treat her claim as unpreserved.\n     3\n      Without authorization, Burnette submitted a reply brief which\nwe will not consider. Burnette was bound by the terms of our order\ninviting one supplemental brief from each party.       We do note,\nhowever, that the reply brief did not contain any argumentation on\nthe issue of supervised release.\n\n                                -3-\n\ffor an amount that has been proven to the Jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt or admitted by the defendant,\" and thus that the district\n\ncourt committed plain error when it imposed a restitution order\n\nbased on its own loss calculation.           We have not yet considered the\n\napplicability of Booker to the statutory provisions governing\n\nrestitution orders.4 Several of our sister circuits, however, have\n\nruled that restitution orders imposed pursuant to statute do not\n\nimplicate Booker for a variety of reasons, including the fact that\n\nthere is no statutory maximum for such orders.                 See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Miller,           F.3d     , 2005 WL 1993936, at *1 (8th Cir.\n\nAug. 19, 2005); United States v. Sosebee,                      F.3d    , 2005 WL\n\n1941286, at *8-9 (6th Cir. Aug. 12, 2005); United States v.\n\nRattler,   2005   WL     1670257,    at    *1    (4th   Cir.    July   19,   2005)\n\n(unpublished); United States v. Bussell, 414 F.3d 1048, 1060 (9th\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. George, 403 F.3d 470, 473 (7th Cir.\n\n2005);   cf.   Booker,    125   S.   Ct.    at   764    (recognizing    that   the\n\nforfeiture statute remains \"perfectly valid\" post-Booker). Indeed,\n\nno circuit has held that Booker applies to restitution orders.5\n\n\n     4\n      Although Antonakopoulos included a challenge to the amount of\na restitution order, that challenge was based on the accuracy of\nthe court's loss calculation rather than on constitutional\nprinciples.    See 399 F.3d at 83-84 and n.13 (\"The defendant\npresents no serious claim of Booker error as to restitution.\").\n     5\n       But see Susan R. Klein, The Return of Federal Judicial\nDiscretion in Criminal Sentencing, 39 Val. U. L. Rev. 693, 722\nn.138 (2005) (arguing that the logic of Booker extends to\nrestitution orders imposed under the Mandatory Victim's Restitution\nAct, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663A).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            This case does not require us to decide the restitution\n\nissue    definitively.   To   prevail   on   her   claim,   Burnette   must\n\ndemonstrate not only that there was an error, but that the error\n\nwas plain.     Even if there is an argument to be made that the\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing the restitution order (and we are\n\nnot suggesting that it did), that error certainly was not plain,\n\nand henceforth Burnette's claim fails.6\n\n     Accordingly, we direct the entry of judgment affirming both\n\nthe conviction and the sentence.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Burnette also complains about two issues unrelated to\nsentencing: her conviction based on the admission of certain\nevidence, and her unhappiness with appellate counsel. These claims,\nunlike her Booker claims, do not rest on an intervening change in\nthe law.   Rather, she seeks to relitigate issues which we have\nalready decided. Although we have the power to \"reexamine an issue\nthat lies beyond the circumference of the Supreme Court's specific\norder\" -- in this case, further consideration in light of Booker --\n\"[t]his power is to be exercised . . . only when its invocation is\nnecessary to avoid extreme injustice.\" United States v. Estevez,\n    F.3d      , 2005 WL 1969745, at *3 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2005)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).     There is no injustice in\nrefusing to reexamine a carefully considered decision based on the\nsame arguments that we have already rejected.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
