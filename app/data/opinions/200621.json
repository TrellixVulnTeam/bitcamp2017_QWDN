These discrepancies are significant and major.\n\nThey amply support the ALJ's conclusion             that the claimant was not\n\nentirely credible in respect to his subjective complaints of pain.\n\n             The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f",
