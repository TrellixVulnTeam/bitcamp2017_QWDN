Antonio and Debra\n\nBraga appeal from an order of the district court dismissing, under\n\nRule 12 (b)6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, their amended\n\ncomplaint against Genlyte Group, Inc. based on injuries that\n\nAntonio Braga sustained while operating a press during the course\n\nof his employment with Genlyte-Thomas Group, LLC. The Bragas claim\n\nthat these injuries were caused by a defective press that had been\n\nmodified    on   several    occasions    either    by    Genlyte   or   its\n\npredecessors, and argue that they can sue Genlyte Group, Inc. as\n\nthe successor in liability for the negligence of Lightolier, Inc.,\n\na company which merged into Genlyte in 1992.       The Bragas also argue\n\nthat dismissal without leave to file a further amended complaint\n\nwas in error.    We reverse and remand.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            On reviewing this Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) order, we\n\nrecite the facts as alleged by the Bragas and accept as true all\n\nwell-pleaded     factual   averments     and   indulge    all    reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the plaintiff.      SEC v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42,\n\n46 (1st    Cir. 2001).   In their amended complaint, the Bragas allege\n\nthat Antonio Braga sustained his injury while operating a hydraulic\n\npress designed to shape sheet metal for the manufacture of light\n\nfixtures at a plant in Fall River, Massachusetts.               In order to\n\noperate this press, a worker would have to push two electrical\n\nbuttons attached to the body of the press.        As long as both buttons\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwere pushed within four seconds of one another, the press would\n\nactivate, driving the press ram down into a \"die space\" into which\n\nthe sheet metal designated for molding would be inserted.            On\n\nNovember 18, 1998, Mr. Braga was working with the press when a\n\npiece of metal inserted into the die space caused it to jam.         Mr.\n\nBraga attempted to correct this problem by manually removing the\n\npiece of metal that caused the jam from the press.        In the course\n\nof leaning into the press to remove the jam, while his left hand\n\nwas under the press ram, he inadvertently depressed both palm\n\nbuttons within a four second interval.       The press was activated,\n\nand the press ram crashed down on Mr. Braga's left hand, severing\n\nall of his fingers.\n\n            The Bragas allege that at the time of his injury, Mr.\n\nBraga was employed by an entity called Genlyte-Thomas Group, LLC.1\n\nGenlyte-Thomas was formed on April 24, 1998, after the defendant,\n\nGenlyte, had merged with another corporation, Thomas Industries.\n\nGenlyte became a controlling member of Genlyte-Thomas and continued\n\nto own the machinery at the Fall River plant after the merger.\n\nBefore this merger, Genlyte had also been Mr. Braga's immediate\n\nemployer.     Furthermore,   Genlyte   had   previously   acquired   the\n\nhydraulic press from another corporation named Lightolier, Inc.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The amended complaint does not admit, but the Bragas state in\ntheir brief, that Antonio has received workers' compensation\nbenefits, presumably paid by or on behalf of Genlyte-Thomas, his\nimmediate employer at the time of injury.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f(\"Lightolier\"), which in turn had originally acquired the press in\n\n1982.     The Bragas allege that Lightolier was once a subsidiary of\n\nGenlyte; however, sometime in 1992, Genlyte merged with Lightolier\n\nand dissolved the corporation, although it continued to do business\n\nunder the Lightolier name.\n\n             The Bragas originally filed a claim for negligence and\n\nloss of consortium in Massachusetts state court.2     Genlyte removed\n\nthe case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1332 (2000).        After removal, the Bragas filed an\n\namended complaint that alleged that Lightolier had purchased the\n\npress on January 12, 1982, and that since then either Genlyte\n\n\"and/or Lightolier\" had negligently modified the press on five\n\ndifferent occasions.3      Although they allege that Genlyte itself\n\nnegligently modified the press on November 14, 1995, February 15,\n\n1996, and March 29, 1996, they also make two other allegations of\n\nnegligent modification without specifying the party making the\n\nmodifications.      From the face of the complaint, it is not clear\n\nfrom these two allegations whether the Bragas are attempting to\n\nstate a claim against Genlyte directly or as the successor in\n\nliability to the negligence of Lightolier.      Nevertheless, we must\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Bragas originally filed this claim against Lightolier.\nGenlyte's counsel entered an appearance as \"Lightolier\" in its\npetition for removal, which states that Lightolier ceased to exist\nin 1991.\n     3\n         The Bragas' amended complaint named Genlyte as the defendant.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fconstrue these allegations in the light most favorable to the\n\nBragas, and so we interpret the amended complaint, as urged by the\n\nBragas' counsel both in the district court and on appeal, to allege\n\nsuccessor liability.   This is the issue that the parties have\n\nbriefed exhaustively before us.\n\n          Genlyte moved under Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint, arguing that as the majority owner of\n\nGenlyte-Thomas Group, LLC, Mr. Braga's employer at the time of\n\ninjury, it is immune from suit under the exclusivity provision of\n\nthe Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act.   Genlyte also argued\n\nthat it is immune even if the amended complaint is read to allege\n\nnegligence on the part of Lightolier, because the complaint alleges\n\nonly that Lightolier modified the machine for the use of its own\n\nemployees. In response, the Bragas presented a further amended\n\ncomplaint to the district court which stated that Genlyte \"by\n\nvirtue of the merger with 'Lightolier, Inc.,' was responsible for\n\nthe negligent modifications, changes, repairs, and/or maintenance\n\nof the subject hydraulic press that caused [Mr. Braga's] injuries,\"\n\nseemingly an attempt to allege more clearly that Genlyte was liable\n\nfor the negligence of Lightolier.      The district court made a\n\nhandwritten entry on the bottom of Genlyte's 12(b)(6) motion\n\nstating, \"Allowed, as Lightolier, Inc. would also be an employer\n\nfor this purpose.   Herbolsheimer v. SMS Holding Co., Inc., 608\n\nN.W.2d 487 (Mich. Ct. App. 2000),\" and dismissed the case in its\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fentirety.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's dismissal of the\n\nBragas' amended complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).    SEC v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   We reverse the order of the district court if we conclude\n\nthat the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the Bragas\n\njustify recovery under \"any supportable legal theory.\" Cruz v.\n\nMelecio, 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2000).       \"[A] complaint should\n\nnot be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears\n\nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in\n\nsupport of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"     Conley v.\n\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).\n\n            Since this case comes to the federal courts on removal\n\nbased on diversity jurisdiction, we must under Erie Railroad Co. v.\n\nTompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), apply state substantive law, which in\n\nthis case is the law of Massachusetts.      As we observed in Blinzler\n\nv. Marriott International, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), the task of a federal court sitting in diversity is limited,\n\nin the first instance, to applying those rules of law announced by\n\nthe highest court of the State.        If that court has not directly\n\naddressed the issues raised in the case, the federal court must\n\nthen \"ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow\n\nunder the circumstances, even if our independent judgment on the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fquestion might differ.\" Id.         We may seek guidance \"in analogous\n\nstate court decisions, persuasive adjudications by courts of sister\n\nstates,   learned     treatises,    and    public      policy    considerations\n\nidentified in state decisional law.\"          Id.\n\n           Here, the district court was required to apply the\n\nsubstantive law of Massachusetts in deciding whether the Bragas\n\nhave alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for relief.               Moores\n\nv. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 (1st Cir. 1987).                     For that\n\nreason, its one line order relying on Herbolsheimer v. SMS Holding\n\nCo., Inc., 608 N.W.2d 487 (Mich. Ct. App. 2000), a case decided by\n\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals, is of little help.                 The district\n\ncourt made no effort to determine whether the amended complaint\n\nstates a claim under Massachusetts law, under the standard we set\n\nout in Blinzler.      We are reluctant to affirm an order of dismissal\n\nwhere the district court neglected to analyze the questions raised\n\nby the complaint under the law governing the case, especially when,\n\nas now, Massachusetts law arguably may permit the maintenance of a\n\ncause of action.\n\n           Furthermore, Herbolsheimer was primarily concerned with\n\nthe scope of the dual persona doctrine under the earlier Michigan\n\nSupreme Court case of Howard v. White, 523 N.W.2d 220 (Mich. 1994).\n\nBoth the majority and dissent in Herbolsheimer discussed at length\n\nthe   decision   of   the   New   York    Court   of   Appeals    in   Billy   v.\n\nConsolidated Machine Tool Corp., 412 N.E.2d 934, 939-941 (N.Y.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f1980).   Billy held liable a corporation that was the plaintiff's\n\nemployer but which had become the successor in liability to another\n\ncorporation that it had acquired and which had manufactured the\n\nmachine that injured the plaintiff.          Herbolsheimer, 608 N.W.2d at\n\n494-96 (majority), 499-501 (dissent).             In addition, both the\n\nmajority and the dissent in Herbolsheimer cited Gurry v. Cumberland\n\nFarms,   550   N.E.2d   127   (Mass.    1990),   in   the   course   of   their\n\nanalysis.      Herbolsheimer, 608 N.W.2d at 497 (majority), 499 n.2\n\n(dissent).      Gurry, 550 N.E.2d at 130-31, was a decision by the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that explicitly applied the\n\ndual persona doctrine in the context of successor liability.               That\n\nHerbolsheimer, the basis for the district court's ruling, presents\n\ndiffering views under Michigan law as to successor liability points\n\nto the necessity of focused discovery and an analysis of this issue\n\nunder Massachusetts law.      The discussion of Gurry, a Massachusetts\n\ncase, and Billy, upon which Gurry relied in part, by both the\n\nmajority and dissent in Herbolsheimer highlights the necessity of\n\nan analysis of a more fully developed factual scenario under\n\nMassachusetts law.      In other words, the complexity of the issues\n\nraised in Herbolsheimer and Gurry underscores the need to analyze,\n\nin a concrete factual setting, the question of whether an employer\n\nthat was also the successor in interest to a former corporation\n\nwhose negligence allegedly caused the plaintiff's injury could be\n\nliable under Massachusetts law. Certainly, an analysis of Gurry is\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcentral to this question.\n\n          The questions raised by the intersection of the immunity\n\nof an employer under the workers' compensation scheme and successor\n\nliability are complex and fact-bound.    Because we encounter these\n\nissues on appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we are not prepared\n\nto conclude at this stage that the Bragas can prove no set of facts\n\nthat would entitle them to relief.    See Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We do not pretend that the amended complaint is a model\n\nof clarity.   The Bragas, by a better-delineated pleading, could\n\nprobably have avoided time and trouble.     But despite its lack of\n\nspecificity, we cannot say that the amended complaint stumbles over\n\nthe modest threshold erected by Rule 12(b)(6). For that reason, we\n\nreverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. We regard the district court's constructive denial of the\n\nleave to further amend the complaint as moot, but the Bragas may,\n\nif they wish to do so, renew that motion in the district court.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.     No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint, arguing that as the majority owner of\n\nGenlyte-Thomas Group, LLC, Mr. Braga's employer at the time of\n\ninjury, it is immune from suit under the exclusivity provision of\n\nthe Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act.   Genlyte also argued\n\nthat it is immune even if the amended complaint is read to allege\n\nnegligence on the part of Lightolier, because the complaint alleges\n\nonly that Lightolier modified the machine for the use of its own\n\nemployees. In response, the Bragas presented a further amended\n\ncomplaint to the district court which stated that Genlyte \"by\n\nvirtue of the merger with 'Lightolier, Inc.,' was responsible for\n\nthe negligent modifications, changes, repairs, and/or maintenance\n\nof the subject hydraulic press that caused [Mr. Braga's] injuries,\"\n\nseemingly an attempt to allege more clearly that Genlyte was liable\n\nfor the negligence of Lightolier.

Herbolsheimer, 608 N.W.2d at\n\n494-96 (majority), 499-501 (dissent).             In addition, both the\n\nmajority and the dissent in Herbolsheimer cited Gurry v. Cumberland\n\nFarms,   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (Mass.    1990),   in   the   course   of   their\n\nanalysis.      Herbolsheimer, 608 N.W.2d at 497 (majority), 499 n.2\n\n(dissent).      Gurry, 550 N.E.2d at 130-31, was a decision by the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that explicitly applied the\n\ndual persona doctrine in the context of successor liability.               That\n\nHerbolsheimer, the basis for the district court's ruling, presents\n\ndiffering views under Michigan law as to successor liability points\n\nto the necessity of focused discovery and an analysis of this issue\n\nunder Massachusetts law.      The discussion of Gurry, a Massachusetts\n\ncase, and Billy, upon which Gurry relied in part, by both the\n\nmajority and dissent in Herbolsheimer highlights the necessity of\n\nan analysis of a more fully developed factual scenario under\n\nMassachusetts law.      In other words, the complexity of the issues\n\nraised in Herbolsheimer and Gurry underscores the need to analyze,\n\nin a concrete factual setting, the question of whether an employer\n\nthat was also the successor in interest to a former corporation\n\nwhose negligence allegedly caused the plaintiff's injury could be\n\nliable under Massachusetts law. Certainly, an analysis of Gurry is\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcentral to this question.\n\n          The questions raised by the intersection of the immunity\n\nof an employer under the workers' compensation scheme and successor\n\nliability are complex and fact-bound.    Because we encounter these\n\nissues on appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we are not prepared\n\nto conclude at this stage that the Bragas can prove no set of facts\n\nthat would entitle them to relief.    See Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We do not pretend that the amended complaint is a model\n\nof clarity.   The Bragas, by a better-delineated pleading, could\n\nprobably have avoided time and trouble.     But despite its lack of\n\nspecificity, we cannot say that the amended complaint stumbles over\n\nthe modest threshold erected by Rule 12(b)(6). For that reason, we\n\nreverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion. We regard the district court's constructive denial of the\n\nleave to further amend the complaint as moot, but the Bragas may,\n\nif they wish to do so, renew that motion in the district court.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.     No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
