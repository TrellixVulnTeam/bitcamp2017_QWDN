In early April 2003, federal and\n\nPuerto Rico law enforcement officials exercised their authority\n\nunder the Shippers Export Declaration guidelines, see 15 C.F.R.\n\nPart 30, to examine a parcel shipped from New York City to a FedEx\n\nstation within the Commonwealth. The shipping manifest stated that\n\nthe parcel contained a \"scrap book, color and photo paper.\"                The\n\nshipper was identified as John Ramirez, 308 Canal Street, New York,\n\nand the addressee as Roberto López Burgos of San Juan.\n\n            The parcel in fact contained nearly $220,000 in $20\n\nbills.      The   investigating   agents   permitted   the   parcel   to    be\n\ndelivered to López Burgos, who had come to the FedEx station to\n\npick it up.       López Burgos drove off with the parcel in a Toyota\n\nFourRunner registered in his name.          A short time later, he was\n\nstopped and asked for his driver's license.       He replied that he did\n\nnot have it with him.     When asked about the contents of the parcel\n\nin plain view in the back seat, he had no comment.           At this point,\n\nthe agents arrested him and his wife, who was riding with him at\n\nthe time.\n\n            At the police station, López Burgos stated that he was\n\nunemployed and asked for a lawyer.         His wife, who was interviewed\n\nseparately, told the agents the neither she nor her husband was\n\nemployed (though she baked wedding cakes part-time).            She stated\n\nthat she had no knowledge of the currency in the parcel, and signed\n\na form relinquishing any claim to it.        Meanwhile, a drug detection\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fdog   alerted      to    the    presence         of    narcotics      in    the        currency.\n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that there is no John Ramirez at\n\nthe company located at 308 Canal Street in New York City.\n\n               The money was formally seized and López Burgos filed an\n\nadministrative        claim     to    it.        The    United       States    subsequently\n\ncommenced      a   civil      judicial      forfeiture          by    filing       a   verified\n\ncomplaint for forfeiture in rem.                  See 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6) and 18\n\nU.S.C.   §§     981     and    983.      After        several    months       of    procedural\n\nskirmishing that we shall not describe because it has no bearing on\n\nour analysis, López Burgos filed a claim to the money and a motion\n\nto dismiss the forfeiture complaint.                      In support of his motion,\n\nLópez Burgos invoked statutorily superseded (and therefore legally\n\nirrelevant) authority requiring the government to plead facts\n\nsufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the currency\n\nis subject to forfeiture.              See United States v. One Lot of U.S.\n\nCurrency       ($36,674),       103    F.3d       1048,     1053       (1st        Cir.        1997)\n\n(interpreting the since repealed 19 U.S.C. § 1615); see also United\n\nStates v. 255 Broadway, 9 F.3d 1000, 1003-04 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nInadequately       alerted       to   López       Burgos's       legal      error         by    the\n\ngovernment's opposition papers (which made only oblique references\n\nto the new statutory regime, which we shall discuss momentarily),\n\nthe district court granted the motion to dismiss.                           In the court's\n\nview,    the    facts     set    forth      in    the    complaint         (which       we     have\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fsummarized above) were insufficient to establish probable cause to\n\nforfeit the currency.\n\n            The government has brought this appeal to secure a remand\n\nand the reinstitution of the forfeiture action.          The government\n\nsays that the district court's decision was incorrect even under\n\nour old law -- that it failed to appreciate the effect of the\n\npleaded facts in their totality -- but we shall focus on its other\n\nargument:    that a remand is required for proper application of the\n\ndecisional standards ushered in by the Civil Asset Forfeiture\n\nReform Act of 2000 (CAFRA).     We agree that a remand is appropriate.\n\nAlthough CAFRA increased the government's burden of proof at trial\n\nfrom mere probable cause (the old standard) to the preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, see 18 U.S.C. § 983(c)(1), it made clear that the\n\npleading requirements imposed by cases such as One Lot of U.S.\n\nCurrency ($36,674) no longer apply.       It did so by stating that no\n\ncivil forfeiture complaint may be dismissed because the government\n\nlacked sufficient evidence of forfeitability at the time of filing,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(3)(D), and that the government may use\n\nevidence gathered after filing to meet its burden of proof, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 983(c)(2).      As a consequence, the government no longer\n\nmust plead facts sufficient to establish probable cause to forfeit;\n\nit need only satisfy Rule E(2)(a) of the Supplemental Rules for\n\nCertain     Admiralty   and   Maritime   Claims.   See   18   U.S.C.   §\n\n983(a)(3)(A). In relevant part, the rule provides: \"In actions to\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fwhich       this   rule   is   applicable   the   complaint   shall   state   the\n\ncircumstances from which the claim arises with such particularity\n\nthat the . . . claimant will be able, without moving for a more\n\ndefinite statement, to commence an investigation of the facts and\n\nto frame a responsive pleading.\"1\n\n               López Burgos concedes that the district court applied the\n\nwrong legal standards, and he, quite properly, does not argue that\n\nthe complaint was inadequate under current law. Instead, he argues\n\n\n\n        1\n      In August 2004, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules\npublished for comment a draft of proposed Supplemental Rule G,\nwhich would merge most provisions of the Supplemental Rules\ngoverning forfeiture actions into a single rule.           Proposed\nSupplemental Rule G(8)(b)(ii) states: \"In an action governed by 18\nU.S.C. § 983(a)(3)(D) the complaint may not be dismissed on the\nground that the government did not have adequate evidence at the\ntime the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the\nproperty.    The sufficiency of the complaint is governed by\nsubdivision (2).\"\n     The cross-referenced \"subdivision (2),\" Proposed Supplemental\nRule G(2), states that a forfeiture complaint must\n\n     (a) be verified;\n\n     (b) state the grounds for subject-matter jurisdiction, in\n     rem jurisdiction over the defendant property, and venue;\n\n     (c) describe the property with reasonable particularity;\n\n     (d) if the property is tangible, state its location when\n     any seizure occurred and -- if different -- its location\n     when the action is filed;\n\n     (e) identify the statute under which the forfeiture\n     action is brought; and\n\n     (f) state sufficiently detailed facts to support a\n     reasonable belief that the government will be able to\n     meet its burden of proof at trial.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthat we should affirm the judgment on alternative grounds:    that\n\nthe government affirmatively waived its entitlement to have its\n\ncomplaint assessed under CAFRA because, as we have said, the\n\ngovernment's opposition papers inadequately alerted the district\n\ncourt to CAFRA's requirements;2 that the court actually treated its\n\nmotion as one for summary judgment and, under summary judgment\n\nprinciples, appropriately entered judgment in its favor; and that\n\na remand would be futile because the government will be unable to\n\naugment its evidence during the discovery process.\n\n          These arguments lack merit.   The first two are without\n\nrecord support, and the third invites us to accept López Burgos's\n\npredictions about the effects on the proceedings (if any) of still\n\nunfolding events -- namely, his anticipated invocation of the Fifth\n\nAmendment's privilege against self-incrimination at his deposition,\n\nand the recent indictment of one of the law enforcement officers\n\ninvolved in the seizure of the currency.    And, in any event, we\n\nsimply do not share López Burgos's conviction that the verified\n\ncomplaint falls significantly short of establishing a trialworthy\n\nissue as to forfeitability.     Under the circumstances, the only\n\nprudent course is to vacate and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n     2\n      López Burgos asserts that the government sought to hide the\nCAFRA standards from the court because it wished to avoid\napplication of the higher burden of proof the statute imposes on\nthe government at trial.     There is nothing in the record to\nsubstantiate this allegation.\n\n                                -6-\n\fIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                    -7-\n\f",

He replied that he did not have it with him. When asked about the contents of the parcel in plain view in the back seat, he had no comment. At this point, the agents arrested him and his wife, who was riding with him at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the police station, L&#243;pez Burgos stated that he was unemployed and asked for a lawyer. His wife, who was interviewed separately, told the agents that neither she nor her husband was employed (though she baked wedding cakes part-time). She stated that she had no knowledge of the currency in the parcel, and signed a form relinquishing any claim to it. Meanwhile, a drug detection dog alerted to the presence of narcotics in the currency. Subsequent investigation revealed that there is no John Ramirez at the company located at 308 Canal Street in New York City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The money was formally seized and L&#243;pez Burgos filed an administrative claim to it. The United States subsequently commenced a civil judicial forfeiture by filing a verified complaint for forfeiture <i>in rem. See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(6) and 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 981 and 983. After several months of procedural skirmishing that we shall not describe because it has no bearing on our analysis, L&#243;pez Burgos filed a claim to the money and a motion to dismiss the forfeiture complaint. In support of his motion, L&#243;pez Burgos invoked statutorily superseded (and therefore legally irrelevant) authority requiring the government to plead facts sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the currency is subject to forfeiture. <i>See United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency ($36,634),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197154\"><a href=\"/opinion/197154/united-states-v-one-lot-of-us/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1053 (1st Cir.1997) (interpreting the since repealed 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1615); <i>see also United States v. 255 Broadway,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195052\"><a href=\"/opinion/195052/united-states-v-parcels-of-property/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1003-04 (1st Cir.1993). Inadequately alerted to L&#243;pez Burgos's legal error by the government's opposition papers (which made only oblique references to the new statutory regime, which we shall discuss momentarily), the district court granted the motion to dismiss. In the court's view, the facts set forth in the complaint (which we have summarized above) were insufficient to establish probable cause to forfeit the currency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has brought this appeal to secure a remand and the reinstitution of the forfeiture action. The government says that the district court's decision was incorrect even under our old law &#8212; that it failed to appreciate the effect of the pleaded facts in their totality &#8212; but we shall focus on its other argument: that a remand is required for proper application of the decisional standards ushered in by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA). We agree that a remand is appropriate. Although CAFRA increased the government's burden of proof at trial from mere probable cause (the old standard) to the preponderance of the evidence, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(c)(1), it made clear that the pleading requirements imposed by cases such as <i>One Lot of U.S. Currency ($36,634)</i> no longer apply. It did so by stating that no civil forfeiture complaint may be dismissed because the government lacked sufficient evidence of forfeitability at the time of filing, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(a)(3)(D), and that the government may use evidence gathered after filing to meet its burden of proof, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(c)(2). As a consequence, the government no longer must plead facts sufficient to establish probable cause to forfeit; it need only satisfy Rule E(2)(a) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(a)(3)(A). In relevant part, the rule provides: \"In actions to which this rule is applicable the complaint shall state the circumstances from which the claim arises with such particularity that the . . . claimant will be able, without moving for a more definite statement, to commence an investigation of the facts and to frame a responsive pleading.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez Burgos concedes that the district court applied the wrong legal standards, and he, quite properly, does not argue that the complaint was inadequate under current law. Instead, he argues that we should affirm the judgment on alternative grounds: that the government affirmatively waived its entitlement to have its complaint assessed under CAFRA because, as we have said, the government's opposition papers inadequately alerted the district court to CAFRA's requirements;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that the court actually treated its motion as one for summary judgment and, under summary judgment principles, appropriately entered judgment in its favor; and that a remand would be futile because the government will be unable to augment its evidence during the discovery process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments lack merit. The first two are without record support, and the third invites us to accept L&#243;pez Burgos's predictions about the effects on the proceedings (if any) of still unfolding events &#8212; namely, his anticipated invocation of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination at his deposition, and the recent indictment of one of the law enforcement officers involved in the seizure of the currency. And, in any event, we simply do not share L&#243;pez Burgos's conviction that the verified complaint falls significantly short of establishing a trialworthy issue as to forfeitability. Under the circumstances, the only prudent course is to vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In August 2004, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules published for comment a draft of proposed Supplemental Rule G, which would merge most provisions of the Supplemental Rules governing forfeiture actions into a single rule. Proposed Supplemental Rule G(8)(b)(ii) states: \"In an action governed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 983(a)(3)(D) the complaint may not be dismissed on the ground that the government did not have adequate evidence at the time the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the property.
