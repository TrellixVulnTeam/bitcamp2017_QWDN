John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          Randy Olen on brief for appellant.\n          Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and James L.\nBurke, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Memorandum in Support of\nSummary Affirmance.\n\n\n\n                         August 9, 2005\n\f           Per    Curiam.      In   this    sentencing   appeal,    defendant\n\nFrancisco Aquino–De La Rosa challenges his sentence on the sole\n\nground that resentencing is required by United States v. Booker,\n\n125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).          The government has moved for summary\n\naffirmance on the grounds that defendant waived his right to appeal\n\nin his plea agreement and that, in any event, the district court\n\ndid not commit plain error under Booker in sentencing defendant to\n\nthe bottom of the applicable guidelines range.           We deny the motion\n\nfor   summary    affirmance,   vacate      the   sentence,   and   remand   for\n\nresentencing because, as discussed more fully below, we find the\n\nappeal waiver to be unenforceable and conclude that defendant has\n\nsatisfied his burden, under United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005), of demonstrating a reasonable probability\n\nthat the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under\n\nadvisory guidelines, id. at 75.\n\n           Defendant pleaded guilty to reentry after deportation\n\nsubsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation\n\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).      His plea agreement contained the following\n\nwaiver of appeal:\n\n           Defendant is aware that Title 18, United\n           States Code, Section 3742 affords a defendant\n           the right to appeal the sentence imposed.\n           Defendant is also aware that he may, in some\n           circumstances, argue that his plea should be\n           set aside, or his sentence be set aside or\n           reduced, in a collateral challenge (such as,\n           but not limited to a motion under 28 U.S.C. §\n           2255).   Knowing that, Defendant waives the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            right to appeal or to collaterally challenge\n            the following:\n\n                 A.    Defendant's guilty plea and any\n                 other     aspect    of   Defendant's\n                 conviction in the above-captioned\n                 case;\n\n                 B.   The adoption by the District\n                 Court at sentencing of the positions\n                 found in paragraph 3 above.1\n\nThat waiver was subject to the following exception:\n\n            Defendant's waiver of rights to appeal and to\n            bring collateral challenges shall not apply to\n            appeals or challenges based on a right that\n            has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court\n            and made retroactively applicable to cases on\n            collateral review.\n\n            Relying   on    this    waiver,    the    government     argues    that\n\ndefendant   waived    his   right    to   appeal      his   sentence    on   Booker\n\ngrounds.    Without reaching the question of whether defendant's\n\nBooker appeal falls within the scope of the waiver or, instead,\n\nwithin its exception, we decline to enforce the waiver because its\n\nterms were not clearly explained during the plea colloquy.                   United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Here, as in Teeter, the district court failed to call\n\ndefendant's     attention     to    the      appeal    waiver    and,     instead,\n\naffirmatively    sought     and    obtained    confirmation     of     defendant's\n\nunderstanding that he had an unqualified right to appeal his\n\n\n     1\n      The \"positions found in paragraph 3\" of the plea agreement\nincluded the government's \"agree[ment] not to oppose the\ndefendant's request to be sentenced at the bottom of the applicable\nguidelines range.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\fsentence.     Under those circumstances, enforcing the plea waiver\n\nwould work a \"miscarriage of justice,\" id. at 26, especially since,\n\nas discussed below, defendant's Booker appeal may well result in a\n\nreduced sentence.\n\n             Defendant concedes that his claim of Booker error was not\n\npreserved and that, therefore, he is entitled only to plain error\n\nreview.      Because     defendant      was    sentenced     under   a   mandatory\n\nguidelines system, the first two prongs of the plain error standard\n\nhave been met.      Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.              In determining\n\nwhether the third and fourth prongs of that test have been met, the\n\ncourt's \"principal concern in these Booker 'pipeline' cases is with\n\nthe likelihood that the defendant would have received a lesser\n\nsentence in a post-Booker regime of advisory guidelines.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 81).                Where the sentencing judge\n\nexpressly indicates that the sentence mandated by the guidelines is\n\nunduly harsh, the third and fourth prongs are satisfied as well.\n\nAntonakopoulos,     399    F.3d   at     81;    see   also   United      States   v.\n\nWilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Lewis,\n\n406 F.3d 11, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Morin, 403\n\nF.3d   41,   42   (1st   Cir.   2005)    (per    curiam);     United     States   v.\n\nMacKinnon, 401 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           The   judge's      comments       here2   indicate     a    reasonable\n\nprobability that he would have imposed a more favorable sentence\n\nunder    advisory    guidelines.3            Accordingly,    we       remand   for\n\nresentencing.       In   so   doing,   we    intimate   no   view     on   whether\n\ndefendant should receive a lower sentence on remand or on the\n\nreasonableness of his previous sentence or any revised sentence.\n\nSee Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.\n\n           The motion for summary affirmance is denied, but the\n\ngovernment's alternative request that its motion and supporting\n\nmemorandum be treated as the brief for the appellee is allowed.\n\nThe sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district\n\ncourt.   See Local R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n     2\n      Before imposing a sentence at the bottom of the applicable\nguidelines range, the judge said to the defendant,\n\n           You seem to me to be a very nice man, and I am\n           sorry that I have to put you in prison for so\n           long. . . . You don't belong here in prison.\n           You belong with your friends; and you belong\n           in your country.\n\n                I know that you come here for economic\n           opportunity, but you have a prior drug\n           conviction, and people with prior drug\n           convictions who aren't authorized to enter the\n           country have to spend a lot of time in jail\n           when they get caught, and you've been caught.\n     3\n      The fact that defendant agreed to seek a sentence at the\nbottom of the applicable guidelines range and did so at sentencing\ndoes not bar his present request for resentencing under Booker, as\nthe government contends.      Rather, like the district court,\ndefendant understandably believed that that was the lowest sentence\nthe court could legally impose.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",
