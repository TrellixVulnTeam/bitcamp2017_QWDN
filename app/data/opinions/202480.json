Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\f     Carlos Rodríguez-García and Maza & Green on brief for\nappellants.\n     Susana I. Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General,\nSalvador J. Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, Mariana Negrón-\nVargas, Deputy Solicitor General, and Maite D. Oronoz-Rodríguez,\nDeputy Solicitor General, on brief for appellees Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico and the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico.\n\n\n\n                        November 3, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.     By order dated November 16, 2005,\n\nthe district court dismissed plaintiffs' civil rights action as a\n\nsanction for violations of three deadlines set in an oral Initial\n\nScheduling    Conference    (ISC)   discovery   order.       The     order    of\n\ndismissal was entered despite the fact that under the district\n\ncourt's local rules, plaintiffs had at least until November 18,\n\n2005 to respond to the defendants' motion requesting this drastic\n\nsanction.     The court then did not accept plaintiffs' motion for\n\nreconsideration in this very active case, as it denied plaintiffs\n\npermission to file a motion that exceeded the page limit in the\n\nlocal rules.     As best one can tell, the court never considered\n\nplaintiffs'    explanation    for   their    failure   to    meet    the     ISC\n\ndeadlines.    On these and other facts presented, we reverse.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            On September 13, 2004, plaintiffs filed an action against\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its Department of Education, a\n\nparticular high school teacher, and various officials and other\n\nparties, alleging that plaintiffs had been victims of gender\n\ndiscrimination, sexual harassment, and quid pro quo exchange of\n\nhigher grades for sexual favors.            In the early months of the\n\nlitigation, the district court granted a number of extensions to\n\nvarious   defendants   to    file   their   answers,   and    then    allowed\n\nsupplemental answers asserting new defenses as late as July 19,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f2005.       Even so, two of the defendants did not timely file their\n\nanswers and default judgment was initially entered against them.1\n\n              The case proceeded to discovery.   By order dated March\n\n18, 2005, the district court notified the parties that they should\n\nprepare for the ISC.        The order informed the parties that all\n\norders issued during the ISC would be effective immediately, even\n\nif the ISC order were not formally entered until a later date.     The\n\nMarch 18, 2005 order also notified the parties that failure to\n\ncomply with that order would \"result in stiff penalties, including\n\nbut not limited to the entry of default, the dismissal of one or\n\nmore claims or defenses, barring of witnesses or evidence, or\n\nmonetary sanctions.\"\n\n              The ISC order was not formally entered until August 24,\n\n2005, though it was apparently orally communicated to the parties\n\nat the ISC on June 16, 2005.      The written ISC order also provided\n\nthat non-compliance might \"result in the imposition of sanctions\n\n. . . includ[ing] the imposition of a fine, or the elimination of\n\nany of the allegations of the complaint, the answer, or any\n\npleading.\"      In the middle of discovery, on November 3, 2005, two of\n\n\n\n        1\n       The default judgment was never formally lifted against\ndefendant Department of Education, although it subsequently\nparticipated in the case throughout the litigation and even\nsuccessfully moved to dismiss some of the claims against it.\nDefendant Adalberto Gonzalez-Vega also appears to have been\nparticipating in the litigation despite being in default; his\nmotion to set aside the default was pending at the time the\ndistrict court dismissed plaintiffs' claims.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe defendants filed a motion requesting that plaintiffs' case be\n\ndismissed with prejudice as a sanction for plaintiffs' failure to\n\ncomply with the ISC order.\n\n              The court order dismissing the case, signed by the\n\ndistrict judge on November 16, 2005, was entered before plaintiffs\n\nhad filed a response to the defendants' motion. The district court\n\nstated   it    was   dismissing    the    action    with     prejudice     because\n\nplaintiffs had failed to meet three of four discovery deadlines in\n\nJuly and August of 2005.          The three deadlines, listed under the\n\nheading \"Preliminary Orders\" in the ISC order, were: (1) that\n\nplaintiffs were to provide, by July 8, 2005, either the name of the\n\nperson in charge of a previous investigation against the teacher\n\nco-defendant or copies of complaints previously filed against that\n\nco-defendant; (2) that plaintiffs' expert was to tender his report\n\nby July 26, 2005; and (3) that plaintiffs were to provide their\n\nmedical records and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\n\nAct (HIPAA) consent forms by August 17, 2005.2               All three of these\n\ndeadlines predated the written ISC order's formal date of entry.\n\n              The   district   court,    citing    Damiani    v.   Rhode    Island\n\nHospital, 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1983), found that this was \"a\n\ncase of extreme misconduct that warrants the sanction of dismissal\n\n\n\n     2\n       The ISC order also set out a number of other deadlines. It\nset March 21, 2006 as the deadline for filing dispositive motions,\nJune 21, 2006 as the date for the pre-trial conference, and June\n28, 2006 as the trial date.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fwith prejudice\" because the plaintiffs had: (1) violated discovery\n\norders; (2) failed to seek consent; and (3) failed to seek approval\n\nfor non-compliance based on a truly valid reason.      The court did\n\nnot order plaintiffs to show cause, and it noted that plaintiffs\n\nhad not opposed the motion.        The court order was entered on\n\nNovember 17, 2005 -- one day after the date it was signed by the\n\ndistrict judge.\n\n            Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on November\n\n28, 2005.    Because the motion exceeded 25 pages in length, the\n\nlimit set by the local rules, it was accompanied by a motion for\n\nleave to file an overlength document. Both motions were denied the\n\nnext day, November 29, 2005.      There is no indication that the\n\ndistrict court ever reviewed the merits of the motion or gave the\n\nplaintiffs a later opportunity to file a conforming motion.\n\n            At the time the court dismissed the case for plaintiffs'\n\nfailure to comply with the ISC deadlines there was a pending motion\n\nfrom the plaintiffs to amend the ISC order.    This motion was filed\n\non October 9, 2005 and was raised again in a filing on November 3,\n\n2005.   There was also activity by a previously defaulted defendant\n\nseeking to enter the case. And throughout discovery the plaintiffs\n\nhad filed numerous motions to compel defendants to comply with\n\ndiscovery, arguing that the defendants were stalling and foot-\n\ndragging.   At least some of plaintiffs' allegations apparently had\n\nmerit: on August 9, 2005 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fto compel defendants to produce certain documents, and it also\n\npartially granted plaintiffs' motion to quash several of the\n\ndeposition notices on the grounds that the defendants had not\n\nprovided notice to all parties.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           A district court may dismiss an action for noncompliance\n\nwith a discovery order.     Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).3    When a\n\ndistrict court invokes this power, our review is for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Nat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc.,\n\n427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam); Bachier-Ortiz v. Colon-\n\nMendoza, 331 F.3d 193, 194 (1st Cir. 2003) (per curiam).\n\n           The sanction imposed here was dismissal with prejudice,\n\nthe harshest sanction, other than contempt, which may be visited on\n\na party.      It has been used where the plaintiff has failed to\n\nprosecute his case.   See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 629\n\n(1962); see also Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 342 F.3d\n\n44, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2003) (reversing a dismissal with prejudice for\n\nlack of prosecution); Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez, 183 F.3d 65,\n\n66-67 (1st Cir. 1999) (same).      In that context, the sanction is\n\nreserved for cases of \"extremely protracted inaction (measured in\n\n\n     3\n       In addition to citing this rule, the district court also\nclaimed authority under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), which allows the\ncourt to dismiss an action \"[f]or failure of the plaintiff to\nprosecute or to comply with . . . any order of court.\"          For\npurposes of this appeal, we need not examine which of these rules\nprovides proper authority for dismissal of an action for failure to\ncomply with an ISC order.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fyears),   disobedience      of     court   orders,   ignorance    of   warnings,\n\ncontumacious conduct, or some other aggravating circumstance.\"\n\nCosme-Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987).                This case\n\ndoes not involve a failure to prosecute.              Indeed, the plaintiffs\n\nzealously prosecuted the action.            The docket sheet shows over 100\n\nentries at the time of entry of dismissal.\n\n              Still, zealous prosecution is no shield against sanctions\n\nfor violations of court discovery orders. Dismissal with prejudice\n\nfor violation of such orders is well within the arsenal of the\n\ntrial judge.      See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,                296\n\nF.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that disobedience of a court\n\norder can constitute extreme misconduct warranting dismissal);\n\nRobson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that\n\nsuccessive     violations     of   court   scheduling    orders    can    justify\n\ndismissal     with   prejudice,      and   admonishing   parties    who   \"treat\n\nscheduling orders as optional and [who] conduct trial preparations\n\nat their own convenience\"); see also Young v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76,\n\n81 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              Where dismissal with prejudice is involved, it has long\n\nbeen our rule that a case should not be dismissed with prejudice\n\nexcept \"when a plaintiff's misconduct is particularly egregious or\n\nextreme.\"     Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 107\n\n(1st   Cir.    1995);   see      also   Tower   Ventures,   296    F.3d    at    46\n\n(explaining that not \"every breach of a scheduling order warrants\"\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdismissal with prejudice, and noting that we will not \"rubber-stamp\n\nthe use of dismissal as a sanction\").                In addition, \"fairness\n\nrequires that some limits be placed on [the] use\" of a sanction of\n\nthis severity.     Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d\n\n1072, 1075-76 (1st Cir. 1990).            These fairness concerns encompass\n\nboth the law's preference that cases be disposed of on the merits,\n\nsee Pomales, 342 F.3d at 48, and procedural aspects such as notice\n\nand an opportunity to be heard, see Ortiz-Anglada, 183 F.3d at 67.\n\nThus, our inquiry is into both the substance of the court's order\n\nand the procedure by which the sanction was imposed.\n\n            Our inquiry into sanctions orders is not a mechanical\n\none, and our cases set forth a variety of important considerations:\n\n            Among those commonly mentioned (this list is\n            not complete) are the severity of the\n            violation, the legitimacy of the party's\n            excuse,   repetition   of   violations,   the\n            deliberateness vel non of the misconduct,\n            mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other\n            side and to the operations of the court, and\n            the adequacy of lesser sanctions. . . . There\n            is also a procedural dimension.\n\nRobson, 81 F.3d at 2-3.\n\n            We look at the substance first.           There is no pattern of\n\nthe plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders.                   Cf., e.g.,\n\nCrossman v. Raytheon Long Term Disability Plan, 316 F.3d 36, 39 &\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting the importance generally of finding a\n\npattern   or    series   of    disobedience    and   reversing   an   order   of\n\ndismissal      where   all    of   the   alleged   infractions   stemmed   from\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fnoncompliance with a single order).                   Defendants do not cite to us,\n\nand    we   have    been     unable     to    find,    a    case   from   this    circuit\n\nsustaining a dismissal with prejudice imposed solely for a single\n\nallegation of noncompliance with a single (albeit multi-part)\n\ndiscovery order -- at least where that noncompliance was never\n\nbrought     to     the    plaintiffs'        attention      by   the   court    prior    to\n\ndismissing the case.             Robson comes closest, but it involved the\n\nmore serious violations of a variety of pre-trial deadlines on the\n\neve of trial, which were brought to the court's attention on the\n\nmorning of trial itself.           See Robson, 81 F.3d at 2.              Context makes\n\nthose much more serious infractions than what is involved here.\n\nAlso, in Robson we vacated the dismissal; the district court had\n\nnot considered the validity of several proffered excuses and thus\n\nthere was an insufficient basis to uphold the dismissal on appeal.\n\nSee id. at 2-5.\n\n                 At the time the defendants brought the motion for\n\nsanctions, the three deadlines had been violated by approximately\n\nfour months, three months, and two and a half months, respectively.\n\nIn Ortiz-Anglada, a delay of seven months was insufficient to\n\nwarrant dismissal with prejudice.                   183 F.3d at 66-67.      In Pomales,\n\na     four-month         delay   \"did        not    alone    constitute        misconduct\n\nsufficiently extreme to justify dismissal with prejudice.\"                              342\n\nF.3d at 49.         The plaintiffs' delay here, albeit one that came\n\nwithout seeking prior consent, is not a case of extreme misconduct\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fwarranting dismissal -- particularly in light of the pending\n\nmotions from plaintiffs4 and from the defaulted defendant seeking\n\nto reenter the case.   Further, there had been no motion to compel\n\ncompliance.\n\n          Moreover, the district court does not appear to have\n\nconsidered whether a sanction as severe as dismissal with prejudice\n\nwas needed or whether other sanctions might well have sufficed.\n\nCf. Crossman, 316 F.3d at 39-40 (finding that the district court's\n\nfailure to consider the adequacy of lesser sanctions contributed to\n\na finding of abuse of discretion); cf. also Asociacion de Empleados\n\ndel Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena v. Rodgriguez-Morales, 538\n\nF.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir. 1976).\n\n          Nor is it clear that the defendants suffered much, if\n\nany, prejudice from plaintiffs' delay; while defendants suggest\n\nthat the documents not produced were \"pertinent to the key issues\n\nof liability and damages,\" they have not explained how the delay\n\nhas affected their ability to litigate these issues in the context\n\nof the broader schedule for the case.        In their   motion for\n\n\n     4\n       The portions of the ISC order that plaintiffs sought to\namend in their pending motion do not appear to be the portions that\nthe district court found they had disobeyed. Nevertheless, the\nplaintiffs' motion did allege that the defendants were hampering\ndiscovery in this case, and in addition to asking for specific\nmodifications, the plaintiffs also asked for \"any order [the court]\nmight see fit.\" Cf. Enlace Mercantil Int'l, Inc. v. Senior Indus.,\nInc., 848 F.2d 315, 318 (1st Cir. 1988) (reversing a district\ncourt's dismissal when the record left open the possibility that\nplaintiff's delay resulted from waiting for the district court to\nrule on a pending and relevant motion).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fsanctions, defendants made no allegations that they ever even\n\nrequested the missing information from plaintiffs in the time\n\nbetween the deadline dates and the filing of their motion. Indeed,\n\nat the time the defendants moved for sanctions it was still nearly\n\neight months before the trial date, and more than four and a half\n\nmonths before the court's deadline to submit dispositive motions.\n\nCf. Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(noting that there was little prejudice from plaintiffs' delay when\n\ndefendants' tactical position was unaffected).5\n\n            Turning to procedure, we think that the district court\n\nsimply could not have weighed all of the appropriate factors here\n\ngiven the alacrity with which it dismissed the action.                  The\n\ndistrict court noted that defendants' motion for sanctions went\n\nunopposed    and   that,   as   a   result,   the    plaintiffs   had   not\n\ndemonstrated good cause for their noncompliance.            But under the\n\ndistrict court's local rules the plaintiffs had at least until\n\nNovember 18, 2005 to file their objection.6         The court did not wait\n\n\n     5\n       It is true that in Robson we stated that \"[r]epeated\ndisobedience of a scheduling order is inherently prejudicial.\" 81\nF.3d at 4. Robson did not, however, explain how much prejudice\nresults from such violations. Moreover, the violations in Robson\noccurred on the eve of trial and appear not to have been brought to\nthe court's attention until the morning of trial itself. Id. at 2.\nThe inherent prejudice in Robson was thus far more obvious from the\nrecord than is the case here.\n     6\n       Under D.P.R. R. 7.1(b), an opposing party is deemed to have\nwaived objection to a motion unless he files a written objection\nwithin ten days. D.P.R. R. 7.1(d) explains that these ten days are\ncalculated according to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a), which in turn\n\n                                    -12-\n\ffor the expiration of this deadline.7     When the plaintiffs sought\n\nto   present   their   argument     in   an   oversize   motion   for\n\nreconsideration, along with a motion for permission to extend the\n\nlength, both were denied without comment.     It appears the district\n\ncourt never considered plaintiffs' explanations for why their\n\n\n\n\nexcludes Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when a rule's time\nperiod is less than 11 days. Excluding weekends and the Veterans\nDay holiday, plaintiffs' response to the motion filed on November\n3, 2005 was due at least no earlier than November 18, 2005. In\nfact, plaintiffs may even have been entitled to several more days\nbeyond that.   The record indicates that defendants' motion for\nsanctions was filed electronically using the CM/ECF system, and\nthat service was made on opposing counsel through this system.\nUnder the district court's local rules, it appears that this\nmechanism of service entitled plaintiffs to an additional three\ndays.

Nevertheless, we can find nothing in the record\nindicating that this deadline was entered as a formal order of the\ncourt, and in the absence of such the district court's local rules\nwere controlling.\n\n                                  -13-\n\ffailures should be excused8 and why a less drastic remedy would\n\nsuffice.\n\n           \"Ordinarily, the plaintiff is given an opportunity to\n\nexplain [his noncompliance] or argue for a lesser penalty . . . .\"\n\nRobson, 81 F.3d at 3.9   Cf.

P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 389 (1993).         It\ninstructed the lower courts to engage in an equitable balancing\ntest, looking to all relevant circumstances, including the degree\nof prejudice to the adverse party, the potential impact on judicial\nproceedings, and the reasons for delay. Id. at 395. This court\nhas held that Pioneer was meant to apply more broadly, in other\ncircumstances in which the party who missed a deadline argues\nexcusable neglect. See Pratt v. Philbrook, 109 F.3d 18, 19-20 (1st\nCir. 1997); see also Graphic Commc'ns Int'l Union, Local 12-N v.\nQuebecor Printing Providence, Inc., 270 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(applying Pioneer to Fed. R.

The order of dismissal was entered despite the fact that under the district court's local rules, plaintiffs had at least until November 18, 2005 to respond to the defendants' motion requesting this drastic sanction. The court then did not accept plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration in this very active case, as it denied plaintiffs permission to file a motion that exceeded the page limit in the local rules. As best one can tell, the court never considered plaintiffs' explanation for their failure to meet the ISC deadlines. On these and other facts presented, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 2004, plaintiffs filed an action against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its Department of Education, a particular high school teacher, and various officials and other parties, alleging that plaintiffs had been victims of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and quid pro quo exchange of higher grades for sexual favors. In the early months of the litigation, the district court granted a number of extensions to various defendants to file their answers, and then allowed supplemental answers asserting new defenses as late as July 19, 2005. Even so, two of the defendants did not timely file their answers and default judgment was initially entered against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to discovery. By order dated March 18, 2005, the district court notified the parties that they should prepare for the ISC. The order informed the parties that all orders issued during the ISC would be effective immediately, even if the ISC order were not formally entered until a later date. The March 18, 2005 order also notified the parties that failure to comply with that order would \"result in stiff penalties, including but not limited to the entry of default, the dismissal of one or more claims or defenses, barring of witnesses or evidence, or monetary sanctions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ISC order was not formally entered until August 24, 2005, though it was apparently orally communicated to the parties at the ISC on June 16, 2005. The written ISC order also provided that non-compliance might \"result in the imposition of sanctions . . . includ[ing] the imposition of a fine, or the elimination of any of the allegations of the complaint, the answer, or any pleading.\" In the middle of discovery, on November 3, 2005, two of the defendants filed a motion requesting that plaintiffs' case be dismissed with prejudice as a sanction for plaintiffs' failure to comply with the ISC order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court order dismissing the case, signed by the district judge on November 16, 2005, was entered before plaintiffs had filed a response to the defendants' motion. The district court stated it was dismissing the action <i>with prejudice</i> because plaintiffs had failed to meet three of four discovery deadlines in July and August of 2005. The three deadlines, listed under the heading \"Preliminary Orders\" in the ISC order, were: (1) that plaintiffs were to provide, by July 8, 2005, either the name of the person in charge of a previous investigation against the teacher co-defendant or copies of complaints previously filed against that co-defendant; (2) that plaintiffs' expert was to tender his report by July 26, 2005; and (3) that plaintiffs were to provide their medical records and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) consent forms by August 17, 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> All three of these deadlines predated the written ISC order's formal date of entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, citing <i>Damiani v. Rhode Island Hospital,</i> 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983), found that this was \"a case of extreme misconduct that warrants the sanction of dismissal with prejudice\" because the plaintiffs had: (1) violated discovery orders; (2) failed to seek consent; and (3) failed to seek approval for non-compliance based on a truly valid reason. The court did not order plaintiffs to show cause, and it noted that plaintiffs had not opposed the motion. The court order was entered on November 17, 2005&#8212;one day after the date it was signed by the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on November 28, 2005. Because the motion exceeded 25 pages in length, the limit set by the local rules, it was accompanied by a motion for leave to file an over-length document. Both motions were denied the next day, November 29, 2005. There is no indication that the district court ever reviewed the merits of the motion or gave the plaintiffs a later opportunity to file a conforming motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the court dismissed the case for plaintiffs' failure to comply with the ISC deadlines there was a pending motion from the plaintiffs to amend the ISC order. This motion was filed on October 9, 2005 and was raised again in a filing on November 3, 2005. There was also activity by a previously defaulted defendant seeking to enter the case. And throughout discovery the plaintiffs had filed numerous motions to compel defendants to comply with discovery, arguing that the defendants were stalling and foot-dragging. At least some of plaintiffs' allegations apparently had merit: on August 9, 2005 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel defendants to produce certain documents, and it also partially granted plaintiffs' motion to quash several of the deposition notices on the grounds that the defendants had not provided notice to all parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may dismiss an action for noncompliance with a discovery order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> When a district court invokes this power, our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>See Nat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc.,</i> 427 U.S. 639, 642, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976) (per curiam); <i>Bachier-Ortiz v. Colon-Mendoza,</i> 331 F.3d 193, 194 (1st Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sanction imposed here was dismissal with prejudice, the harshest sanction, other than contempt, which may be visited on a party. It has been used where the plaintiff has failed to prosecute his case. <i>See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 629, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962); <i>see also Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc.,</i> 342 F.3d 44, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2003) (reversing a dismissal with prejudice for lack of prosecution); <i>Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez,</i> 183 F.3d 65, 66-67 (1st Cir. 1999) (same). In that context, the sanction is reserved for cases of \"extremely protracted inaction (measured in years), disobedience of court orders, ignorance of warnings, contumacious conduct, or some other aggravating circumstance.\" <i>Cosme Nieves v. Deshler,</i> 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987). This case does not involve a failure to prosecute. Indeed, the plaintiffs zealously prosecuted the action. The docket sheet shows over 100 entries at the time of entry of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, zealous prosecution is no shield against sanctions for violations of court discovery orders. Dismissal with prejudice for violation of such orders is well within the arsenal of the trial judge. <i>See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that disobedience of a court order can constitute extreme misconduct warranting dismissal); <i>Robson v. Hallenbeck,</i> 81 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that successive violations of court scheduling orders can justify dismissal with prejudice, and admonishing parties who \"treat scheduling orders as optional and [who] conduct trial preparations at their own convenience\"); <i>see also Young v. Gordon,</i> 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where dismissal with prejudice is involved, it has long been our rule that a case should not be dismissed with prejudice except \"when a plaintiff's misconduct is particularly egregious or extreme.\" <i>Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 46 (explaining that not \"every breach of a scheduling order warrants\" dismissal with prejudice, and noting that we will not \"rubber-stamp the use of dismissal as a sanction\"). In addition, \"fairness requires that some limits be placed on [the] use\" of a sanction of this severity. <i>Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,</i> 920 F.2d 1072, 1075-76 (1st Cir.1990). These fairness concerns encompass both the law's preference that cases be disposed of on the merits, <i>see Pomales,</i> 342 F.3d at 48, and procedural aspects such as notice and an opportunity to be heard, <i>see Ortiz-Anglada,</i> 183 F.3d at 67. Thus, our inquiry is into both the substance of the court's order and the procedure by which the sanction was imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry into sanctions orders is not a mechanical one, and our cases set forth a variety of important considerations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those commonly mentioned (this list is not complete) are the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions. . . . There is also a procedural dimension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 2-3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look at the substance first. There is no pattern of the plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders. <i>Cf., e.g., Crossman v. Raytheon Long Term Disability Plan,</i> 316 F.3d 36, 39 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.2002) (noting the importance generally of finding a pattern or series of disobedience and reversing an order of dismissal where all of the alleged infractions stemmed from noncompliance with a single order). Defendants do not cite to us, and we have been unable to find, a case from this circuit sustaining a dismissal with prejudice imposed solely for a single allegation of noncompliance with a single (albeit multi-part) discovery order&#8212;at least where that noncompliance was never brought to the plaintiffs' attention by the court prior to dismissing the case. <i>Robson</i> comes closest, but it involved the more serious violations of a variety of pre-trial deadlines on the eve of trial, which were brought to the court's attention on the morning of trial itself. <i>See Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 2. Context makes those much more serious infractions than what is involved here. Also, in <i>Robson</i> we vacated the dismissal; the district court had not considered the validity of several proffered excuses and thus there was an insufficient basis to uphold the dismissal on appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 2-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the defendants brought the motion for sanctions, the three deadlines had been violated by approximately four months, three months, and two and a half months, respectively. In <i>Ortiz-Anglada,</i> a delay of seven months was insufficient to warrant dismissal with prejudice. 183 F.3d at 66-67. In <i>Pomales,</i> a four-month delay \"did not alone constitute misconduct sufficiently extreme to justify dismissal with prejudice.\" 342 F.3d at 49. The plaintiffs' delay here, albeit one that came without seeking prior consent, is not a case of extreme misconduct warranting dismissal&#8212;particularly in light of the pending motions from plaintiffs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and from the defaulted defendant seeking to reenter the case. Further, there had been no motion to compel compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court does not appear to have considered whether a sanction as severe as dismissal with prejudice was needed or whether other sanctions might well have sufficed. <i>Cf. Crossman,</i> 316 F.3d at 39-40 (finding that the district court's failure to consider the adequacy of lesser sanctions contributed to a finding of abuse of discretion); <i>cf. also Asociacion de Empleados Del Instituto De Cultura Puertorriquena v. Rodriguez-Morales,</i> 538 F.2d 915, 917 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it clear that the defendants suffered much, if any, prejudice from plaintiffs' delay; while defendants suggest that the documents not produced were \"pertinent to the key issues of liability and damages,\" they have not explained how the delay has affected their ability to litigate these issues in the context of the broader schedule for the case. In their motion for sanctions, defendants made no allegations that they ever even requested the missing information from plaintiffs in the time between the deadline dates and the filing of their motion. Indeed, at the time the defendants moved for sanctions it was still nearly eight months before the trial date, and more than four and a half months before the court's deadline to submit dispositive motions. <i>Cf. Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria,</i> 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that there was little prejudice from plaintiffs' delay when defendants' tactical position was unaffected).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to procedure, we think that the district court simply could not have weighed all of the appropriate factors here given the alacrity with which it dismissed the action. The district court noted that defendants' motion for sanctions went unopposed and that, as a result, the plaintiffs had not demonstrated good cause for their noncompliance. But under the district court's local rules the plaintiffs had at least until November 18, 2005 to file their objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court did not wait for the expiration of this deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> When the plaintiffs sought to present their argument in an oversize motion for reconsideration, along with a motion for permission to extend the length, both were denied without comment. It appears the district court never considered plaintiffs' explanations for why their failures should be excused<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and why a less drastic remedy would suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Ordinarily, the plaintiff is given an opportunity to explain [his noncompliance] or argue for a lesser penalty. . . .\" <i>Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>Cf.

Nevertheless, the plaintiffs' motion did allege that the defendants were hampering discovery in this case, and in addition to asking for specific modifications, the plaintiffs also asked for \"any order [the court] might see fit.\"<i>Cf. Enlace Mercantil Int'l, Inc. v.

The order of dismissal was entered despite the fact that under the district court's local rules, plaintiffs had at least until November 18, 2005 to respond to the defendants' motion requesting this drastic sanction. The court then did not accept plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration in this very active case, as it denied plaintiffs permission to file a motion that exceeded the page limit in the local rules. As best one can tell, the court never considered plaintiffs' explanation for their failure to meet the ISC deadlines. On these and other facts presented, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 2004, plaintiffs filed an action against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, its Department of Education, a particular high school teacher, and various officials and other parties, alleging that plaintiffs had been victims of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and quid pro quo exchange of higher grades for sexual favors. In the early months of the litigation, the district court granted a number of extensions to various defendants to file their answers, and then allowed supplemental answers asserting new defenses as late as July 19, 2005. Even so, two of the defendants did not timely file their answers and default judgment was initially entered against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to discovery. By order dated March 18, 2005, the district court notified the parties that they should prepare for the ISC. The order informed the parties that all orders issued during the ISC would be effective immediately, even if the ISC order were not formally entered until a later date. The March 18, 2005 order also notified the parties that failure to comply with that order would \"result in stiff penalties, including but not limited to the entry of default, the dismissal of one or more claims or defenses, barring of witnesses or evidence, or monetary sanctions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ISC order was not formally entered until August 24, 2005, though it was apparently orally communicated to the parties at the ISC on June 16, 2005. The written ISC order also provided that non-compliance might \"result in the imposition of sanctions . . . includ[ing] the imposition of a fine, or the elimination of any of the allegations of the complaint, the answer, or any pleading.\" In the middle of discovery, on November 3, 2005, two of the defendants filed a motion requesting that plaintiffs' case be dismissed with prejudice as a sanction for plaintiffs' failure to comply with the ISC order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court order dismissing the case, signed by the district judge on November 16, 2005, was entered before plaintiffs had filed a response to the defendants' motion. The district court stated it was dismissing the action <i>with prejudice</i> because plaintiffs had failed to meet three of four discovery deadlines in July and August of 2005. The three deadlines, listed under the heading \"Preliminary Orders\" in the ISC order, were: (1) that plaintiffs were to provide, by July 8, 2005, either the name of the person in charge of a previous investigation against the teacher co-defendant or copies of complaints previously filed against that co-defendant; (2) that plaintiffs' expert was to tender his report by July 26, 2005; and (3) that plaintiffs were to provide their medical records and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) consent forms by August 17, 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> All three of these deadlines predated the written ISC order's formal date of entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, citing <i>Damiani v.

The court did not order plaintiffs to show cause, and it noted that plaintiffs had not opposed the motion. The court order was entered on November 17, 2005&#8212;one day after the date it was signed by the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on November 28, 2005. Because the motion exceeded 25 pages in length, the limit set by the local rules, it was accompanied by a motion for leave to file an over-length document. Both motions were denied the next day, November 29, 2005. There is no indication that the district court ever reviewed the merits of the motion or gave the plaintiffs a later opportunity to file a conforming motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the court dismissed the case for plaintiffs' failure to comply with the ISC deadlines there was a pending motion from the plaintiffs to amend the ISC order. This motion was filed on October 9, 2005 and was raised again in a filing on November 3, 2005. There was also activity by a previously defaulted defendant seeking to enter the case. And throughout discovery the plaintiffs had filed numerous motions to compel defendants to comply with discovery, arguing that the defendants were stalling and foot-dragging. At least some of plaintiffs' allegations apparently had merit: on August 9, 2005 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel defendants to produce certain documents, and it also partially granted plaintiffs' motion to quash several of the deposition notices on the grounds that the defendants had not provided notice to all parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may dismiss an action for noncompliance with a discovery order.

There is no pattern of the plaintiffs repeatedly flouting court orders. <i>Cf., e.g., Crossman v.

Defendants do not cite to us, and we have been unable to find, a case from this circuit sustaining a dismissal with prejudice imposed solely for a single allegation of noncompliance with a single (albeit multi-part) discovery order&#8212;at least where that noncompliance was never brought to the plaintiffs' attention by the court prior to dismissing the case. <i>Robson</i> comes closest, but it involved the more serious violations of a variety of pre-trial deadlines on the eve of trial, which were brought to the court's attention on the morning of trial itself. <i>See Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 2. Context makes those much more serious infractions than what is involved here. Also, in <i>Robson</i> we vacated the dismissal; the district court had not considered the validity of several proffered excuses and thus there was an insufficient basis to uphold the dismissal on appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 2-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the defendants brought the motion for sanctions, the three deadlines had been violated by approximately four months, three months, and two and a half months, respectively. In <i>Ortiz-Anglada,</i> a delay of seven months was insufficient to warrant dismissal with prejudice. 183 F.3d at 66-67. In <i>Pomales,</i> a four-month delay \"did not alone constitute misconduct sufficiently extreme to justify dismissal with prejudice.\" 342 F.3d at 49. The plaintiffs' delay here, albeit one that came without seeking prior consent, is not a case of extreme misconduct warranting dismissal&#8212;particularly in light of the pending motions from plaintiffs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and from the defaulted defendant seeking to reenter the case.

Crossman,</i> 316 F.3d at 39-40 (finding that the district court's failure to consider the adequacy of lesser sanctions contributed to a finding of abuse of discretion); <i>cf. also Asociacion de Empleados Del Instituto De Cultura Puertorriquena v.

In their motion for sanctions, defendants made no allegations that they ever even requested the missing information from plaintiffs in the time between the deadline dates and the filing of their motion. Indeed, at the time the defendants moved for sanctions it was still nearly eight months before the trial date, and more than four and a half months before the court's deadline to submit dispositive motions. <i>Cf. Figueroa Ruiz v.

The district court noted that defendants' motion for sanctions went unopposed and that, as a result, the plaintiffs had not demonstrated good cause for their noncompliance. But under the district court's local rules the plaintiffs had at least until November 18, 2005 to file their objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court did not wait for the expiration of this deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> When the plaintiffs sought to present their argument in an oversize motion for reconsideration, along with a motion for permission to extend the length, both were denied without comment.

In fact, plaintiffs may even have been entitled to several more days beyond that.
