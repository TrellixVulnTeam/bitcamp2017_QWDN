Roy appeals pro se from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction\n\non the ground that he had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsucceeding on the merits of his claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                             On\n\nappeal, Roy      argues   that    the       district    court      erred      in    denying\n\npreliminary injunctive relief as to his claims that the warden and\n\nother staff of the New Hampshire State Prison for Men (\"NHSP\"),\n\nwhere he is incarcerated, violated his First Amendment, Due Process\n\nand   Equal     Protection      rights       by    cutting        off   his    telephone\n\ncommunication      with   the    software         company    which      he    ran       before\n\nbecoming incarcerated (\"the Company\").1\n\n            \"The criteria for the grant of a preliminary injunction\n\nare the familiar four: likelihood of success, risk of irreparable\n\nharm, the       balance   of    the    equities      and    the    public     interest.\"\n\nLanglois v. Abington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). \"Likelihood of success is the touchstone of the preliminary\n\ninjunction inquiry.\" Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d\n\n670, 674 (1st Cir. 1998).        The standard of review \"depends upon the\n\nissue under consideration.            Generally speaking, pure issues of law\n\n(e.g.,    the   construction      of    a    statute)      are    reviewed         de   novo,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       In his brief, Roy states that he is \"withdraw[ing]\" his\nappeal from the denial of preliminary injunctive relief as to his\nclaim that he has been \"blacklisted\" from computer jobs in\nretaliation for his previous litigation against defendants.\n\n                                            2\n\ffindings of    fact   for   clear   error,   and   'judgment   calls'   with\n\nconsiderable deference depending upon the issue.\" Id.\n\n          We agree with the district court that Roy has failed to\n\nshow likelihood of success on the merits of any of the claims\n\npursued in this appeal.     In order to succeed on his § 1983 claims,\n\nRoy must show violation of a right secured by federal law. Fournier\n\nv. Reardon, 160 F.3d 754, 756 (1998).        Roy appeals from the denial\n\nof preliminary injunctive relief as to his claims that the prison\n\nrestriction on his telephone access violated his rights under the\n\nFirst Amendment, Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n          I. First Amendment\n\n          Roy argues that the district court erred in denying\n\npreliminary injunctive relief on his claim that by cutting off\n\ntelephone access to the Company and \"others interested in receiving\n\nhis intellectual property,\" defendants violated his First Amendment\n\nrights to free speech and free association.            We agree with the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that \"Roy's stated desire to engage in\n\ntelephone communications for the purpose of generating revenue and\n\ngoodwill for his outside business, and to independently license his\n\nintellectual    property      are     not     constitutionally-protected\n\ninterests.\" Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation, 9/3/03,\n\np. 34.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             \"Prisoners have no per se constitutional right to use a\n\ntelephone.\" United States v. Footman, 215 F.3d 145, 155 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); see also Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.\n\n2002)    (characterizing      First   Amendment     right   as   the     right       to\n\ncommunicate    with   persons    outside       prison   walls    and    use     of    a\n\ntelephone as merely one \"means of exercising that right\"); Pope v.\n\nHightower, 101 F.3d 1382, 1385 (11th Cir. 1996) (characterizing\n\nFirst    Amendment    right    at     issue    in   challenge     to     telephone\n\nrestrictions    as    the   \"right     to     communicate   with       family    and\n\nfriends\"); Benzel v. Grammar, 869 F.2d 1105, 1108 (8th Cir. 1989)\n\n(stating that \"[a] prisoner has no right to unlimited telephone\n\nuse\").    Moreover, \"a prisoner has no recognized right to conduct a\n\nbusiness while incarcerated.\" French v. Butterworth, 614 F.2d 23,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 1980).     Having failed to identify a First Amendment\n\nright on which the challenged restriction impinges, Roy has not\n\ndemonstrated a likelihood that he would succeed on the merits of\n\nthat claim.\n\n            II. Due Process\n\n            Roy appeals from the denial of a preliminary injunction\n\non his second claim in his amended complaint, that the telephone\n\nrestrictions deprived him of a liberty interest in \"continuing to\n\npreserve his beneficial interest in [the Company],\" without due\n\nprocess. Amended Complaint, ¶ 67.               \"[A] prisoner retains [no]\n\nunrestricted right under the fourteenth amendment to operate a\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fbusiness.\" French, 614 F.2d at 25.                  The Supreme Court has held that\n\n\"States may under certain circumstances create liberty interests\n\nwhich are protected by the Due Process Clause. But these interests\n\nwill be generally limited to freedom from restraint which . . .\n\nimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation\n\nto the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Sandin v. Conner, 515\n\nU.S. 472, 484 (1995).\n\n                 Roy has not demonstrated a likelihood of establishing\n\nthat such a liberty interest has been created in this case.                            Roy\n\nhas not shown that restrictions barring prisoners from running a\n\nbusiness from prison are atypical, and \"an inmate's subjective\n\nexpectations are not dispositive of the liberty-interest analysis.\"\n\nDominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996). Roy suggests\n\nthat       the   fact   that    he    had   communicated        with   the   Company    by\n\ntelephone        for    eight     years     prior    to   the    imposed     restriction\n\nestablishes        a    liberty      interest.        However,    a    change   to   more\n\nrestrictive (but not \"atypical\") conditions of confinement does not\n\nalone create a liberty interest. See id. (holding that prisoner's\n\nremoval from work release program and transfer to medium security\n\nfacility did not meet Sandin standard).2\n\n\n       2\n       Roy also argues that an alleged settlement agreement entered\ninto with defendants in 1995, following related litigation, created\na liberty interest, but he fails to show a likelihood of succeeding\non that claim.      The district court found that, in the 1995\nsettlement, \"NHSP allowed Roy to resume his telephone access to the\nCompany and his business friends, but did not exempt him from its\nprohibition against inmates conducting business while incarcerated,\n\n                                             -5-\n\f           The district court, in declining to dismiss the second\n\nclaim of the amended complaint for failure to state a claim,\n\nsuggested that a prohibition on running a business which did not\n\nrecognize \"exceptions for occasional communications necessary to\n\nprotect property legitimately acquired prior to incarceration,\"\n\nmight be \"atypical\" under Sandin. However, we need not decide that\n\nissue because Roy does not challenge the telephone restrictions on\n\nthat basis. Instead, he claims that preventing him from continuing\n\non an ongoing basis to dictate software to the Company over the\n\ntelephone deprives him of a liberty interest without due process.\n\nHe has failed to show a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of\n\nthat claim.\n\n           III. Equal Protection Claim\n\n           Roy     appeals    from   the     district   court's    denial   of\n\npreliminary      injunctive   relief    on    his   claim   that   his   equal\n\nprotection rights were violated because the prison prohibits him\n\nfrom selling his intellectual property while allowing other inmates\n\nto sell their handmade products through the prison's \"hobbycraft\"\n\nprogram.   Roy has not claimed to be part of a \"suspect class.\" And,\n\nas discussed above, prisoners do not have               a fundamental right\n\neither to telephone access or to conduct a business from prison.\n\n\n\nnor did NHSP agree to permit Roy to receive compensation for his\ncommunications.\" 9/3/03 Report and Recommendation, pp. 5 - 6. Roy\nhas not shown that that finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           Since there is no suspect classification here\n           involved, nor any deprivation of fundamental\n           rights, the ordinary equal protection test is\n           extremely deferential. The standard formula\n           is that a non-suspect classification is\n           unconstitutional only if no legitimate basis\n           can be imagined to support it. And \"support\"\n           means only that a legislature . . . could\n           provide a rational basis for the choice.\n\n\nBeauchamp v. Murphy, 37 F.3d 700, 707 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           We agree with the district court that \"allow[ing] inmates\n\nto receive compensation for their works sold through an approved\n\nand prison-supervised program is readily distinguishable from Roy's\n\ndesire to engage in unsupervised outside business activities.\"\n\n9/3/03   Report   and   Recommendation,   p.   20,   n.5.     Defendants'\n\ntestimony at the first preliminary injunction hearing articulated\n\na rationale for the rule that easily satisfies the \"rational basis\"\n\ntest. See 1/14/03 Report and Recommendation, p. 8.          Roy has failed\n\nto demonstrate a likelihood that he could prevail on the merits of\n\nhis equal protection claim.\n\n           The district court's denial of preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

Weld, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711034\"><a href=\"/opinion/711034/james-dominique-v-william-weld/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996). Roy suggests\n\nthat       the   fact   that    he    had   communicated        with   the   Company    by\n\ntelephone        for    eight     years     prior    to   the    imposed     restriction\n\nestablishes        a    liberty      interest.        However,    a    change   to   more\n\nrestrictive (but not \"atypical\") conditions of confinement does not\n\nalone create a liberty interest. See id. (holding that prisoner's\n\nremoval from work release program and transfer to medium security\n\nfacility did not meet Sandin standard).2\n\n\n       2\n       Roy also argues that an alleged settlement agreement entered\ninto with defendants in 1995, following related litigation, created\na liberty interest, but he fails to show a likelihood of succeeding\non that claim.      The district court found that, in the 1995\nsettlement, \"NHSP allowed Roy to resume his telephone access to the\nCompany and his business friends, but did not exempt him from its\nprohibition against inmates conducting business while incarcerated,\n\n                                             -5-\n\f           The district court, in declining to dismiss the second\n\nclaim of the amended complaint for failure to state a claim,\n\nsuggested that a prohibition on running a business which did not\n\nrecognize \"exceptions for occasional communications necessary to\n\nprotect property legitimately acquired prior to incarceration,\"\n\nmight be \"atypical\" under Sandin. However, we need not decide that\n\nissue because Roy does not challenge the telephone restrictions on\n\nthat basis. Instead, he claims that preventing him from continuing\n\non an ongoing basis to dictate software to the Company over the\n\ntelephone deprives him of a liberty interest without due process.\n\nHe has failed to show a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of\n\nthat claim.\n\n           III. Equal Protection Claim\n\n           Roy     appeals    from   the     district   court's    denial   of\n\npreliminary      injunctive   relief    on    his   claim   that   his   equal\n\nprotection rights were violated because the prison prohibits him\n\nfrom selling his intellectual property while allowing other inmates\n\nto sell their handmade products through the prison's \"hobbycraft\"\n\nprogram.   Roy has not claimed to be part of a \"suspect class.\" And,\n\nas discussed above, prisoners do not have               a fundamental right\n\neither to telephone access or to conduct a business from prison.\n\n\n\nnor did NHSP agree to permit Roy to receive compensation for his\ncommunications.\" 9/3/03 Report and Recommendation, pp. 5 - 6. Roy\nhas not shown that that finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           Since there is no suspect classification here\n           involved, nor any deprivation of fundamental\n           rights, the ordinary equal protection test is\n           extremely deferential. The standard formula\n           is that a non-suspect classification is\n           unconstitutional only if no legitimate basis\n           can be imagined to support it. And \"support\"\n           means only that a legislature . . . could\n           provide a rational basis for the choice.\n\n\nBeauchamp v.

Defendants'\n\ntestimony at the first preliminary injunction hearing articulated\n\na rationale for the rule that easily satisfies the \"rational basis\"\n\ntest. See 1/14/03 Report and Recommendation, p. 8.          Roy has failed\n\nto demonstrate a likelihood that he could prevail on the merits of\n\nhis equal protection claim.\n\n           The district court's denial of preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
