On December 7, 2004, the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nentered summary judgment in favor of Charter Oak Fire Insurance\n\nCompany   (\"Charter   Oak\")    in        an    action      brought    by   appellants\n\nAnthony   A.    DiMaio   (\"DiMaio\")            and    DiMaio      Family     Pizza    &\n\nLuncheonette, Inc. (\"DiMaio Family Pizza\").                    On January 25, 2005,\n\nthe district court denied appellants' motion for relief from\n\nsummary judgment under Rules 59(e) and 60(b) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure.      Appellants herein appeal.                   Because we find\n\nthat their contract claims were time-barred under the applicable\n\nlimitations period, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.    Facts\n\n           Appellants operated the Villa DiMaio Restaurant (\"the\n\nRestaurant\") at 268 State Road in Whately, Massachusetts.                     Charter\n\nOak issued a property insurance policy (\"the Policy\") to the\n\nRestaurant, effective from February 18, 2000 to February 18, 2001.\n\n           On   December      18,        2000,       the    Restaurant     sustained\n\nsubstantial damage in a fire.            On February 25, 2000, prior to the\n\nfire, DiMaio Family Pizza had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nAfter the fire, on March 21, 2001, DiMaio Family Pizza's bankruptcy\n\ncase was converted from a Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 case.                       On\n\nDecember 27, 2001, DiMaio filed for personal bankruptcy under\n\nChapter   7.    Two   bankruptcy         trustees       were    appointed,    one    to\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\frepresent each estate, and both appellants were represented by\n\ncounsel in their respective bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n            After     the    fire,    the   Town     of       Whately   (\"the   Town\")\n\nrequested    that   DiMaio     demolish       the    building       and   remove    the\n\ndestroyed property.          Because DiMaio was without funds, the Town\n\nundertook to demolish the building and remove the wreckage.                         The\n\nTown then made a claim against DiMaio for the demolition and debris\n\nremoval, and DiMaio in turn made a claim against Charter Oak.\n\nCharter Oak issued an \"advance\" check of $20,000 to cover these\n\ncosts, payable to both DiMaio and the Town.                   After DiMaio filed for\n\npersonal bankruptcy, Charter Oak paid approximately $345,000 on the\n\ninsurance claim to CIT Small Business Lending Corporation, a\n\ncreditor of appellants.         Appellants initiated this action because\n\nthey seek to recover additional money under the Policy for property\n\ndamage and business income losses allegedly sustained as a result\n\nof the fire.\n\n            Under the Policy's suit limitation provision, the terms\n\nof which are set forth in and mandated by Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 175,\n\n§ 99, suit must be brought within two years of the date of loss.\n\nThe suit limitation was thus set to expire on December 18, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, both bankruptcy trustees asked Charter Oak to agree to\n\nextend the suit limitation period.             Charter Oak extended the suit\n\nlimitation period to February 17, 2003.                   Again at the trustees'\n\nrequest,    Charter    Oak    later    agreed       to    a    second   extension   to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fApril 11, 2003.   In the end, although Charter Oak agreed to a four-\n\nmonth extension of the suit limitation period, neither of the\n\nbankruptcy trustees ever brought suit.\n\n           On April 11, 2003, the extended suit limitation period\n\nexpired.   Neither appellants nor their bankruptcy trustees sought\n\nor received a further extension of the suit limitation period. The\n\ncomplaint in the instant case was not filed until February 12,\n\n2004, more than ten months after the extended suit limitation\n\nperiod had expired.\n\n                           II.   Analysis\n\n           Our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo, and\n\nwe view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp. v. RFI Supply, Inc., 440 F.3d 549, 552 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).   We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration of a grant of summary judgment under Rules 59(e)\n\nand 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for manifest\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Son, Ltd.,\n\n427 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2005); Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d\n\n27, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           Appellants do not dispute the fact that they failed to\n\nfile suit within two years of the date of the fire.    Instead, they\n\nappeal the grant of summary judgment on two grounds.    First, they\n\nclaim that, having filed for bankruptcy and thus having no standing\n\nto bring suit within two years of the loss, they fall within an\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fexception to the limitations provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175,\n\n§ 99.   Second, they maintain that Charter Oak's failure to comply\n\nwith the provisions of another statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,\n\n§ 140B, tolled the limitations period.              We address each claim in\n\nturn.\n\n           A.    Enjoined-or-Abated Clause\n\n           Appellants      claim   that     their    commencement   of   this\n\nlitigation      was   timely   because    their     respective   bankruptcies\n\nenjoined them from filing suit or action upon the Policy until the\n\ntrustees abandoned their claims.1          They rely upon the enjoined-or-\n\nabated clause in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99, which provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n           If suit or action upon this policy is enjoined\n           or abated, suit or action may be commenced at\n           any time within one year after the dissolution\n           of such injunction, or the abatement of such\n           suit or action, to the same extent as would be\n           possible if there was no limitation of time\n           provided herein for the bringing of such suit\n           or action.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 (emphasis added).           Charter Oak argues\n\n-- and the district court agreed -- that appellants were neither\n\nenjoined nor abated from commencing suit against Charter Oak in the\n\nmanner contemplated by § 99.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The trustee for DiMaio Family Pizza was ordered to abandon any\nclaim against Charter Oak on April 2, 2003, and the trustee for\nDiMaio was ordered to abandon its interest on June 20, 2003.\nAppellants initiated this suit on February 12, 2004.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Appellants first contend that the plain language of the\n\nenjoined-or-abated clause of § 99 clearly includes bankruptcy\n\nproceedings within its ambit.       They argue in their brief to this\n\nCourt that \"the common meaning\" and \"fair reading\" of the enjoined-\n\nor-abated clause makes plain that their respective bankruptcies\n\n\"operated to enjoin the assertion of their claims on the policy\"\n\nand thus that they qualify for an extension of the limitation\n\nperiod under § 99.   This argument fails.\n\n           Appellants'   position    is    predicated   on   the   erroneous\n\nassumption that bankruptcy proceedings created an \"automatic stay\"\n\nthat enjoined or abated their suit against Charter Oak.                 They\n\ncorrectly note that the filing of a bankruptcy petition triggers an\n\nautomatic stay under § 362(a) of the bankruptcy code.              See In re\n\nJamo, 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2002).          However, that section\n\nprovides that a petition in bankruptcy stays the commencement or\n\ncontinuation of all nonbankruptcy judicial proceedings \"against the\n\ndebtor.\"    11 U.S.C. § 362(a).           The stay is designed to give\n\n\"breathing room\" to the debtor, In re Jamo, 283 F.3d at 398, and\n\nhas absolutely no effect on the debtors' ability to bring suit\n\nagainst other parties.      Further, the actual language of § 99\n\npermits an extension of the limitation period only \"[i]f suit or\n\naction . . . is enjoined or abated.\"         We agree with the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that, by its own plain language, § 99 is not\n\npersonal to appellants, but rather speaks generally to their \"suit\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\for action.\"         The question is thus whether, at any point during the\n\nextended limitation period, appellants' suit against Charter Oak\n\nwas enjoined or abated.\n\n               As an initial matter, DiMaio did not file for bankruptcy\n\nuntil December 27, 2001 -- more than one year after the fire -- and\n\nhe could have initiated suit against Charter Oak at any time before\n\nthat date.          Once trustees were appointed for both bankruptcies,\n\nappellants argue that they were enjoined from bringing suit against\n\nCharter       Oak    because    their   rights       were     transferred    to    their\n\nrespective trustees, who alone had standing to initiate suit.\n\nIndeed, when appellants filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, \"all\n\nlegal    or    equitable       interests    .    .   .   in    property     as    of   the\n\ncommencement of the case\" and \"[a]ny interest in property that the\n\nestate acquire[d] after the commencement of the case\" became the\n\nproperty of their respective bankruptcy estates.                    11 U.S.C. § 541\n\n(a)(1),(7).          The parties agree that appellants' claim against\n\nCharter Oak became part of their respective bankruptcy estates and\n\nthat their bankruptcy trustees acquired exclusive standing to\n\nassert    those      claims.      Although       appellants      were   thus     without\n\nstanding to initiate suit, their suit against Charter Oak was not\n\nenjoined or abated.             When a trustee is appointed, the trustee\n\n\"steps into the shoes of the debtor for the purposes of asserting\n\nor maintaining the debtor's causes of action[].\"                    In re Rare Coin\n\nGalleries, Inc., 862 F.2d 896, 901 (1st Cir. 1988).                       During their\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\frepresentation of appellants' respective bankruptcy estates, the\n\ntrustees had the right to initiate suit against Charter Oak.\n\n            Although they requested and received from Charter Oak two\n\nextensions of the suit limitation period, the bankruptcy trustees\n\nnever initiated suit.       However, the trustees' failure to exercise\n\nthat right does not mean that the suit itself was enjoined or\n\nabated. Furthermore, appellants were not without any rights during\n\nthis period. The Bankruptcy Code allows \"[a]ny party [to] petition\n\nthe bankruptcy court to compel the trustee either to bring suit or\n\nto abandon the claim.\"          Koch Ref. v. Farmers Union Cent. Exch.,\n\nInc., 831 F.2d 1339, 1347 n.9 (7th Cir. 1987); see also In re\n\nDawnwood Props./78, 209 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 2000) (\"If not\n\nsatisfied    with     the   trustee's    [failure    to   pursue   a   claim],\n\nplaintiffs were free to bring the matter to the attention of the\n\nBankruptcy Court for whatever directions or relief the Court\n\nthought appropriate, including a direction to the trustee either to\n\ninitiate the action in question or to abandon the claims within the\n\nlimitation period so as to allow the plaintiffs to pursue the\n\nclaims on their own.\").         Upon abandonment, interest in the claim\n\nwould have reverted to the appellants.             See In re Charles George\n\nLand Reclamation Trust, 30 B.R. 918, 923 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1983).\n\n            In sum, we find that § 99 does not apply to extend\n\nappellants' limitation period.          Their suit against Charter Oak was\n\nnot   enjoined   or    abated   by   appellants'    bankruptcy     proceedings\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fbecause at no point during the limitation period was there an\n\nabatement or injunction against appellants' rights to initiate suit\n\nagainst Charter Oak; further, we also note that there was no\n\nabatement   or   injunction   against    the   trustees.   There   is   no\n\nunfairness here.\n\n            B.   Tolling\n\n            Appellants also argue that the suit limitation period was\n\ntolled because Charter Oak violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 140B\n\nby failing to give them proper notice of the applicable statute of\n\nlimitations period when it made a partial payment to the Town of\n\nWhately for the removal and disposal of the restaurant's building\n\nremnants and debris.       Section 140B provides, in applicable part,\n\nthat\n\n            Any person against whom a claim or suit for\n            damages on account of bodily injury, property\n            damage, or death is made, or if such person is\n            insured against loss by reason of his\n            liability to pay such damages the insurer of\n            such person may advance money to, or pay bills\n            incurred by or on behalf of, such claimant, or\n            plaintiff, as the case may be . . . .\n\n            Any such insurer who makes an advance payment\n            under this section shall at the time of making\n            such payment, by notice in writing, inform the\n            claimant of the statute of limitations\n            applicable to his claim and the time within\n            which an action is required to be commenced to\n            enforce such claim in a court of competent\n            jurisdiction.\n\n            The cause of action of any claimant who\n            receives an advance payment under this section\n            but who is not given the written notice\n            required hereunder shall accrue on the date\n\n                                   -9-\n\f             such written notice is actually given and not\n             on the date the injury or damage was\n             sustained.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 140B (emphasis added).\n\n             Appellants maintain that Charter Oak's $20,000 payment to\n\nthe   Town   for    demolition     and    removal   constituted    an    \"advance\n\npayment\" under § 140B and that they were \"claimants\" who were due\n\nnotice of the applicable statute of limitations.               Because they did\n\nnot receive such notice, they argue that the statute of limitations\n\nwas tolled.\n\n             The    statute    provides    for   three    types   of    actors:   a\n\n\"person,\" an \"insurer,\" and a \"claimant.\"                As a threshold matter,\n\nwe must determine the identity of the claimant within the context\n\nof § 140B.    The claimant is the critical actor because the statute\n\nprovides for the tolling of the statute of limitations only with\n\nrespect to the claimant's cause of action. Charter Oak argues, and\n\nthe district court agreed, that the claimant referred to in this\n\nsection is the Town.          Appellants urge us to interpret the statute\n\nsuch that they are the claimants.\n\n             The plain language of § 140B clearly favors Charter Oak's\n\nposition.    It is obvious from the statutory text that the \"person\"\n\nreferred to is the insured (here DiMaio).                  The \"claimant,\" by\n\ncontrast, is the entity that initiates a \"claim or suit\" against\n\nthe insured.       The text cannot support the notion that the \"person\"\n\nand the \"claimant\" are one and the same.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f          We   understand    the   statute's    notice    requirement    to\n\nbenefit third-party claimants rather than insurance policy holders.\n\nIndeed,   it   appears   that   every     Massachusetts   case   to     have\n\ninterpreted and applied § 140B has done so in the context of claims\n\nmade by third-party claimants against insureds. See, e.g., Trinity\n\nChurch v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 502 N.E.2d 532, 539\n\n(Mass. 1987); Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, 685 N.E.2d 1210, 1212-\n\n13 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997).       This interpretation has the force of\n\nreason.   As the district court points out, \"requiring such notice\n\nto the insured every time an insurance company renders a payment to\n\na third party . . . would not only be burdensome but, given that\n\nthe insured is provided notice of the statute of limitations in the\n\ninsurance contract itself, nonsensical.\"         DiMaio Family Pizza &\n\nLuncheonette, Inc. v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 349 F. Supp. 2d\n\n128, 134 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Charter Oak and its denial of\n\nappellants' Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Charter Oak issued a property insurance policy (\"the Policy\") to the Restaurant, effective from February 18, 2000 to February 18, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 2000, the Restaurant sustained substantial damage in a fire. On February 25, 2000, prior to the fire, DiMaio Family Pizza had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After the fire, on March 21, 2001, DiMaio Family Pizza's bankruptcy case was converted from a Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 case. On December 27, 2001, DiMaio filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 7. Two bankruptcy trustees were appointed, one to represent each estate, and both appellants were represented by counsel in their respective bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the fire, the Town of Whately (\"the Town\") requested that DiMaio demolish the building and remove the destroyed property. Because DiMaio was without funds, the Town undertook to demolish the building and remove the wreckage. The Town then made a claim against DiMaio for the demolition and debris removal, and DiMaio in turn made a claim against Charter Oak. Charter Oak issued an \"advance\" check of $20,000 to cover these costs, payable to both DiMaio and the Town. After DiMaio filed for personal bankruptcy, Charter Oak paid approximately $345,000 on the insurance claim to CIT Small Business Lending Corporation, a creditor of appellants. Appellants initiated this action because they seek to recover additional money under the Policy for property damage and business income losses allegedly sustained as a result of the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Policy's suit limitation provision, the terms of which are set forth in and mandated by Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 175, &#167; 99, suit must be brought within two years of the date of loss. The suit limitation was thus set to expire on December 18, 2002. Accordingly, both bankruptcy trustees asked Charter Oak to agree to extend the suit limitation period. Charter Oak extended the suit limitation period to February 17, 2003. Again at the trustees' request, Charter Oak later agreed to a second extension to April 11, 2003. In the end, although Charter Oak agreed to a four-month extension of the suit limitation period, neither of the bankruptcy trustees ever brought suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 11, 2003, the extended suit limitation period expired.

First, they claim that, having filed for bankruptcy and thus having no standing to bring suit within two years of the loss, they fall within an exception to the limitations provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99. Second, they maintain that Charter Oak's failure to comply with the provisions of another statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 140B, tolled the limitations period.

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If suit or action upon this policy is <i>enjoined or abated,</i> suit or action may be commenced at any time within one year after the dissolution of such injunction, or the abatement of such suit or action, to the same extent as would be possible if there was no limitation of time provided herein for the bringing of such suit or action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 (emphasis added). Charter Oak argues &#8212; and the district court agreed &#8212; that appellants were neither enjoined nor abated from commencing suit against Charter Oak in the manner contemplated by &#167; 99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants first contend that the plain language of the enjoined-or-abated clause of &#167; 99 clearly includes bankruptcy proceedings within its ambit. They argue in their brief to this Court that \"the common meaning\" and \"fair reading\" of the enjoined-or-abated clause makes plain that their respective bankruptcies \"operated to enjoin the assertion of their claims on the policy\" and thus that they qualify for an extension of the limitation period under &#167; 99. This argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' position is predicated on the erroneous assumption that bankruptcy proceedings created an \"automatic stay\" that enjoined or abated their suit against Charter Oak. They correctly note that the filing of a bankruptcy petition triggers an automatic stay under &#167; 362(a) of the bankruptcy code. <i>See In re Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2002). However, that section provides that a petition in bankruptcy stays the commencement or continuation of all nonbankruptcy judicial proceedings \"against the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a). The stay is designed to give \"breathing room\" to the debtor, <i>In re Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d at 398, and has absolutely no effect on the debtors' ability to bring suit <i>against other parties.</i> Further, the actual language of &#167; 99 permits an extension of the limitation period only \"[i]f suit or action . . . is enjoined or abated.\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that, by its own plain language, &#167; 99 is not personal to appellants, but rather speaks generally to their \"suit or action.\" The question is thus whether, at any point during the extended limitation period, appellants' suit against Charter Oak was enjoined or abated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, DiMaio did not file for bankruptcy until December 27, 2001 &#8212; more than one year after the fire &#8212; and he could have initiated suit against Charter Oak at any time before that date. Once trustees were appointed for both bankruptcies, appellants argue that they were enjoined from bringing suit against Charter Oak because their rights were transferred to their respective trustees, who alone had standing to initiate suit. Indeed, when appellants filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, \"all legal or equitable interests . . . in property as of the commencement of the case\" and \"[a]ny interest in property that the estate acquire[d] after the commencement of the case\" became the property of their respective bankruptcy estates. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1),(7). The parties agree that appellants' claim against Charter Oak became part of their respective bankruptcy estates and that their bankruptcy trustees acquired exclusive standing to assert those claims. Although appellants were thus without standing to initiate suit, their suit against Charter Oak was not enjoined or abated. When a trustee is appointed, the trustee \"steps into the shoes of the debtor for the purposes of asserting or maintaining the debtor's causes of action[].\" <i>In re Rare Coin Galleries, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 896, 901 (1st Cir.1988). During their representation of appellants' respective bankruptcy estates, the trustees had the right to initiate suit against Charter Oak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they requested and received from Charter Oak two extensions of the suit limitation period, the bankruptcy trustees never initiated suit. However, the trustees' failure to exercise that right does not mean that the suit itself was enjoined or abated. Furthermore, appellants were not without any rights during this period. The Bankruptcy Code allows \"[a]ny party [to] petition the bankruptcy court to compel the trustee either to bring suit or to abandon the claim.\" <i>Koch Ref v. Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc.,</i> 831 F.2d 1339, 1347 n. 9 (7th Cir.1987); <i>see also In re Dawnwood Props./78,</i> 209 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.2000) (\"If not satisfied with the trustee's [failure to pursue a claim], plaintiffs were free to bring the matter to the attention of the Bankruptcy Court for whatever directions or relief the Court thought appropriate, including a direction to the trustee either to initiate the action in question or to abandon the claims within the limitation period so as to allow the plaintiffs to pursue the claims on their own.\"). Upon abandonment, interest in the claim would have reverted to the appellants. <i>See In re Charles George Land Reclamation Trust,</i> 30 B.R. 918, 923 (Bankr.D.Mass.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that &#167; 99 does not apply to extend appellants' limitation period. Their suit against Charter Oak was not enjoined or abated by appellants' bankruptcy proceedings because at no point during the limitation period was there an abatement or injunction against appellants' rights to initiate suit against Charter Oak; further, we also note that there was no abatement or injunction against the trustees. There is no unfairness here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the suit limitation period was tolled because Charter Oak violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 140B by failing to give them proper notice of the applicable statute of limitations period when it made a partial payment to the Town of Whately for the removal and disposal of the restaurant's building remnants and debris. Section 140B provides, in applicable part, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any <i>person</i> against whom a claim or suit for damages on account of bodily injury, property damage, or death is made, or if such person is insured against loss by reason of his liability to pay such damages <i>the insurer</i> of such person may advance money to, or pay bills incurred by or on behalf of, such <i>claimant,</i> or plaintiff, as the case may be . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Any such <i>insurer</i> who makes an advance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">payment under this section shall at the time of making such payment, by notice in writing, inform the <i>claimant</i> of the statute of limitations applicable to his claim and the time within which an action is required to be commenced to enforce such claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause of action of any <i>claimant</i> who receives an advance payment under this section but who is not given the written notice required hereunder shall accrue on the date such written notice is actually given and not on the date the injury or damage was sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 140B (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants maintain that Charter Oak's $20,000 payment to the Town for demolition and removal constituted an \"advance payment\" under &#167; 140B and that they were \"claimants\" who were due notice of the applicable statute of limitations. Because they did not receive such notice, they argue that the statute of limitations was tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute provides for three types of actors: a \"person,\" an \"insurer,\" and a \"claimant.\" As a threshold matter, we must determine the identity of the claimant within the context of &#167; 140B. The claimant is the critical actor because the statute provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations only with respect to the claimant's cause of action. Charter Oak argues, and the district court agreed, that the claimant referred to in this section is the Town. Appellants urge us to interpret the statute such that they are the claimants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 140B clearly favors Charter Oak's position. It is obvious from the statutory text that the \"person\" referred to is the insured (here DiMaio). The \"claimant,\" by contrast, is the entity that initiates a \"claim or suit\" against the insured. The text cannot support the notion that the \"person\" and the \"claimant\" are one and the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand the statute's notice requirement to benefit third-party claimants rather than insurance policy holders. Indeed, it appears that every Massachusetts case to have interpreted and applied &#167; 140B has done so in the context of claims made by third-party claimants against insureds. <i>See, e.g., Trinity Church v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 399 Mass. 43, 502 N.E.2d 532, 539 (1987); <i>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reynolds,</i> 43 Mass.App.Ct. 927, 685 N.E.2d 1210, 1212-13 (1997). This interpretation has the force of reason. As the district court points out, \"requiring such notice to the insured every time an insurance company renders a payment to a third party . . . would not only be burdensome but, given that the insured is provided notice of the statute of limitations in the insurance contract itself, nonsensical.\" <i>DiMaio Family Pizza &amp; Luncheonette, Inc. v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 349 F.Supp.2d 128, 134 (D.Mass.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Charter Oak and its denial of appellants' Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The trustee for DiMaio Family Pizza was ordered to abandon any claim against Charter Oak on April 2, 2003, and the trustee for DiMaio was ordered to abandon its interest on June 20, 2003.

However, that section provides that a petition in bankruptcy stays the commencement or continuation of all nonbankruptcy judicial proceedings \"against the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a). The stay is designed to give \"breathing room\" to the debtor, <i>In re Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d at 398, and has absolutely no effect on the debtors' ability to bring suit <i>against other parties.</i> Further, the actual language of &#167; 99 permits an extension of the limitation period only \"[i]f suit or action . . . is enjoined or abated.\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that, by its own plain language, &#167; 99 is not personal to appellants, but rather speaks generally to their \"suit or action.\" The question is thus whether, at any point during the extended limitation period, appellants' suit against Charter Oak was enjoined or abated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, DiMaio did not file for bankruptcy until December 27, 2001 &#8212; more than one year after the fire &#8212; and he could have initiated suit against Charter Oak at any time before that date. Once trustees were appointed for both bankruptcies, appellants argue that they were enjoined from bringing suit against Charter Oak because their rights were transferred to their respective trustees, who alone had standing to initiate suit. Indeed, when appellants filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, \"all legal or equitable interests . . . in property as of the commencement of the case\" and \"[a]ny interest in property that the estate acquire[d] after the commencement of the case\" became the property of their respective bankruptcy estates. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1),(7). The parties agree that appellants' claim against Charter Oak became part of their respective bankruptcy estates and that their bankruptcy trustees acquired exclusive standing to assert those claims. Although appellants were thus without standing to initiate suit, their suit against Charter Oak was not enjoined or abated. When a trustee is appointed, the trustee \"steps into the shoes of the debtor for the purposes of asserting or maintaining the debtor's causes of action[].\" <i>In re Rare Coin Galleries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515442\"><a href=\"/opinion/515442/bankr-l-rep-p-72501-in-re-rare-coin-galleries-of-america-inc-debtor/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span>, 901 (1st Cir.1988). During their representation of appellants' respective bankruptcy estates, the trustees had the right to initiate suit against Charter Oak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they requested and received from Charter Oak two extensions of the suit limitation period, the bankruptcy trustees never initiated suit. However, the trustees' failure to exercise that right does not mean that the suit itself was enjoined or abated. Furthermore, appellants were not without any rights during this period. The Bankruptcy Code allows \"[a]ny party [to] petition the bankruptcy court to compel the trustee either to bring suit or to abandon the claim.\" <i>Koch Ref v. Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496608\"><a href=\"/opinion/496608/18-collier-bankrcas2d-84-bankr-l-rep-p-72009-koch-refining-koch/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1339</span></a></span>, 1347 n. 9 (7th Cir.1987); <i>see also In re Dawnwood Props./78,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768310\"><a href=\"/opinion/768310/in-re-dawnwood-properties78-debtor-john-p-rooney-and-dawnwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 117 (2d Cir.2000) (\"If not satisfied with the trustee's [failure to pursue a claim], plaintiffs were free to bring the matter to the attention of the Bankruptcy Court for whatever directions or relief the Court thought appropriate, including a direction to the trustee either to initiate the action in question or to abandon the claims within the limitation period so as to allow the plaintiffs to pursue the claims on their own.\"). Upon abandonment, interest in the claim would have reverted to the appellants. <i>See In re Charles George Land Reclamation Trust,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1815682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1815682/in-re-charles-george-land-reclamation-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span>, 923 (Bankr.D.Mass.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that &#167; 99 does not apply to extend appellants' limitation period. Their suit against Charter Oak was not enjoined or abated by appellants' bankruptcy proceedings because at no point during the limitation period was there an abatement or injunction against appellants' rights to initiate suit against Charter Oak; further, we also note that there was no abatement or injunction against the trustees. There is no unfairness here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Tolling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the suit limitation period was tolled because Charter Oak violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 140B by failing to give them proper notice of the applicable statute of limitations period when it made a partial payment to the Town of Whately for the removal and disposal of the restaurant's building remnants and debris. Section 140B provides, in applicable part, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any <i>person</i> against whom a claim or suit for damages on account of bodily injury, property damage, or death is made, or if such person is insured against loss by reason of his liability to pay such damages <i>the insurer</i> of such person may advance money to, or pay bills incurred by or on behalf of, such <i>claimant,</i> or plaintiff, as the case may be . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Any such <i>insurer</i> who makes an advance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">payment under this section shall at the time of making such payment, by notice in writing, inform the <i>claimant</i> of the statute of limitations applicable to his claim and the time within which an action is required to be commenced to enforce such claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause of action of any <i>claimant</i> who receives an advance payment under this section but who is not given the written notice required hereunder shall accrue on the date such written notice is actually given and not on the date the injury or damage was sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 140B (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants maintain that Charter Oak's $20,000 payment to the Town for demolition and removal constituted an \"advance payment\" under &#167; 140B and that they were \"claimants\" who were due notice of the applicable statute of limitations. Because they did not receive such notice, they argue that the statute of limitations was tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute provides for three types of actors: a \"person,\" an \"insurer,\" and a \"claimant.\" As a threshold matter, we must determine the identity of the claimant within the context of &#167; 140B. The claimant is the critical actor because the statute provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations only with respect to the claimant's cause of action. Charter Oak argues, and the district court agreed, that the claimant referred to in this section is the Town. Appellants urge us to interpret the statute such that they are the claimants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of &#167; 140B clearly favors Charter Oak's position. It is obvious from the statutory text that the \"person\" referred to is the insured (here DiMaio). The \"claimant,\" by contrast, is the entity that initiates a \"claim or suit\" against the insured. The text cannot support the notion that the \"person\" and the \"claimant\" are one and the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand the statute's notice requirement to benefit third-party claimants rather than insurance policy holders. Indeed, it appears that every Massachusetts case to have interpreted and applied &#167; 140B has done so in the context of claims made by third-party claimants against insureds. <i>See, e.g., Trinity Church v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2134410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2134410/trinity-church-in-the-city-v-john-hancock-mut-l-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2134410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2134410/trinity-church-in-the-city-v-john-hancock-mut-l-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 539 (1987); <i>Allstate Ins.

This interpretation has the force of reason. As the district court points out, \"requiring such notice to the insured every time an insurance company renders a payment to a third party . . . would not only be burdensome but, given that the insured is provided notice of the statute of limitations in the insurance contract itself, nonsensical.\" <i>DiMaio Family Pizza &amp; Luncheonette, Inc. v.
