D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John P. Gause with whom Berman & Simmons was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Christopher W. Nanos for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 14, 2002\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.           Appellant Shawnee Patten, a\n\nformer employee of appellee Wal-Mart Stores East, Inc., challenges\n\ntwo rulings made by the district court during the trial of her\n\nanalogous claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101-12213, and the Maine Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"),\n\n5 M.R.S.A. § 4551-4633. She asserts that the court incorrectly\n\ninstructed the jury on her burden of proof and improperly excluded\n\nevidence of a state agency's finding of discrimination. Concluding\n\nthat the district court did not err, we affirm the judgment in\n\nfavor of Wal-Mart.\n                             I.    Background\n\n     Appellant suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (\"CMT\"), a\ndisability similar in its effects to muscular dystrophy.              Although\nthe CMT does not prevent appellant from working, it substantially\n\nlimits her ability to walk or stand for a long time.                Because of\nthe illness, she often has pains in her arms and legs, and has an\nunusual gait.    Appellant’s supervisors at Wal-Mart were aware of\n\nher disability from the time she first applied for a position\nthere.       During   appellant’s        ten-month    employment,     Wal-Mart\nrepeatedly    accommodated   her    by    approving    long-term    leaves   of\n\nabsence and transferring her to less-demanding positions when she\nfelt the CMT prevented her from adequately doing her job.\n     Throughout her tenure at Wal-Mart, which began on September\n\n30, 1997, Patten’s presence was marked by accommodations and\nabsences, only sometimes because of CMT.             In October 1997, Patten\n\nsuffered a back injury as a result of a fall unrelated to CMT.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fFrom then through December, Patten was transferred to two new\n\npositions because she was restricted from various tasks, including\n\nstanding and lifting.     From January 2 through January 27, 1998,\nPatten took a leave of absence for a heart condition that was\n\ninduced by caffeine. From February 24 through June 1, 1998, Patten\n\ntook another leave of absence, related to CMT, for surgery to\ndiminish the \"hammer toes\" syndrome that she had been experiencing.\n\n       When she returned to work at the beginning of June, Patten was\n\nrestricted to only four hours of work per day and she could stand\n\nduring only one of those hours.    Patten informed Theresa Barrows,\n\nthe personnel manager, of these limitations and was assigned to an\n\nalternate position for one month, after which she returned to a\n\ncashier's position.\n       Patten alleged that on the day she returned to work, she\n\noverheard Barrows, Gerald Tyler, the store’s manager, and Paula\n\nCarey, the assistant store manager, having a conversation about\nher.     Patten recalled hearing one of them make the following\n\nremarks: \"We know Shawnee has a disability, but we’re just tired of\n\nthis. We’re tired of her, and we just don’t feel that she needs to\n\nbe here.\"\n\n       Between June 27 and July 19, Patten missed six days of work,\n\nleft early on another day (without justification), and called in\n\nsick one day.    On July 19, Patten arrived at work, but felt ill.\n\nAfter she asked to be excused, Carey called Patten to her office\n\nand allegedly stated: \"We understand that you have health problems.\n\nWe understand that you are disabled, but we don’t want you working\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fin this store.\"     When Patten asked if she was being fired because\n\nof her disability, Carey allegedly responded, \"you may take it as\n\nyou want, but you are not working here.\"\n     Appellant sued Wal-Mart for discriminating against her on the\n\nbasis of her disability, in violation of the ADA and the MHRA, and\n\nthe case proceeded to trial.           All of Patten's allegations were\ndenied    by    management    personnel.       Carey    testified   that    she\n\nterminated      Patten’s      employment     because    of    non-CMT-related\n\nattendance problems that had developed during Patten’s final weeks\n\nat Wal-Mart.      Tyler testified that Patten was fired for \"gross\n\nmisconduct of the attendance policy.\"\n\n     At   the    conclusion     of   the    evidence,   the   district     court\n\npertinently instructed the jury on termination as follows:\n     Termination. To succeed on her claim, Shawnee Patten has\n     the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence\n     that her disability was the determining factor in the\n     decision to discharge her . . . .\n\n     To prove that a disability was the determining factor in\n     the decision to terminate her, Shawnee Patten is not\n     required to prove that it was the sole motivation or the\n     primary motivation for Wal-Mart’s decision, but she must\n     prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her\n     disability actually made the difference in causing Wal-\n     Mart to terminate her employment.\n\n     The jury concluded that although appellant is disabled under\n\nfederal and state law, her disability was not the determining\n\nfactor in Wal-Mart’s decision to discharge her. It therefore found\n\nin Wal-Mart’s favor.         This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f                              II.    Discussion\n\nA.   The Contested Jury Instruction\n\n     Appellant     contends   that    the    district    court    incorrectly\ninstructed the jury that her supervisor’s discriminatory animus had\n\nto be \"the determining factor,\" rather than \"a motivating factor,\"\n\nin the decision to terminate her.            We review a contested jury\ninstruction de novo, Ponce v. Ashford Presbyterian Cmty. Hosp.,\n\n238 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2001), and begin by looking briefly at\n\nthe crowded landscape of discrimination cases.\n\n        These cases fall into two general categories.                  The more\n\ncommon     genre   involves   evidence      of    discrimination       that   is\n\ncircumstantial.      In such cases the burden-shifting analysis of\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973),\napplies.     For our purposes, it is enough to say here that after\n\nplaintiff and defendant bear their preliminary burdens, plaintiff\n\nbears     the   ultimate   burden     of    proving     that     the    alleged\ndiscriminatory action was the determining factor in an adverse\n\nemployment action.\n\n        The second and less common type involves direct evidence,\n\nevidence    that   unambiguously     implicates    an   age    discrimination\n\nmotive.     Where such evidence exists, a mixed-motive analysis\n\napplies; that is, a plaintiff's burden is tempered so that she need\n\nprove only that the discriminatory action was a motivating factor\n\nin an adverse employment decision.1         The defendant then may \"assert\n\n     1\n        We need not get into the question of whether mixed-motive\nanalysis is available on strong circumstantial evidence of\ndiscrimination. See Weston-Smith v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., 282\n\n                                      -5-\n\fan affirmative defense, bearing the burdens of production and\n\npersuasion that it <would have taken the same action in the absence\n\nof the impermissible motivating factor.'\" Weston-Smith v. Cooley\n\nDickinson Hosp., 282 F.3d at 64 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n5(g)(2)(B)).2\n\n     Direct     evidence,   which   \"consists   of   statements   by     a\ndecisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear\n\nsquarely on the contested employment decision,\"       Febres, 214 F.3d\n\nat 60, opens the door to a mixed motive analysis.             The high\n\nthreshold for this type of evidence requires that \"mere background\n\nnoise\" and \"stray remarks\" be excluded from its definition.            Id.\n\nat 61; see also Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc., 199 F.3d\n\n572, 580-81 (1st Cir. 1999) (concluding that the owner’s statement\nthat he did not \"need minorities . . . on the job\" could have been\n\neither discriminatory or a response to what \"he perceived as an\n\nunjustified attempt to impose some sort of quota system upon his\ncompany\").      \"A statement that can plausibly be interpreted two\n\ndifferent ways -- one discriminatory and the other benign -- does\n\nnot directly reflect illegal animus, and, thus, does not constitute\n\n\n\nF.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 2002). For present purposes, we will deal\nwith the case in terms of direct evidence. There was no strong\ncircumstantial showing of discrimination here.\n     2\n        This circuit has noted, but not resolved, the question of\nwhether that portion of the 1991 Civil Rights Act which amended\nTitle VII to provide for limited relief against defendants who\nwould have taken the same action even absent their discriminatory\nmotive, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), applies to cases under\nthe ADA. See Thomas v. Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist., 150 F.3d 31,\n42 n.6 (1st Cir. 1998). Giving plaintiff the benefit of the doubt,\nwe assume arguendo that the 1991 Act standards would apply.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdirect     evidence.\"    Id.    at   583.        Hence,   \"direct    evidence    is\n\nrelatively rare.\"       Id. at 580.         To be sure, that burden is not\n\ninsurmountable.         For    example,     in   Febres,     we   concluded    that\nplaintiff presented direct evidence where an employer’s criteria\n\nfor   an   employment    decision     involved        \"job   performance,     union\n\nidentification, and 'in some cases, the age.’\" 214 F.3d at 59.\n      Patten argues that the two sets of comments by her supervisors\n\nreferring to her disability, see supra at 3-4, constitute direct\n\nevidence and thus take her out of the McDonnell Douglas framework.\n\nNone of these statements constitutes direct evidence, however. Our\n\nstandard for direct evidence requires statements that are not\n\n\"inherently ambiguous,\" Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583.                   We require\n\nstatements that give us a \"high degree of assurance\" that a\ntermination was attributable to discrimination.                     Id. at 580.\n\nNeither of the sets of statements in this case meets this test.\n\nBoth are subject to the interpretation that management fully\nunderstood      that     appellant        had     a    disability     but     could\n\nnot further abide appellant's gross and repeated absenteeism.                     A\ndecisionmaker’s mentioning of a disability in the context of an\n\nadverse employment action cannot, without more, constitute direct\n\nevidence of discrimination.3          Cf. id. at 583.\n\n      3\n         Given our determination that no direct evidence was\npresented here, we need not consider appellee’s contention that\nappellant waived her right to appeal on this issue by failing to\nobject to a portion of the magistrate judge’s recommended decision.\nSee Seahorse Marine Supplies v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., __ F.3d __, 2002\nWL 1431766, at *14 n. 15 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Appellant alternatively requests that we do away with the\ndistinction between circumstantial and direct evidence, and instead\n\n                                       -7-\n\fB.   Exclusion of the Maine Human Rights Commission’s Finding of\n     Discrimination\n\n     Appellant also assigns error to the district court’s refusal\n\nto admit into evidence a right-to-sue letter from the Maine Human\n\nRights Commission (\"MHRC\").          At the outset, we must determine the\nproper standard of review for the district court’s exclusion.\n\nAppellant    contends     that   because     the   district    court   routinely\n\nexcludes MHRC right-to-sue letters from the jury’s purview, its\n\ndecision applying that practice here must be reviewed de novo. For\n\nsupport     she   cites     S.E.C.    v.     Sargent,    229    F.3d    68,   79\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), in which we noted that \"the interpretation of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence is a question of law which we review de\nnovo.\"\n\n     Appellant’s argument is flawed in that the district court’s\n\nexclusion did not involve an interpretation of those rules.                   We\ncannot discern a material difference between the district court’s\n\npractice of excluding these types of letters in other cases and its\n\ndecision to apply that practice here.              At bottom, the question is\n\none of relevancy and prejudice under Rule 403,4 and it is well-\n\nsettled that abuse of discretion is the proper standard to be\n\napplied to such issues.          See, e.g., Gen’l Elec. Co. v. Joiner,\n\n\n\n\nemploy a single standard of proof for all evidence. Although we\nare not unsympathetic to the plight of a civil rights plaintiff\nattempting to prove her case, the abundance of caselaw in this\ncircuit requires that we do not reconsider that duality here.\n     4\n       Rule 403 allows a court to exclude admissible evidence that\nis more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f522 U.S. 136, 141 (1997); United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278,\n\n284 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     The MHRC right to sue letter pertinently stated:\n     The Commission has conducted an investigation of\n     the . . . complaint of discrimination and has determined\n     that there are reasonable grounds to believe that\n     unlawful discrimination has occurred. The decision was\n     based on information received during the course of\n     investigation    of   the   complaint    including   the\n     Investigator’s Report, any written submissions, and any\n     oral presentations made.\n\n     Pursuant to § 4612(3) of the Maine Human Rights Act, the\n     Commission will endeavor to resolve the reasonable\n     grounds determination. A proposed Conciliation Agreement\n     will be forthcoming from the Commission’s Compliance\n     Officer. If no settlement is reached, the Maine Human\n     Rights Act authorizes the filing of a civil action in\n     Superior Court. * * * The Maine Human Rights Act provides\n     that you may pursue this matter on your own.\n\n     Appellant asks us to adopt a rule that \"reasonable grounds\nfindings from the MHRC are per se admissible.\"    For support, she\n\ncites Plummer v. Western International Hotels Co., 656 F.2d 502,\n\n505 (9th Cir. 1981). The Ninth Circuit’s determination of per se\nadmissibility of EEOC determinations cannot be squared with our\n\nprecedent.   In Smith v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 877\n\nF.2d 1106, 1113 (1st Cir. 1989), we considered the admissibility of\n\nEEOC findings, and agreed with the Seventh Circuit that \"a rule of\n\nper se admissibility of the investigative file would clearly\n\nundercut the district court’s function as independent fact-finder.\n\nThe better approach is to permit the district court to determine,\n\non a case-by-case basis, what, if any, EEOC investigator materials\n\nshould be admitted at trial.\"     Id. (quoting Tulloss v. Near N.\n\nMontessori Sch., 776 F.2d 150, 154 (7th Cir. 1985).      Moreover,\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fSmith      concerned   the    admissibility    of   an   investigative    file,\n\ncontaining       statements     and    other   evidence    of   the    alleged\n\ndiscrimination.        Here, the right-to-sue letter states only a\nconclusory       probability    of    discrimination,    unsupported     by   any\n\nrelevant facts, and thus on its surface lacks the probative content\n\nof the excluded investigative file challenged in Smith.\n\n        The district court's routine exclusion of the MHRC letter is\n\nconsistent with Smith's stated approach.            It seems to us that the\n\ndistrict court's exclusion reflects a tacit balancing under Rule\n\n403.       See United States v. De La Cruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 n. 1 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).       Although the findings of a fact-finding agency are\n\nentitled to deference, see Blizard v. Fielding, 572 F.2d 13, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1978), we cannot say that the district court abuses its\ndiscretion when it concludes that such an agency determination,\n\nunaccompanied by relevant facts, tends to be more prejudicial than\n\nprobative.5\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Appellant alternatively argues that even without a per se\nrule, the district court’s exclusion of the MHRC letter constitutes\nreversible error. Appellant does not explain how this letter, if\nadmitted, would have changed the jury’s outcome. See United States\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

The more common genre involves evidence of discrimination that is circumstantial. In such cases the burden-shifting analysis of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies.

The high threshold for this type of evidence requires that \"mere background noise\" and \"stray remarks\" be excluded from its definition. <i>Id.</i> at 61; <i>see also Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 572, 580-81 (1st Cir.1999) (concluding that the owner's statement that he did not \"need minorities ... on the job\" could have been either discriminatory or a response to what \"he perceived as an unjustified attempt to impose some sort of quota system upon his company\"). \"A statement that can plausibly be interpreted two different ways &#8212; one discriminatory and the other benign &#8212; does not directly reflect illegal animus, and, thus, does not constitute direct evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 583. Hence, \"direct evidence is relatively rare.\" <i>Id.</i> at 580. To be sure, that burden is not insurmountable. For example, in <i>Febres,</i> we concluded that plaintiff presented direct evidence where an employer's criteria for an employment decision involved \"job performance, union identification, and `in some cases, the age.'\" 214 F.3d at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patten argues that the two sets of comments by her supervisors referring to her disability, <i>see supra</i> at 24, constitute direct evidence and thus take her out of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. None of these statements constitutes direct evidence, however. Our standard for direct evidence requires statements that are not \"inherently ambiguous,\" <i>Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 583. We require statements that give us a \"high degree of assurance\" that a termination was attributable to discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 580. Neither of the sets of statements in this case meets this test. Both are subject to the interpretation that management fully understood that appellant had a disability but could not further abide appellant's gross and repeated absenteeism. A decisionmaker's mentioning of a disability in the context of an adverse employment action cannot, without more, constitute direct evidence of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Cf. id.</i> at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Exclusion of the Maine Human Rights Commission's Finding of Discrimination</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also assigns error to the district court's refusal to admit into evidence a right-to-sue letter from the Maine Human Rights Commission (\"MHRC\"). At the outset, we must determine the proper standard of review for the district court's exclusion. Appellant contends that because the district court routinely excludes MHRC right-to-sue letters from the jury's purview, its decision applying that practice here must be reviewed de novo. For support she cites <i>S.E.C. v. Sargent,</i> 229 F.3d 68, 79 (1st Cir.2000), in which we noted that \"the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law which we review de novo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's argument is flawed in that the district court's exclusion did not involve an interpretation of those rules. We cannot discern a material difference between the district court's practice of excluding these types of letters in other cases and its decision to apply that practice here. At bottom, the question is one of relevancy and prejudice under Rule 403,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and it is well-settled that abuse of discretion is the proper standard to be applied to such issues. <i>See, e.g., Gen'l Elec. Co. v. Joiner,</i> 522 U.S. 136, 141, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997); <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MHRC right to sue letter pertinently stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has conducted an investigation of the ... complaint of discrimination and has determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred. The decision was based on information received during the course of investigation of the complaint including the Investigator's Report, any written submissions, and any oral presentations made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to &#167; 4612(3) of the Maine Human Rights Act, the Commission will endeavor to resolve the reasonable grounds determination. A proposed Conciliation Agreement will be forthcoming from the Commission's Compliance Officer. If no settlement is reached, the Maine Human Rights Act authorizes the filing of a civil action in Superior Court. * * * The Maine Human Rights Act provides that you may pursue this matter on your own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asks us to adopt a rule that \"reasonable grounds findings from the MHRC are per se admissible.\" For support, she cites <i>Plummer v. Western International Hotels Co.,</i> 656 F.2d 502, 505 (9th Cir.1981). The Ninth Circuit's determination of per se admissibility of EEOC determinations cannot be squared with our precedent. In <i>Smith v. Massachusetts Institute</i> <i>of Technology,</i> 877 F.2d 1106, 1113 (1st Cir.1989), we considered the admissibility of EEOC findings, and agreed with the Seventh Circuit that \"a rule of per se admissibility of the investigative file would clearly undercut the district court's function as independent fact-finder. The better approach is to permit the district court to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what, if any, EEOC investigator materials should be admitted at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Tulloss v. Near N. Montessori Sch.,</i> 776 F.2d 150, 154 (7th Cir.1985)). Moreover, <i>Smith</i> concerned the admissibility of an investigative file, containing statements and other evidence of the alleged discrimination. Here, the right-to-sue letter states only a conclusory probability of discrimination, unsupported by any relevant facts, and thus on its surface lacks the probative content of the excluded investigative file challenged in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's routine exclusion of the MHRC letter is consistent with <i>Smith</i>'s stated approach. It seems to us that the district court's exclusion reflects a tacit balancing under Rule 403. <i>See United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 902 F.2d 121, 123 n. 1 (1st Cir.1990). Although the findings of a fact-finding agency are entitled to deference, <i>see Blizard v. Fielding,</i> 572 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1978), we cannot say that the district court abuses its discretion when it concludes that such an agency determination, unaccompanied by relevant facts, tends to be more prejudicial than probative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We need not get into the question of whether mixed-motive analysis is available on strong circumstantial evidence of discrimination<i>See Weston-Smith v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp.,</i> 282 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir.2002). For present purposes, we will deal with the case in terms of direct evidence.

Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 150 F.3d 31, 42 n. 6 (1st Cir.1998).

She asserts that the court incorrectly instructed the jury on her burden of proof and improperly excluded evidence of a state agency's finding of discrimination. Concluding that the district court did not err, we affirm the judgment in favor of Wal-Mart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (\"CMT\"), a disability similar in its effects to muscular dystrophy. Although the CMT does not prevent appellant from working, it substantially limits her ability to walk or stand for a long time. Because of the illness, she often has pains in her arms and legs, and has an unusual gait. Appellant's supervisors at Wal-Mart were aware of her disability from the time she first applied for a position there. During appellant's ten-month employment, Wal-Mart repeatedly accommodated her by approving long-term leaves of absence and transferring her to less-demanding positions when she felt the CMT prevented her from adequately doing her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout her tenure at Wal-Mart, which began on September 30, 1997, Patten's presence was marked by accommodations and absences, only sometimes because of CMT. In October 1997, Patten suffered a back injury as a result of a fall unrelated to CMT. From then through December, Patten was transferred to two new positions because she was restricted from various tasks, including standing and lifting. From January 2 through January 27, 1998, Patten took a leave of absence for a heart condition that was induced by caffeine. From February 24 through June 1, 1998, Patten took another leave of absence, related to CMT, for surgery to diminish the \"hammer toes\" syndrome that she had been experiencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When she returned to work at the beginning of June, Patten was restricted to only four hours of work per day and she could stand during only one of those hours. Patten informed Theresa Barrows, the personnel manager, of these limitations and was assigned to an alternate position for one month, after which she returned to a cashier's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Patten alleged that on the day she returned to work, she overheard Barrows, Gerald Tyler, the store's manager, and Paula Carey, the assistant store manager, having a conversation about her. Patten recalled hearing one of them make the following remarks: \"We know Shawnee has a disability, but we're just tired of this. We're tired of her, and we just don't feel that she needs to be here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between June 27 and July 19, Patten missed six days of work, left early on another day (without justification), and called in sick one day. On July 19, Patten arrived at work, but felt ill. After she asked to be excused, Carey called Patten to her office and allegedly stated: \"We understand that you have health problems. We understand that you are disabled, but we don't want you working in this store.\" When Patten asked if she was being fired because of her disability, Carey allegedly responded, \"you may take it as you want, but you are not working here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant sued Wal-Mart for discriminating against her on the basis of her disability, in violation of the ADA and the MHRA, and the case proceeded to trial.

We require statements that give us a \"high degree of assurance\" that a termination was attributable to discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 580. Neither of the sets of statements in this case meets this test. Both are subject to the interpretation that management fully understood that appellant had a disability but could not further abide appellant's gross and repeated absenteeism. A decisionmaker's mentioning of a disability in the context of an adverse employment action cannot, without more, constitute direct evidence of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Cf. id.</i> at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Exclusion of the Maine Human Rights Commission's Finding of Discrimination</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also assigns error to the district court's refusal to admit into evidence a right-to-sue letter from the Maine Human Rights Commission (\"MHRC\"). At the outset, we must determine the proper standard of review for the district court's exclusion. Appellant contends that because the district court routinely excludes MHRC right-to-sue letters from the jury's purview, its decision applying that practice here must be reviewed de novo. For support she cites <i>S.E.C. v. Sargent,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2000), in which we noted that \"the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law which we review de novo.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's argument is flawed in that the district court's exclusion did not involve an interpretation of those rules. We cannot discern a material difference between the district court's practice of excluding these types of letters in other cases and its decision to apply that practice here. At bottom, the question is one of relevancy and prejudice under Rule 403,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and it is well-settled that abuse of discretion is the proper standard to be applied to such issues. <i>See, e.g., Gen'l Elec.

A proposed Conciliation Agreement will be forthcoming from the Commission's Compliance Officer. If no settlement is reached, the Maine Human Rights Act authorizes the filing of a civil action in Superior Court. * * * The Maine Human Rights Act provides that you may pursue this matter on your own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asks us to adopt a rule that \"reasonable grounds findings from the MHRC are per se admissible.\" For support, she cites <i>Plummer v. Western International Hotels Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393062\"><a href=\"/opinion/393062/26-fair-emplpraccas-1292-27-empl-prac-dec-p-32131-9-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 505 (9th Cir.1981). The Ninth Circuit's determination of per se admissibility of EEOC determinations cannot be squared with our precedent. In <i>Smith v. Massachusetts Institute</i> <i>of Technology,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525211\"><a href=\"/opinion/525211/william-b-smith-v-massachusetts-institute-of-technology/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span>, 1113 (1st Cir.1989), we considered the admissibility of EEOC findings, and agreed with the Seventh Circuit that \"a rule of per se admissibility of the investigative file would clearly undercut the district court's function as independent fact-finder. The better approach is to permit the district court to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what, if any, EEOC investigator materials should be admitted at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Tulloss v. Near N. Montessori Sch.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460261\"><a href=\"/opinion/460261/ijya-tulloss-v-near-north-montessori-school-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 154 (7th Cir.1985)). Moreover, <i>Smith</i> concerned the admissibility of an investigative file, containing statements and other evidence of the alleged discrimination. Here, the right-to-sue letter states only a conclusory probability of discrimination, unsupported by any relevant facts, and thus on its surface lacks the probative content of the excluded investigative file challenged in <i>Smith.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's routine exclusion of the MHRC letter is consistent with <i>Smith</i>'s stated approach. It seems to us that the district court's exclusion reflects a tacit balancing under Rule 403. <i>See United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540778\"><a href=\"/opinion/540778/united-states-v-jose-manuel-de-la-cruz-aka-jose-manuel-linares-de-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123 n. 1 (1st Cir.1990). Although the findings of a fact-finding agency are entitled to deference, <i>see Blizard v. Fielding,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353901\"><a href=\"/opinion/353901/17-fair-emplpraccas-149-16-empl-prac-dec-p-8175-margaret-m-blizard/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1978), we cannot say that the district court abuses its discretion when it concludes that such an agency determination, unaccompanied by relevant facts, tends to be more prejudicial than probative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We need not get into the question of whether mixed-motive analysis is available on strong circumstantial evidence of discrimination<i>See Weston-Smith v.
