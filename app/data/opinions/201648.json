Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Martin Bramson on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Christopher\nR. Donato, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 15, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.     Pro se plaintiff-appellant Martin Bramson\n\nappeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. § 2241 petition.      After\n\ncarefully reviewing the parties' briefs and the record, we affirm.\n\nWe briefly address Bramson's arguments.\n\n           First, Bramson claims that the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nmay not set the timing and amount of his restitution and fine\n\npayments   through   the   Inmate   Financial   Responsibility   Program\n\n(\"IFRP\") without submitting any such plan to the sentencing court\n\nfor its approval.      While district courts may not delegate to\n\nprobation or the Bureau of Prisons designation of the timing and\n\namount of court-ordered payments, see United States v. Merric, 166\n\nF.3d 406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that district court could\n\nnot delegate to probation the obligation of scheduling defendant's\n\ninstallment payments), this case is distinguishable.       Contrary to\n\nBramson's argument, the Maryland and New Jersey courts here did not\n\ndelegate the setting of payment schedules to probation or the\n\nBureau of Prisons.    Rather, both courts held that payment was due\n\nimmediately.   Thus, there was no improper delegation by the courts\n\nof their exclusive authority to determine a payment schedule.        The\n\nBureau of Prisons was merely using the IFRP to collect Bramson's\n\ncourt-ordered payments.     See, e.g., Matheny v. Morrison, 307 F.3d\n\n709, 712 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that Bureau of Prisons may\n\nadminister collection of payments through IFRP where sentencing\n\ncourt orders immediate payment); McGhee v. Clark, 166 F.3d 884, 886\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f(7th Cir. 1999) (same).     Moreover, as the lower court correctly\n\nnoted,   Bramson's    argument    regarding   the   collection   of   his\n\nrestitution payments is moot in light of the Maryland court's\n\namended judgment which limits the source of restitution funds to\n\nthe money already seized from Bramson at the time of his arrest.1\n\n          Next, Bramson argues that the Bureau of Prisons may not\n\ncollect fine payments when restitution remains outstanding.            He\n\ncites to 18 U.S.C. § 3612(c) which states that money received from\n\na defendant should be disbursed to pay restitution in full prior to\n\npaying other fines.    We deem this argument waived, as it was raised\n\nfor the first time in Bramson's objections to the magistrate's\n\nreport and recommendation.       Maine Green Party v. Maine, Sec'y of\n\nState, 173 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999).     The claim lacks merit in any\n\nevent.   While Bramson argues that the restitution order \"remains\n\nlegally undischarged,\" he essentially concedes that the collection\n\nof restitution from him is no longer an issue.             Indeed, the\n\nMaryland court's amended judgment makes clear that the only source\n\n\n     1\n       To the extent Bramson challenges his \"refusal status\" under\nthe IFRP, particularly its effect on his prison housing assignment,\nwe note that every court to consider the issue has upheld the IFRP\nagainst general, and due process, challenges, see Montano-Figueroa\nv. Crabtree, 162 F.3d 548, 548 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing cases);\nJohnpoll v. Thornburgh, 898 F.2d 849, 851 (2d Cir. 1990) (noting\nthat IFRP \"serves valid penological interests and is fully\nconsistent with the Bureau of Prisons' authorization . . . to\nprovide for rehabilitation and reformation\"), and find Bramson's\nclaim to be without merit, see Williams v. Faulkner, 837 F.2d 304,\n309 (7th Cir. 1988), aff'd sub nom. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n319 (1989) (stating that prisoners have no protected interest in\nparticular housing assignment).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fof funds to be applied to Bramson's restitution obligation is the\n\nmoney already seized from Bramson at the time of his arrest and\n\nthat       \"restitution   is   not    to   be    paid   pursuant   to    the   Inmate\n\nFinancial Responsibility Program.\" Thus, there is no money due and\n\nowing from Bramson as restitution.                 Accordingly, the Bureau of\n\nPrisons may properly collect money to satisfy Bramson's outstanding\n\nfine.\n\n               Finally, Bramson argues that the lower court erred in\n\nallowing the government an additional two months to respond to his\n\npetition. This claim lacks merit. While Bramson states that \"[n]o\n\nexplanation       was   offered      for   the   reason   for   the     delay,\"   the\n\ngovernment explained in its motion that it was \"in the process of\n\ngathering information necessary to file an answer or other response\n\nand need[ed] additional time to complete these assessments.\" There\n\nis no indication that these proffered reasons were not legitimate.\n\nIndeed, the government's response, in the form of a motion to\n\ndismiss/motion for summary judgment based on failure to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies, included 22 exhibits regarding Bramson's\n\nMaryland and New Jersey sentences, his participation in the IFRP,\n\nand his requests for administrative remedies.2               Also, while Bramson\n\nstates that the government's delay resulted in the lack of a \"level\n\n\n\n       2\n       The lower court did not address the government's exhaustion\nargument, ruling instead \"that the petitioner has been afforded the\nrelief sought, and that to the extent that the petition seeks more,\nit is without merit.\"\n\n                                           -4-\n\fjudicial playing field,\" Bramson does not explain how he was\n\nprejudiced by the delay or denied due process.        Further, while\n\nBramson argues that 28 U.S.C. § 2243 forbids an extension of time\n\nbeyond twenty days in § 2241 cases and that the rules governing §\n\n2254 cases are inapplicable, the § 2254 rules specifically state\n\nthat they may be applied by the district court to other habeas\n\npetitions.     See Rule 1(b) of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases.\n\nRule 4 provides that the \"the judge shall order the respondent to\n\nfile an answer or other pleading within the period of time fixed by\n\nthe court . . . .\"    Thus, the district court had the discretion to\n\nset a deadline beyond twenty days for a response.    See Bleitner v.\n\nWelborn, 15 F.3d 652, 653-54 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that Rule 4,\n\nwhich has force of superseding statute, loosened up deadline for\n\nresponses); Clutchette v. Rushen, 770 F.2d 1469, 1474 (9th Cir.\n\n1985) (noting that Rule 4 contains no fixed time requirement and\n\ngives district court discretion to grant appropriate deadline in\n\nhabeas cases).\n\n             The judgment of the district court is affirmed.   See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
