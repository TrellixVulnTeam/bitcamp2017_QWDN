Mejilla-Romero v. Holder, 600 F.3d 63 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n        Thereafter petitioner sought panel and en banc rehearing, arguing, inter alia, that the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") decision had not complied with the Department of\nHomeland Security's Guidelines for Children's Asylum Claims (1998) and the Guidelines for\nImmigration Court Cases Involving Unaccompanied Alien Children (2004). These Guidelines in\nturn are informed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees's (\"UNHCR\")\nGuidelines on Policies and Procedures in Dealing with Unaccompanied Minors Seeking Asylum\n(1997), and decisions based on those guidelines. Petitioner was supported by two briefs amici\ncuriae from (1) the UNHCR and (2) the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, Immigrant Child\nAdvocacy Project, National Immigrant Justice Center, Tahirih Justice Center, Professor Deborah\nAnker, Professor Rebecca Sharpless, and Professor David B. Thronson. The respondent has\nopposed rehearing.\n\n       Petitioner raised arguments regarding the Guidelines' child-sensitive approach in his brief\n\fto the BIA and in his Memorandum of Law to the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"). However, neither\nthe BIA nor the IJ explicitly addressed the arguments in their decisions. That was one of the\nmain arguments presented in the petition for rehearing. Petitioner also claimed that because of\nthe failure to follow the Guidelines the evidence submitted in support of his asylum claim was\nnot properly considered. Since petitioner's claims may implicate important issues of law and\npolicy, we are of the view that these arguments should be considered by the administrative courts\nin the first instance.\n\n        Accordingly, we vacate both the panel opinion and the BIA's decision and we remand this\ncase to the BIA. The BIA should undertake de novo consideration of petitioner's arguments and\nre-evaluate the record in their light. The parties should be given an opportunity for further\nbriefing on these issues, including briefing with further specificity which guidelines are claimed\nto have been transgressed. The BIA should also consider a remand to an IJ, in order that the IJ\ncan evaluate the testimony and supporting evidence in light of the Guidelines' standards\nregarding child asylum seekers.\n\n       The clerk of court shall provide to the BIA a copy of all filings as to the petition for\nrehearing. We do not retain jurisdiction and anticipate that the BIA and/or the IJ will issue a new\ndecision.\n\n       So ordered.\n\n\n\n\ncc:\nNancy Jean Kelly\nJohn Edward Willshire\nLaTia N. Bing\nJohn W.
