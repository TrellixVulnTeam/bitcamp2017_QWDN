Teresa   Torres-Martínez\n\n(\"Torres\") sued Miguel Pereira (Administrator of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment   of    Corrections,      \"Pereira\"),   Jaime    López   (Regional\n\nDirector of the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections, \"López\") and\n\nother Puerto Rico Department of Corrections (\"PRDOC\") personnel in\n\ntheir   personal     and   official     capacities    (collectively,     the\n\n\"Defendants\") for political discrimination and violations of her\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process rights. She also asserted various\n\nstate-law claims.     The district court granted summary judgment to\n\nDefendants on all claims.      Torres now appeals the entry of summary\n\njudgment on her political discrimination and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nclaims against Defendants in their personal capacities.                 After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n          Torres is a member of the New Progressive Party.               She\n\nbegan working for the Department of Corrections in January 1987 as\n\na Penal Records Technician. In 1992, Torres was appointed Director\n\nof the Penal Records Division at the Ponce Correctional Complex at\n\na salary of $1,145 per month.        In 1994, Torres was promoted to Head\n\nof Personnel/Human Resources Coordinator, a \"trust\" position in the\n\nPuerto Rico government,1 at a salary of $2,065 per month.            In 2000,\n\n\n\n1\n   A \"trust\" position is a job filled by political appointment in\nwhich the holder of the job serves at the discretion of the elected\ngovernment. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 1349-1350 (2000)\n(repealed 2004).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe job classifications in PRDOC were reorganized, and Torres was\n\nreclassified as a \"Human Resources Supervisor.\"         Torres appealed\n\nthe   reclassification,   and   her   title   was   restored   to   \"Human\n\nResources Coordinator.\"    In November 2000, the Popular Democratic\n\nParty defeated the New Progressive Party in the gubernatorial\n\nelections in Puerto Rico and took control of the government.          With\n\nthe change in administration, Torres was dismissed from her trust\n\nposition and was reinstated as a career employee in the Ponce\n\ndivision of PRDOC.2   López was her new supervisor.     Torres's career\n\nposition was reclassified as a \"Human Resources Coordinator,\" and\n\nshe received a salary increase to $2,256 per month.        According to\n\nTorres's job description, the Human Resources Coordinator:\n\n           performs executive level management work of\n           great responsibility and complexity including\n           planning,    coordinating,    directing,    and\n           supervising a division of the Human Resources\n           Office or a program or activities that are\n           highly complex and specialized and require the\n           application of broad understanding of the\n           field of human resources.     The employee may\n           act as technical or administrative assistant\n           to the Director of Human Resources in\n           comparable   areas   or    functions   in   the\n           Corrections Administration or may be in charge\n           of supervising personnel transactions for a\n           region.      He   or  she    receives   general\n           instructions from a superior and may supervise\n\n\n2\n    Under Puerto Rico law at the time that Torres alleges\ndiscrimination occurred, a career employee who was chosen to fill\na trust position had an absolute right to return to their career\nposition at the end of their term at the same salary and with the\nsame benefits they enjoyed before, and any benefits that may have\nbeen awarded to the civil service position subsequently. P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 3, § 1350(a) (2000) (repealed 2004).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            other personnel. The employee has discretion\n            to develop and execute the assigned tasks and\n            uses his or her judgment and criteria to\n            perform assigned work.\n\n            The job description also included twenty \"work examples,\"\n\nindicating      that   a   Human    Resources      Coordinator     \"[i]nterviews,\n\nrecommends, and selects personnel to be hired in his or her\n\ndivision\" and \"[p]repares various complex letters and reports\n\nrelated to the activities carried out in his or her division.\"\n\nTorres claims that between 2000 and 2004, a number of her official\n\nduties were performed by López and some of her co-workers.                         In\n\nparticular, Torres claims that she no longer \"[made] request[s] for\n\npersonnel     needs,\"      \"wr[ote]      relocation    or     transfer    letters,\"\n\n\"wr[ote] requests [for] merit steps,\" or \"[gave] orientation to new\n\nemployees.\"        Torres     conceded      that   these      functions    are    not\n\nexclusively     assigned      to   her    job,   and   that    López     could   have\n\nperformed some of these functions in his job.                    However, Torres\n\nclaims   that    she    was   \"left      without   duties,\"     and    resorted    to\n\nperforming clerical work.\n\n            Torres filed suit against Defendants in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico on October 25, 2004.\n\nDefendants filed a motion for summary judgment on February 10,\n\n2006, arguing that Torres had failed to make out a case of\n\npolitical discrimination or due process violations, and that in any\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fcase, they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment to Defendants on April 3, 2006.3\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\n          Torres appeals the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment on her political discrimination and due process claims.4\n\nWe review a grant of summary judgment \"de novo, construing the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving\n\nall reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"    Rochester Ford\n\nSales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that summary judgment\n\nmay be granted if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"A 'genuine' issue is one\n\nthat could be resolved in favor of either party, and a 'material\n\nfact' is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the\n\ncase.\"   Calero-Cerezo v. United States DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).   Furthermore, \"[a]s to issues on which the summary\n\njudgment target bears the ultimate burden of proof, she cannot rely\n\non an absence of competent evidence, but must affirmatively point\n\nto specific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic\n\n\n3\n   We do not reach the immunity issues because the district court\ncorrectly awarded summary judgment to the defendants on the First\nAmendment claim, and the Due Process claim fails to state a claim\nat all.\n4\n  Torres also argues that if either of these claims is reinstated,\nher supplemental state-law claims should also be reinstated.\n\n                                -5-\n\fdispute.\"     McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                         A. Political Discrimination\n\n              Employment decisions with respect to civil servants in\n\n\"career\" positions may violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nif     they    are    motivated       by     an     employee's      \"exercise        of\n\nconstitutionally      protected    First         Amendment   freedoms,\"      such    as\n\nmembership in or activism on behalf of a political party.                           Mt.\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 283-84\n\n(1977).        To    establish    a    prima        facie    case      of   political\n\ndiscrimination,      a    plaintiff    must       \"show   that   his    conduct     was\n\nconstitutionally         protected,    and        that    this   conduct      was     a\n\n'substantial factor' -- or to put it in other words, that it was a\n\n'motivating factor'\" in an adverse employment decision.                       Id. at\n\n287.    In order to be redressable, an alleged adverse employment\n\ndecision must result \"in conditions 'unreasonably inferior' to the\n\nnorm for that position.\"         Rosario-Urdaz v. Velazco, 433 F.3d 174,\n\n178 (1st Cir. 2006).        The plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion\n\non the prima facie case. Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago, 464 F.3d 29,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2006).        Once a plaintiff has made out a prima facie\n\ncase of political discrimination, the burden then shifts to the\n\nstate to show \"by a preponderance of the evidence that it would\n\nhave reached the same decision as to [plaintiff's employment] even\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fin the absence of the protected conduct.\"               Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n\n287.\n\n            Torres     has   not   established      a    prima     facie    case    of\n\npolitical discrimination because the evidence she submitted fails\n\nto show that she suffered an \"adverse employment decision.\"                        We\n\nbegin by noting that throughout the period during which Torres\n\nalleges   she    was    subject    to   political       discrimination,       Torres\n\nmaintained her position, the same or a substantially similar title,\n\nand her salary.        In fact, Torres received a salary increase that\n\nwas awarded to all career employees.            Thus, Torres's claim is not\n\nbased on her termination or any loss of benefits.\n\n            Torres claims instead that she was subject to a more\n\n\"subtle\" form of discrimination in that Defendants completely\n\ndeprived her of any work duties.              See, e.g., Rodríguez-Pinto v.\n\nTirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding that\n\nplaintiff     had    made    out   a    prima   facie       case    of     political\n\ndiscrimination where \"since his reassignment, plaintiff only has\n\nbeen assigned clerical tasks which take ten minutes a day to\n\nperform\").    However, Torres provides almost no evidence to support\n\nthis allegation, and many of her own statements contradict it.                      In\n\nTorres's own deposition, she claimed that López stripped her of\n\nonly   four     of   over    twenty-seven     duties.        The    evidence       and\n\ndepositions that Torres submitted in connection with her Opposition\n\nto Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment add little more to her\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fclaims. Gerardina Rosario Borrero, a secretary in Torres's office,\n\nstated   that   López    began    conducting   job   candidate   interviews.\n\nHowever, Rosario Borrero admitted that this was within the purview\n\nof López's job description, and stated only that she felt that\n\nLópez \"should make [Torres] aware [of the interviews] because she\n\nis the human resources coordinator.\"           Rosario Borrero also added\n\nthat López was supposed to ask Torres for copies of employee\n\nevaluations in writing, but that instead he would often verbally\n\nask   the   employee's     supervisor   for    the   evaluation.     Another\n\nemployee, Luis A. Blasini Rodríguez, indicated that he had heard\n\nrumors that Torres was not properly introduced at meetings, that\n\nTorres was no longer participating in \"new appointments,\" and that\n\nthe human resources office generally was no longer copied on salary\n\nchange reports. Carmen M. Martínez Bernard stated only that Torres\n\nwould assist her with her work when Torres did not have her own\n\nwork to do.     Finally, Gilda M. Santiago Franceschi stated that she\n\nbelieved    that   López    was    hiring     employees   without   Torres's\n\nparticipation.      Notably, Torres does not claim that any of the\n\nduties of which she was allegedly deprived were exclusive to her\n\nposition,5 and she admits that all of these duties were part of\n\nLópez's job description as well.\n\n\n5\n  In fact, Torres explicitly stated in her brief before this court\nthat \"Plaintiff agrees that the duties taken away from her could be\nperformed by, and fell within the authority of, other employees,\nincluding that of defendant-appellee [López].\" Appellant's Br. at\n18.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f            Thus, making all possible inferences in favor of Torres,\n\nthe most that she has shown is that her boss exercised his\n\nprerogative to perform three or four duties which he shared with\n\nher.    This is not a case where Torres states that her duties have\n\nbeen \"substantially narrowed.\" Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,\n\n889 F.2d 1209, 1219 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).            Nor does Torres\n\nclaim that \"all [her] work duties had been assigned to others\" for\n\na substantial period of time.       Díaz-Gandía v. Dapena-Thompson, 90\n\nF.3d 609, 615 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding that such a claim might\n\nconstitute an adverse employment decision for the purposes of the\n\nVeterans Reemployment Rights Act of 1968) (emphasis in original);\n\nsee also Acevedo-Luis v. Pagán, 478 F.3d 35 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting\n\nplaintiff's    allegations   that    he   was   subject   to   an   adverse\n\nemployment decision because \"he was assigned no substantive tasks,\n\nhad no one to supervise, was given no office space, and had only a\n\nfew menial duties\" for three and a half years).           Rather, López's\n\ndecision to exercise more of his duties left Torres with most of\n\nher original job functions and perhaps an occasional spell of free\n\ntime.    These perceived slights and alleged alterations in duties\n\nare not enough to demonstrate that Torres's working conditions were\n\n\"substantially inferior\" to those she enjoyed before the alleged\n\npolitical discrimination.    See Rosario-Urdaz v. Velazco, 433 F.3d\n\n174, 179 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding no adverse employment decision\n\nwhere an employee claimed she was deprived of a few employment\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fduties).   Because Torres did not suffer a cognizable \"adverse\n\nemployment decision,\" the district court was correct to grant\n\nDefendants summary judgment on the political discrimination claim.\n\n                       B. Due Process Violation\n\n           The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall\n\n\"deprive any person of . . . property, without due process of law.\"\n\nTorres does not claim to have been deprived of state employment,\n\nher title, or her salary; she claims only to have been deprived of\n\nduties pertaining to her position. Thus, \"[t]he threshold question\n\nwe must first address is whether [Torres] had a property interest\"\n\nin her job duties.   Vélez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea, 437 F.3d 145,\n\n155 (1st Cir. 2006).     We look to \"an independent source such as\n\nstate law\" to determine whether Torres had such an interest.\n\nFigueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bd. of Regents of State\n\nColls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)); see also Duriex-Gauthier\n\nv. López-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 11 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"The due process\n\nclaim turns on whether Duriex-Gauthier had a property interest in\n\nhis job, which is a question of Puerto Rican law.\").    The Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court has said that public employees have no property\n\ninterest in their job duties.   Consejo de Educación Superior de la\n\nUniversidad de P.R. v. Rosselló González, 137 P.R. Dec. 83, 110\n\n(1994); see also Rosado de Vélez v. Zayas, 328 F. Supp. 2d 202, 212\n\n(D.P.R. 2004) (\"[U]nder Puerto Rico law, public employees have a\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fproperty   interest    in   their   continued   employment,   not   in   the\n\nfunctions they perform.\"); accord Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,\n\n415 F.3d 127, 134 (1st Cir. 2005).         Therefore, in allegedly taking\n\naway some of Torres's job duties, Defendants have not deprived\n\nTorres of any property interest.       As such, plaintiffs have failed\n\nto state a claim of denial of due process.          See Kauffman v. P.R.\n\nTel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1176 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                             III. Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

In 2000, the job classifications in PRDOC were reorganized, and Torres was reclassified as a \"Human Resources Supervisor.\" Torres appealed the reclassification, and her title was restored to \"Human Resources Coordinator.\" In November 2000, the Popular Democratic Party defeated the New Progressive Party in the gubernatorial elections in Puerto Rico and took control of the government.

Once a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of political discrimination, the burden then shifts to the state to show \"by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to [plaintiff's employment] even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Mt.

In fact, Torres received a salary increase that was awarded to all career employees. Thus, Torres's claim is not based on her termination or any loss of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres claims instead that she was subject to a more \"subtle\" form of discrimination in that Defendants completely deprived her of any work duties. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado,</i> 982 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir.1993) (finding that plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of political discrimination where \"since his reassignment, plaintiff only has been assigned clerical tasks which take ten minutes a day to perform\"). However, Torres provides almost no evidence to support this allegation, and many of her own statements contradict it. In Torres's own deposition, she claimed that L&#243;pez stripped her of only four of over twenty-seven duties. The evidence and depositions that Torres submitted in connection with her Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment add little more to her claims. Gerardina Rosario Borrero, a secretary in Torres's office, stated that L&#243;pez began conducting job candidate interviews. However, Rosario Borrero admitted that this was within the purview of L&#243;pez's job description, and stated only that she felt that L&#243;pez \"should make [Torres] aware [of the interviews] because she is the human resources coordinator.\" Rosario Borrero also added that L&#243;pez was supposed to ask Torres for copies of employee evaluations in writing, but that instead he would often verbally ask the employee's supervisor for the evaluation. Another employee, Luis A. Blasini Rodr&#237;guez, indicated that he had heard rumors that Torres was not properly introduced at meetings, that Torres was no longer participating in \"new appointments,\" and that the human resources office generally was no longer copied on salary change reports. Carmen M. Mart&#237;nez Bernard stated only that Torres would assist her with her work when Torres did not have her own work to do. Finally, Gilda M. Santiago Franceschi stated that she believed that L&#243;pez was hiring employees without Torres's participation. Notably, Torres does not claim that any of the duties of which she was allegedly deprived were exclusive to her position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and she admits that all of these duties were part of L&#243;pez's job description as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, making all possible inferences in favor of Torres, the most that she has shown is that her boss exercised his prerogative to perform three or four duties which he shared with her. This is not a case where Torres states that her duties have been \"substantially narrowed.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1219 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc). Nor does Torres claim that \"<i>all</i> [her] work duties had been assigned to others\" for a substantial period of time. <i>D&#237;az-Gand&#237;a v. Dapena-Thompson,</i> 90 F.3d 609, 615 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that such a claim might constitute an adverse employment decision for the purposes of the Veterans Reemployment Rights Act of 1968) (emphasis in original); <i>see also Acevedo-Luis v. Pag&#225;n,</i> 478 F.3d 35 (1st Cir.2007) (noting plaintiff's allegations that he was subject to an adverse employment decision because \"he was assigned no substantive tasks, had no one to supervise, was given no office space, and had only a few menial duties\" for three and a half years). Rather, L&#243;pez's decision to exercise more of his duties left Torres with most of her original job functions and perhaps an occasional spell of free time. These perceived slights and alleged alterations in duties are not enough to demonstrate that Torres's working conditions were \"substantially inferior\" to those she enjoyed before the alleged political discrimination. <i>See Rosario-Urdaz v. Velazco,</i> 433 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.2006) (finding no adverse employment decision where an employee claimed she was deprived of a few employment duties). Because Torres did not suffer a cognizable \"adverse employment decision,\" the district court was correct to grant Defendants summary judgment on the political discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B. Due Process Violation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \"deprive any person of ... property, without due process of law.\" Torres does not claim to have been deprived of state employment, her title, or her salary; she claims only to have been deprived of duties pertaining to her position. Thus, \"[t]he threshold question we must first address is whether [Torres] had a property interest\" in her job duties. <i>V&#233;lez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 437 F.3d 145, 155 (1st Cir.2006). We look to \"an independent source such as state law\" to determine whether Torres had such an interest. <i>Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)); <i>see also Duriex-Gauthier v. L&#243;pez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 11 (1st Cir.2001) (\"The due process claim turns on whether Duriex-Gauthier had a property interest in his job, which is a question of Puerto Rican law.\"). The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has said that public employees have no property interest in their job duties. <i>Consejo de Educaci&#243;n Superior de la Universidad de P.R. v. Rossell&#243; Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 137 P.R. Dec. 83, 110 (1994); <i>see also Rosado de V&#233;lez v. Zayas,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 202, 212 (D.P.R. 2004) (\"[U]nder Puerto Rico law, public employees have a property interest in their continued employment, not in the functions they perform.\"); <i>accord Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,</i> 415 F.3d 127, 134 (1st Cir.2005). Therefore, in allegedly taking away some of Torres's job duties, Defendants have not deprived Torres of any property interest. As such, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of denial of due process. <i>See Kauffman v. P.R. Tel.

Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres has not established a prima facie case of political discrimination because the evidence she submitted fails to show that she suffered an \"adverse employment decision.\" We begin by noting that throughout the period during which Torres alleges she was subject to political discrimination, Torres maintained her position, the same or a substantially similar title, and her salary. In fact, Torres received a salary increase that was awarded to all career employees. Thus, Torres's claim is not based on her termination or any loss of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Torres claims instead that she was subject to a more \"subtle\" form of discrimination in that Defendants completely deprived her of any work duties. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597138\"><a href=\"/opinion/597138/pedro-l-rodriguez-pinto-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1993) (finding that plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of political discrimination where \"since his reassignment, plaintiff only has been assigned clerical tasks which take ten minutes a day to perform\"). However, Torres provides almost no evidence to support this allegation, and many of her own statements contradict it. In Torres's own deposition, she claimed that L&#243;pez stripped her of only four of over twenty-seven duties. The evidence and depositions that Torres submitted in connection with her Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment add little more to her claims. Gerardina Rosario Borrero, a secretary in Torres's office, stated that L&#243;pez began conducting job candidate interviews. However, Rosario Borrero admitted that this was within the purview of L&#243;pez's job description, and stated only that she felt that L&#243;pez \"should make [Torres] aware [of the interviews] because she is the human resources coordinator.\" Rosario Borrero also added that L&#243;pez was supposed to ask Torres for copies of employee evaluations in writing, but that instead he would often verbally ask the employee's supervisor for the evaluation. Another employee, Luis A. Blasini Rodr&#237;guez, indicated that he had heard rumors that Torres was not properly introduced at meetings, that Torres was no longer participating in \"new appointments,\" and that the human resources office generally was no longer copied on salary change reports. Carmen M. Mart&#237;nez Bernard stated only that Torres would assist her with her work when Torres did not have her own work to do. Finally, Gilda M. Santiago Franceschi stated that she believed that L&#243;pez was hiring employees without Torres's participation. Notably, Torres does not claim that any of the duties of which she was allegedly deprived were exclusive to her position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and she admits that all of these duties were part of L&#243;pez's job description as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, making all possible inferences in favor of Torres, the most that she has shown is that her boss exercised his prerogative to perform three or four duties which he shared with her. This is not a case where Torres states that her duties have been \"substantially narrowed.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1219 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc). Nor does Torres claim that \"<i>all</i> [her] work duties had been assigned to others\" for a substantial period of time. <i>D&#237;az-Gand&#237;a v. Dapena-Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722531\"><a href=\"/opinion/722531/stanley-diaz-gandia-v-maria-rosa-dapena-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 615 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that such a claim might constitute an adverse employment decision for the purposes of the Veterans Reemployment Rights Act of 1968) (emphasis in original); <i>see also Acevedo-Luis v. Pag&#225;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202642\"><a href=\"/opinion/202642/acevedo-luis-v-zayas/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2007) (noting plaintiff's allegations that he was subject to an adverse employment decision because \"he was assigned no substantive tasks, had no one to supervise, was given no office space, and had only a few menial duties\" for three and a half years). Rather, L&#243;pez's decision to exercise more of his duties left Torres with most of her original job functions and perhaps an occasional spell of free time. These perceived slights and alleged alterations in duties are not enough to demonstrate that Torres's working conditions were \"substantially inferior\" to those she enjoyed before the alleged political discrimination. <i>See Rosario-Urdaz v. Velazco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202003\"><a href=\"/opinion/202003/rosario-urdaz-v-velazco/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 179 (1st Cir.2006) (finding no adverse employment decision where an employee claimed she was deprived of a few employment duties). Because Torres did not suffer a cognizable \"adverse employment decision,\" the district court was correct to grant Defendants summary judgment on the political discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B. Due Process Violation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \"deprive any person of ... property, without due process of law.\" Torres does not claim to have been deprived of state employment, her title, or her salary; she claims only to have been deprived of duties pertaining to her position. Thus, \"[t]he threshold question we must first address is whether [Torres] had a property interest\" in her job duties. <i>V&#233;lez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202056\"><a href=\"/opinion/202056/velez-rivera-v-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.2006). We look to \"an independent source such as state law\" to determine whether Torres had such an interest. <i>Figueroa-Serrano v.

Therefore, in allegedly taking away some of Torres's job duties, Defendants have not deprived Torres of any property interest. As such, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of denial of due process. <i>See Kauffman v. P.R. Tel.
