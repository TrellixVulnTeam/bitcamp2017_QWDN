Defendant-Appellant       Roy\n\nPizarro-Berríos (\"Pizarro\") pled guilty pursuant to a straight plea\n\n(i.e., without a plea agreement) to conspiracy to commit credit\n\ncard, bank fraud, and conspiracy to launder money. He now appeals,\n\narguing      that    his   plea   was   not   knowing     and    intelligent    and\n\nchallenging his sentence.          We affirm in part, vacate in part, and\n\nremand to the district court.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              Pizarro participated in a conspiracy involving the use of\n\ncounterfeit credit cards, forged checks, and false identification\n\ndocuments to purchase merchandise from various businesses.                     The\n\nmerchandise was used either for the conspirators' benefit or\n\nresold, with the earnings being distributed to members of the\n\nconspiracy. The conspiracy ran from December 2002 through November\n\n2003.     Pizarro's role in the conspiracy was to make purchases at\n\nlocal businesses using the counterfeit credit cards.1\n\n              In April 2003, Pizarro was arrested and put in state\n\ncustody after attempting to make a purchase at a supermarket in the\n\ntown of Canóvanas, Puerto Rico, using a forged check.                While being\n\nheld    in   state    custody,    Pizarro     gave   an   oral    statement    (the\n\n\n\n\n1\n    A more detailed discussion of the various aspects of the\nunderlying conspiracy is not necessary for a resolution of this\ncase.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f\"confession\")2 to Agent Israel Santiago-Monserrate (\"Santiago\") of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Police Department, discussing the details of the\n\nconspiracy and his involvement in it.                      Santiago transcribed the\n\nconfession       and    Pizarro       signed     the    document.          Pizarro    was\n\nincarcerated in state prison on July 7, 2003.                     On August 21, 2003,\n\nPizarro       entered   a   guilty     plea    to    the    state    charges   and    was\n\nsentenced to two years in prison.\n\n               Meanwhile,      the    other    conspirators         were   arrested    by\n\nfederal authorities.           On December 3, 2003, Pizarro was released\n\nfrom    state     prison    pursuant      to     a   writ    of     habeas   corpus    ad\n\nprosequendum       so   that    he     could   face     federal      charges   for    his\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy. On December 8, a federal grand jury\n\nreturned an indictment against the members of the conspiracy.\n\nCounsel was appointed for Pizarro on December 10.                      On January 28,\n\n2004,     a    twelve-count          superseding       indictment      issued.        The\n\nsuperseding indictment charged Pizarro with conspiracy to commit\n\ncredit card fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1029(a)\n\n(\"Count One\"); bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1344\n\n(\"Count Two\"); conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1) and (h) (\"Count Three\"); and identification\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(4) (\"Count Nine\").\n\n\n\n2\n   The parties argue about whether the statement was a confession,\na sworn statement, or simply a statement. For the sake of clarity,\nwe will refer to it as a \"confession,\" as we will also be\ndiscussing other statements Pizarro made.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f           According to the government, Pizarro spoke with federal\n\nagents prior to his federal indictment and indicated that he wanted\n\nto cooperate with the government. Some of these conversations were\n\nsummarized in what the FBI calls 302 forms.3           The government\n\neventually offered Pizarro a plea agreement, which he decided not\n\nto take after consulting with his counsel.           According to the\n\ngovernment, the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") handling\n\nthe case told Pizarro's counsel that none of Pizarro's statements\n\nsummarized in the 302 forms would be used at trial.\n\n           On February 24, 2004, Pizarro filed a motion for change\n\nof plea.   At a change of plea hearing held before the district\n\ncourt on March 1, 2004, Pizarro entered a straight guilty plea to\n\nCounts One through Three.    Count Nine was dismissed.4       Pizarro's\n\nPresentence Report (\"PSR\") assigned him a base offense level of 6.\n\nAfter   relevant   enhancements   and   reductions   were   calculated,\n\nPizarro's total offense level was 26.5      Combined with a Criminal\n\n\n3\n    302 forms are what the FBI calls reports its agents make\nsummarizing interviews with witnesses or suspects.\n4\n    Count Nine charged Pizarro with actions that occurred on\nJuly 21, 2003. However, as Pizarro was incarcerated at that time,\nthe government conceded that it had misidentified Pizarro as to\nCount Nine. The district court therefore dismissed the count at\nthe change of plea hearing.\n5\n   The PSR recommended a fourteen-level enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) because the offenses involved a loss in excess of\n$400,000; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(A)\nbecause the offenses involved more than ten but fewer than fifty\nvictims; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(3)\nbecause the offenses involved a theft from the person of another;\n\n                                  -4-\n\fHistory Category of II, the applicable Guidelines range was 70-87\n\nmonths' imprisonment.\n\n           The PSR referenced the confession Pizarro had provided to\n\nAgent Santiago, as well as the statements found in the 302 forms.\n\nUpon reading the PSR, Pizarro's counsel called the Probation\n\nOfficer,   Andrea   Cribben   (\"Cribben\").    Cribben   told   Pizarro's\n\ncounsel that she had received the confession from the case agent.\n\nAccording to Pizarro, his counsel also contacted AUSA Juan Milanés,\n\nwho said that he was unaware of the existence of the confession and\n\nthat he had not provided any 302 forms because he did not have to\n\nprovide them until trial.      On June 4, 2004, the government faxed\n\nthe 302 forms to Pizarro's counsel, and on June 8, the government\n\nfaxed the confession.\n\n           On June 9, 2004, Pizarro filed a motion arguing that the\n\ngovernment had violated Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure6 and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), because it\n\nhad not provided Pizarro with either the confession or the FBI 302\n\nforms before Pizarro pled guilty.       Although Pizarro stated in the\n\nmotion that the government's actions called into question the\n\n\na two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9) because the\noffenses involved the use of sophisticated means; a two-level\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(10) because the offenses\ninvolved the possession and use of device-making equipment; and a\ntwo-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) for acceptance of\nresponsibility.\n6\n  Rule 16 details the government's obligations to provide certain\ndocuments to the defendant.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fvoluntariness and intelligence of his guilty plea, he did not ask\n\nthat he be allowed to withdraw his plea; rather, he asked that the\n\ndistrict    court     adopt   his   interpretation     of   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            The government filed an opposition to Pizarro's motion on\n\nJune 16, 2004, stating that it never intended to use the 302 forms\n\nat trial and therefore did not have to disclose them under Rule\n\n16(a)(1)(A).    The government also stated that the case agent did\n\nnot   receive   the    confession   until   May   4,   2004,   after     he   had\n\ncontacted state police to gather documents to prepare the case for\n\npresentation.    As soon as the case agent received the confession,\n\nhe forwarded it to Cribben, who used it in the PSR.            The agent also\n\nsent the document -- which was in the Spanish language -- to a\n\ntranslator and forwarded a translated copy to the U.S. Attorney's\n\nOffice on June 7.        The confession was then faxed to Pizarro's\n\ncounsel the following day. According to the government, therefore,\n\nno one involved in the case either knew or could have known of the\n\nconfession's existence prior to May 4, 2004, meaning that the\n\nconfession could not have been given to Pizarro before he pled\n\nguilty on March 1, 2004.\n\n            Pizarro was sentenced on July 1, 2004. At the sentencing\n\nhearing, the district court denied Pizarro's motion regarding the\n\nalleged    discovery    violations.     The   court    accepted    the    PSR's\n\ncalculations, but gave Pizarro a three-level (instead of a two-\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\flevel) reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted\n\nin a Guidelines range of 63-78 months' imprisonment.          The district\n\ncourt sentenced Pizarro to 70 months' imprisonment as to Counts Two\n\nand Three and 60 months' imprisonment as to Count One, to be served\n\nconcurrently with each other and the state sentence.7         However, in\n\nits written judgment, the court stated that Pizarro's federal\n\nprison term would run consecutively to his state sentence. Pizarro\n\nnow appeals, arguing that his plea was not knowing and intelligent\n\nbecause the government failed to disclose the confession or the 302\n\nforms; that he should be re-sentenced pursuant to United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005); that his sentence included some\n\nimproperly applied enhancements; and that the written judgment\n\nshould be corrected so that Pizarro's federal prison term runs\n\nconcurrently with his state prison term, in accordance with the\n\ndistrict court's oral pronouncement of sentence.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          A.   Rule 16 Violations and Withdrawal of Plea\n\n          We   have   stated   that   a   \"district   court    may   allow\n\nwithdrawal [of a guilty plea] for 'a fair and just reason.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B)). Among the relevant factors\n\na court should consider are\n\n\n\n7\n   The court also sentenced Pizarro to three years of supervised\nrelease, a $1000 fine, and a $300 mandatory monetary assessment.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           whether a plea was voluntary, intelligent,\n           knowing and complied with Rule 11; the force\n           of the reasons offered by the defendant;\n           whether there is a serious claim of actual\n           innocence; the timing of the motion; and any\n           countervailing prejudice to the government if\n           the defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea.\n\nId.\n\n           Pizarro appears to argue that his guilty plea was not\n\nknowing and intelligent because of failures of the prosecutor to\n\ndisclose (allegedly in violation of Rule 16) both a confession and\n\nvarious   statements   given   by   Pizarro.   The   supposed   Rule   16\n\nviolations were raised in the district court but not as a reason\n\nfor withdrawing the plea.      So far as we can tell, Pizarro has not\n\nsought to withdraw his plea either in the district court or his\n\nbrief to this Court.\n\n           Further, Pizarro has never explained why the disclosure\n\nof his prior confession or statements would have caused him not to\n\nplead guilty.   If anything, disclosure would seem rather to have\n\nencouraged a guilty plea.      Of course, if Pizarro were asserting\n\nthat the government had withheld exculpatory evidence, this would\n\nbe quite a different matter, but there is no such suggestion.\n\n           About the best we can make out from the brief is that\n\nPizarro is not interested in a withdrawal of plea at all but may be\n\npressing the following conjecture: that if the government had\n\nturned over the confession and other statements at an earlier\n\nstage, counsel might have been able to persuade his client to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\faccept an earlier and better plea offer from the government.                      But\n\nthis argument, obviously resting on considerable conjecture, is not\n\nitself expressly developed in Pizarro's brief in this court or\n\nsupported with any precedent for such a use of Rule 16.\n\n               As it happens, it is uncontested that the federal agents\n\ndid not know about the confession until well after the plea.                       As\n\nfor the 302 forms, Pizarro makes no claim that at the time he pled\n\nguilty he was ignorant of the fact that he had made statements to\n\nthe FBI agents during various interviews.                   There is an argument\n\nthat the forms should have been disclosed based on Rule 16 language\n\nnot cited by the government, but we have no reason to resolve the\n\nmatter.    Pizarro has waived any argument that he should have been\n\npermitted to withdraw his guilty plea by not seeking to have the\n\nplea   withdrawn       before     the   district    court    and   not   making   any\n\ndeveloped argument in favor of such relief on appeal.\n\n               B.    Sentencing\n\n                        1.    Booker\n\n               In his initial brief, filed after the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), and our\n\ndecision in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), Pizarro argued that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated\n\nbecause the district court sentenced him based on facts that were\n\nnot    found    by    the    jury.      Pizarro    never    mentioned    Booker   (he\n\nmentioned Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fv.   Washington,     542    U.S.   296    (2004)),   never   claimed   that   he\n\npreserved a Booker error under Antonakopoulos, and never addressed\n\nthe likelihood that he would receive a more lenient sentence on\n\nremand.    Further, after filing his initial brief, Pizarro never\n\nsought leave to file any supplemental materials to make the above\n\narguments.    Instead, at oral argument, which occurred over a year\n\nafter Pizarro filed his initial appellate brief, Pizarro for the\n\nfirst time argued that he had preserved Booker error.\n\n           We have consistently held that, except in extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, arguments not raised in a party's initial brief and\n\ninstead raised for the first time at oral argument are considered\n\nwaived.    See, e.g., Piazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).        We will therefore not consider Pizarro's arguments\n\nmade for the first time at oral argument and will hold him to what\n\nhe argued in his brief.\n\n           In his brief, Pizarro argued that the district court\n\nviolated     his    Sixth   Amendment      rights    by   applying   sentencing\n\nenhancements based on facts not found by the jury.             We have already\n\nconsidered and rejected this argument on numerous occasions, and we\n\nreject it again in this case.            See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75\n\n(\"The [Booker] error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a\n\nsentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission\n\nby the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fmandatory Guidelines system.\").           We therefore reject Pizarro's\n\nrequest that he be re-sentenced under Booker.8\n\n                     2.   Amount of Loss Attributable to Pizarro\n\n          Pizarro also argues that the district court erred in\n\nfinding him responsible for over $400,000 in losses, which resulted\n\nin a fourteen-level enhancement. \"We review the district court's\n\ninterpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its\n\nfactual findings for clear error.\"         United States v. Bailey, 405\n\nF.3d 102, 113 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAlthough it is not entirely clear from Pizarro's brief, it appears\n\nthat he is making two arguments regarding the imposition of the\n\nenhancement:   (1)    the    district   court   erred   by   automatically\n\nattributing to him the amount of loss charged in Count Two of the\n\nindictment simply because he pled guilty to that count,9 and (2)\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence in the record to show that he\n\n\n\n8\n   In his brief, Pizarro mentions in passing that several of the\nenhancements found by the district court were inapplicable to his\ncase.    However, with two exceptions, discussed infra, these\narguments are made in such a perfunctory manner, buried within\nPizarro's discussion of the constitutionality of his sentence, that\nwe deem them waived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990) (stating that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\nare deemed waived\").\n9\n   Pizarro actually argues that the district court found that he\nwas responsible for the totality of the scheme. This is incorrect.\nThe evidence at sentencing was that the actual loss caused by the\nscheme was over $600,000, and the intended loss was over $1.5\nmillion. The district court found that Pizarro was responsible for\nover $400,000 in losses.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fwas responsible for over $400,000 in losses.           We deal with each in\n\nturn.\n\n          At   sentencing,   a   defendant    in   a   jointly   undertaken\n\ncriminal activity is liable for the harm resulting from acts\n\ndirectly attributable to him and for the harm resulting from the\n\nreasonably foreseeable acts of others taken in furtherance of the\n\njointly undertaken criminal activity.        See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1),\n\n(3).    However, the fact that a defendant has pled guilty to\n\ninvolvement in a jointly undertaken criminal activity does not\n\nautomatically mean that the defendant is responsible for all the\n\nlosses caused by the jointly undertaken criminal activity.              In\n\nUnited States v. Colón-Solís, 354 F.3d 101, 102 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\nthe defendant entered a straight guilty plea to a conspiracy\n\ninvolving more than five kilograms of cocaine.10 At sentencing, the\n\n\n10\n    Colón-Solís involved a guilty plea to a conspiracy count,\nwhereas the instant case involves a guilty plea to a substantive\ncount (bank fraud). However, we do not think the analysis changes.\nThe reason has to do with the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344,\nand the relevant guideline, U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.\n\n     18 U.S.C. § 1344 defines bank fraud as \"a scheme or artifice.\"\nUnder U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1), a defendant is liable for all acts\ndirectly attributable to him and \"in the case of a jointly\nundertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or\nenterprise . . . whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all\nreasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance\nof the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)\n(1)(B) (emphasis added). In accordance with the statute, Count Two\ncharged Pizarro and others with a scheme and artifice to defraud\ncertain financial institutions. Thus, Count Two qualifies as a\n\"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" for purposes of U.S.S.G.\n§ 1B1.3. No one has argued that $400,000 in losses resulted from\nacts directly attributable to Pizarro. Therefore, in determining\n\n                                  -12-\n\fdistrict court found that the defendant was responsible for five or\n\nmore kilograms of cocaine, based solely on the defendant's plea.\n\nId.   We found that \"automatically attributing to the [defendant]\n\nthe full amount of drugs charged in the indictment and attributed\n\nto the conspiracy as a whole\" was error.        Id. at 103.   We therefore\n\nvacated the sentence, stating that, in the drug conspiracy context,\n\n\"the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug\n\namounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\"          Id.\n\nIn subsequent cases, we have applied Colón-Solís to fraud cases.\n\nSee United States v. Rodríguez-González, 433 F.3d 165, 168 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).      It is therefore clear that, in cases involving a\n\njointly undertaken criminal activity, a district court must make an\n\nindividualized     determination    regarding     the   amount   of   loss\n\nattributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, a defendant, and may\n\nnot rely solely on what was charged in the jointly undertaken\n\ncriminal activity count of an indictment, even if the defendant\n\nentered a guilty plea.\n\n          We are initially troubled by this case because it appears\n\nthat the district court based its finding at least in part on the\n\nfact that Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, which alleged his\n\ninvolvement in a scheme to defraud different financial institutions\n\nof over $400,000.     For example, the court stated that \"I notice\n\n\nthe amount of loss attributable to Pizarro, the district court was\nrequired to determine which acts taken by others in furtherance of\nthe scheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fthat the defendant pled guilty to Count 2 which alleged that the\n\nloss was in excess of $400,000.      So why are we wasting time?        He\n\nadmitted it.    That's it.   It is the same as if he had gone to trial\n\nand was found guilty as to that amount.\"        However, elsewhere the\n\ncourt indicated that it had to make a finding as to the amount\n\nreasonably foreseeable to Pizarro based on the evidence as it\n\napplied to Pizarro.      For example, the court stated: \"I told you\n\nthat I have to find what is the reasonable [sic] foreseeable amount\n\nof the harm, and that's what we are doing here.\"         The court also\n\nstated that \"[t]he fact is that the intended loss that it is\n\nreasonably foreseeable, all the machines, all of this sophisticated\n\nmeans, then that's what I have to decide, what was reasonably\n\nforeseeable to him.\"     (Emphasis added).11\n\n           Having reviewed the record, we believe that the district\n\ncourt made its finding that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in\n\nlosses   for   two   reasons:   1)   the   evidence   presented   by   the\n\ngovernment, and 2) the fact that Pizarro had pled guilty to a\n\nscheme involving over $400,000.      The first reason is permissible\n\n\n\n11\n   We note that the government stated several times that the issue\nbefore the court was whether the losses caused by his others in the\nscheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro.       While this is\nobviously not conclusive on the reasoning of the district court, we\nfind it relevant.    If, for example, the government had simply\nargued that, because Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, he was\nresponsible for $400,000 in losses, that would make it more\nprobable that the district court had simply attributed the amount\nof loss in the indictment to Pizarro without an individualized\ndetermination.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbut the second is an error of law under our precedent.          This\n\nconclusion is borne out by the court's pronouncement of sentence:\n\n          As the offense involved a loss in excess of\n          $400,000, I do find that in this case, there\n          has been evidence that the loss exceeded\n          $400,000, and also I find that the defendant\n          pled guilty to the specific amount as charged\n          in Count 2, that is bank fraud in excess of\n          $400,000, so that's why the Court finds the\n          offense involved in excess of $400,000 . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).   We therefore conclude that the district court's\n\ndecision to find Pizarro responsible for over $400,000 in losses\n\nwas based in part on an error of law.\n\n          However, that does not mean that we must automatically\n\nremand for re-sentencing.   In Colón-Solís, our decision to remand\n\nwas based on the fact that the district court's sole foundation for\n\nfinding the defendant responsible for greater than five kilograms\n\nof cocaine was an error of law: that the drug amount charged in the\n\nindictment and attributed to the conspiracy was automatically\n\nattributable to the defendant.    354 F.3d at 102-03.   We also noted\n\nthat the record was barren of any evidence as to the drug amounts\n\ndirectly attributable to, or foreseeable by, the defendant. Id. at\n\n103.   The instant case presents a different situation, as the\n\ndistrict court's decision is not based solely on an error of law.\n\nIf there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation\n\nfor the court's finding, the error would be harmless and there\n\nwould be no reason to remand to the district court when the result\n\nwill be the same.    We therefore turn to whether there is enough\n\n                                 -15-\n\fevidence to show that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in\n\nlosses.   We conclude that there is.\n\n            As we noted above, a defendant in a jointly undertaken\n\ncriminal activity is liable for all losses directly attributable to\n\nhim and for all losses resulting from reasonably foreseeable acts\n\ncommitted by others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken\n\ncriminal activity.    In the instant case, it is undisputed that the\n\namount of loss directly attributable to Pizarro was around $21,000,\n\nand that the amount of actual loss attributable to the entire\n\nscheme was over $600,000.     The issue, then, is whether Pizarro\n\ncould have reasonably foreseen the losses caused by others involved\n\nin the scheme such that he should be held responsible for $400,000\n\nin losses.\n\n            We have stated that, in making the above determination,\n\na court must first \"determine what acts and omissions of others\n\nwere in furtherance of the defendant's jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity.    This task requires the court to ascertain what activity\n\nfell within the scope of the specific conduct and objectives\n\nembraced by the defendant's agreement.\"        United States v. LaCroix,\n\n28 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1994).         The court must then \"determine\n\nto what extent others' acts and omissions . . . would have been\n\nforeseeable by a reasonable person in defendant's shoes at the time\n\nof his or her agreement.\"    Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f            The acts of Pizarro's co-schemers were within the scope\n\nof Pizarro's agreement.      Pizarro argues that he only had an\n\nagreement with the leader of the scheme, Angel Lacén-de Jesús\n\n(\"Lacén\"), to make purchases.     However, the evidence belies this\n\nargument.     Under the Guidelines, \"the court may consider any\n\nexplicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the\n\nconduct of the defendant and others.\"    U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, comment.\n\n(n.2).    Here, the evidence shows that Pizarro implicitly agreed to\n\nbe a part of the entire scheme.     Pizarro was part of the scheme\n\nfrom its inception and knew the leaders of the scheme well.      He\n\ngrew up with one of the leaders, Lacén, and also served as his\n\nbodyguard before and up to the point that the scheme began.\n\nPizarro admitted that he was paid $200 a day to guard Lacén \"while\n\nhe would do his work, which was the counterfeiting of credit\n\ncards.\"    Thus, even before he joined, Pizarro knew what Lacén was\n\ndoing and planning.    Pizarro also admitted that he knew the other\n\nleader of the scheme, Eric Adorno-Rosario (\"Adorno\"), and knew that\n\nAdorno and Lacén were partners in the counterfeit credit card\n\noperation. He also admitted that, after serving as a bodyguard for\n\nLacén, he became a purchaser, \"which is the person who goes\n\nshopping with the cards that [Lacén] would make and program.\"\n\n            This is not a case where a defendant agrees to make a\n\none-time transaction for a scheme and gets caught.    Here, Pizarro\n\nstated that he was paid $100-$500 per day and that he worked a few\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fdays a week.        There was also evidence that others accompanied\n\nPizarro to the stores, so he knew that others were involved in the\n\nscheme.   Given all of this evidence, we find that the acts of\n\nothers in furtherance of the scheme were within the scope of an\n\nimplicit agreement that Pizarro made.\n\n          We now turn our attention to what losses were reasonably\n\nforeseeable    to    Pizarro.    Given   the   evidence   presented   at\n\nsentencing, we conclude that the district court did not err in\n\nfinding that $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro.          We\n\nbase this finding on Pizarro's knowledge of the inner details of\n\nthe scheme.\n\n          In LaCroix, we stated that:\n\n          foreseeability may be established . . . by a\n          defendant's knowledge of the nature and extent\n          of    a   conspiracy    in    which   he    is\n          involved . . . . It is both good law and good\n          logic that a defendant's awareness of the\n          inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is\n          participating is germane to, and often highly\n          probative of, accomplice attribution . . . .\n          Such knowledge frequently will suffice to\n          prove the defendant's ability to foresee the\n          acts of coconspirators.\n\n28 F.3d at 229.      The instant case presents an example of what we\n\ndiscussed in LaCroix.       As we noted above, Pizarro was with the\n\nscheme from the beginning.      He knew the leaders of the scheme and\n\nthe details of their roles in the scheme.       He also knew others in\n\nthe scheme.    Further, Pizarro knew details about how the leaders\n\nmade the counterfeit credit cards, was able to give details about\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fhow the programs used in making the cards were accessed, and knew\n\nwhere the leaders stored their computers. He knew how the machines\n\nworked, and also knew that the leaders made not just counterfeit\n\ncredit cards, but also counterfeit checks and fake licenses.                He\n\nalso knew that the leaders got their computers from a man named\n\nFrancisco, and stated that Francisco was able to obtain equipment\n\n\"to commit all types of fraud.\"               Further, in his role as a\n\npurchaser, Pizarro knew exactly why he was making the purchases.\n\nHe admitted that every few days he would change businesses where he\n\nmade   purchases   in    order   to     avoid   being   identified    by    an\n\nestablishment's personnel.        In sum, while his actual acts in\n\nfurtherance of the scheme only involved bodyguard duties and making\n\npurchases, Pizarro was intimately acquainted with the details of\n\nthe scheme.   We therefore hold that the district court correctly\n\nfound that the loss of $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable by\n\nPizarro.\n\n           Pizarro attempts to get around these difficulties by\n\nmaking two arguments: (1) that his role was minor and that he only\n\nparticipated in exchange for drugs, and (2) that he did not\n\nparticipate in the scheme once he went to jail in July 2003.                We\n\nreject both of these arguments.              First, it is settled that a\n\ndistrict   court   may   correctly     attribute    \"the   entire    loss   to\n\nappellant\" even considering \"the fact that he may have played only\n\na supporting role.\"      LaCroix, 28 F.3d at 231.       Here, the fact that\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fPizarro only acted in a supporting role in no way means that the\n\nlosses stemming from the jointly undertaken criminal activity were\n\nnot reasonably foreseeable to him, especially given his knowledge\n\nof the inner workings of the scheme. Further, although Pizarro was\n\nallegedly given drugs in exchange for his services, there was also\n\nevidence that he was paid between $100-$500 per day and worked two\n\nto three days per week.        In other words, he was not simply making\n\npurchases in exchange for drugs.\n\n              Second, Pizarro has presented absolutely no evidence that\n\nhe ever withdrew from the scheme.         We have stated that \"in order to\n\nwithdraw from a conspiracy, a conspirator must act affirmatively\n\neither   to    defeat   or   disavow    the   purposes   of   the   conspiracy.\n\nTypically, that requires either a full confession to authorities or\n\na communication by the accused to his co-conspirators that he has\n\nabandoned the enterprise and its goals.\"           United States v. Piper,\n\n298 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.              2002); see also United States v.\n\nRobinson, 390 F.3d 853, 882 (6th Cir. 2004) (stating that, even\n\nassuming that after his arrest the defendant was no longer an\n\nactive participant in the conspiracy, \"he is nonetheless presumed\n\nto be a continuing member, and is chargeable for the subsequent\n\nacts of co-conspirators, so long [as] the conspiracy was ongoing\n\nand [the defendant] did not establish his affirmative withdrawal\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\ffrom the conspiracy\").12        At sentencing, the prosecutor noted that\n\nPizarro   --   although    he    initially     gave   a   statement   to   the\n\nCommonwealth agent who arrested him            -- had not provided a \"full\n\nconfession\" and had been \"obstinate with respect to his culpability\n\nin this case.\"    In conclusion, Pizarro has not provided evidence\n\nthat he gave a full confession or informed others involved in the\n\nscheme that he was abandoning the scheme, and the fact that he was\n\nin jail does not in and of itself mean that he withdrew from the\n\nscheme.   See, e.g., Robinson, 390 F.3d at 882 (stating that \"a\n\ndefendant's arrest . . . does not qualify as an affirmative,\n\nvolitional act of withdrawal [from a conspiracy]\"); United States\n\nv. Melton, 131 F.3d 1400, 1405 (10th Cir. 1997) (stating that a\n\ndefendant's    arrest,    by    itself,   is   insufficient   to   constitute\n\nwithdrawal from a conspiracy).\n\n           We find that the district court did not commit clear\n\nerror in its finding that there was enough evidence to find Pizarro\n\nresponsible for over $400,000 in losses.              We base this finding\n\nprimarily on Pizarro's relationship with the leaders of the scheme\n\nand his knowledge of various intimate details of the scheme.                We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's decision to apply a fourteen-\n\nlevel enhancement to Pizarro's sentence.\n\n\n12\n   As we noted above in footnote 10, Count Two was not a conspiracy\ncount. Nevertheless, since Count Two alleged Pizarro's involvement\nin a scheme, we think the analysis regarding withdrawal from a\nconspiracy applies with equal force to withdrawal from a scheme to\ndefraud financial institutions.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f                     3.   Theft From The Person of Another Enhancement\n\n           Pizarro has also challenged a two-level enhancement of\n\nhis offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(3), which applies\n\n\"[i]f the offense involved a theft from the person of another,\" id.\n\nThis challenge is only dubiously preserved, as Pizarro devotes but\n\nhalf a paragraph to it and performs none of the spadework necessary\n\nto enable us to figure out precisely what is going on.                   But the\n\nenhancement clearly affects Pizarro's sentence, and it is easy to\n\nunderstand the thrust of what he is arguing once the guideline (and\n\nits accompanying commentary) is consulted.              In light of this, and\n\nto guide the future application of this particular guideline, it is\n\nuseful to say something about the issue.\n\n           At first blush, it looks like § 2B1.1(b)(3) does not\n\napply here at all.        Even if one could construe the text of the\n\nguideline as ambiguous, the commentary to the guideline makes it\n\nclear that the guideline is intended to apply to physical takings,\n\nnot to abstract forms of theft that take place far from the victim,\n\nlike credit card fraud.      The application note defines \"theft from\n\nthe person of another\" as \"theft, without the use of force, of\n\nproperty that was being held by another person or was within arms'\n\nreach\"   (emphasis    added),   and    it    provides    as   examples    \"pick-\n\npocketing and non-forcible purse-snatching, such as the theft of a\n\npurse from a shopping cart.\"      Id., comment. (n.1).         The background\n\nnote explains that such theft \"receives an enhanced sentence\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fbecause of the increased risk of physical injury\" that inheres in\n\nsuch activity.        Id., comment. (backg'd).\n\n               The case law on this particular guideline -- none of\n\nwhich is cited by Pizarro or the government -- is consistent with\n\nthe    view    that    the    guideline     targets   physical      and   therefore\n\npotentially violent (even if non-forcible) forms of theft.                       See\n\nUnited States v. Rizzo, 349 F.3d 94, 98, 100 (2d Cir. 2003); United\n\nStates v. Londono, 285 F.3d 348, 350-51, 353-54 (5th Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Jankowski, 194 F.3d 878, 885-86 (8th Cir. 1999).\n\nTo the extent Pizarro's PSR recommended this particular enhancement\n\nbased upon a contrary reading of § 2B1.1(b)(3), it was fairly\n\nevidently mistaken.\n\n               But the district judge was more discerning in his reading\n\nof the guideline.            Looking at the transcript of the sentencing\n\nhearing, it is apparent that the judge recognized immediately that\n\nsome    kind    of    physical    taking     was   required    to    trigger     this\n\nguideline, and said initially that he was \"going to eliminate that\"\n\nenhancement.         At that point, the AUSA intervened to explain that\n\nvictims'       \"[credit]     cards   were    being    taken\"   as    part   of   the\n\nconspiracy.       Pizarro's lawyer did not object (nor had he objected\n\nto the enhancement in his written objections to the PSR), and the\n\ndistrict court included the enhancement.\n\n               We have some basis for conjecturing that the AUSA,\n\ndoubtless innocently, was referring not to any physical theft of\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fcredit cards from the victims, but to the practice by which co-\n\nconspirators, employed at retail establishments, would take credit\n\ncards handed over voluntarily by customers (to pay for goods or\n\nservices) and surreptitiously swipe them through machines designed\n\nto \"steal\" sufficient information from the cards to permit them to\n\nbe copied.   The cards would then be returned to the owners; the\n\nonly theft was of the information stored on the credit cards'\n\nmagnetic stripes.     This was not made clear to the judge at the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n          If that is all that the AUSA meant when he said \"[credit]\n\ncards were being taken,\" then that form of theft falls just as much\n\noutside the guideline as the form of credit card fraud practiced by\n\nPizarro himself in his role in the conspiracy (using forged credit\n\ncards to purchase goods).   Such theft involves no physical taking\n\nand no appreciable risk of escalating to violence.   We do not know\n\nfor certain what the AUSA was referring to at the sentencing\n\nhearing, and therefore under the circumstances we do not know\n\nwhether the district court erred when it applied the enhancement.\n\nWe are therefore in no position to engage in plain error review\n\n(which, of course, would be all Pizarro is entitled to, since he\n\nfailed to raise this objection below).\n\n          Although counsel for Pizarro may have an explanation for\n\nhaving not pursued the objection below, this may well afford some\n\nbasis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, given a plain\n\n\n                                -24-\n\freading of the guideline commentary and the apparent lack of\n\nevidence that any credit cards were physically stolen.                     But of\n\ncourse this is a matter that must be raised by a § 2255 attack on\n\ncompetence of counsel, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and a matter we are\n\nnot in a position to address, except to say that, although we take\n\nno view on whether ineffective assistance occurred here, it is\n\npromising enough that if a habeas petition is filed, the court\n\nshould consider appointing counsel for Pizarro.\n\n            C.    Concurrent vs. Consecutive Sentences\n\n            As we have already noted, in its oral pronouncement of\n\nPizarro's    sentence,        the   district   court     stated   that   Pizarro's\n\nfederal prison term would run concurrently with the sentence he was\n\nserving for state convictions.           Nevertheless, the written judgment\n\nsaid that the sentences would run consecutively.                  The government\n\nconcedes that the case should be remanded so that the written\n\njudgment can be modified to agree with what the district court\n\nstated at the sentencing hearing.              See United States v. Muñiz, 49\n\nF.3d 36, 42 n.5 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Where, as in this case, the\n\ndistrict court's oral expression of its sentencing rationale varies\n\nmaterially       from   its    subsequent      written     expression    of   that\n\nrationale, appellate courts have tended to honor the former at the\n\nexpense of the latter.\").            We will therefore remand the case so\n\nthat this portion of the sentence may be corrected.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\f                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision not to allow Pizarro to withdraw his plea.      We vacate\n\nPizarro's sentence and remand to the district court so that the\n\nwritten judgment may be corrected to agree with the oral sentence.\n\n          Affirmed in part, Vacated in part, and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f",

We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro participated in a conspiracy involving the use of counterfeit credit cards, forged checks, and false identification documents to purchase merchandise from various businesses. The merchandise was used either for the conspirators' benefit or resold, with the earnings being distributed to members of the conspiracy. The conspiracy ran from December 2002 through November 2003. Pizarro's role in the conspiracy was to make purchases at local businesses using the counterfeit credit cards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, Pizarro was arrested and put in state custody after attempting to make a purchase at a supermarket in the town of Can&#243;vanas, Puerto Rico, using a forged check. While being held in state custody, Pizarro gave an oral statement (the \"confession\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to Agent Israel Santiago-Monserrate (\"Santiago\") of the Puerto Rico Police Department, discussing the details of the conspiracy and his involvement in it. Santiago transcribed the confession and Pizarro signed the document. Pizarro was incarcerated in state prison on July 7, 2003. On August 21, 2003, Pizarro entered a guilty plea to the state charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the other conspirators were arrested by federal authorities. On December 3, 2003, Pizarro was released from state prison pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <i>ad prosequendum</i> so that he could face federal charges for his involvement in the conspiracy. On December 8, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against the members of the conspiracy. Counsel was appointed for Pizarro on December 10. On January 28, 2004, a twelve-count superseding indictment issued. The superseding indictment charged Pizarro with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1029(a) (\"Count One\"); bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 1344 (\"Count Two\"); conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) and (h) (\"Count Three\"); and identification fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(4) (\"Count Nine\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Pizarro spoke with federal agents prior to his federal indictment and indicated that he wanted to cooperate with the government. Some of these conversations were summarized in what the FBI calls 302 forms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government eventually offered Pizarro a plea agreement, which he decided not to take after consulting with his counsel. According to the government, the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") handling the case told Pizarro's counsel that none of Pizarro's statements summarized in the 302 forms would be used at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 24, 2004, Pizarro filed a motion for change of plea. At a change of plea hearing held before the district court on March 1, 2004, Pizarro entered a straight guilty plea to Counts One through Three. Count Nine was dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Pizarro's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") assigned him a base offense level of 6. After relevant enhancements and reductions were calculated, Pizarro's total offense level was 26.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Combined with a Criminal History Category of II, the applicable Guidelines range was 70-87 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR referenced the confession Pizarro had provided to Agent Santiago, as well as the statements found in the 302 forms. Upon reading the PSR, Pizarro's counsel called the Probation Officer, Andrea Cribben (\"Cribben\"). Cribben told Pizarro's counsel that she had received the confession from the case agent. According to Pizarro, his counsel also contacted AUSA Juan Milan&#233;s, who said that he was unaware of the existence of the confession and that he had not provided any 302 forms because he did not have to provide them until trial. On June 4, 2004, the government faxed the 302 forms to Pizarro's counsel, and on June 8, the government faxed the confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 2004, Pizarro filed a motion arguing that the government had violated Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), because it had not provided Pizarro with either the confession or the FBI 302 forms before Pizarro pled guilty. Although Pizarro stated in the motion that the government's actions called into question the voluntariness and intelligence of his guilty plea, he did not ask that he be allowed to withdraw his plea; rather, he asked that the district court adopt his interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed an opposition to Pizarro's motion on June 16, 2004, stating that it never intended to use the 302 forms at trial and therefore did not have to disclose them under Rule 16(a)(1)(A). The government also stated that the case agent did not receive the confession until May 4, 2004, after he had contacted state police to gather documents to prepare the case for presentation. As soon as the case agent received the confession, he forwarded it to Cribben, who used it in the PSR. The agent also sent the document &#8212; which was in the Spanish language &#8212; to a translator and forwarded a translated copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office on June 7. The confession was then faxed to Pizarro's counsel the following day. According to the government, therefore, no one involved in the case either knew or could have known of the confession's existence prior to May 4, 2004, meaning that the confession could not have been given to Pizarro before he pled guilty on March 1, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro was sentenced on July 1, 2004. At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Pizarro's motion regarding the alleged discovery violations. The court accepted the PSR's calculations, but gave Pizarro a three-level (instead of a two-level) reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 63-78 months' imprisonment. The district court sentenced Pizarro to 70 months' imprisonment as to Counts Two and Three and 60 months' imprisonment as to Count One, to be served <i>concurrently</i> with each other and the state sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However, in its written judgment, the court stated that Pizarro's federal prison term would run <i>consecutively</i> to his state sentence. Pizarro now appeals, arguing that his plea was not knowing and intelligent because the government failed to disclose the confession or the 302 forms; that he should be re-sentenced pursuant to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); that his sentence included some improperly applied enhancements; and that the written judgment should be corrected so that Pizarro's federal prison term runs concurrently with his state prison term, in accordance with the district court's oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 16 Violations and Withdrawal of Plea</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that a \"district court may allow withdrawal [of a guilty plea] for `a fair and just reason.'\" <i>United States v. Padilla-Galarza,</i> 351 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B)). Among the relevant factors a court should consider are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether a plea was voluntary, intelligent, knowing and complied with Rule 11; the force of the reasons offered by the defendant; whether there is a serious claim of actual innocence; the timing of the motion; and any countervailing prejudice to the government if the defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro appears to argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent because of failures of the prosecutor to disclose (allegedly in violation of Rule 16) both a confession and various statements given by Pizarro. The supposed Rule 16 violations were raised in the district court but not as a reason for withdrawing the plea. So far as we can tell, Pizarro has not sought to withdraw his plea either in the district court or his brief to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Pizarro has never explained why the disclosure of his prior confession or statements would have caused him not to plead guilty. If anything, disclosure would seem rather to have encouraged a guilty plea. Of course, if Pizarro were asserting that the government had withheld <i>exculpatory</i> evidence, this would be quite a different matter, but there is no such suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the best we can make out from the brief is that Pizarro is not interested in a withdrawal of plea at all but may be pressing the following conjecture: that if the government had turned over the confession and other statements at an earlier stage, counsel might have been able to persuade his client to accept an earlier and better plea offer from the government. But this argument, obviously resting on considerable conjecture, is not itself expressly developed in Pizarro's brief in this court or supported with any precedent for such a use of Rule 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, it is uncontested that the federal agents did not know about the confession until well after the plea. As for the 302 forms, Pizarro makes no claim that at the time he pled guilty he was ignorant of the fact that he had made statements to the FBI agents during various interviews. There is an argument that the forms should have been disclosed based on Rule 16 language not cited by the government, but we have no reason to resolve the matter. Pizarro has waived any argument that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea by not seeking to have the plea withdrawn before the district court and not making any developed argument in favor of such relief on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Booker</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his initial brief, filed after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and our decision in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2005), Pizarro argued that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court sentenced him based on facts that were not found by the jury. Pizarro never mentioned <i>Booker</i> (he mentioned <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)), never claimed that he preserved a <i>Booker</i> error under <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> and never addressed the likelihood that he would receive a more lenient sentence on remand. Further, after filing his initial brief, Pizarro never sought leave to file any supplemental materials to make the above arguments. Instead, at oral argument, which occurred over a year after Pizarro filed his initial appellate brief, Pizarro for the first time argued that he had preserved <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that, except in extraordinary circumstances, arguments not raised in a party's initial brief and instead raised for the first time at oral argument are considered waived. <i>See, e.g., Piazza v. Aponte Roque,</i> 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1990). We will therefore not consider Pizarro's arguments made for the first time at oral argument and will hold him to what he argued in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, Pizarro argued that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by applying sentencing enhancements based on facts not found by the jury. We have already considered and rejected this argument on numerous occasions, and we reject it again in this case. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75 (\"The [<i>Booker</i>] error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\"). We therefore reject Pizarro's request that he be re-sentenced under <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Amount of Loss Attributable to Pizarro</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro also argues that the district court erred in finding him responsible for over $400,000 in losses, which resulted in a fourteen-level enhancement. \"We review the district court's interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 405 F.3d 102, 113 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although it is not entirely clear from Pizarro's brief, it appears that he is making two arguments regarding the imposition of the enhancement: (1) the district court erred by automatically attributing to him the amount of loss charged in Count Two of the indictment simply because he pled guilty to that count,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and (2) that there was insufficient evidence in the record to show that he was responsible for over $400,000 in losses. We deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, a defendant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity is liable for the harm resulting from acts directly attributable to him and for the harm resulting from the reasonably foreseeable acts of others taken in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), (3). However, the fact that a defendant has pled guilty to involvement in a jointly undertaken criminal activity does not automatically mean that the defendant is responsible for all the losses caused by the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In <i>United States v. Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> 354 F.3d 101, 102 (1st Cir.2004), the defendant entered a straight guilty plea to a conspiracy involving more than five kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> At sentencing, the district court found that the defendant was responsible for five or more kilograms of cocaine, based <i>solely</i> on the defendant's plea. <i>Id.</i> We found that \"automatically attributing to the [defendant] the full amount of drugs charged in the indictment and attributed to the conspiracy as a whole\" was error. <i>Id.</i> at 103. We therefore vacated the sentence, stating that, in the drug conspiracy context, \"the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> In subsequent cases, we have applied <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s</i> to fraud cases. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 433 F.3d 165, 168 (1st Cir.2005). It is therefore clear that, in cases involving a jointly undertaken criminal activity, a district court must make an individualized determination regarding the amount of loss attributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, a defendant, and may not rely solely on what was charged in the jointly undertaken criminal activity count of an indictment, even if the defendant entered a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are initially troubled by this case because it appears that the district court based its finding at least in part on the fact that Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, which alleged his involvement in a scheme to defraud different financial institutions of over $400,000. For example, the court stated that \"I notice that the defendant pled guilty to Count 2 which alleged that the loss was in excess of $400,000. So why are we wasting time? He admitted it. That's it. It is the same as if he had gone to trial and was found guilty as to that amount.\" However, elsewhere the court indicated that it had to make a finding as to the amount reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro based on the evidence as it applied to Pizarro. For example, the court stated: \"I told you that I have to find what is the reasonable [sic] foreseeable amount of the harm, and that's what we are doing here.\" The court also stated that \"[t]he fact is that the intended loss that it is reasonably foreseeable, all the machines, all of this sophisticated means, <i>then that's what I have to decide, what was reasonably foreseeable to him.</i>\" (Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the record, we believe that the district court made its finding that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in losses for two reasons: 1) the evidence presented by the government, and 2) the fact that Pizarro had pled guilty to a scheme involving over $400,000. The first reason is permissible but the second is an error of law under our precedent. This conclusion is borne out by the court's pronouncement of sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the offense involved a loss in excess of $400,000, I do find that in this case, there has been evidence that the loss exceeded $400,000, <i>and also</i> I find that the defendant pled guilty to the specific amount as charged in Count 2, that is bank fraud in excess of $400,000, so that's why the Court finds the offense involved in excess of $400,000. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). We therefore conclude that the district court's decision to find Pizarro responsible for over $400,000 in losses was based in part on an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, that does not mean that we must automatically remand for re-sentencing. In <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> our decision to remand was based on the fact that the district court's sole foundation for finding the defendant responsible for greater than five kilograms of cocaine was an error of law: that the drug amount charged in the indictment and attributed to the conspiracy was automatically attributable to the defendant. 354 F.3d at 102-03. We also noted that the record was barren of any evidence as to the drug amounts directly attributable to, or foreseeable by, the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 103. The instant case presents a different situation, as the district court's decision is not based solely on an error of law. If there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation for the court's finding, the error would be harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result will be the same. We therefore turn to whether there is enough evidence to show that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in losses. We conclude that there is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, a defendant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity is liable for all losses directly attributable to him and for all losses resulting from reasonably foreseeable acts committed by others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the amount of loss directly attributable to Pizarro was around $21,000, and that the amount of actual loss attributable to the entire scheme was over $600,000. The issue, then, is whether Pizarro could have reasonably foreseen the losses caused by others involved in the scheme such that he should be held responsible for $400,000 in losses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that, in making the above determination, a court must first \"determine what acts and omissions of others were in furtherance of the defendant's jointly undertaken criminal activity. This task requires the court to ascertain what activity fell within the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant's agreement.\" <i>United States v. LaCroix,</i> 28 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir.1994). The court must then \"determine to what extent others' acts and omissions . . . would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in defendant's shoes at the time of his or her agreement.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The acts of Pizarro's co-schemers were within the scope of Pizarro's agreement. Pizarro argues that he only had an agreement with the leader of the scheme, Angel Lac&#233;n-de Jes&#250;s (\"Lac&#233;n\"), to make purchases. However, the evidence belies this argument. Under the Guidelines, \"the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment. (n.2). Here, the evidence shows that Pizarro implicitly agreed to be a part of the entire scheme. Pizarro was part of the scheme from its inception and knew the leaders of the scheme well. He grew up with one of the leaders, Lac&#233;n, and also served as his bodyguard before and up to the point that the scheme began. Pizarro admitted that he was paid $200 a day to guard Lac&#233;n \"while he would do his work, which was the counterfeiting of credit cards.\" Thus, even before he joined, Pizarro knew what Lac&#233;n was doing and planning. Pizarro also admitted that he knew the other leader of the scheme, Eric Adorno-Rosario (\"Adorno\"), and knew that Adorno and Lac&#233;n were partners in the counterfeit credit card operation. He also admitted that, after serving as a bodyguard for Lac&#233;n, he became a purchaser, \"which is the person who goes shopping with the cards that [Lac&#233;n] would make and program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case where a defendant agrees to make a one-time transaction for a scheme and gets caught. Here, Pizarro stated that he was paid $100-$500 per day and that he worked a few days a week. There was also evidence that others accompanied Pizarro to the stores, so he knew that others were involved in the scheme. Given all of this evidence, we find that the acts of others in furtherance of the scheme were within the scope of an implicit agreement that Pizarro made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to what losses were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. Given the evidence presented at sentencing, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. We base this finding on Pizarro's knowledge of the inner details of the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In <i>LaCroix,</i> we stated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">foreseeability may be established . . . by a defendant's knowledge of the nature and extent of a conspiracy in which he is involved.... It is both good law and good logic that a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating is germane to, and often highly probative of, accomplice attribution.... Such knowledge frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 F.3d at 229. The instant case presents an example of what we discussed in <i>LaCroix.</i> As we noted above, Pizarro was with the scheme from the beginning. He knew the leaders of the scheme and the details of their roles in the scheme. He also knew others in the scheme. Further, Pizarro knew details about how the leaders made the counterfeit credit cards, was able to give details about how the programs used in making the cards were accessed, and knew where the leaders stored their computers. He knew how the machines worked, and also knew that the leaders made not just counterfeit credit cards, but also counterfeit checks and fake licenses. He also knew that the leaders got their computers from a man named Francisco, and stated that Francisco was able to obtain equipment \"to commit all types of fraud.\" Further, in his role as a purchaser, Pizarro knew exactly why he was making the purchases. He admitted that every few days he would change businesses where he made purchases in order to avoid being identified by an establishment's personnel. In sum, while his actual acts in furtherance of the scheme only involved bodyguard duties and making purchases, Pizarro was intimately acquainted with the details of the scheme. We therefore hold that the district court correctly found that the loss of $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable by Pizarro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro attempts to get around these difficulties by making two arguments: (1) that his role was minor and that he only participated in exchange for drugs, and (2) that he did not participate in the scheme once he went to jail in July 2003. We reject both of these arguments. First, it is settled that a district court may correctly attribute \"the entire loss to appellant\" even considering \"the fact that he may have played only a supporting role.\" <i>LaCroix,</i> 28 F.3d at 231. Here, the fact that Pizarro only acted in a supporting role in no way means that the losses stemming from the jointly undertaken criminal activity were not reasonably foreseeable to him, especially given his knowledge of the inner workings of the scheme. Further, although Pizarro was allegedly given drugs in exchange for his services, there was also evidence that he was paid between $100-$500 per day and worked two to three days per week. In other words, he was not simply making purchases in exchange for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pizarro has presented absolutely no evidence that he ever withdrew from the scheme. We have stated that \"in order to withdraw from a conspiracy, a conspirator must act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy. Typically, that requires either a full confession to authorities or a communication by the accused to his co-conspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also United States v. Robinson,</i> 390 F.3d 853, 882 (6th Cir.2004) (stating that, even assuming that after his arrest the defendant was no longer an active participant in the conspiracy, \"he is nonetheless presumed to be a continuing member, and is chargeable for the subsequent acts of co-conspirators, so long [as] the conspiracy was ongoing and [the defendant] did not establish his affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> At sentencing, the prosecutor noted that Pizarro &#8212; although he initially gave a statement to the Commonwealth agent who arrested him &#8212; had not provided a \"full confession\" and had been \"obstinate with respect to his culpability in this case.\" In conclusion, Pizarro has not provided evidence that he gave a full confession or informed others involved in the scheme that he was abandoning the scheme, and the fact that he was in jail does not in and of itself mean that he withdrew from the scheme. <i>See, e.g., Robinson,</i> 390 F.3d at 882 (stating that \"a defendant's arrest . . . does not qualify as an affirmative, volitional act of withdrawal [from a conspiracy]\"); <i>United States v. Melton,</i> 131 F.3d 1400, 1405 (10th Cir.1997) (stating that a defendant's arrest, by itself, is insufficient to constitute withdrawal from a conspiracy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court did not commit clear error in its finding that there was enough evidence to find Pizarro responsible for over $400,000 in losses. We base this finding primarily on Pizarro's relationship with the leaders of the scheme and his knowledge of various intimate details of the scheme. We therefore affirm the district court's decision to apply a fourteen-level enhancement to Pizarro's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Theft From The Person of Another Enhancement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro has also challenged a two-level enhancement of his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3), which applies \"[i]f the offense involved a theft from the person of another,\" <i>id.</i> This challenge is only dubiously preserved, as Pizarro devotes but half a paragraph to it and performs none of the spadework necessary to enable us to figure out precisely what is going on. But the enhancement clearly affects Pizarro's sentence, and it is easy to understand the thrust of what he is arguing once the guideline (and its accompanying commentary) is consulted. In light of this, and to guide the future application of this particular guideline, it is useful to say something about the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, it looks like &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3) does not apply here at all. Even if one could construe the text of the guideline as ambiguous, the commentary to the guideline makes it clear that the guideline is intended to apply to physical takings, not to abstract forms of theft that take place far from the victim, like credit card fraud. The application note defines \"theft from the person of another\" as \"theft, without the use of force, of <i>property that was being held by another person or was within arms' reach</i>\" (emphasis added), and it provides as examples \"pick-pocketing and non-forcible purse-snatching, such as the theft of a purse from a shopping cart.\" <i>Id.,</i> comment. (n.1). The background note explains that such theft \"receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of physical injury\" that inheres in such activity. <i>Id.,</i> comment. (backg'd).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law on this particular guideline &#8212; none of which is cited by Pizarro or the government &#8212; is consistent with the view that the guideline targets physical and therefore potentially violent (even if non-forcible) forms of theft. <i>See United States v. Rizzo,</i> 349 F.3d 94, 98, 100 (2d Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Londono,</i> 285 F.3d 348, 350-51, 353-54 (5th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Jankowski,</i> 194 F.3d 878, 885-86 (8th Cir.1999). To the extent Pizarro's PSR recommended this particular enhancement based upon a contrary reading of &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3), it was fairly evidently mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the district judge was more discerning in his reading of the guideline. Looking at the transcript of the sentencing hearing, it is apparent that the judge recognized immediately that some kind of physical taking was required to trigger this guideline, and said initially that he was \"going to eliminate that\" enhancement. At that point, the AUSA intervened to explain that victims' \"[credit] cards were being taken\" as part of the conspiracy. Pizarro's lawyer did not object (nor had he objected to the enhancement in his written objections to the PSR), and the district court included the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have some basis for conjecturing that the AUSA, doubtless innocently, was referring not to any <i>physical theft</i> of credit cards from the victims, but to the practice by which co-conspirators, employed at retail establishments, would take credit cards handed over voluntarily by customers (to pay for goods or services) and surreptitiously swipe them through machines designed to \"steal\" sufficient information from the cards to permit them to be copied. The cards would then be returned to the owners; the only theft was of the information stored on the credit cards' magnetic stripes. This was not made clear to the judge at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that is all that the AUSA meant when he said \"[credit] cards were being taken,\" then that form of theft falls just as much outside the guideline as the form of credit card fraud practiced by Pizarro himself in his role in the conspiracy (using forged credit cards to purchase goods). Such theft involves no physical taking and no appreciable risk of escalating to violence. We do not know for certain what the AUSA was referring to at the sentencing hearing, and therefore under the circumstances we do not know whether the district court erred when it applied the enhancement. We are therefore in no position to engage in plain error review (which, of course, would be all Pizarro is entitled to, since he failed to raise this objection below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although counsel for Pizarro may have an explanation for having not pursued the objection below, this may well afford some basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, given a plain reading of the guideline commentary and the apparent lack of evidence that any credit cards were physically stolen. But of course this is a matter that must be raised by a &#167; 2255 attack on competence of counsel, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, and a matter we are not in a position to address, except to say that, although we take no view on whether ineffective assistance occurred here, it is promising enough that if a habeas petition is filed, the court should consider appointing counsel for Pizarro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Concurrent vs. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already noted, in its oral pronouncement of Pizarro's sentence, the district court stated that Pizarro's federal prison term would run concurrently with the sentence he was serving for state convictions. Nevertheless, the written judgment said that the sentences would run consecutively. The government concedes that the case should be remanded so that the written judgment can be modified to agree with what the district court stated at the sentencing hearing. <i>See United States v. Mu&#241;iz,</i> 49 F.3d 36, 42 n. 5 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Where, as in this case, the district court's oral expression of its sentencing rationale varies materially from its subsequent written expression of that rationale, appellate courts have tended to honor the former at the expense of the latter.\"). We will therefore remand the case so that this portion of the sentence may be corrected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's decision not to allow Pizarro to withdraw his plea.

However, with two exceptions, discussed<i>infra,</i> these arguments are made in such a perfunctory manner, buried within Pizarro's discussion of the constitutionality of his sentence, that we deem them waived. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Pizarro actually argues that the district court found that he was responsible for the totality of the scheme. This is incorrect. The evidence at sentencing was that the actual loss caused by the scheme was over $600,000, and the intended loss was over $1.5 million. The district court found that Pizarro was responsible for over $400,000 in losses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s</i> involved a guilty plea to a conspiracy count, whereas the instant case involves a guilty plea to a substantive count (bank fraud). However, we do not think the analysis changes. The reason has to do with the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, and the relevant guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 defines bank fraud as \"a scheme or artifice.\" Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), a defendant is liable for all acts directly attributable to him and \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, <i>scheme,</i> endeavor, or enterprise . . . <i>whether or not charged as a conspiracy</i>), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In accordance with the statute, Count Two charged Pizarro and others with a scheme and artifice to defraud certain financial institutions. Thus, Count Two qualifies as a \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. No one has argued that $400,000 in losses resulted from acts directly attributable to Pizarro. Therefore, in determining the amount of loss attributable to Pizarro, the district court was required to determine which acts taken by others in furtherance of the scheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We note that the government stated several times that the issue before the court was whether the losses caused by his others in the scheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. While this is obviously not conclusive on the reasoning of the district court, we find it relevant. If, for example, the government had simply argued that, because Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, he was responsible for $400,000 in losses, that would make it more probable that the district court had simply attributed the amount of loss in the indictment to Pizarro without an individualized determination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As we noted above in footnote 10, Count Two was not a conspiracy count. Nevertheless, since Count Two alleged Pizarro's involvement in a scheme, we think the analysis regarding withdrawal from a conspiracy applies with equal force to withdrawal from a scheme to defraud financial institutions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The merchandise was used either for the conspirators' benefit or resold, with the earnings being distributed to members of the conspiracy. The conspiracy ran from December 2002 through November 2003. Pizarro's role in the conspiracy was to make purchases at local businesses using the counterfeit credit cards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, Pizarro was arrested and put in state custody after attempting to make a purchase at a supermarket in the town of Can&#243;vanas, Puerto Rico, using a forged check. While being held in state custody, Pizarro gave an oral statement (the \"confession\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to Agent Israel Santiago-Monserrate (\"Santiago\") of the Puerto Rico Police Department, discussing the details of the conspiracy and his involvement in it. Santiago transcribed the confession and Pizarro signed the document. Pizarro was incarcerated in state prison on July 7, 2003. On August 21, 2003, Pizarro entered a guilty plea to the state charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the other conspirators were arrested by federal authorities. On December 3, 2003, Pizarro was released from state prison pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus <i>ad prosequendum</i> so that he could face federal charges for his involvement in the conspiracy. On December 8, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against the members of the conspiracy. Counsel was appointed for Pizarro on December 10. On January 28, 2004, a twelve-count superseding indictment issued. The superseding indictment charged Pizarro with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1029(a) (\"Count One\"); bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 1344 (\"Count Two\"); conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1) and (h) (\"Count Three\"); and identification fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(4) (\"Count Nine\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Pizarro spoke with federal agents prior to his federal indictment and indicated that he wanted to cooperate with the government. Some of these conversations were summarized in what the FBI calls 302 forms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government eventually offered Pizarro a plea agreement, which he decided not to take after consulting with his counsel. According to the government, the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") handling the case told Pizarro's counsel that none of Pizarro's statements summarized in the 302 forms would be used at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 24, 2004, Pizarro filed a motion for change of plea.

Count Nine was dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Pizarro's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") assigned him a base offense level of 6. After relevant enhancements and reductions were calculated, Pizarro's total offense level was 26.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Combined with a Criminal History Category of II, the applicable Guidelines range was 70-87 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR referenced the confession Pizarro had provided to Agent Santiago, as well as the statements found in the 302 forms.

According to Pizarro, his counsel also contacted AUSA Juan Milan&#233;s, who said that he was unaware of the existence of the confession and that he had not provided any 302 forms because he did not have to provide them until trial.

Although Pizarro stated in the motion that the government's actions called into question the voluntariness and intelligence of his guilty plea, he did not ask that he be allowed to withdraw his plea; rather, he asked that the district court adopt his interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed an opposition to Pizarro's motion on June 16, 2004, stating that it never intended to use the 302 forms at trial and therefore did not have to disclose them under Rule 16(a)(1)(A). The government also stated that the case agent did not receive the confession until May 4, 2004, after he had contacted state police to gather documents to prepare the case for presentation. As soon as the case agent received the confession, he forwarded it to Cribben, who used it in the PSR. The agent also sent the document &#8212; which was in the Spanish language &#8212; to a translator and forwarded a translated copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office on June 7. The confession was then faxed to Pizarro's counsel the following day. According to the government, therefore, no one involved in the case either knew or could have known of the confession's existence prior to May 4, 2004, meaning that the confession could not have been given to Pizarro before he pled guilty on March 1, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro was sentenced on July 1, 2004. At the sentencing hearing, the district court denied Pizarro's motion regarding the alleged discovery violations. The court accepted the PSR's calculations, but gave Pizarro a three-level (instead of a two-level) reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 63-78 months' imprisonment. The district court sentenced Pizarro to 70 months' imprisonment as to Counts Two and Three and 60 months' imprisonment as to Count One, to be served <i>concurrently</i> with each other and the state sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However, in its written judgment, the court stated that Pizarro's federal prison term would run <i>consecutively</i> to his state sentence.

Padilla-Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200792\"><a href=\"/opinion/200792/united-states-v-padilla-galarza/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B)). Among the relevant factors a court should consider are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether a plea was voluntary, intelligent, knowing and complied with Rule 11; the force of the reasons offered by the defendant; whether there is a serious claim of actual innocence; the timing of the motion; and any countervailing prejudice to the government if the defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro appears to argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent because of failures of the prosecutor to disclose (allegedly in violation of Rule 16) both a confession and various statements given by Pizarro. The supposed Rule 16 violations were raised in the district court but not as a reason for withdrawing the plea. So far as we can tell, Pizarro has not sought to withdraw his plea either in the district court or his brief to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Pizarro has never explained why the disclosure of his prior confession or statements would have caused him not to plead guilty. If anything, disclosure would seem rather to have encouraged a guilty plea. Of course, if Pizarro were asserting that the government had withheld <i>exculpatory</i> evidence, this would be quite a different matter, but there is no such suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the best we can make out from the brief is that Pizarro is not interested in a withdrawal of plea at all but may be pressing the following conjecture: that if the government had turned over the confession and other statements at an earlier stage, counsel might have been able to persuade his client to accept an earlier and better plea offer from the government. But this argument, obviously resting on considerable conjecture, is not itself expressly developed in Pizarro's brief in this court or supported with any precedent for such a use of Rule 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, it is uncontested that the federal agents did not know about the confession until well after the plea. As for the 302 forms, Pizarro makes no claim that at the time he pled guilty he was ignorant of the fact that he had made statements to the FBI agents during various interviews. There is an argument that the forms should have been disclosed based on Rule 16 language not cited by the government, but we have no reason to resolve the matter. Pizarro has waived any argument that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea by not seeking to have the plea withdrawn before the district court and not making any developed argument in favor of such relief on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Booker</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his initial brief, filed after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v.

Further, after filing his initial brief, Pizarro never sought leave to file any supplemental materials to make the above arguments. Instead, at oral argument, which occurred over a year after Pizarro filed his initial appellate brief, Pizarro for the first time argued that he had preserved <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that, except in extraordinary circumstances, arguments not raised in a party's initial brief and instead raised for the first time at oral argument are considered waived. <i>See, e.g., Piazza v.

We will therefore not consider Pizarro's arguments made for the first time at oral argument and will hold him to what he argued in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, Pizarro argued that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by applying sentencing enhancements based on facts not found by the jury. We have already considered and rejected this argument on numerous occasions, and we reject it again in this case. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75 (\"The [<i>Booker</i>] error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\"). We therefore reject Pizarro's request that he be re-sentenced under <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Amount of Loss Attributable to Pizarro</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro also argues that the district court erred in finding him responsible for over $400,000 in losses, which resulted in a fourteen-level enhancement. \"We review the district court's interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201561\"><a href=\"/opinion/201561/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, 113 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although it is not entirely clear from Pizarro's brief, it appears that he is making two arguments regarding the imposition of the enhancement: (1) the district court erred by automatically attributing to him the amount of loss charged in Count Two of the indictment simply because he pled guilty to that count,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and (2) that there was insufficient evidence in the record to show that he was responsible for over $400,000 in losses. We deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, a defendant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity is liable for the harm resulting from acts directly attributable to him and for the harm resulting from the reasonably foreseeable acts of others taken in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), (3). However, the fact that a defendant has pled guilty to involvement in a jointly undertaken criminal activity does not automatically mean that the defendant is responsible for all the losses caused by the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In <i>United States v. Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200804\"><a href=\"/opinion/200804/united-states-v-colon-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2004), the defendant entered a straight guilty plea to a conspiracy involving more than five kilograms of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> At sentencing, the district court found that the defendant was responsible for five or more kilograms of cocaine, based <i>solely</i> on the defendant's plea. <i>Id.</i> We found that \"automatically attributing to the [defendant] the full amount of drugs charged in the indictment and attributed to the conspiracy as a whole\" was error. <i>Id.</i> at 103. We therefore vacated the sentence, stating that, in the drug conspiracy context, \"the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> In subsequent cases, we have applied <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s</i> to fraud cases. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201993\"><a href=\"/opinion/201993/united-states-v-rodriguez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 168 (1st Cir.2005). It is therefore clear that, in cases involving a jointly undertaken criminal activity, a district court must make an individualized determination regarding the amount of loss attributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, a defendant, and may not rely solely on what was charged in the jointly undertaken criminal activity count of an indictment, even if the defendant entered a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are initially troubled by this case because it appears that the district court based its finding at least in part on the fact that Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, which alleged his involvement in a scheme to defraud different financial institutions of over $400,000. For example, the court stated that \"I notice that the defendant pled guilty to Count 2 which alleged that the loss was in excess of $400,000. So why are we wasting time? He admitted it. That's it. It is the same as if he had gone to trial and was found guilty as to that amount.\" However, elsewhere the court indicated that it had to make a finding as to the amount reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro based on the evidence as it applied to Pizarro. For example, the court stated: \"I told you that I have to find what is the reasonable [sic] foreseeable amount of the harm, and that's what we are doing here.\" The court also stated that \"[t]he fact is that the intended loss that it is reasonably foreseeable, all the machines, all of this sophisticated means, <i>then that's what I have to decide, what was reasonably foreseeable to him.</i>\" (Emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the record, we believe that the district court made its finding that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in losses for two reasons: 1) the evidence presented by the government, and 2) the fact that Pizarro had pled guilty to a scheme involving over $400,000. The first reason is permissible but the second is an error of law under our precedent. This conclusion is borne out by the court's pronouncement of sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the offense involved a loss in excess of $400,000, I do find that in this case, there has been evidence that the loss exceeded $400,000, <i>and also</i> I find that the defendant pled guilty to the specific amount as charged in Count 2, that is bank fraud in excess of $400,000, so that's why the Court finds the offense involved in excess of $400,000. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added). We therefore conclude that the district court's decision to find Pizarro responsible for over $400,000 in losses was based in part on an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, that does not mean that we must automatically remand for re-sentencing. In <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s,</i> our decision to remand was based on the fact that the district court's sole foundation for finding the defendant responsible for greater than five kilograms of cocaine was an error of law: that the drug amount charged in the indictment and attributed to the conspiracy was automatically attributable to the defendant. 354 F.3d at 102-03. We also noted that the record was barren of any evidence as to the drug amounts directly attributable to, or foreseeable by, the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 103. The instant case presents a different situation, as the district court's decision is not based solely on an error of law. If there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation for the court's finding, the error would be harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result will be the same. We therefore turn to whether there is enough evidence to show that Pizarro was responsible for $400,000 in losses. We conclude that there is.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, a defendant in a jointly undertaken criminal activity is liable for all losses directly attributable to him and for all losses resulting from reasonably foreseeable acts committed by others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the amount of loss directly attributable to Pizarro was around $21,000, and that the amount of actual loss attributable to the entire scheme was over $600,000. The issue, then, is whether Pizarro could have reasonably foreseen the losses caused by others involved in the scheme such that he should be held responsible for $400,000 in losses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that, in making the above determination, a court must first \"determine what acts and omissions of others were in furtherance of the defendant's jointly undertaken criminal activity. This task requires the court to ascertain what activity fell within the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant's agreement.\" <i>United States v. LaCroix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195454\"><a href=\"/opinion/195454/united-states-v-lacroix/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1994). The court must then \"determine to what extent others' acts and omissions . . . would have been foreseeable by a reasonable person in defendant's shoes at the time of his or her agreement.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The acts of Pizarro's co-schemers were within the scope of Pizarro's agreement. Pizarro argues that he only had an agreement with the leader of the scheme, Angel Lac&#233;n-de Jes&#250;s (\"Lac&#233;n\"), to make purchases. However, the evidence belies this argument. Under the Guidelines, \"the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment. (n.2). Here, the evidence shows that Pizarro implicitly agreed to be a part of the entire scheme. Pizarro was part of the scheme from its inception and knew the leaders of the scheme well. He grew up with one of the leaders, Lac&#233;n, and also served as his bodyguard before and up to the point that the scheme began. Pizarro admitted that he was paid $200 a day to guard Lac&#233;n \"while he would do his work, which was the counterfeiting of credit cards.\" Thus, even before he joined, Pizarro knew what Lac&#233;n was doing and planning. Pizarro also admitted that he knew the other leader of the scheme, Eric Adorno-Rosario (\"Adorno\"), and knew that Adorno and Lac&#233;n were partners in the counterfeit credit card operation. He also admitted that, after serving as a bodyguard for Lac&#233;n, he became a purchaser, \"which is the person who goes shopping with the cards that [Lac&#233;n] would make and program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case where a defendant agrees to make a one-time transaction for a scheme and gets caught. Here, Pizarro stated that he was paid $100-$500 per day and that he worked a few days a week. There was also evidence that others accompanied Pizarro to the stores, so he knew that others were involved in the scheme. Given all of this evidence, we find that the acts of others in furtherance of the scheme were within the scope of an implicit agreement that Pizarro made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to what losses were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. Given the evidence presented at sentencing, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. We base this finding on Pizarro's knowledge of the inner details of the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In <i>LaCroix,</i> we stated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">foreseeability may be established . . . by a defendant's knowledge of the nature and extent of a conspiracy in which he is involved.... It is both good law and good logic that a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating is germane to, and often highly probative of, accomplice attribution.... Such knowledge frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 F.3d at 229. The instant case presents an example of what we discussed in <i>LaCroix.</i> As we noted above, Pizarro was with the scheme from the beginning. He knew the leaders of the scheme and the details of their roles in the scheme. He also knew others in the scheme. Further, Pizarro knew details about how the leaders made the counterfeit credit cards, was able to give details about how the programs used in making the cards were accessed, and knew where the leaders stored their computers. He knew how the machines worked, and also knew that the leaders made not just counterfeit credit cards, but also counterfeit checks and fake licenses. He also knew that the leaders got their computers from a man named Francisco, and stated that Francisco was able to obtain equipment \"to commit all types of fraud.\" Further, in his role as a purchaser, Pizarro knew exactly why he was making the purchases. He admitted that every few days he would change businesses where he made purchases in order to avoid being identified by an establishment's personnel. In sum, while his actual acts in furtherance of the scheme only involved bodyguard duties and making purchases, Pizarro was intimately acquainted with the details of the scheme. We therefore hold that the district court correctly found that the loss of $400,000 was reasonably foreseeable by Pizarro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro attempts to get around these difficulties by making two arguments: (1) that his role was minor and that he only participated in exchange for drugs, and (2) that he did not participate in the scheme once he went to jail in July 2003. We reject both of these arguments. First, it is settled that a district court may correctly attribute \"the entire loss to appellant\" even considering \"the fact that he may have played only a supporting role.\" <i>LaCroix,</i> 28 F.3d at 231. Here, the fact that Pizarro only acted in a supporting role in no way means that the losses stemming from the jointly undertaken criminal activity were not reasonably foreseeable to him, especially given his knowledge of the inner workings of the scheme. Further, although Pizarro was allegedly given drugs in exchange for his services, there was also evidence that he was paid between $100-$500 per day and worked two to three days per week. In other words, he was not simply making purchases in exchange for drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pizarro has presented absolutely no evidence that he ever withdrew from the scheme. We have stated that \"in order to withdraw from a conspiracy, a conspirator must act affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy. Typically, that requires either a full confession to authorities or a communication by the accused to his co-conspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200046\"><a href=\"/opinion/200046/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also United States v.

Melton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749431\"><a href=\"/opinion/749431/united-states-v-clyde-wayne-melton/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1400</span></a></span>, 1405 (10th Cir.1997) (stating that a defendant's arrest, by itself, is insufficient to constitute withdrawal from a conspiracy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court did not commit clear error in its finding that there was enough evidence to find Pizarro responsible for over $400,000 in losses. We base this finding primarily on Pizarro's relationship with the leaders of the scheme and his knowledge of various intimate details of the scheme. We therefore affirm the district court's decision to apply a fourteen-level enhancement to Pizarro's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Theft From The Person of Another Enhancement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pizarro has also challenged a two-level enhancement of his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3), which applies \"[i]f the offense involved a theft from the person of another,\" <i>id.</i> This challenge is only dubiously preserved, as Pizarro devotes but half a paragraph to it and performs none of the spadework necessary to enable us to figure out precisely what is going on. But the enhancement clearly affects Pizarro's sentence, and it is easy to understand the thrust of what he is arguing once the guideline (and its accompanying commentary) is consulted. In light of this, and to guide the future application of this particular guideline, it is useful to say something about the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, it looks like &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3) does not apply here at all. Even if one could construe the text of the guideline as ambiguous, the commentary to the guideline makes it clear that the guideline is intended to apply to physical takings, not to abstract forms of theft that take place far from the victim, like credit card fraud. The application note defines \"theft from the person of another\" as \"theft, without the use of force, of <i>property that was being held by another person or was within arms' reach</i>\" (emphasis added), and it provides as examples \"pick-pocketing and non-forcible purse-snatching, such as the theft of a purse from a shopping cart.\" <i>Id.,</i> comment. (n.1). The background note explains that such theft \"receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of physical injury\" that inheres in such activity. <i>Id.,</i> comment. (backg'd).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law on this particular guideline &#8212; none of which is cited by Pizarro or the government &#8212; is consistent with the view that the guideline targets physical and therefore potentially violent (even if non-forcible) forms of theft. <i>See United States v. Rizzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784132\"><a href=\"/opinion/784132/united-states-v-elice-rizzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98, 100 (2d Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Londono,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"26624\"><a href=\"/opinion/26624/united-states-v-londono/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 350-51, 353-54 (5th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Jankowski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766525\"><a href=\"/opinion/766525/united-states-v-michal-jankowski-united-states-of-america-v-sylwia/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span>, 885-86 (8th Cir.1999). To the extent Pizarro's PSR recommended this particular enhancement based upon a contrary reading of &#167; 2B1.1(b)(3), it was fairly evidently mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the district judge was more discerning in his reading of the guideline. Looking at the transcript of the sentencing hearing, it is apparent that the judge recognized immediately that some kind of physical taking was required to trigger this guideline, and said initially that he was \"going to eliminate that\" enhancement. At that point, the AUSA intervened to explain that victims' \"[credit] cards were being taken\" as part of the conspiracy. Pizarro's lawyer did not object (nor had he objected to the enhancement in his written objections to the PSR), and the district court included the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have some basis for conjecturing that the AUSA, doubtless innocently, was referring not to any <i>physical theft</i> of credit cards from the victims, but to the practice by which co-conspirators, employed at retail establishments, would take credit cards handed over voluntarily by customers (to pay for goods or services) and surreptitiously swipe them through machines designed to \"steal\" sufficient information from the cards to permit them to be copied. The cards would then be returned to the owners; the only theft was of the information stored on the credit cards' magnetic stripes. This was not made clear to the judge at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that is all that the AUSA meant when he said \"[credit] cards were being taken,\" then that form of theft falls just as much outside the guideline as the form of credit card fraud practiced by Pizarro himself in his role in the conspiracy (using forged credit cards to purchase goods). Such theft involves no physical taking and no appreciable risk of escalating to violence. We do not know for certain what the AUSA was referring to at the sentencing hearing, and therefore under the circumstances we do not know whether the district court erred when it applied the enhancement. We are therefore in no position to engage in plain error review (which, of course, would be all Pizarro is entitled to, since he failed to raise this objection below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although counsel for Pizarro may have an explanation for having not pursued the objection below, this may well afford some basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, given a plain reading of the guideline commentary and the apparent lack of evidence that any credit cards were physically stolen. But of course this is a matter that must be raised by a &#167; 2255 attack on competence of counsel, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, and a matter we are not in a position to address, except to say that, although we take no view on whether ineffective assistance occurred here, it is promising enough that if a habeas petition is filed, the court should consider appointing counsel for Pizarro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Concurrent vs. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already noted, in its oral pronouncement of Pizarro's sentence, the district court stated that Pizarro's federal prison term would run concurrently with the sentence he was serving for state convictions. Nevertheless, the written judgment said that the sentences would run consecutively. The government concedes that the case should be remanded so that the written judgment can be modified to agree with what the district court stated at the sentencing hearing. <i>See United States v. Mu&#241;iz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195951\"><a href=\"/opinion/195951/united-states-v-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 n. 5 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Where, as in this case, the district court's oral expression of its sentencing rationale varies materially from its subsequent written expression of that rationale, appellate courts have tended to honor the former at the expense of the latter.\"). We will therefore remand the case so that this portion of the sentence may be corrected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's decision not to allow Pizarro to withdraw his plea. We vacate Pizarro's sentence and remand to the district court so that the written judgment may be corrected to agree with the oral sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, Vacated in part, and Remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A more detailed discussion of the various aspects of the underlying conspiracy is not necessary for a resolution of this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties argue about whether the statement was a confession, a sworn statement, or simply a statement.

However, with two exceptions, discussed<i>infra,</i> these arguments are made in such a perfunctory manner, buried within Pizarro's discussion of the constitutionality of his sentence, that we deem them waived. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Pizarro actually argues that the district court found that he was responsible for the totality of the scheme. This is incorrect. The evidence at sentencing was that the actual loss caused by the scheme was over $600,000, and the intended loss was over $1.5 million. The district court found that Pizarro was responsible for over $400,000 in losses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> <i>Col&#243;n-Sol&#237;s</i> involved a guilty plea to a conspiracy count, whereas the instant case involves a guilty plea to a substantive count (bank fraud). However, we do not think the analysis changes. The reason has to do with the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, and the relevant guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 defines bank fraud as \"a scheme or artifice.\" Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), a defendant is liable for all acts directly attributable to him and \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, <i>scheme,</i> endeavor, or enterprise . . . <i>whether or not charged as a conspiracy</i>), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In accordance with the statute, Count Two charged Pizarro and others with a scheme and artifice to defraud certain financial institutions. Thus, Count Two qualifies as a \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. No one has argued that $400,000 in losses resulted from acts directly attributable to Pizarro. Therefore, in determining the amount of loss attributable to Pizarro, the district court was required to determine which acts taken by others in furtherance of the scheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We note that the government stated several times that the issue before the court was whether the losses caused by his others in the scheme were reasonably foreseeable to Pizarro. While this is obviously not conclusive on the reasoning of the district court, we find it relevant. If, for example, the government had simply argued that, because Pizarro pled guilty to Count Two, he was responsible for $400,000 in losses, that would make it more probable that the district court had simply attributed the amount of loss in the indictment to Pizarro without an individualized determination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As we noted above in footnote 10, Count Two was not a conspiracy count. Nevertheless, since Count Two alleged Pizarro's involvement in a scheme, we think the analysis regarding withdrawal from a conspiracy applies with equal force to withdrawal from a scheme to defraud financial institutions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
