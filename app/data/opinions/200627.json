Assuming that the ten-day appeal period in Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(b)(1)(A) controls, see, e.g., United States v. Fair, 326\n\nF.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir. 2003)(collecting cases), this appeal is\n\ntimely.   See Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1) (mailbox rule applies to\n\ninmate's notice of appeal), Fed. R.

Nevertheless, the appeal fails on\n\nanother ground.\n\n     Contrary to appellant's suggestion, Amendment 635 is not\n\nretroactive.   See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(c)(2002).    Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court lacked the authority to reduce appellant's sentence\n\nin light of this amendment.
