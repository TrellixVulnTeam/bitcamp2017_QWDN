Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jonathan M. Feigenbaum, with whom Phillips & Angley was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Andrew C. Pickett, with whom Ashley B. Abel, Richard W.\nPaterniti, and Jackson Lewis LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           March 28, 2007\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.              This seemingly straightforward\n\nappeal of a denial of disability benefits presents difficult issues\n\ninvolving    our   standard     of   review     in   cases    arising     under   the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§\n\n1001-1461.    In fact, the issues are so difficult that this case has\n\ngenerated three opinions. Although I agree with the district court\n\nthat the insurer's denial of disability benefits was neither\n\narbitrary    nor   capricious,       I   believe     that    our   circuit     should\n\nreexamine in an en banc proceeding the standard of review that\n\napplies when an insurer both reviews and pays disability claims,\n\nresulting in a structural conflict of interest.                          Judge Selya\n\nconcurs in the judgment affirming the decision of the district\n\ncourt, but disagrees with my assessment of the standard of review.\n\nFinally,    although    Judge    Howard        dissents,     believing     that   the\n\ndisability benefits denial was arbitrary and capricious under our\n\ncurrent standard of review, he joins me in concluding that our\n\ncircuit should reexamine our standard of review in these structural\n\nconflict cases.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            Appellant    Diane       Denmark      (\"Denmark\")       is     a   former\n\nparticipant in a group long term disability insurance plan offered\n\nthrough her employer, GenRad, Inc. (“GenRad”), and its successor in\n\ninterest, Teradyne, Inc. (“Teradyne”).                  Appellee Liberty Life\n\nAssurance Company (\"Liberty\"), the plan insurer, denied Denmark’s\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fclaim for long term disability benefits on August 20, 2002.                          After\n\nexhausting her administrative appeals, Denmark filed suit.                             On\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found that\n\nthe   decision    to        deny    benefits       was      neither      arbitrary    nor\n\ncapricious and entered summary judgment for defendants.\n\n           On    appeal,       Denmark       argues        that   this    court    should\n\nsubject Liberty's benefits decision to de novo review on several\n\ngrounds: an improper delegation of discretionary authority, a\n\nstructural conflict of interest resulting from Liberty's dual\n\nresponsibility        for   making        benefits     determinations       and    paying\n\nclaims,   and    the    fact       that    the    entire     benefits     decision    was\n\n\"infected with conflict.\"                 To further complicate matters, the\n\ndistrict court employed a heightened standard of review with\n\nrespect   to    one    medical       opinion      as   a    sanction     for   Liberty’s\n\nrefusal to comply with a discovery order, and we must consider\n\nhow to deal with that aspect of the court's decision.                             Finally,\n\nDenmark contends that Liberty's benefits decision cannot survive\n\neven deferential arbitrary and capricious review.\n\nA.         Factual Background\n\n           The facts are undisputed (although the conclusions and\n\ninferences to be drawn from them are not).                         This opinion will\n\nrecite them here in some detail to facilitate the analysis of the\n\nissues raised by the parties.               Denmark began working at GenRad on\n\nApril 2, 1973 as a Group Leader in Manufacturing Inspection.                          Her\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fjob   involved    inspecting       GenRad     products        and    overseeing   other\n\ninspection personnel.\n\n             She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1996 by her\n\nprimary care physician, Dr. Gregory Malanoski.                      Fibromyalgia is a\n\nchronic disorder characterized by muscle pain and fatigue that\n\ncan be alleviated, but not cured.                     Certain drug regimes and\n\nphysical therapy often help to improve a patient’s condition.\n\n             Despite      her    illness,     Denmark    continued       working    for\n\nseveral years, including during several periods when her symptoms\n\nworsened.       On October 3, 2001, she stopped working for health\n\nreasons.     She has not returned to work.\n\n             At the time she left work, Denmark was covered under\n\nGenRad’s Short Term Disability Benefits Plan (\"STD plan\") and its\n\nLong Term Disability Benefits Plan (\"LTD plan\").                       Liberty served\n\nas    the   claims    administrator      for    the     STD    plan,    providing    an\n\ninitial claims review and a decision for STD claims submitted by\n\nGenRad employees.          GenRad then reviewed appeals of STD benefit\n\ndenials and paid meritorious claims.                  For the LTD plan, Liberty\n\nboth made benefits determinations and paid for claims out of its\n\nown   assets.        At   some   point   in    late     2001,       Teradyne   acquired\n\nGenRad, but Denmark’s disability benefits under the two plans\n\nremained the same.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f               1.        Short Term Disability Claim1\n\n               GenRad’s STD plan defines “disabled” to mean that the\n\nclaimant       is   “unable         to    perform      all   of    the    material      and\n\nsubstantial duties of [her] occupation on an Active Employment\n\nbasis because of an Injury or Sickness.”\n\n                         a.       Initial Review by Nurse Kaye\n\n               Denmark      filed        for   STD   benefits     shortly     after    she\n\nstopped working on October 3, 2001.                     Her claim was reviewed by\n\nNurse       Debra   Kaye,     a    Liberty     Disability       Case   Manager.       Kaye\n\nreviewed medical records provided by Dr. Malanoski, Denmark’s\n\nprimary care physician; Dr. Thomas Goodman, a rheumatologist to\n\nwhom Dr. Malanoski referred Denmark; and Dr. Terrence Hack, a\n\ncardiologist.        She also reviewed a description of Denmark's job\n\nfrom GenRad.\n\n               Dr. Malanoski, who originally diagnosed Denmark with\n\nfibromyalgia in 1996, examined her on October 4, 2001, the day\n\nafter she stopped working.                  His notes from that date state that\n\nDenmark       was   “[d]oing        poorly:     much    worse     myalgia    generally,”\n\n“[h]eadache, hard to get out of [illegible], general point muscle\n\ntenderness.”         He also listed the nine drugs that Denmark was\n\ntaking and concluded: “No work until further [follow-up].”                           In an\n\nAttending      Physician          Statement     reporting    on    that     visit,    dated\n\n\n        1\n      Denmark's appeal concerns only the denial of her LTD claim.\nThis opinion recounts the history surrounding the STD claim because\nLiberty considered this information in denying the LTD claim.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fNovember     6,        Dr.      Malanoski       considered       Denmark’s        physical\n\nimpairment “Class 5 – Severe limitation of functional capacity,\n\nincapable of minimum activity.”                 In response to a question asking\n\nfor   the   “objective          medical     findings      that     support      the    above\n\nrestrictions           and     limitations,”       he     wrote:       “diffuse       muscle\n\ntenderness,” “weakness,” and “fatigue.”\n\n             Dr.       Malanoski     referred      Denmark       to    Dr.     Goodman,      a\n\nrheumatologist who saw her on October 8.                     Dr. Goodman noted that\n\nshe   experienced            “palpitations,      sharp    ('stinging')         pain”       and\n\n“fatigue/exhaustion/myalgia/insomnia,”                   and     was    “stiff,       tired,\n\nexhausted in AM. Needs afternoon nap.”\n\n             Dr.       Terrence    Hack,    a     cardiologist,        prescribed       many\n\nmedications       to     help    manage     Denmark’s      angina      and     high    blood\n\npressure.        He also provided a report indicating that there were\n\nno serious cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac symptoms that\n\nrendered Denmark unable to work.\n\n             GenRad's description of Denmark’s position listed the\n\nphysical demands: “Bending, squatting and body movement involved\n\ninspecting external and internal components of various products.\n\nAbility     to    utilize       material    handling      equipment       to    move       test\n\nequipment        and    position     product.           Occasional      lifting       of    25\n\npounds.”\n\n             After reviewing this information, Nurse Kaye noted in\n\nLiberty’s claim record on November 14, 2001 that “there is no\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\findication       as        to       what      has          changed        to        warrant\n\n[restrictions/limitations]              provided       by        [her     primary      care\n\nprovider] to justify [stopping work].”                      She acknowledged that\n\n“Clmnt has [history] of fibromyalgia x5 years as diagnosed by her\n\n[primary care provider], with episodes of flare in condition,”\n\nbut added that “there is no evidence that clmnt needed to cease\n\noccupational functioning & in fact, was able to function in an\n\noccupational setting full time, working long hours.”\n\n                      b.        Peer Review by Dr. Miller\n\n          Nurse       Kaye      requested     a     peer    review       from   Dr.    Clay\n\nMiller,   an    independent         physician        specializing          in    physical\n\nmedicine and rehabilitation.               She asked: “Does the accompanying\n\ndocumentation provide objective findings that would indicate a\n\nsignificant change in condition that was evident on or about the\n\ndate of disability?”\n\n          On     December          5,   Dr.       Miller     responded          that    the\n\ndocumentation     was      insufficient       because       it     did    not    “provide\n\nobjective findings that would indicate a significant change in\n\ncondition that was evident on or about the date of disability.”\n\nHe elaborated: “The documentation provided does not indicate a\n\nsignificant change in the patient’s condition about the time of\n\ndisability 10/03/2001 because there are no objective physical\n\nfunctional     deficits      documented       and    the    patient       had   a   normal\n\ncardiac   exercise         test    11/09/2001.”             He     also    limited     the\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fsignificance of the reports of Dr. Malanoski and Dr. Goodman for\n\nthe purposes of a disability benefits determination, stating:\n\n              [t]he rheumatology exam was positive only for\n              the 18-fibromyalgia tender points. There are\n              no   documented   objective   physical   exam\n              findings   that   support   a   decrease   or\n              significant change in this patient’s physical\n              condition. In fact, the patient had a normal\n              cardiac exercise test 11/09/2001. Therefore,\n              the   medical   records   provided   do   not\n              substantiate that the patient’s condition\n              significantly changed about the time of\n              disability 10/03/2001.\n\n                       c.   Denial of Short Term Disability Benefits\n\n              The Liberty claim record includes entries on December\n\n6, 2001 that summarize Dr. Miller’s peer review: “Dr[.] indicates\n\nreview of the medical information does not provide objective\n\nfindings   that    would    indicate   a     significant   change    in   clmt’s\n\ncondition on or about [date of disability].”               The claim record\n\nrepeatedly notes the lack of objective findings.\n\n              In addition to his notes described above, Dr. Goodman,\n\nthe rheumatologist, submitted a follow-up letter dated December\n\n11,   2001.       He   stated   that   Denmark's     symptoms   of    fatigue,\n\nexhaustion, myalgia and insomnia had become \"quite marked over\n\nthe last year or so, such that she is unable to perform her usual\n\nwork as a quality control group leader.\"               Noting that \"[t]his\n\nwork requires her to be on her feet all day,\" he concluded that\n\n\"she remains totally disabled in terms of her line of work.”2\n\n      2\n      The claim record indicates that this letter was not\nconsidered as part of the original STD benefits determination.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f              In a letter dated December 26, 2001, Liberty denied\n\nDenmark’s claim for STD benefits.             The letter cites the records\n\nprovided by Drs. Malanoski, Goodman, and Hack, as well as the\n\npeer review of Dr. Miller.         The letter explained that the lack of\n\ndocumented       objective      physical     exam     findings   supporting    a\n\nsignificant      change    in    Denmark’s    physical     condition   made   it\n\nimpossible      to   define   \"restrictions     and    limitations\"    resulting\n\nfrom her condition that would preclude her from performing her\n\njob responsibilities at GenRad.3\n\n                      d.      Appeal of Short Term Disability Benefits\n                              Decision\n\n              Denmark appealed her denial of STD benefits in January\n\n2002.       Liberty informed Denmark that her employer, now Teradyne,\n\nreviewed all appeals itself.          Liberty also sent letters to Drs.\n\nMalanoski and Goodman inviting them to express disagreement with\n\nDr. Miller's peer review.         Dr. Malanoski responded on January 14,\n\n2002, stating:\n\n              Diane Denmark is a patient of mine who\n              suffers    from     substantial    symptoms    of\n              fibromyalgia. I strongly disagree with your\n              peer    review    decision    not   to   provide\n              disability     benefits.        As   you    know,\n              fibromyalgia     is     a   condition    lacking\n              abnormalities in blood testing or specific\n\nHowever, Liberty did consider the letter as part of its LTD\nbenefits determination.\n        3\n      The distinction between objective evidence of fibromyalgia\nitself and objective evidence of the functional deficits resulting\nfrom the disease is an important issue that will be discussed\ninfra.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f              abnormalities in physical exam.   [Denmark]\n              describes . . . extreme pain, fatigue, and\n              sleep disorder (among others). Dr. Goodman,\n              our Rheumatologist specialist, agrees with\n              her degree of disability.\n\n              Teradyne       decided     to   have   Denmark    examined         by   an\n\nindependent medical examiner (\"IME\").                Dr. Peter Schur evaluated\n\nDenmark and, in a letter to Dr. Goodman on April 12, concluded\n\nthat “at least for the time being, she is clearly disabled not\n\nonly   from    work,        but   from   being   able   to    take    care       of   her\n\nhousehold.”           He    explained    that    Denmark     “can    no     longer    do\n\nhousework, cook, needs help shopping, although she is still able\n\nto do her laundry\"; that she is constantly fatigued and \"has lots\n\nof aches and pains all over her body”; that the range of motion\n\nin her limbs is limited; and that she “clearly has a sleep\n\ndisorder.”      As to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, Dr. Schur noted\n\nthat Denmark’s “shoulder and pelvic girdle problems plus her\n\nhistory of an elevated sedimentation rate would make one suspect\n\nPMR [polymyalgia rheumatica], but I think most of this, in fact,\n\nas suggested by others, is classical fibromyalgia.”                       He concluded\n\nthat modifying Denmark’s regime of exercise and medication may\n\nhelp her “get her stamina back and be able to go back to work.”\n\n              Based    on    this   independent      evaluation      by    Dr.   Schur,\n\nTeradyne determined that it would pay for six months of STD\n\nbenefits for Denmark, retroactive to her date of disability.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f           2.        Long Term Disability Benefits\n\n           Under the LTD benefits plan, one qualifies as disabled\n\nif, for the first two years, “the Covered Person, as a result of\n\nInjury   o[r]   Sickness,      is     unable      to    perform     the   Material   and\n\nSubstantial Duties of his Own Occupation” and “thereafter, the\n\nCovered Person is unable to perform, with reasonable continuity,\n\nthe Material and Substantial Duties of Any Occupation.”\n\n                     a.       Review by Nurse Kaye and Denial of Benefits\n\n           Denmark filed for LTD benefits in June 2002.                          Nurse\n\nKaye   again    reviewed      Denmark’s      medical       file,    focusing   on    the\n\ninformation     added     since      the    conclusion      of     Liberty's   initial\n\nreview of Denmark's claim on December 10, 2001.                      Since that time,\n\nDenmark had submitted Dr. Goodman’s letter of December 12, 2001,\n\nDr. Malanoski’s letter of January 14, 2002 and Dr. Schur's IME\n\nreport as part of the STD appeals process conducted by Teradyne.\n\nHowever,   Denmark      did    not    add    any       additional    medical   reports\n\nregarding her physical limitations for her LTD benefits claim.\n\n           In addition, Kaye reviewed an activities questionnaire\n\nthat Denmark completed on July 23, 2002, in which Denmark stated\n\nthat she could sit for only thirty minutes at a time, stand for\n\nten minutes, walk for ten to fifteen minutes, sit in a car for\n\ntwenty minutes, and drive for five minutes.                   She also stated that\n\nshe spends fourteen hours a day in bed and needs help grocery\n\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fshopping, carrying groceries, and washing and drying her hair.\n\nFinally, she noted that she “can not concentrate for very long.\n\n     I go to do something then I find myself standing in the room\n\nwondering what I was going to do.”\n\n            Kaye also reviewed the Department of Labor's general\n\ndescription of Denmark's position, last updated in 1988.          This\n\ndescription listed the physical requirements of Denmark’s job as\n\n“Light,\" stating that she would need to lift, carry or pull 20\n\npounds \"occasionally,\" up to ten pounds \"frequently,\" and smaller\n\nweights \"constantly.\"   The job could include frequent walking and\n\nstanding.\n\n            After her review, Kaye again concluded that there had\n\nbeen no “significant change” in Denmark’s condition around her\n\nclaimed date of disability.     Denmark had had fibromyalgia for six\n\nyears and “managed to maintain occupational functioning during\n\nthat time, even during periods of exacerbation.       This diagnosis\n\nhas been confirmed by multiple providers.”          Kaye limited the\n\nsignificance of the IME report by Dr. Schur, noting that “[s]ince\n\nan IME provides an examination on a specific date in time, its\n\nscope is limited in that inferences to the status of conditions 6\n\nmonths previous cannot be accurately assessed.”        Finally, Kaye\n\nquestioned the extent of Denmark’s disability, stating that she\n\n“may be self-limiting her work or social activities, with no\n\nobjective     medical   basis    to     support   [restrictions   and\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\flimitations]” and that her “perception that she is unable to work\n\n& is seeking permanent benefits” was a “barrier[] to recovery.”\n\n          On   August   20,    2002,    Liberty      denied   Denmark’s   LTD\n\nbenefits claim, citing the reports of Drs. Malanoski, Goodman,\n\nHack,   Miller,   and   Schur.    The     denial     letter     states:   “Our\n\nassessment of the new information provided by Dr. S[c]hur does\n\nnot find any information to alter our previous findings that\n\nthere was no significant change in Ms. Denmark’s condition on\n\nOctober 3, 2001 which would preclude her from performing the\n\nMaterial and Substantial duties of her occupation.”\n\n                  b.    Appeal of Long Term Disability Benefits\n                        Decision\n\n          Denmark requested review of the denial of her LTD claim\n\nin September 2002.      She provided all of her medical records,\n\nincluding a report from a psychological examination by Dr. Taylor\n\nthat was completed on July 24, 2002, but apparently was not\n\nincluded in Nurse Kaye’s review.          Dr. Taylor described Denmark's\n\nillness as “well documented,” and concluded: “She presents in an\n\nhonest and straightforward manner and I suspect that she has some\n\nsignificant physical limitations, as noted by Dr. Schur, M.D.               I\n\ndo not believe that her depression, in and of itself, is of\n\nsufficient   severity   to    prevent   her   from    gainful    employment.”\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fAgain,       however,     Denmark     did    not   add    any   additional        medical\n\nreports regarding her physical limitations.\n\n               Liberty arranged for surveillance of Denmark to monitor\n\nher activity level on October 24 and November 2, 4, and 5, 2002.\n\nOn October 24, the investigator observed Denmark running errands\n\nfor about two and a half hours.                    The investigator photographed\n\nher lifting groceries such as a gallon of water with one hand and\n\nplacing them in her car.4               The investigator also reported that\n\nDenmark was “walking and moving in a fluid non-obstructed manner,\n\nbending and lifting items such as a case of soda and gallon of\n\nmilk without difficulties.”                 On another day Denmark ran errands\n\nfor about an hour and a half, and on the last two days the\n\ninvestigator did not observe any activity.                      Liberty's claim log\n\nnotes       that   the    activity    check    “found     her   to   be    very    active\n\nrunning errands,” but that “the investigator had no video camera\n\non him . . . so we only have stills of her and not actual moving\n\nfootage.       Will go [a]head and have peer review perform[ed.]                        I\n\nwas hoping to supply them with surveillance footage but as there\n\nwasn’t much will not send.”\n\n               Liberty also obtained a Labor Market Survey regarding\n\nDenmark’s job.           The survey examined various sources and conducted\n\nlabor       market   research,       finding   that      “[p]hysical      demands    were\n\ndescribed as sedentary to light with occasional lifting up to 20\n\n        4\n       The record indicates that a gallon of water weighs about\neight pounds.\n\n                                            -14-\n\fpounds” and that “[t]he opportunity to change positions from\n\nsitting,      standing     and    walking       was    provided   throughout   the\n\nworkday.”\n\n              Liberty     submitted       all     the     information     it   had\n\naccumulated to the Network Medical Review – Elite Physicians\n\n(“NMR”) for a final medical review.5                  Dr. John Bomalaski did the\n\nreview and wrote a report on December 4, 2002.                     He stated that\n\nthe primary diagnosis “may be” fibromyalgia, but that “[t]he\n\nphysical examination and testing do not support the diagnosis of\n\nMs. Denmark’s treating physicians, at least within the records\n\nprovided.      There is no documentation of laboratory testing ruling\n\nout coexisting causes of myalgia.”                    Dr. Bomalaski stated that\n\n“the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question not only by\n\nthis       reviewer     but   also    by        Dr.     Schur,    the   consultant\n\nrheumatologist who had examined Ms. Denmark at the request of her\n\ntreating rheumatologist, Dr. Goodman.”\n\n              Dr.     Bomalaski   also      evaluated      Denmark's    functional\n\nlimitations.        Relying on the surveillance evidence, he noted that\n\nshe can engage in activities such as sitting, standing, walking,\n\ndriving, reading, and lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\"\n\nmeaning \"up to 1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able\n\nto lift a gallon of water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in\n\n\n       5\n      The Network Medical Review refers claims to physicians who\nevaluate the functional abilities of a claimant based on medical\ninformation provided.\n\n                                         -15-\n\fcar from grocery cart.\"        He concluded that Denmark was “capable\n\nof working full time in a primarily sedentary position within the\n\nlimitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities\n\nForm.”\n\n            On    December    10,    2002,    Liberty   informed    Denmark’s\n\nattorney that Liberty was upholding its decision to deny LTD\n\nbenefits.        The denial letter states that the review found no\n\nimpairment that would prevent Denmark from performing her own\n\noccupational job duties.           Liberty’s case log states that “there\n\nwas limited evidence to support a need to cease working and she\n\nwas able in fact to work at her own occupation for long hours.\n\nThere was no indication of what changed in her condition.”\n\n            3.       Social Security Determination\n\n            On    January    31,    2004,    an   Administrative   Law   Judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") issued a decision that Denmark was entitled to Social\n\nSecurity disability benefits retroactive to October 2, 2001, the\n\nday before she stopped working.             The ALJ concluded that Denmark\n\nhad been \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act\n\nsince    that    date,   because    her   \"severe   pain,   limitations,   and\n\nrestrictions . . . prevent [ ] her from performing her past\n\nrelevant work\" and because she has suffered a \"substantial loss\n\nof ability necessary to perform a significant number of jobs\"\n\nidentified as unskilled sedentary occupations.                The ALJ noted\n\nthat Denmark’s testimony was credible and gave controlling weight\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fto additional reports that Drs. Goodman and Hack submitted for\n\nthe Social Security benefits determination.\n\n            Based          on     this    favorable        decision,     Denmark       again\n\nrequested that Liberty review the denial of LTD benefits and\n\nsubmitted       a    new    letter       from    Dr.    Goodman.      However,       Liberty\n\nreplied    on       June    3,    2004    that    the    Social    Security       disability\n\nbenefits decision did not affect its prior denial determination.\n\nB.          Procedural History\n\n            On September 17, 2004, Denmark filed an action against\n\nLiberty in Superior Court in Massachusetts seeking LTD benefits\n\nallegedly due under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132(a)(1)(B), (2) and\n\n(3), and for breach of contract.6                      On October 27, Liberty removed\n\nthe case to federal district court in Massachusetts.                           Denmark did\n\nnot pursue her breach of contract claim in federal court.\n\n            After discovery was completed, both parties moved for\n\nsummary judgment.                In a detailed opinion, the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment for Liberty.                         The court found that,\n\nbecause     the      ERISA       plan     granted       discretionary        authority     to\n\nLiberty,    the       benefits      decision       should    be    reviewed       under   the\n\narbitrary       and        capricious       standard.             Although     the     court\n\nacknowledged          the       potential       financial     conflict       of     interest\n\npresented by Liberty’s dual responsibility for making benefits\n\n\n     6\n      The district court correctly noted that the appropriate civil\nenforcement provision for Denmark’s benefits claim was 29 U.S.C. §\n1132(a)(1)(B) only, not 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132(a)(2) and (3).\n\n                                                -17-\n\fdeterminations and paying claims, it found no evidence that this\n\nfinancial     arrangement     had    risen   to   the    level   of   an   actual\n\nconflict that would warrant altering the standard of review.7\n\nThe   court     then    thoroughly    examined     the   evidence     supporting\n\nLiberty’s      denial    of   LTD    benefits      to    Denmark,     ultimately\n\nconcluding that this denial, supported by substantial evidence,\n\nwas neither arbitrary nor capricious.             In light of the record and\n\nprecedents, this decision is affirmed.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.            Summary Judgment Standard in an ERISA Action\n\n              Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”                   Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).    In the ERISA context, however, we have held that “the\n\ndistrict court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial\n\ncourt\"; instead of considering affidavits submitted to the court,\n\nit    \"evaluates        the   reasonableness        of    an     administrative\n\ndetermination in light of the record compiled before the plan\n\nfiduciary.”      Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n\n      7\n      The court did apply heightened review to Dr. Bomalaski’s\nopinion as a sanction for Liberty’s refusal to comply with a\ndiscovery order pertaining to its financial relationship with NMR,\nDr. Bomalaski’s employer. The court’s treatment of this evidence\nwill be discussed in detail below.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f2002).8    Thus, because the court’s review is usually based only\n\non   the   administrative   record,    “summary   judgment   is   simply    a\n\nvehicle for deciding the issue,” and consequently “the non-moving\n\nparty is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.”\n\nOrndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\nB.          De Novo or Deferential Review\n\n            Appellate    review   of   the   district   court’s   grant    of\n\nsummary judgment is de novo.       See, e.g., Wright v. R.R. Donnelley\n\n& Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 73-74 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     However, the issue of what standard of review this court\n\napplies to the administrative record can raise more difficult\n\nquestions.     Denmark makes three arguments in support of de novo\n\nreview.      First, she claims that de novo review is warranted\n\nbecause Liberty was not granted discretionary authority under the\n\nterms of the LTD plan.       Second, she requests that we reconsider\n\nour precedent and hold that, because Liberty both reviews and\n\npays claims, there is a structural conflict of interest requiring\n\nde novo review.         Finally, she argues that the entire review\n\nprocess was “infected with conflict.”          This opinion will address\n\neach of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      Leahy left open the possibility that under certain\ncircumstances a district court might take evidence in an ERISA\ncase. 315 F.3d at 18 n.6.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f             1.       Grant of Discretionary Authority in an ERISA\n                      Instrument\n\n             In Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101,\n\n115 (1989) the Supreme Court held that “a denial of benefits\n\nchallenged under [29 U.S.C.] § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed\n\nunder    a   de    novo   standard    unless       the   benefit   plan    gives    the\n\nadministrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine\n\neligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.”9\n\nIf   the     ERISA        plan    grants     the     plan    administrator         such\n\ndiscretionary authority in the determination of eligibility for\n\nbenefits, the administrator’s decision must be upheld unless it\n\nis arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.                      Wright, 402\n\nF.3d at 74.\n\n             The only document in the record describing the LTD plan\n\nis the insurance policy.             Section 7 of the policy provides that\n\n\"Liberty shall possess the authority, in its sole discretion, to\n\nconstrue     the    terms    of   this     policy    and    to   determine    benefit\n\neligibility         hereunder.             Liberty’s        decisions       regarding\n\nconstruction of the terms of this policy and benefit eligibility\n\nshall be conclusive and binding.\"                 In light of this language, the\n\n     9\n      The Court justified its holding by explaining that, in\ninterpreting ERISA, courts \"are guided by principles of trust law.\"\nFirestone, 489 U.S. at 111. Consequently, \"[t]rust principles make\na deferential standard of review appropriate when a trustee\nexercises discretionary powers.\" Id. (citing Restatement (Second)\nof Trusts § 187 (1959)(\"Where discretion is conferred upon the\ntrustee with respect to the exercise of a power, its exercise is\nnot subject to control by the court except to prevent an abuse by\nthe trustee of his discretion.\")).\n\n                                           -20-\n\fdistrict court concluded that \"the record unequivocally shows\n\nthat Liberty is a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA because\n\nit acted within the capacity of manager and administrator of\n\nGenRad's      LTD       benefits    plan,\"    and    consequently        held    that     the\n\ndecision denying Denmark LTD benefits was subject to arbitrary\n\nand capricious review.\n\n              On        appeal,    Denmark     argues       that    Liberty       \"granted\n\ndiscretion         to    itself     without    authority      to    do    so.\"          While\n\nacknowledging that the language in Section 7 could provide a\n\nsufficient grant of discretionary authority, she protests that in\n\nthis case authority was not properly delegated to Liberty in an\n\nERISA   plan       instrument.          Denmark     first   contends      that    the     LTD\n\npolicy in the record was not an ERISA plan instrument, but rather\n\nan insurance policy that Liberty itself wrote.                       She then asserts\n\nthat GenRad never properly delegated discretionary authority to\n\nLiberty.\n\n              The        improper       delegation      argument         involves         the\n\ninteraction of several provisions of ERISA.                        As an employer who\n\nestablished the LTD plan, GenRad — later Teradyne — is the plan's\n\nsponsor.      See 29 U.S.C. § 1002(16)(B).                  Because the LTD policy\n\ndoes    not    designate           an   administrator,       GenRad      is      also    the\n\nadministrator.            See id. § 1002(16)(A).              In light of GenRad's\n\nstatutorily defined role as plan administrator, Denmark argues\n\nthat the LTD policy did not contain a sufficient delegation of\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\ffiduciary authority from GenRad to Liberty.                  ERISA states that\n\n\"[t]he instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly\n\nprovide     for        procedures       (A)    for      allocating        fiduciary\n\nresponsibilities . . . among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named\n\nfiduciaries to designate persons . . . to carry out fiduciary\n\nresponsibilities.\"        Id. § 1105(c)(1).           Denmark thus argues that\n\nthe LTD policy needed to designate Liberty to carry out fiduciary\n\nresponsibilities with an explicit statement such as “GenRad vests\n\nLiberty with fiduciary responsibility including making benefit\n\ndecisions.”\n\n            Liberty counters that an insurance policy can serve as\n\nan ERISA plan instrument.             Moreover, it argues that the lack of\n\nexplicit    delegation     is    irrelevant    because,      for    all   practical\n\npurposes, it performed the role of a fiduciary of the policy.\n\n            Under 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1), \"[e]very employee benefit\n\nplan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written\n\ninstrument.\"      Courts have held that an insurance policy may serve\n\nas this written instrument.              See, e.g., Krohn v. Huron Mem'l\n\nHosp.,    173   F.3d     542,    551    (6th   Cir.    1999)(“[T]he       long-term\n\ndisability policy . . . is the written instrument pursuant to\n\nwhich this employee benefit plan was established and maintained,\n\nas required by ERISA.”); Cirelli v.

Our examination of the LTD policy satisfies\n\nus that it complies with these requirements.            Section 8 explains\n\nthat Liberty sets the premiums, specifies the conditions under\n\nwhich the premiums can be changed and provides for payment of\n\npremiums.     Section 4 also provides a detailed description of\n\nbenefits.    These provisions satisfy requirements (1) and (4).           As\n\npreviously quoted, Section 7 explains that \"Liberty shall possess\n\nthe authority, in its sole discretion, to construe the terms of\n\nthe policy and to determine benefit eligibility hereunder.\"             This\n\nprovision satisfies requirement (2).            Section 7 also states:\n\n\"This Policy may be changed in whole or in part.           Only an officer\n\nof Liberty can approve a change.        The approval must be in writing\n\n                                     -23-\n\fand endorsed on or attached to this policy.\"                           This provision\n\nsatisfies requirement (3).           Thus, the LTD policy is the \"written\n\ninstrument\" required under 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1).\n\n            Denmark's    contention         that    GenRad      did    not    explicitly\n\ndelegate    fiduciary        responsibility          to    Denmark        also       fails.\n\nAlthough    Liberty   drafted       the     LTD    policy,      GenRad    adopted      the\n\nprovisions of the policy — including the grant of discretionary\n\nauthority to Liberty — by purchasing the LTD plan from Liberty.10\n\nMoreover,    the   provisions       of    the      LTD    policy      described       supra\n\nunquestionably     assign         Liberty     fiduciary         responsibility         for\n\nreviewing benefit claims.             At least one court has held that\n\nidentical    language     warrants        arbitrary       and    capricious       review\n\n\"because    Liberty     is    a    fiduciary       that    the     plan      vests    with\n\ndiscretionary authority.\"           Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,\n\n394 F.3d 262, 266 & n.3 (5th Cir. 2004).                           Thus, the policy\n\nproperly    grants      discretionary            authority       to     Liberty       and,\n\nconsequently, the LTD benefit decision warrants arbitrary and\n\ncapricious review under Firestone.11\n\n     10\n        Denmark cites Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 986\nF.2d 580 (1st Cir. 1993), to support her contention of improper\ndelegation, but that case is distinguishable. There, we applied de\nnovo review because the plan granted discretionary authority to a\nnamed fiduciary, rather than to the plan administrator, but the\nplan administrator made the final claim determination. Id. at 582-\n84. Here, by contrast, the plan explicitly granted discretionary\nauthority to Liberty, and Liberty also made the final decision on\nDenmark’s claim.\n     11\n        The district court took a different approach to this issue,\nfinding that the improper delegation argument \"miss[es] the point\"\nbecause Liberty \"acted as a de facto administrator and fiduciary\"\n\n                                          -24-\n\f             2.       Effect of Structural Conflict of Interest\n\n             Firestone      also   held    that     \"if    a   benefit    plan    gives\n\ndiscretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating\n\nunder a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighted as a\n\n'facto[r]     in    determining          whether     there      is   an    abuse       of\n\ndiscretion.'\"       489 U.S. at 115 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\n\nTrusts § 187, cmt. d (1959)).              Since Firestone, however, \"courts\n\nhave struggled to give effect to this delphic statement, and to\n\ndetermine both what constitutes a conflict of interest and how a\n\nconflict     should       affect   the     scrutiny       of   an    administrator's\n\ndecision to deny benefits.\"           Pinto v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.\n\nCo., 214 F.3d 377, 383 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n             In Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., 144 F.3d\n\n181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998), we acknowledged that \"a conflict of\n\ninterest exists\" where, as here, \"any award of benefits would\n\ncome   out   of    [the    insurer's]      own    pocket.\"       However,    we    then\n\nobserved that an insurer’s financial self-interest is balanced by\n\nan   \"important     competing      motive:       having   a    benefit    plan    is   to\n\nplease employees, not to result in the employer’s bad reputation.\n\nIndeed, we venture that an employer would not want to keep an\n\noverly tight-fisted insurer.              The conflict is not as serious as\n\n\nthroughout the claim determination process and that, consequently,\nit was a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA. Because GenRad’s\nadoption of the LTD policy granted discretionary authority to\nLiberty, it is unnecessary to consider the merits of this de facto\nanalysis.\n\n                                          -25-\n\fmight        appear   at    first        blush.\"        Id.     (citation       omitted).         We\n\nindicated          that   we    would      review       cases    of   conflict           with   “more\n\nbite,”        meaning     that      we   would     “adher[e]       to    the    arbitrary        and\n\ncapricious principle, with special emphasis on reasonableness,\n\nbut with the burden on the claimant to show that the decision was\n\nimproperly motivated.”                   Id.     In that regard, we concluded that\n\nmerely showing that the insurer both reviewed and paid claims was\n\nnot enough to warrant “more bite.”                       Id.\n\n                  Subsequently, in Doe v. Travelers Insurance Co., 167\n\nF.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir. 1999), we limited the significance that\n\nmight        be   imputed      to   the    phrase       “more    bite,”       explaining        that\n\n“[t]he essential requirement of reasonableness has substantial\n\nbite itself where, as here, we are concerned with a specific\n\ntreatment decision based on medical criteria and not some broad\n\nissue        of    public      policy.”          We     reiterated       that       an    insurer’s\n\n“general interest in conserving its resources is [not] the kind\n\nof conflict that warrants de novo review.”                            Id.12\n\n                  Our subsequent cases have read Doyle and Doe to stand\n\nfor   the         proposition       that       \"[t]he    fact     that    .     .    .    the    plan\n\nadministrator[] will have to pay [the] claim out of its own\n\nassets does not change [the arbitrary and capricious] standard of\n\n        12\n      As previously explained, GenRad was the statutory plan\nadministrator for the LTD plan, but it delegated the benefits\ndeterminations to Liberty, making Liberty a fiduciary that is\nresponsible for paying claims out of its own assets. Thus, Liberty\nfaces the structural conflict of interest described in Doyle and\nDoe.\n\n                                                 -26-\n\freview.\"    Glista v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 378 F.3d 113, 125-\n\n26 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &\n\nAccident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 418-19 (1st Cir. 2000)).                                We\n\nhave    continued        to     justify    our     adherence       to     arbitrary      and\n\ncapricious review in the face of such “structural” conflicts on\n\nthe ground that “the market presents competing incentives to the\n\ninsurer    that        substantially       minimize       the     apparent     conflict.”\n\nPari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 418.               Recently, however, we acknowledged\n\nthat “other circuits have rejected the market forces rationale\n\nand    specifically        recognized      a     conflict    of    interest       when   the\n\ninsurer    of     an    ERISA    plan    also     serves    as    plan    administrator,\n\nalthough there is no consistent approach in accordingly adjusting\n\nthe standard of review.\"               Wright, 402 F.3d at 75 & n.5.\n\n            Prior to argument in this case, Denmark requested in a\n\npetition for initial hearing en banc that we reconsider this\n\nprecedent.         We    denied    the    petition,        and    she    now   renews    her\n\nargument that, where an insurer both reviews and pays claims,\n\nthere is a “structural irreconcilable conflict of interest that\n\nrequires     an    initial       de     novo     review    of     an    adverse    benefit\n\ndecision.”        Liberty responds that the financial self-interest of\n\nan insurer who both reviews and pays claims is counterbalanced by\n\nthe    insurer’s        desire    to    remain    attractive       to    employers,      and\n\nemphasizes the desirability of a simple procedure for reviewing\n\ndenials of benefits.\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\f           The circuits have adopted varying approaches to the\n\nissue of whether the structural conflict that arises when an\n\ninsurer both reviews and pays claims justifies less deferential\n\nreview.      In    addition    to    this    court,    the    Seventh         and     Second\n\nCircuits     have    held     that    a      structural       conflict             alone     is\n\ninsufficient to alter the standard of review.                           Instead, these\n\ncircuits require an actual showing that the conflict of interest\n\naffected     the    benefits      decision        before     there          will     be     any\n\nalteration in the standard of review.                  See Rud v. Liberty Life\n\nAssurance Co., 438 F.3d 772, 776-77 (7th Cir. 2006)(holding that\n\na structural conflict of interest, without more, does not affect\n\nthe standard of review); Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace & Def. Co., 82\n\nF.3d 1251, 1255-56 (2d Cir. 1996)(holding that a claimant must\n\nshow that a conflict of interest affected the benefits decision,\n\nbut if such showing is made, de novo review applies).\n\n           However,       seven      other       circuits     have          held     that     a\n\nstructural    conflict      warrants        alteration       to       the    standard       of\n\nreview, although six of these circuits apply less deferential\n\nreview within the arbitrary and capricious framework.                               Of these\n\nsix   circuits,     all   except     one    have    adopted       a    “sliding       scale”\n\napproach to the standard of review, in which the court applies\n\nless deferential review to the extent that a conflict of interest\n\nexists.    See, e.g., Fought v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 379 F.3d\n\n997, 1004 (10th Cir. 2004)(per curiam)(explaining that “the court\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fmust decrease the level of deference given to the conflicted\n\nadministrator’s decision in proportion to the seriousness of the\n\nconflict”(internal citation and quotation omitted)); Pinto, 214\n\nF.3d     at    379     (expressly     adopting       a    “sliding    scale      method,\n\nintensifying the degree of scrutiny to match the degree of the\n\nconflict”); Vega v. Nat’l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., 188 F.3d 287,\n\n297 (5th Cir. 1999)(en banc)(explaining that “[t]he greater the\n\nevidence of conflict on the part of the administrator, the less\n\ndeferential our abuse of discretion standard will be”); Woo v.\n\nDeluxe        Corp.,     144   F.3d    1157,        1161-62    &     n.2   (8th     Cir.\n\n1998)(explicitly adopting the sliding scale approach while noting\n\nthat “not every funding conflict of interest per se warrants\n\nheightened review”); Doe v. Group Hosp. & Med. Servs., 3 F.3d 80,\n\n87   (4th      Cir.     1993)(applying       less    deference       “to   the    degree\n\nnecessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the\n\nconflict”).          The Ninth Circuit employs a “substantially similar”\n\napproach, but with a “conscious rejection of the ‘sliding scale’\n\nmetaphor”       on     the   ground   that    “[a]       straightforward      abuse   of\n\ndiscretion analysis allows a court to tailor its review to all\n\nthe circumstances before it.”            Abatie v. Alta Health & Life Ins.\n\nCo., 458 F.3d 955, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2006)(en banc).\n\n               The Eleventh Circuit uses a different framework.                       It\n\nfirst determines, under de novo review, whether the decision was\n\nwrong; if it was, and if an inherent conflict of interest exists,\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\f“the burden shifts to the claims administrator to prove that its\n\ninterpretation of the plan is not tainted by self-interest.”                 HCA\n\nHealth Servs., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 982,\n\n993-94 (11th Cir. 2001).            The claims administrator may then meet\n\nthis        burden   “by   showing     that   its   wrong     but    reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the plan benefits the class of participants and\n\nbeneficiaries.”       Id. at 994-95.\n\n               Finally, the D.C. Circuit has not yet established a\n\nstandard of review in cases involving a structural conflict of\n\ninterest.       See Wagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan-Non Bargained\n\nProgram, 407 F.3d 395, 402 (D.C. Cir. 2005)(finding that the\n\nresult would be the same under either arbitrary and capricious or\n\nde novo review).\n\n               This survey of the circuits reflects the difficulty of\n\nthe    standard      of    review    issue.    It   remains     an   issue    of\n\nconsiderable importance, as the number of amicus curiae briefs\n\nfiled in this case demonstrates.13            However, this court’s prior\n\ndecision in Doyle cannot be overruled by a panel of the court.\n\nThus, we are bound by our precedent, and must apply arbitrary and\n\ncapricious review in situations where the conflict of interest is\n\npurely structural.\n\n               Nevertheless, I think our standard of review in cases\n\n       13\n       The Massachusetts Employment Lawyers Association, AARP, and\nUnited Policyholders have filed briefs in support of Denmark. The\nAmerican Council of Life Insurers has filed a brief in support of\nLiberty.\n\n                                       -30-\n\fin    which     an   insurer    also     makes      benefits      determinations     is\n\nincreasingly difficult to defend.                In light of the development of\n\nthe law since we first addressed the issue in Doyle, and because\n\nour position is now a minority view, I think it is time to\n\nreexamine the standard of review issue in an en banc proceeding.\n\nAlthough Judge Howard dissents from the judgment agreed to by\n\nJudge Selya and myself, he agrees with me, as indicated in his\n\ndissent, that we should reexamine the standard of review issue.\n\nIn such a proceeding, I would be inclined to favor the “sliding\n\nscale” approach explicitly adopted by the Third, Fourth, Fifth,\n\nEighth, and Tenth Circuits.            Under this approach, \"'the fiduciary\n\ndecision will be entitled to some deference, but this deference\n\nwill   be     lessened   to     the   degree       necessary     to     neutralize   any\n\nuntoward influence resulting from the conflict.'\" Pinto, 214 F.3d\n\nat 391 (citation omitted).\n\n              3.       Other Evidence of Conflict\n\n              This panel must also consider, however, whether other\n\nevidence,       in   addition    to    this      structural      conflict,      warrants\n\nalteration of the standard of review.                    In her broadest argument,\n\nDenmark asserts that “[t]he District Court should have reviewed\n\nthe    entire      Liberty    analysis      with    no    less   than     a   heightened\n\nstandard of review, because the entire claims process . . . was\n\ninfected      with   conflict.”        In     support      of    this    argument,   she\n\ncontends      that    Liberty    chose      to     rely    on    unreliable     medical\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fopinions and improperly imposed a requirement that she produce\n\nobjective        evidence      of        her      inability       to   work,       thereby\n\ndemonstrating its bias against her.\n\n            This argument is essentially another request that we\n\nreject our precedents in Doyle and Doe.                         The evidence to which\n\nDenmark refers is part of the record on which Liberty based its\n\nbenefits    decision,        and    is     thus    properly      evaluated       under   the\n\n“essential requirement of reasonableness” that we apply to that\n\ndecision, Doe, 167 F.3d at 57, rather than as evidence of a\n\nconflict of interest.          As the district court acknowledged, Wright\n\nentertained — and rejected — a plaintiff’s claim that there was a\n\nconflict    of    interest         based    on    certain       factual    circumstances\n\nsurrounding the claim.               402 F.3d at 76.               Here, however, the\n\nevidence in question falls within the scope of the reasonableness\n\nanalysis, and this opinion will consider it using that framework.\n\n            Before the district court, Denmark made one additional\n\nattempt to demonstrate a conflict of interest.                              She filed a\n\nmotion for discovery of information relating to the financial\n\nrelationship       between         Liberty        and    NMR,     arguing     that       such\n\ninformation would help her establish that Liberty referred claims\n\nto NMR for reasons of financial self-interest.                              The district\n\ncourt   granted      the      motion       and     ordered       Liberty     to    produce\n\ninformation about how much money it paid NMR, answer Denmark's\n\ninterrogatory      as   to    how     many       files   it     referred    to    NMR,   and\n\n\n                                            -32-\n\fstipulate the number of cases in which NMR has accepted a claim.\n\nLiberty produced information showing that between 2001 and 2003\n\nit had paid $2,004,656 and referred 1,204 files to NMR, but\n\nstated that it was unable to make the stipulation described by\n\nthe   district    court     \"due    to   the     very    substantial    burden    and\n\nexpense    that     would   be     involved      in     retrieving   and     manually\n\nreviewing the over 1,200 claims files that were referred to NMR\n\nphysicians from 2001 to 2003.\"\n\n            In its order granting summary judgment to Liberty, the\n\ndistrict     court    interpreted         “the      First   Circuit’s       reluctant\n\nconcurrence with past precedent in Wright as a suggestion that\n\nadditional evidence of the ERISA plan administrator’s efforts to\n\nmaximize profits could be enough to turn apparent conflict into\n\nreal conflict.”       Moreover, it stated that the discovery Denmark\n\nrequested was appropriate because \"[a] claimant cannot meet the\n\nburden of demonstrating a conflict of interest if she cannot\n\nsupplement    the    record      with    relevant       evidence.\"     To    sanction\n\nLiberty for its refusal to comply with this discovery order, the\n\ndistrict   court     determined      that      it   would   “draw    the    inference\n\nsuggested by the Plaintiff, namely that NMR has not found in\n\nfavor of a single claimant in connection with the 1,204 Liberty\n\nfiles referred to NMR during the years 2001--2003.”                         The court\n\nconcluded that, if NMR never found in favor of claimants in its\n\nevaluations, Liberty would have a “‘clear incentive’ to contract\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fwith NMR to obtain peer reviews that support denial of disability\n\nbenefits, justifying a review with ‘more bite.’”                    However, the\n\ncourt also determined that to “calibrate the sanction” it would\n\napply    the    heightened     standard    of   review    only     to   Liberty’s\n\nreliance on Dr. Bomalaski’s opinion because no other evidence in\n\nthe record would have been affected by the conflict with NMR.\n\n               On appeal, Denmark does not advance the argument that,\n\nunder this court’s existing precedent, the evidence of Liberty’s\n\nrelationship with NMR would, in combination with the existing\n\nstructural conflict, justify some degree of heightened review not\n\nonly of Dr. Bomalaski’s opinion but also of the entire record.\n\nLiberty, however, protests both the discovery that the district\n\ncourt allowed and the sanction that the court imposed for its\n\nrefusal to comply.           It urges that we disregard the discovery\n\nadmitted into the record and reject the heightened standard of\n\nreview    that    the   district    court    applied     to   Dr.    Bomalaski's\n\nopinion.\n\n               In light of Denmark's silence on the link between the\n\nparticularized      conflict    evidence    and   an     altered    standard   of\n\nreview for the entire record, we need not decide whether such\n\nalteration of the overall standard of review would have been\n\nappropriate under our precedents suggesting that proof of an\n\nactual conflict (rather than a structural conflict) might justify\n\nreview with \"more bite.\"         However, the panel has divided on its\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fresponse    to   the   sanction     imposed      by    the   district          court    for\n\nLiberty's refusal to comply with the discovery order.                              Judge\n\nSelya concludes that the sanction was a proper exercise of the\n\ndistrict court's authority.              Judge Howard does not reach the\n\nsanction issue because his view of the case does not depend on\n\nwhether a higher level of scrutiny is applied to the report of\n\nDr. Bomalaski.     In my view, the district court erred in applying\n\nheightened review to Dr. Bomalaski's opinion as a sanction for\n\nfailure to comply with the discovery it orders.                         This piecemeal\n\napproach    to   the   standard     of   review       is   not    supported       by    any\n\nprecedents that I could find.\n\n            I think that the district court's implementation of its\n\npiecemeal    approach        demonstrates       the    problem          with    such     an\n\napproach.    It first applied heightened review to conclude that\n\nDr. Bomalaski's opinion was \"not fully supported, although still\n\nrelevant.\"       It then factored its skeptical assessment of Dr.\n\nBomalaski's opinion into the overall arbitrary and capricious\n\nanalysis, essentially running Dr. Bomalaski's opinion through two\n\nlevels of analysis.          Although arguably manageable as a mode of\n\nanalysis    here   because      this     case   involves         only    one    expert’s\n\nopinion, one can easily imagine cases in which this piecemeal\n\napproach would be unmanageable if conflicts affected numerous,\n\ndiscrete    portions    of    the   record.       I    cannot      approve       such    an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\funwieldy approach to the standard of review.14                                   Therefore, in\n\napplying that arbitrary and capricious standard of review as\n\narticulated in Doyle and Doe to the administrative record, I will\n\nnot   apply      heightened            review       to    the   report    submitted       by       Dr.\n\nBomalaski.\n\n              Having found no reason to depart from the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious        standard,            I    turn     to    the       administrative      record,\n\napplying that standard as articulated in Doyle and Doe.\n\n                                                   III.\n\n              Under arbitrary and capricious review, this court will\n\nuphold      an    administrator’s               decision        to    deny   benefits         to     a\n\nbeneficiary           if     the      decision      was     reasoned      and    supported         by\n\nsubstantial evidence.                      Wright, 402 F.3d at 74.                   Evidence is\n\nsubstantial           when       it   is    reasonably          sufficient      to     support      a\n\nconclusion, and contrary evidence does not make the decision\n\nunreasonable.              Id.     While arbitrary and capricious review is not\n\nthe equivalent of a \"'rubber stamp,'\" Lopez v. Metro. Life Ins.\n\nCo., 332 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003)(citation omitted), \"'a court\n\nis    not        to        substitute         its        judgment      for      that     of        the\n\n[decisionmaker],'\"                 Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st\n\n      14\n      I think that the novelty of the district court's piecemeal\napproach to the standard of review demonstrates an understandable\nuncertainty in the district court, under our current law, about\nwhat is permitted in the way of discovery to establish a conflict\nof interest that goes beyond a structural conflict, and what should\nbe done when such a conflict exists. This uncertainty emphasizes\nfurther the need for en banc consideration of the standard of\nreview issue in this type of ERISA case.\n\n                                                   -36-\n\fCir. 1998)(citation omitted).\n\n            Thus,     I    will     review   the    LTD     benefits     denial    by\n\nexamining in turn Liberty’s review of the medical opinions, its\n\ninsistence       on   objective         evidence,     its     reliance       on   the\n\nsurveillance evidence, and its refusal to consider the favorable\n\nSocial Security determination.                  After such review, I conclude\n\nthat Liberty’s denial of benefits was supported by substantial\n\nevidence.\n\nA.          Review of Medical Evidence\n\n            In support of her claim that Liberty's decision was not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence, Denmark first argues, as a\n\ngeneral proposition, that Liberty improperly based its decision\n\non the opinions of medical personnel who did not examine her.\n\nShe then discusses the reports of these medical personnel on an\n\nindividual basis, arguing that these opinions were unreliable.\n\nLiberty   counters        that    the   opinions    were    consistent    with    the\n\nclaims file and that, consequently, it could rely on them.\n\n            1.        Nonexamining Medical Personnel\n\n            Denmark objects to Liberty’s reliance on the opinions\n\nof Nurse Kaye and Dr. Miller over the opinions of three doctors\n\nwho conducted physical examinations: Dr. Malanoski, Dr. Goodman,\n\nand Dr. Schur.        She relies on Calvert v. Firstar Finance, Inc.,\n\n409 F.3d 286, 295 (6th Cir. 2005), in which the court found that\n\nwhile   “reliance     on    a    file   review     does    not,   standing    alone,\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\frequire the conclusion that [the insurer] acted improperly, we\n\nfind that the failure to conduct a physical examination . . .\n\nmay, in some cases, raise questions about the thoroughness and\n\naccuracy of the benefits determination.”\n\n               However,    the   Supreme   Court    held    in    Black     &    Decker\n\nDisability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 834 (2003), that courts\n\n“have no warrant to require plan administrators automatically to\n\naccord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician;\n\nnor may courts impose on such administrators a discrete burden of\n\nexplanation       when    such   administrators    credit       reliable    evidence\n\nthat        conflicts     with   a    treating     physician's       evaluation.”\n\nMoreover, as Calvert acknowledges, the absence of a physical exam\n\nis not determinative.            409 F.3d at 295.         Finally, in Gannon v.\n\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., 360 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir.\n\n2004), this court noted that “we have treated a nonexamining\n\nphysician’s       review    of   a   claimant’s    file    as    reliable       medical\n\nevidence on several occasions.\"                Thus, I conclude that it was\n\npermissible for Liberty to rely on the reports of nonexamining\n\nphysicians over those of examining physicians.15\n\n       15\n      The dissent argues, based on our decision in Cook v. Liberty\nLife Assurance Co., 320 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2003), that Liberty's\nrejection of the opinions of Drs. Malanoski, Goodman, and Schur is\nparticularly suspect because the treating physicians and the IME\nwere in agreement. Part of the basis for our decision in Cook was\nthe insurer's failure to seek an IME or subject the claimant's file\nto review by another physician. Id. at 23. However, we did not\nhold that, where an IME agrees with a treating physician, an\ninsurer cannot reach an opposite conclusion as to the claimant's\ndisability status. In fact, we stated that \"[t]here may well be\n\n                                        -38-\n\f             2.       Nurse Kaye's Opinion\n\n             In     addition    to     her     objection         to    Nurse      Kaye's\n\nnonexamining role, Denmark argues that Liberty should not have\n\nrelied on the opinion of a nurse over the opinions of doctors.\n\nMoreover, she contends that Kaye made an improper credibility\n\nfinding.\n\n             Denmark directs this panel to Gellerman v. Jefferson\n\nPilot Financial Insurance Co., 376 F. Supp. 2d 724, 735 (S.D.\n\nTex. 2005), in which one district court found that “the level of\n\ndeference due nurses should generally be less than that extended\n\nto doctors whose professions concentrate in the relevant field.”\n\nAlthough     that    district    court       admitted     that    little      precedent\n\nsupports this exact proposition, \"other courts, at least in the\n\ncontext     of    determining   medical       necessity,       have    been     wary   of\n\ngiving nurses broad deference.\"                Id. at 735-36 (citing C.N.S.,\n\nInc.   v.   Conn.    Gen.    Life     Ins.    Co.,   9    F.   Supp.    2d    194,     198\n\n(E.D.N.Y. 1998); Pritt v. United Mine Workers of Am., 847 F.\n\nSupp. 427 (S.D.W.Va. 1994)).\n\n             I conclude, contrary to Denmark’s claims, that it was\n\nnot    improper     for     Liberty    to     rely   on    Nurse       Kaye’s     report\n\nquestioning the probative value of Dr. Schur's opinion.                         On April\n\ncases where the opinion of the claimant's treating physician can be\nrejected without reliance on any contradictory medical evidence\ndeveloped by the plan administrator.\" Id. Moreover, Dr. Schur's\nIME report was submitted as part of the STD appeals process, and\nDenmark submitted no additional medical reports during the\nsubsequent LTD benefits determination.\n\n                                        -39-\n\f12, 2002, as part of the STD appeal, Dr. Schur evaluated Denmark\n\nand found that “at least for the time being, she is clearly\n\ndisabled not only from work, but from being able to take care of\n\nher household.”             Denmark's application for LTD benefits on July\n\n11 then began a new phase of the process, and Denmark failed to\n\nsubmit any additional medical reports during this part of the\n\nprocess.        Evaluating Denmark’s LTD claim on August 8, Nurse Kaye\n\nfound        that   \"inferences       into       the    status      of    [the    Plaintiff's]\n\nconditions          6    months    previous      cannot       be    accurately         assessed.\"\n\nAlthough in fact only four months had elapsed, Dr. Schur's own\n\nlimitation          on   his    opinion     to    \"the       time   being\"       and    Denmark's\n\nfailure to submit additional medical reports resulted in a lack\n\nof    evidence          showing    that,    on    an     ongoing      basis,      Denmark      was\n\n\"unable to perform the Material and Substantial Duties\" of her\n\nown     occupation.16             Consequently,          I    find       that    Nurse     Kaye’s\n\nassessment was not unreasonable.\n\n                Denmark        also   contends         that   Liberty      should       not   have\n\nrelied        on    Kaye’s        opinion    due        to    an     apparent      credibility\n\ndetermination that Kaye made in her review of Denmark's file.\n\nDenmark cites Smith v. Continental Casualty Co., 450 F.3d 253,\n\n        16\n      Following the denial of Denmark's LTD benefits appeal, Drs.\nGoodman and Hack each submitted a detailed four-page \"Fibromyalgia\nResidual Functional Questionnaire\" for Denmark's Social Security\nbenefits determination. The questionnaires addressed some of the\nfunctional limitations caused by Denmark's condition.         Such\ninformation might have been helpful to Denmark if it had been\nsubmitted during the LTD process.\n\n                                              -40-\n\f263-64     (6th   Cir.   2006),    in    which     the   court   found    that      an\n\ninsurer’s     reliance       on    a    credibility       determination       by     a\n\nnonexamining physician, in conjunction with its refusal to seek\n\nan independent medical examination, supported a finding that the\n\ndecision was arbitrary.\n\n             In the claim log, Kaye observed: \"[Denmark] may be\n\nself-limiting her work or social activities . . . .                   Barriers to\n\nrecovery are clmnt’s perception that she is unable to work & is\n\nseeking permanent benefits.\"             However, this apparent credibility\n\ndetermination was only one of many statements by Kaye evaluating\n\nDenmark's record.        There is no indication that this statement\n\ndictated    the    outcome    of   the    benefits       decision.     Kaye    also\n\nthoroughly reviewed each piece of evidence in Denmark's file and\n\nrequested a peer review \"to fully define\" Denmark's condition and\n\nto \"determine if the [restrictions/limitations] are supported.\"\n\nThis review evinces a full evaluation of the evidence in the\n\nrecord.\n\n             3.      Dr. Miller’s Opinion\n\n             Denmark challenges Liberty's reliance on the opinion of\n\nDr. Miller on the grounds that he did not examine her, that he\n\nrequired objective evidence of her condition, and that he did not\n\nconsider her entire medical record.                For the reasons discussed\n\nsupra, Dr. Miller's evaluation is not unreliable simply because\n\nhe   did   not    examine    Denmark.       And,    as    explained   infra,       the\n\n                                        -41-\n\femphasis on objective evidence of Denmark's inability to work\n\ndoes    not    render       Dr.    Miller's       opinion      unreliable.          Finally,\n\nDenmark's      only    evidence       that    Dr.    Miller      did    not    examine     her\n\nentire medical file was his fax report accompanied by only three\n\npages of medical records.                   However, this fact alone does not\n\ndemonstrate that he did not also consider the remainder of her\n\nfile;    in    fact,        his    report    refers       to    several       documents    in\n\nDenmark's file that were not among those that accompanied the\n\nfax.\n\n              4.        Dr. Bomalaski's Opinion\n\n              Denmark        contends      that     Dr.     Bomalaski's        opinion     was\n\nunreliable      because       he    did     not    identify      the    records     that    he\n\nreviewed and because his conclusion that she could work full time\n\nin her own occupation did not follow from surveillance evidence\n\ndocumenting her activities for a few hours at a time.                                Liberty\n\ncounters      that    Dr.     Bomalaski's         opinion      was   based    on   both    the\n\nsurveillance evidence and the medical information in the file.\n\n              Dr.     Bomalaski's         opinion    specifically         refers     to    the\n\nopinions      of     Drs.    Malanoski,       Goodman,         Taylor   and     Schur,     the\n\nFunctional         Capacities       Form,     and     the      surveillance        evidence,\n\nindicating that he examined these records.                           He first found that\n\n\"[t]he clinical medical evidence does not clearly support severe\n\nimpairment because as noted the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains\n\nin question not only by this reviewer but also by Dr. Schur.\"\n\n                                             -42-\n\fGiven     that     Liberty     does     not    contest       the    diagnosis      of\n\nfibromyalgia, this statement is largely irrelevant.\n\n            More     importantly,       Dr.      Bomalaski       relied     on    the\n\nsurveillance evidence to conclude that Denmark could engage in\n\nactivities such as sitting, standing, walking, driving, reading,\n\nand lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\" meaning \"up to\n\n1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able to lift a gallon\n\nof water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in car from grocery\n\ncart.\"     Dr.     Bomalaski     concluded     that    \"Denmark    is   capable    of\n\nworking full time in a primarily sedentary position within the\n\nlimitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities\n\nForm.\"     His characterization of her occupation as \"primarily\n\nsedentary\" is supported by the Labor Market Survey's description\n\nof the physical demands as \"sedentary to light.\"                   Moreover, while\n\nhis conclusion that she can perform the duties of her occupation\n\ndoes not follow necessarily from the surveillance evidence, it is\n\nnot contradicted by objective evidence of Denmark's functional\n\nlimitations.\n\nB.          Requirement of Objective Evidence of Inability to Work\n\n            Denmark    also      contends     that    it   was   unreasonable     for\n\nLiberty    to    require   her    to   produce    objective      evidence    of   her\n\ninability to work.         In evaluating the STD claim, Kaye sought a\n\npeer review from Dr. Miller asking whether “the accompanying\n\ndocumentation provide[s] objective findings that would indicate a\n\n                                        -43-\n\fsignificant change in condition that was evident on or about the\n\ndate of the disability (10/3/2001)[.]”                      Dr. Miller responded that\n\n“[t]here are no documented objective physical exam findings that\n\nsupport      a    decrease   or    significant         change      in   this    patient’s\n\nphysical condition.”           His conclusion is quoted and paraphrased\n\nthroughout Liberty’s claim log as well as in the letters denying\n\nDenmark’s STD and LTD benefits claims.17\n\n                 We have previously found it unreasonable for an insurer\n\nto   require       objective      evidence   to    support          a   diagnosis   of   a\n\ncondition that is not subject to verification through laboratory\n\ntesting.         See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320 F.3d 11, 21\n\n(1st    Cir.      2003)(explaining     that       it    was       unreasonable    for    an\n\ninsurer to require a claimant to provide “clinical objective”\n\nevidence that she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome).\n\nThe district court correctly found that fibromyalgia is also a\n\ncondition that is not subject to objective verification because,\n\nas     Dr.   Malanoski       explained,      it        is     a    “condition    lacking\n       17\n      The dissent says that this opinion has failed to address the\nissue of whether Liberty improperly required Denmark to show\nevidence that her condition changed on or around her date of\ndisability, contending that neither case law nor the LTD policy\nsupports such a requirement. I have not ignored that issue, and\nagree that \"[a] disabled person should not be punished for heroic\nefforts to work by being held to have forfeited his entitlement to\ndisability benefits should he stop working.\"      Hawkins v. First\nUnion Long-Term Disability Plan, 326 F.3d 914, 918 (7th Cir. 2003).\nIn this case, however, it was Denmark and her physicians who\ninitially claimed that her condition worsened around the date of\ndisability. Under such circumstances it was not unreasonable for\nLiberty to consider the lack of evidence to substantiate Denmark's\nself-reported worsening condition.\n\n                                        -44-\n\fabnormalities      in    blood   testing    or   specific      abnormalities    in\n\nphysical exam.”         In accordance with this precedent, Liberty did\n\nnot   base   its   denial    of   LTD     benefits     on    reservations   about\n\nDenmark’s diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\n\n             However,     this    court    draws       a    distinction   between\n\nrequiring     objective      evidence      of    the       diagnosis,   which   is\n\nimpermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not\n\nlend itself to objective verification, and requiring objective\n\nevidence that the plaintiff is unable to work, which is allowed.\n\nIn Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 337 F.3d 9,\n\n17 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003), we held that “[w]hile the diagnoses of\n\nchronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves\n\nto objective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed\n\nby the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective\n\nanalysis.”     We concluded:\n\n             None of the specialists that have treated Ms.\n             Boardman in the past two years have indicated\n             any limitations or restrictions, based on\n             objective findings, that would preclude Ms.\n             Boardman from performing any occupation for\n             which she is suited.      Therefore, we have\n             determined that Ms. Boardman does not meet\n             the definition of disability as required by\n             the policy.\n\nId. at 16-17.       Thus, it fell within the parameters defined in\n\nBoardman for Liberty to require Denmark to provide objective\n\nevidence of functional limitations or restrictions that would\n\nprevent her from working.\n\n                                        -45-\n\f          Denmark attempts to distinguish Boardman on the ground\n\nthat, unlike the plaintiff in that case, she submitted evidence\n\nof impairment rather than mere conclusions from the treating\n\nphysician.    Moreover,   she   argues    that,   unlike   the   IME   in\n\nBoardman, the IME in this case agreed with the conclusions of the\n\ntreating physician.   Dr. Schur stated:\n\n          Her muscle tone is very poor throughout; she\n          has   about  30   tender   points   all   over,\n          including her hands, wrists, elbows, around\n          her shoulders, back and neck, upper back,\n          middle and low back, as well as lower\n          extremity.  .   .   .   [S]he   has   decreased\n          abduction in both shoulders, more on the\n          right than on the left, and decreased\n          rotation in both shoulders, some decreased\n          rotation in both hips. I cannot do straight\n          leg raising on either side because of back\n          discomfort.\n\nDenmark argues that Dr. Schur’s findings provide the objective\n\nevidence that was lacking in Boardman.     However, while Denmark is\n\ncorrect that Dr. Schur’s evaluation does provide some objective\n\nsupport for her physical restrictions, it does not demonstrate\n\nobjectively her inability to work because the evaluation does not\n\nsufficiently relate those restrictions either to the specific\n\nphysical requirements of her job or to her overall stamina.18\n\n     18\n      The dissent contends that significant limitations on\nDenmark's stamina would preclude her from performing the duties of\nany occupation.      However, Dr. Schur provided no specific\ninformation regarding such limitation. Although he recommended a\ncourse of treatment \"to try and cut down on pain and help her sleep\n. . . so that she isn't so tired and, hopefully, can get some of\nher stamina back,\" this general comment merely recognizes some\namount of fatigue without acknowledging that Denmark's stamina is\n\n                                -46-\n\fConsequently, Liberty’s emphasis on objective evidence was not\n\nimpermissible.\n\nC.           Reliance on Surveillance Evidence\n\n             Denmark also argues that Liberty relied unreasonably on\n\nthe   surveillance         evidence       it   obtained.            She    dismisses       the\n\nsurveillance       evidence       against      her    as    \"worthless,\"      emphasizing\n\nthat she was never out of her house for more than a few hours at\n\na time and that on two of the four days she did not leave her\n\nhouse at all.\n\n             Liberty       counters        that       the        surveillance       directly\n\ncontradicted        Denmark's         self-reported              limitations        in     her\n\nactivities questionnaire.              She was observed driving for up to\n\ntwenty minutes at a time, when her activities questionnaire had\n\nreported that she could drive for only five minutes at a time.\n\nShe was also observed lifting and carrying groceries from the\n\nstore   to   her    car     and    from     her      car    to    her   house,   when      her\n\nactivities questionnaire had reported that she needed help with\n\nthese tasks.\n\n             I conclude that Liberty was entitled to consider the\n\nsurveillance evidence along with the other medical opinions and\n\nevidence     that     it     had     at     its      disposal.            Liberty        itself\n\nacknowledged the limitations of the evidence, explaining that the\n\ninvestigator “didn’t have a video camera to document [Denmark’s]\nimpaired to such a degree that she cannot work.\n\n                                            -47-\n\factivities only a photo camera which can’t detail how fluid her\n\nmovements    were     and    how    long     she   was    doing     the     activities.\"\n\nHowever,     Denmark    does       not     contest       that     she     performed    the\n\nactivities described by the surveillance investigator, and it was\n\nnot improper for Liberty to use the investigator's report and\n\nphotographs in making the LTD benefit determination.\n\nD.           Refusal to Consider Social Security Determination\n\n             Finally,       Denmark      argues    that         Liberty    should     have\n\nreconsidered her claim in light of her favorable decision from\n\nthe Social Security Administration (\"SSA\").                          As the district\n\ncourt correctly noted, “[a]lthough the SSA’s determination of a\n\nclaimant’s entitlement to social security disability benefits is\n\nnot binding on disability insurers, it can be relevant to an\n\ninsurer’s determination whether that claimant is eligible for\n\ndisability benefits.”         See Gannon, 360 F.3d at 215.\n\n             However, the district court also correctly concluded\n\nthat   the   timing     in   this     case    forecloses         Denmark’s     argument.\n\nLiberty initially decided Denmark’s LTD claim on August 20, 2002.\n\nIt then denied Denmark’s appeal in a letter dated December 10,\n\n2002, which stated that Denmark’s “administrative right of review\n\nhas been exhausted and no further review will be conducted by\n\nLiberty.”     On January 13, 2004, more than thirteen months later,\n\nthe SSA issued its decision for Denmark.\n\n\n\n                                           -48-\n\f            On appeal, Denmark relies heavily on Calvert, 409 F.3d\n\n286, in which the Sixth Circuit held that an insurer’s refusal to\n\nconsider a Social Security benefits decision contributed to a\n\nfinding    that   its   decision     was      arbitrary     and    capricious.   In\n\nCalvert, however, the SSA’s decision was issued more than two\n\nyears    before   Liberty   denied      the    claimant’s    appeal.       We   have\n\nobserved that “in order to find that an insurer has abused its\n\ndiscretion under the contract, we would have to conclude that the\n\ninsurer’s eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of\n\nthe    information   available     to    it”    when   it   made    its   decision.\n\nPari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d\n\n415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 519\n\n(“[T]he final administrative decision acts as a temporal cut off\n\npoint.      The claimant may not come to a court and ask it to\n\nconsider post-denial medical evidence in an effort to reopen the\n\nadministrative decision.”).             Because the SSA decision was not\n\navailable to Liberty when it made its decision, Liberty cannot be\n\nfaulted for failing to factor the SSA decision into its final\n\ndecision.\n\n                                        IV.\n\n            Applying arbitrary and capricious review, I conclude\n\nthat     Liberty's      benefits     determination          was     supported    by\n\nsubstantial evidence.       Liberty reasonably relied on the opinions\n\nof three nonexamining medical personnel: Nurse Kaye, Dr. Miller,\n\n                                        -49-\n\fand Dr. Bomalaski.           These reports, in conjunction with the lack\n\nof objective evidence to support Denmark's inability to work, and\n\nthe   surveillance        evidence,     provide       substantial         evidence        to\n\nsupport    Liberty's      decision      to   deny     Denmark's         claim    for     LTD\n\nbenefits.         Finally,    I   cannot     fault    Liberty      for        refusing    to\n\nreconsider     its    decision     to    deny    benefits         in    light     of     the\n\nsubsequent SSA decision.\n\n            Although Judge Selya does not join my analysis of the\n\nadministrative       record,      he    agrees       with    my    conclusion          that\n\nsubstantial evidence in that record supports Liberty's decision.\n\nThus, we affirm the district court’s determination that Liberty’s\n\ndecision     to    deny   Denmark’s      claim       for    long       term    disability\n\nbenefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n            - Concurring and Dissenting Opinions Follow -\n\n\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring in the judgment).                         I\n\nagree with Judge Lipez's meticulous analysis of the relevant\n\nmedical evidence and with the lead opinion's conclusion that the\n\njudgment rendered by the district court — a judgment rendered\n\nafter an equally thoughtful study — should be affirmed. For the\n\nreasons elucidated by Judge Lipez and by the court below, the\n\nbenefits determination made by Liberty, qua plan fiduciary, was\n\nwithin the universe of plausible outcomes.                       Consequently, that\n\ndetermination was neither arbitrary nor capricious.                        See, e.g.,\n\nLeahy   v.     Raytheon      Co.,     315    F.3d   11,     21     (1st   Cir.     2002)\n\n(upholding      plan       fiduciary's       benefits     determination,         which,\n\n\"though not inevitable, was solidly grounded\").\n\n              Despite my admiration for the lead opinion's synthesis\n\nof the medical evidence, I choose not to join it.                             I write\n\nseparately to identify the two areas of concern that prompt this\n\ncourse of action.\n\n              First    —   and   in   the     overall     scheme    of    things      less\n\nimportant — I disagree with the lead opinion's treatment of the\n\nsanction imposed by the district court.                     While I must confess\n\nthat the sanction — reading the report of Dr. John Bomalaski\n\nwith an increased level of scrutiny — is an unorthodox one, I do\n\nnot   think    that    the    sanction       goes   beyond   the     limits      of   the\n\ndistrict court's authority.\n\n\n\n                                            -51-\n\f             It is black-letter law that district courts have wide\n\nauthority    to     fashion       sanctions      that      are    appropriate        to   the\n\ncircumstances.        See, e.g., Santiago-Díaz v. Laboratorio Clínico\n\ny De Referencia Del Este, 456 F.3d 272, 275 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nRosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe more unusual the circumstances of the misconduct, the more a\n\nneed for inventiveness may arise.                   See generally Tower Ventures,\n\nInc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(encouraging case-by-case review of choice of sanction because\n\n“the circumstances attendant to noncompliance are apt to differ\n\nwidely”).        Busy district courts must be able to control their\n\ndockets and to manage burgeoning caseloads effectively.                                Thus,\n\nwhen   the       choice    of     an    appropriate        sanction        is   at   issue,\n\northodoxy for its own sake ought not to be required.\n\n             The sanction imposed here, though curious, was custom-\n\ntailored to fit a unique set of circumstances and to offset the\n\nperceived        effects    of    an        idiosyncratic        discovery      violation.\n\nAlthough     I    would     not    recommend        this       form   of    sanction      for\n\neveryday use, I am not prepared to say that it falls outside the\n\nextensive    armamentarium             of    sanctions     available       to   a    federal\n\ndistrict court.           I would, therefore, unlike Judge Lipez, uphold\n\nthe sanction.\n\n             Having        made    this        point,      I     eschew     any      further\n\nelaboration.        The situation is sui generis, and Judge Lipez's\n\n                                             -52-\n\frefusal to enforce the sanction — while mistaken in my view — is\n\nof no consequence in the long run.                   Either way — that is, with\n\nor   without     effectuating          the   sanction    —    the   district    court's\n\naffirmance       of   the    benefits-denial           determination        merits    our\n\napprobation.\n\n            This brings me to a more important, more global area\n\nof   concern.         I   wish     to    disassociate        myself   from    the     lead\n\nopinion's survey of the standard-of-review cases (which I find\n\nmore     nuanced      than    that       opinion     indicates)       and     from    its\n\nconclusion that our own standard of review, most clearly set\n\nforth in Doe v. Travelers Insurance Co., 167 F.3d 53, 56-57 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), requires reexamination en banc.                         The Doe standard,\n\nin my view, is not only correct but also sufficiently flexible\n\nto     permit    us     to   take       into   account       singular      factors    and\n\ncircumstances that might heighten conflict-of-interest concerns\n\nin   a   particular       case.         See,   e.g.,    id.    at   57     (terming   the\n\nrequirement that the fiduciary's determination be \"reasonable\"\n\nas \"the basic touchstone\" of our standard of review).                           Indeed,\n\nwe have recognized that, in developing this standard of review\n\nin   Doe   and    its     lineal       ancestor,    Doyle     v.    Paul    Revere    Life\n\nInsurance Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998), \"we took into\n\naccount the potential for conflict in considering whether the\n\ninsurer's        decision        had     strayed       outside      the      bounds    of\n\nreasonableness to become an abuse of discretion.\"                           Pari-Fasano\n\n\n                                             -53-\n\fv. ITT Hartford Life & Accid. Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      I have no desire to revisit this well-ploughed\n\nterrain.\n\n           I need not wax longiloquent.             It suffices to say that\n\nthe Doe standard has served us well.               I continue to believe, as\n\nI remarked in a different context, that \"if it ain't broke,\n\ndon't fix it.\"     United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 310 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (quoting Lawrence \"Yogi\" Berra).              In my judgment, our\n\ncourt would do well to heed that piece of folk wisdom here.\n\n           If more is needed — and I doubt that it is — en banc\n\nproceedings tend to be notoriously wasteful of scarce judicial\n\nresources.      There seems to me to be little point in trading a\n\nworkable and battle-tested standard of review for yet another\n\nplunge into the vortex of en banc consideration — a plunge that\n\nthreatens to splinter the court and to make the standard of\n\nreview less transparent.        Even if one assumes, for argument's\n\nsake, that our standard of review could profit from an attempted\n\nclarification with respect to \"structural conflict\" cases, the\n\nunevenness in the decisions of the various courts of appeals\n\nstrongly suggests that any such undertaking should be left to\n\nthe   Supreme   Court   (when   and    if    the    Justices   deem   the   time\n\npropitious).\n\n           With these brief comments, I concur in the judgment of\n\nthe court.\n\n                                      -54-\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.     For essentially\n\nthe reasons stated by Judge Lipez, I agree that we ought to re-\n\nexamine our approach to reviewing an administrator's denial of\n\nbenefits under a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. (\"ERISA\"), when those\n\nbenefits stand to be paid out of the administrator's own assets.\n\nI think, however, that, even under the standard of review now in\n\nplace, we should reverse the decision by Liberty Life Assurance\n\nCompany (\"Liberty\") to deny long-term disability benefits to\n\nDiane Denmark.    In my view, the denial \"was 'unreasonable in\n\nlight of the information available' to Liberty at the time of\n\nits decision.\"   Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320 F.3d 11,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &\n\nAcc. Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000)).    As my view\n\ndoes not depend on whether a higher level of scrutiny is applied\n\nto the report of the outside physician who reviewed Denmark's\n\nfile for Liberty, Dr. John Bomalaski, see infra note 4, I do not\n\nreach whether the district court permissibly applied a higher\n\nlevel of scrutiny as a sanction for Liberty's refusal to provide\n\ndiscovery on whether Dr. Bomalaski's employer routinely approved\n\nLiberty's benefit decisions.\n\n          As Judge Lipez's lead opinion observes, Liberty does\n\nnot dispute that Denmark has fibromyalgia, but only that the\n\ncondition rendered her disabled under the terms of the plan when\n\n\n                               -55-\n\fshe   stopped      working     in   October        2001.           Around    that       time,\n\nDenmark's    treating      physician       rated        her   as    having    a     \"severe\n\nlimitation    of    functional       capacity\"          and     being    \"incapable        of\n\nphysical     activity,\"        while       her     rheumatologist            called      her\n\n\"disabled by exhaustion and myalgia which makes it difficult for\n\nher to stay at work for any appreciable amount of time.\"                               At her\n\nemployer's insistence, Denmark then obtained a third opinion, in\n\nthe form of an independent medical examination conducted by Dr.\n\nPeter Schur (\"the IME\").            Schur found that Denmark was \"clearly\n\ndisabled, not only from work, but from being able to take care\n\nof her household.\"           While he expressed hope that changes to\n\nDenmark's    drug     regime      and     increased       exercise       \"will      improve\n\nmatters so that she can get her stamina back and get back to\n\nwork,\" he concluded that \"until that is accomplished, which may\n\ntake months, she is clearly disabled.\"\n\n            In spite of this consensus among the doctors who had\n\nexamined Denmark, Liberty concluded that she was not, in fact,\n\ndisabled    because    \"there       was    no     significant        change       in    [her]\n\ncondition\" on the date she stopped working.                             This rationale,\n\nhowever, bears no relationship to any requirement for long-term\n\ndisability benefits imposed by the plan itself.                              Instead, it\n\namounts to an argument that, because Denmark has suffered from\n\nfibromyalgia       since     at     least        1996     but      continued        working\n\nnonetheless, she cannot rely on fibromyalgia as a reason for not\n\n\n                                          -56-\n\fworking in 2001 unless she can show that her condition has\n\nworsened.    The argument does not survive even minimal scrutiny.\n\n            As a number of other courts have recognized, there is\n\nno \"logical incompatibility between working full time and being\n\ndisabled from working full time.             A desperate person might force\n\nhimself to work despite an illness that everyone agreed was\n\ntotally disabling.         Yet even a desperate person might not be\n\nable to maintain the necessary level of effort indefinitely.\"\n\nHawkins v. First Union Long-Term Disability Plan, 326 F.3d 914,\n\n918 (7th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); accord Seitz v. Metro.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 647, 651 (8th Cir. 2006); Lasser v.\n\nReliance Std. Life Ins. Co., 344 F.3d 381, 392 (3d Cir. 2003);\n\nMaracek v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 49 F.3d 702, 706 (11th\n\nCir. 1994).       In addition to its appeal as a matter of human\n\nexperience, this reasoning also furthers an important policy\n\nobjective,    namely   that    \"[a]    disabled      person      should   not     be\n\npunished    for   heroic   efforts    to     work   by   being    held    to    have\n\nforfeited his entitlement to disability benefits should he stop\n\nworking.\"    Hawkins, 326 F.3d at 918.\n\n            Rather than engaging this line of authority here, the\n\nlead   opinion    sidesteps    the    issue,     concluding      that,    because\n\nDenmark herself asserted that her condition had worsened at the\n\ntime she stopped working, Liberty was entitled to rely on her\n\nfailure to support that assertion in denying her claim.                        Under\n\n                                      -57-\n\fthe plan, however, Denmark's entitlement to long-term disability\n\npayments       does       not       depend     on    whether     her   fibromyalgia        had\n\nintensified around the time she stopped working.                              It depends on\n\nwhether       she    was     then          \"unable   to   perform      the    Material     and\n\nSubstantial Duties of [her] Own Occupation.\"                           Denmark's treating\n\nphysicians,          as    well        the    independent        doctor      hired    by   her\n\nemployer, all concluded that she was.                            Liberty could not have\n\nreasonably reached the opposite conclusion based on Denmark's\n\nfailure       to    prove       a    fact    that    is   inessential,       and     logically\n\nunconnected, to her contractual right to long-term disability\n\nbenefits.\n\n               The lead opinion also downplays the importance of this\n\nfactor to Liberty's ultimate decision, focusing instead on the\n\nasserted absence of objective evidence of Denmark's inability to\n\nwork.        But the lack of a change in Denmark's condition at the\n\ntime she stopped working was the sole explanation the insurer\n\ngave     for       denying          both    short-term     and    long-term        disability\n\nbenefits.19         In any event, Denmark presented objective evidence\n\nof her inability to work in the form of the IME, where Dr. Schur\n\nobserved \"tender points all over,\" a decreased range of motion\n\n\n\n        19\n      Liberty's letter reaffirming its denial of long-term\ndisability benefits does cite the absence of \"support of a severity\nof impairment that would preclude Ms. Denmark from performing her\nown occupational job duties,\" but, as the lead opinion observes, a\ncontemporaneous explanation in Liberty's case log again notes the\n\"limited evidence to support a need to cease working.\"\n\n                                                -58-\n\fin   the   shoulders       and   hips,    and     \"back    discomfort\"     during       an\n\nextensive physical examination.\n\n             The    lead    opinion       treats    this     as    \"some    objective\n\nevidence of [Denmark's] physical restrictions,\" but concludes\n\nthat \"it does not demonstrate objectively her inability to work\n\nbecause     the    evaluation      does     not    specifically         relate    those\n\nrestrictions either to the physical requirements of the job or\n\nto   her   overall      stamina\"    (emphasis       added).        As   this     passage\n\nrecognizes, a condition that saps a claimant of her energy would\n\nmake her unable to perform the duties of nearly any occupation.\n\nSee, e.g., Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1994).                            Dr.\n\nSchur's report characterizes Denmark's fibromyalgia in precisely\n\nthat way: he endorses a course of treatment \"to try and cut down\n\non pain and help her sleep . . . so that she isn't so tired and,\n\nhopefully, can get some of her stamina back,\" but opines that,\n\n\"until     that    is   accomplished,      which     may    take   months,       she    is\n\nclearly disabled not only from work, but from being able to take\n\ncare of her household.\"            The IME therefore expressly relates the\n\nobjective manifestations of Denmark's condition--the pain Dr.\n\nSchur observed in various points throughout her body--to her\n\ninability to work.20\n      20\n      The lead opinion devalues Dr. Schur's report based on its\nview that it does not speak to the current level of Denmark's\nfatigue or its effect on her ability to do her job. But, again,\nthe report states that Denmark's fatigue has left her unable to\nwork or to care for her household. I do not know how the report\ncould have described the level of fatigue any more clearly, or\n\n                                          -59-\n\f              In light of this diagnosis, our decision in Boardman\n\nv. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 337 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2003), does\n\nnot support the outcome reached by the majority.                          In Boardman,\n\nwe upheld the insurer's denial of long-term disability benefits\n\nto the claimant based on two factors:                            \"(1) the absence of\n\nadequate evidence in [her] medical records indicating that [her]\n\ncondition     imposed        limitation      on    her    ability    to   perform    the\n\nmaterial and substantial duties of her own occupation . . . and\n\n(2) the evidence to the contrary provided in the [IME] reports .\n\n.   .   .\"        Id.   at    17.         Here,    in    stark    contrast,   the    IME\n\nunequivocally concludes, based on objective observations, that\n\nDenmark      is    disabled,        and    that    conclusion      squares    with   the\n\nopinions of her treating physicians.\n\n              Liberty's contrary finding, then, much more closely\n\nresembles the decision we overturned in Cook.                        There, as here,\n\nthe physician who had examined the claimant opined that she was\n\ndisabled from fatigue,21 but Liberty relied on purported defects\n\nin the opinion--identified by an in-house analyst who had not\n\nexamined the claimant--to conclude otherwise.                        320 F.3d at 20-\n\n23.     In criticizing this approach, we suggested that an insurer\n\nwho doubts a treating doctor's diagnosis ordinarily should seek\n\na second opinion, either in the form of peer review or an IME.\n\n\npertinently.\n     21\n        The claimant in Cook suffered from asthma, chronic fatigue\nsyndrome, and fibromyalgia. 320 F.3d at 15.\n\n                                            -60-\n\fId. at 23.        Here, of course, the IME confirmed the diagnoses of\n\nDenmark's treating physicians.                So Liberty reached the contrary\n\nconclusion based on purported defects in the IME identified by\n\nan    in-house    analyst      who    had    not    examined    Denmark--using,      in\n\nessence, the same approach we took such a dim view of in Cook.22\n\n              Furthermore, Liberty's efforts to discount the IME do\n\nnot hold up, even under our deferential standard of review.                          In\n\nseeking      to   diminish     Dr.     Schur's      conclusion    that     Denmark   is\n\ndisabled, Liberty's in-house nurse argued that \"since an IME\n\nprovides an examination on a specific date in time, its scope is\n\nlimited on that inferences to the status of conditions 6 months\n\nprevious     cannot     be    accurately      assessed.\"         Under    this   logic,\n\nhowever, a medical examination--which, by its nature, always\n\noccurs      \"on   a   specific       date   in     time\"--can    never    \"accurately\n\nassess\" the patient's condition prior to having walked into the\n\nexamination room.           Either that premise is demonstrably false, or\n\na patient is subjected to a pointless exercise every time she\n\nundergoes an IME.            Cf. Cook, 320 F.3d at 23.            Liberty's reasons\n\nfor    spurning       Dr.    Schur's    opinion       here,    then,     are   no   more\n       22\n      Liberty also subjected the IME to peer review by Dr.\nBomalaski, who concluded that \"[t]he clinical medical evidence does\nnot clearly support severe impairment because as noted, the\ndiagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question . . . .\" As Judge\nLipez notes, this conclusion is irrelevant because Liberty has\nnever contested the diagnosis itself. The closest Dr. Bomalaski's\nreport comes to supporting Liberty's position that Denmark is not\ndisabled is its observation that \"[l]imitations of ability to\nfunction are difficult to assess . . . .\" The report therefore\ndoes little to bolster Liberty's decision.\n\n                                            -61-\n\fsupportable than its reasons for spurning the treating doctor's\n\nopinion in Cook.23\n\n           I recognize, as we did in Cook, the possibility of\n\n\"cases where the opinion of the claimant's treating physician\n\ncan be rejected without reliance on any contradictory medical\n\nevidence developed by the plan administrator.\"        320 F.3d at 23.\n\nBut    rejecting     the   opinions   of   the   claimant's   treating\n\nphysicians, and the corroborating view of an independent medical\n\nexaminer, ought to require a considerably stronger justification\n\nthan the one relied on here.24        Accordingly, I would overturn\n\nLiberty's denial of long-term disability benefits to Denmark,\n\neven under our present standard of review.\n\n\n\n\n      23\n        The lead opinion finds Liberty's criticism of the IME \"not\nunreasonable given that Dr. Schur himself had limited his\nevaluation to 'the time being.'\" While Dr. Schur's report indeed\ncontains the phrase \"at least for the time being,\" it is clearly\nnot intended to limit Dr. Schur's opinion retrospectively, but\nprospectively: in both the paragraph immediately preceding the\nphrase and the sentence immediately following it, Dr. Schur\nsuggests interventions for Denmark that \"hopefully will improve\nmatters, so that she can get her stamina back and get back to\nwork.\"    Accordingly, I do not see how the phrase \"for the time\nbeing\" can reasonably be read to support Liberty's exceedingly\nnarrow view of Dr. Schur's opinion.\n     24\n        While Liberty also relied on its surveillance of Denmark to\nsupport its decision, I agree with the district court that this\nevidence does not speak to whether she can consistently work full\ndays as her job requires. Denmark was observed leaving her house\non only two of the four days she was being watched and, even then,\nwas out for only a few hours.\n\n                                  -62-\n\f",

In fact, the issues are so difficult that this case has generated three opinions. Although I agree with the district court that the insurer's denial of disability benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious, I believe that our circuit should reexamine in an en banc proceeding the standard of review that applies when an insurer both reviews and pays disability claims, resulting in a structural conflict of interest. Judge Selya concurs in the judgment affirming the decision of the district court, but disagrees with my assessment of the standard of review. Finally, although Judge Howard dissents, believing that the disability benefits denial was arbitrary and capricious under our current standard of review, he joins me in concluding that our circuit should reexamine our standard of review in these structural conflict cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Diane Denmark (\"Denmark\") is a former participant in a group long term disability insurance plan offered through her employer, GenRad, Inc.

Appellee Liberty Life Assurance Company (\"Liberty\"), the plan insurer, denied Denmark's claim for long term disability benefits on August 20, 2002.

This opinion will recite them here in some detail to facilitate the analysis of the issues raised by the parties. Denmark began working at GenRad on April 2, 1973 as a Group Leader in Manufacturing Inspection. Her job involved inspecting GenRad products and overseeing other inspection personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1996 by her primary care physician, Dr. Gregory Malanoski.

Liberty served as the claims administrator for the STD plan, providing an initial claims review and a decision for STD claims submitted by GenRad employees. GenRad then reviewed appeals of STD benefit denials and paid meritorious claims. For the LTD plan, Liberty both made benefits determinations and paid for claims out of its own assets. At some point in late 2001, Teradyne acquired GenRad, but Denmark's disability benefits under the two plans remained the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Nurse Kaye again reviewed Denmark's medical file, focusing on the information added since the conclusion of Liberty's initial review of Denmark's claim on December 10, 2001. Since that time, Denmark had submitted Dr. Goodman's letter of December 11, 2001, Dr. Malanoski's letter of January 14, 2002 and Dr. Schur's IME report as part of the STD appeals process conducted by Teradyne. However, Denmark did not add any additional medical reports regarding her physical limitations for her LTD benefits claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Kaye reviewed an activities questionnaire that Denmark completed on July 23, 2002, in which Denmark stated that she could sit for only thirty minutes at a time, stand for ten minutes, walk for ten to fifteen minutes, sit in a car for twenty minutes, and drive for five minutes. She also stated that she spends fourteen hours a day in bed and needs help grocery shopping, carrying groceries, and washing and drying her hair.

This description listed the physical requirements of Denmark's job as \"Light,\" stating that she would need to lift, carry or pull 20 pounds \"occasionally,\" up to ten pounds \"frequently,\" and smaller weights \"constantly.\" The job could include frequent walking and standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her review, Kaye again concluded that there had been no \"significant change\" in Denmark's condition around her claimed date of disability. Denmark had had fibromyalgia for six years and \"managed to maintain occupational functioning during that time, even during periods of exacerbation. This diagnosis has been confirmed by multiple providers.\" Kaye limited the significance of the IME report by Dr. Schur, noting that \"[s]ince an IME provides an examination on a specific date in time, its scope is limited in that inferences to the status of conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Finally, Kaye questioned the extent of Denmark's disability, stating that she \"may be self-limiting her work or social activities, with no objective medical basis to support [restrictions and limitations]\" and that her \"perception that she is unable to work &amp; is seeking permanent benefits\" was a \"barrier[ ] to recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 2002, Liberty denied Denmark's LTD benefits claim, citing the reports of Drs.

She provided all of her medical records, including a report from a psychological examination by Dr. Taylor that was completed on July 24, 2002, but apparently was not included in Nurse Kaye's review. Dr. Taylor described Denmark's illness as \"well documented,\" and concluded: \"She presents in an honest and straightforward manner and I suspect that she has some significant physical limitations, as noted by Dr. Schur, M.D. I do not believe that her depression, in and of itself, is of sufficient severity to prevent her from gainful employment.\" Again, however, Denmark did not add any additional medical reports regarding her physical limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty arranged for surveillance of Denmark to monitor her activity level on October 24 and November 2, 4, and 5, 2002. On October 24, the investigator observed Denmark running errands for about two and a half hours. The investigator photographed her lifting groceries such as a gallon of water with one hand and placing them in her car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The investigator also reported that Denmark was \"walking and moving in a fluid non-obstructed manner, bending and lifting items such as a case of soda and gallon of milk without difficulties.\" On another day Denmark ran errands for about an hour and a half, and on the last two days the investigator did not observe any activity. Liberty's claim log notes that the activity check \"found her to be very active running errands,\" but that \"the investigator had no video camera on him . . . so we only have stills of her and not actual moving footage.

The survey examined various sources and conducted labor market research, finding that \"[p]hysical demands were described as sedentary to light with occasional lifting up to 20 pounds\" and that \"[t]he opportunity to change positions from sitting, standing and walking was provided throughout the workday.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty submitted all the information it had accumulated to the Network Medical Review &#8212; Elite Physicians (\"NMR\") for a final medical review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Dr. John Bomalaski did the review and wrote a report on December 4, 2002. He stated that the primary diagnosis \"may be\" fibromyalgia, but that \"[t]he physical examination and testing do not support the diagnosis of Ms. Denmark's treating physicians, at least within the records provided. There is no documentation of laboratory testing ruling out coexisting causes of myalgia.\" Dr. Bomalaski stated that \"the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question not only by this reviewer but also by Dr. Schur, the consultant rheumatologist who had examined Ms. Denmark at the request of her treating rheumatologist, Dr. Goodman.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bomalaski also evaluated Denmark's functional limitations. Relying on the surveillance evidence, he noted that she can engage in activities such as sitting, standing, walking, driving, reading, and lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\" meaning \"up to 1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able to lift a gallon of water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in car from grocery cart.\" He concluded that Denmark was \"capable of working full time in a primarily sedentary position within the limitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities Form.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, 2002, Liberty informed Denmark's attorney that Liberty was upholding its decision to deny LTD benefits. The denial letter states that the review found no impairment that would prevent Denmark from performing her own occupational job duties. Liberty's case log states that \"there was limited evidence to support a need to cease working and she was able in fact to work at her own occupation for long hours. There was no indication of what changed in her condition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Social Security Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 2004, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") issued a decision that Denmark was entitled to Social Security disability benefits retroactive to October 2, 2001, the day before she stopped working. The ALJ concluded that Denmark had been \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act since that date, because her \"severe pain, limitations, and restrictions . . . prevent [ ] her from performing her past relevant work\" and because she has suffered a \"substantial loss of ability necessary to perform a significant number of jobs\" identified as unskilled sedentary occupations. The ALJ noted that Denmark's testimony was credible and gave controlling weight to additional reports that Drs. Goodman and Hack submitted for the Social Security benefits determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this favorable decision, Denmark again requested that Liberty review the denial of LTD benefits and submitted a new letter from Dr. Goodman. However, Liberty replied on June 3, 2004 that the Social Security disability benefits decision did not affect its prior denial determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 2004, Denmark filed an action against Liberty in Superior Court in Massachusetts seeking LTD benefits allegedly due under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), (2) and (3), and for breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> On October 27, Liberty removed the case to federal district court in Massachusetts. Denmark did not pursue her breach of contract claim in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery was completed, both parties moved for summary judgment. In a detailed opinion, the district court granted summary judgment for Liberty. The court found that, because the ERISA plan granted discretionary authority to Liberty, the benefits decision should be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard. Although the court acknowledged the potential financial conflict of interest presented by Liberty's dual responsibility for making benefits determinations and paying claims, it found no evidence that this financial arrangement had risen to the level of an actual conflict that would warrant altering the standard of review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court then thoroughly examined the evidence supporting Liberty's denial of LTD benefits to Denmark, ultimately concluding that this denial, supported by substantial evidence, was neither arbitrary nor capricious. In light of the record and precedents, this decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Summary Judgment Standard in an ERISA Action</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In the ERISA context, however, we have held that \"the district court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial court\"; instead of considering affidavits submitted to the court, it \"evaluates the reasonableness of an administrative determination in light of the record compiled before the plan fiduciary.\" <i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, because the court's review is usually based only on the administrative record, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue,\" and consequently \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. De Novo or Deferential Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is <i>de novo. See, e.g., Wright v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Group Benefits Plan,</i> 402 F.3d 67, 73-74 (1st Cir.2005). However, the issue of what standard of review this court applies to the administrative record can raise more difficult questions. Denmark makes three arguments in support of <i>de novo</i> review. First, she claims that <i>de novo</i> review is warranted because Liberty was not granted discretionary authority under the terms of the LTD plan. Second, she requests that we reconsider our precedent and hold that, because Liberty both reviews and pays claims, there is a structural conflict of interest requiring <i>de novo</i> review. Finally, she argues that the entire review process was \"infected with conflict.\" This opinion will address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) the Supreme Court held that \"a denial of benefits challenged under [29 U.S.C.] &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <i>de novo</i> standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> If the ERISA plan grants the plan administrator such discretionary authority in the determination of eligibility for benefits, the administrator's decision must be upheld unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <i>Wright,</i> 402 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only document in the record describing the LTD plan is the insurance policy. Section 7 of the policy provides that \"Liberty shall possess the authority, in its sole discretion, to construe the terms of this policy and to determine benefit eligibility hereunder. Liberty's decisions regarding construction of the terms of this policy and benefit eligibility shall be conclusive and binding.\" In light of this language, the district court concluded that \"the record unequivocally shows that Liberty is a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA because it acted within the capacity of manager and administrator of GenRad's LTD benefits plan,\" and consequently held that the decision denying Denmark LTD benefits was subject to arbitrary and capricious review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark argues that Liberty \"granted discretion to itself without authority to do so.\" While acknowledging that the language in Section 7 could provide a sufficient grant of discretionary authority, she protests that in this case authority was not properly delegated to Liberty in an ERISA plan instrument. Denmark first contends that the LTD policy in the record was not an ERISA plan instrument, but rather an insurance policy that Liberty itself wrote. She then asserts that GenRad never properly delegated discretionary authority to Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The improper delegation argument involves the interaction of several provisions of ERISA. As an employer who established the LTD plan, GenRad &#8212; later Teradyne &#8212; is the plan's sponsor. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(16)(B). Because the LTD policy does not designate an administrator, GenRad is also the administrator. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1002(16)(A). In light of GenRad's statutorily defined role as plan administrator, Denmark argues that the LTD policy did not contain a sufficient delegation of fiduciary authority from GenRad to Liberty. ERISA states that \"[t]he instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly provide for procedures (A) for allocating fiduciary responsibilities . . . among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named fiduciaries to designate persons . . . to carry out fiduciary responsibilities.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1105(c)(1). Denmark thus argues that the LTD policy needed to designate Liberty to carry out fiduciary responsibilities with an explicit statement such as \"GenRad vests Liberty with fiduciary responsibility including making benefit decisions.\" Liberty counters that an insurance policy can serve as an ERISA plan instrument. Moreover, it argues that the lack of explicit delegation is irrelevant because, for all practical purposes, it performed the role of a fiduciary of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1), \"[e]very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\" Courts have held that an insurance policy may serve as this written instrument. <i>See, e.g., Krohn v.

Our examination of the LTD policy satisfies us that it complies with these requirements. Section 8 explains that Liberty sets the premiums, specifies the conditions under which the premiums can be changed and provides for payment of premiums. Section 4 also provides a detailed description of benefits. These provisions satisfy requirements (1) and (4). As previously quoted, Section 7 explains that \"Liberty shall possess the authority, in its sole discretion, to construe the terms of the policy and to determine benefit eligibility hereunder.\" This provision satisfies requirement (2). Section 7 also states: \"This Policy may be changed in whole or in part. Only an officer of Liberty can approve a change. The approval must be in writing and endorsed on or attached to this policy.\" This provision satisfies requirement (3). Thus, the LTD policy is the \"written instrument\" required under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark's contention that GenRad did not explicitly delegate fiduciary responsibility to Liberty also fails.

Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 394 F.3d 262, 266 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2004).

Since <i>Firestone,</i> however, \"courts have struggled to give effect to this delphic statement, and to determine both what constitutes a conflict of interest and how a conflict should affect the scrutiny of an administrator's decision to deny benefits.\" <i>Pinto v.

Paul Revere Life Insurance Co.,</i> 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.1998), we acknowledged that \"a conflict of interest exists\" where, as here, \"any award of benefits would come out of [the insurer's] own pocket.\" However, we then observed that an insurer's financial self-interest is balanced by an \"important competing motive: having a benefit plan is to please employees, not to result in the employer's bad reputation. Indeed, we venture that an employer would not want to keep an overly tight-fisted insurer. The conflict is not as serious as might appear at first blush.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). We indicated that we would review cases of conflict with \"more bite,\" meaning that we would \"adher[e] to the arbitrary and capricious principle, with special emphasis on reasonableness, but with the burden on the claimant to show that the decision was improperly motivated.\" <i>Id.</i> In that regard, we concluded that merely showing that the insurer both reviewed and paid claims was not enough to warrant \"more bite.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, in <i>Doe v.

We have continued to justify our adherence to arbitrary and capricious review in the face of such \"structural\" conflicts on the ground that \"the market presents competing incentives to the insurer that substantially minimize the apparent conflict.\" <i>Pari-Fasano,</i> 230 F.3d at 418. Recently, however, we acknowledged that \"other circuits have rejected the market forces rationale and specifically recognized a conflict of interest when the insurer of an ERISA plan also serves as plan administrator, although there is no consistent approach in accordingly adjusting the standard of review.\" <i>Wright,</i> 402 F.3d at 75 &amp; n.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to argument in this case, Denmark requested in a petition for initial hearing en banc that we reconsider this precedent. We denied the petition, and she now renews her argument that, where an insurer both reviews and pays claims, there is a \"structural irreconcilable conflict of interest that requires an initial de novo review of an adverse benefit decision.\" Liberty responds that the financial self-interest of an insurer who both reviews and pays claims is counterbalanced by the insurer's desire to remain attractive to employers, and emphasizes the desirability of a simple procedure for reviewing denials of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuits have adopted varying approaches to the issue of whether the structural conflict that arises when an insurer both reviews and pays claims justifies less deferential review. In addition to this court, the Seventh and Second Circuits have held that a structural conflict alone is insufficient to alter the standard of review. Instead, these circuits require an actual showing that the conflict of interest affected the benefits decision before there will be any alteration in the standard of review. <i>See Rud v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 438 F.3d 772, 776-77 (7th Cir.2006)(holding that a structural conflict of interest, without more, does not affect the standard of review); <i>Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace &amp; Def. Co.,</i> 82 F.3d 1251, 1255-56 (2d Cir.1996)(holding that a claimant must show that a conflict of interest affected the benefits decision, but if such showing is made, <i>de novo</i> review applies).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, seven other circuits have held that a structural conflict warrants alteration to the standard of review, although six of these circuits apply less deferential review within the arbitrary and capricious framework. Of these six circuits, all except one have adopted a \"sliding scale\" approach to the standard of review, in which the court applies less deferential review to the extent that a conflict of interest exists. <i>See, e.g., Fought v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 379 F.3d 997, 1004 (10th Cir.2004)(per curiam)(explaining that \"the court must decrease the level of deference given to the conflicted administrator's decision in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict\" (internal citation and quotation omitted)); <i>Pinto,</i> 214 F.3d at 379 (expressly adopting a \"sliding scale method, intensifying the degree of scrutiny to match the degree of the conflict\"); <i>Vega v. Nat'l Life Ins. Servs., Inc.,</i> 188 F.3d 287, 297 (5th Cir.1999)(en banc)(explaining that \"[t]he greater the evidence of conflict on the part of the administrator, the less deferential our abuse of discretion standard will be\"); <i>Woo v. Deluxe Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 1157, 1161-62 &amp; n. 2 (8th Cir.1998)(explicitly adopting the sliding scale approach while noting that \"not every funding conflict of interest per se warrants heightened review\"); <i>Doe v. Group Hosp. &amp; Med. Servs.,</i> 3 F.3d 80, 87 (4th Cir.1993)(applying less deference \"to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict\"). The Ninth Circuit employs a \"substantially similar\" approach, but with a \"conscious rejection of the `sliding scale' metaphor\" on the ground that \"[a] straightforward abuse of discretion analysis allows a court to tailor its review to all the circumstances before it.\" <i>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co.,</i> 458 F.3d 955, 967-68 (9th Cir.2006)(en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit uses a different framework. It first determines, under <i>de novo</i> review, whether the decision was wrong; if it was, and if an inherent conflict of interest exists, \"the burden shifts to the claims administrator to prove that its interpretation of the plan is not tainted by self-interest.\" <i>HCA Health Servs., Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co.,</i> 240 F.3d 982, 993-94 (11th Cir.2001). The claims administrator may then meet this burden \"by showing that its wrong but reasonable interpretation of the plan benefits the class of participants and beneficiaries.\" <i>Id.</i> at 994-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the D.C. Circuit has not yet established a standard of review in cases involving a structural conflict of interest. <i>See Wagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan-Non Bargained Program,</i> 407 F.3d 395, 402 (D.C.Cir.2005)(finding that the result would be the same under either arbitrary and capricious or de novo review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This survey of the circuits reflects the difficulty of the standard of review issue. It remains an issue of considerable importance, as the number of amicus curiae briefs filed in this case demonstrates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> However, this court's prior decision in <i>Doyle</i> cannot be overruled by a panel of the court. Thus, we are bound by our precedent, and must apply arbitrary and capricious review in situations where the conflict of interest is purely structural.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I think our standard of review in cases in which an insurer also makes benefits determinations is increasingly difficult to defend. In light of the development of the law since we first addressed the issue in <i>Doyle,</i> and because our position is now a minority view, I think it is time to reexamine the standard of review issue in an en banc proceeding. Although Judge Howard dissents from the judgment agreed to by Judge Selya and myself, he agrees with me, as indicated in his dissent, that we should reexamine the standard of review issue. In such a proceeding, I would be inclined to favor the \"sliding scale\" approach explicitly adopted by the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. Under this approach, \"`the fiduciary decision will be entitled to some deference, but this deference will be lessened to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict.'\" <i>Pinto,</i> 214 F.3d at 391 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Other Evidence of Conflict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This panel must also consider, however, whether other evidence, in addition to this structural conflict, warrants alteration of the standard of review. In her broadest argument, Denmark asserts that \"[t]he District Court should have reviewed the entire Liberty analysis with no less than a heightened standard of review, because the entire claims process . . . was infected with conflict.\" In support of this argument, she contends that Liberty chose to rely on unreliable medical opinions and improperly imposed a requirement that she produce objective evidence of her inability to work, thereby demonstrating its bias against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is essentially another request that we reject our precedents in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe.</i> The evidence to which Denmark refers is part of the record on which Liberty based its benefits decision, and is thus properly evaluated under the \"essential requirement of reasonableness\" that we apply to that decision, <i>Doe,</i> 167 F.3d at 57, rather than as evidence of a conflict of interest. As the district court acknowledged, <i>Wright</i> entertained&#8212;and rejected&#8212;a plaintiff's claim that there was a conflict of interest based on certain factual circumstances surrounding the claim. 402 F.3d at 76. Here, however, the evidence in question falls within the scope of the reasonableness analysis, and this opinion will consider it using that framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Denmark made one additional attempt to demonstrate a conflict of interest. She filed a motion for discovery of information relating to the financial relationship between Liberty and NMR, arguing that such information would help her establish that Liberty referred claims to NMR for reasons of financial self-interest. The district court granted the motion and ordered Liberty to produce information about how much money it paid NMR, answer Denmark's interrogatory as to how many files it referred to NMR, and stipulate the number of cases in which NMR has accepted a claim. Liberty produced information showing that between 2001 and 2003 it had paid $2,004,656 and referred 1,204 files to NMR, but stated that it was unable to make the stipulation described by the district court \"due to the very substantial burden and expense that would be involved in retrieving and manually reviewing the over 1,200 claims files that were referred to NMR physicians from 2001 to 2003.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order granting summary judgment to Liberty, the district court interpreted \"the First Circuit's reluctant concurrence with past precedent in <i>Wright</i> as a suggestion that additional evidence of the ERISA plan administrator's efforts to maximize profits could be enough to turn apparent conflict into real conflict.\" Moreover, it stated that the discovery Denmark requested was appropriate because \"[a] claimant cannot meet the burden of demonstrating a conflict of interest if she cannot supplement the record with relevant evidence.\" To sanction Liberty for its refusal to comply with this discovery order, the district court determined that it would \"draw the inference suggested by the Plaintiff, namely that NMR has not found in favor of a single claimant in connection with the 1,204 Liberty files referred to NMR during the years 2001-2003.\" The court concluded that, if NMR never found in favor of claimants in its evaluations, Liberty would have a \"`clear incentive' to contract with NMR to obtain peer reviews that support denial of disability benefits, justifying a review with `more bite.'\" However, the court also determined that to \"calibrate the sanction\" it would apply the heightened standard of review only to Liberty's reliance on Dr. Bomalaski's opinion because no other evidence in the record would have been affected by the conflict with NMR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark does not advance the argument that, under this court's existing precedent, the evidence of Liberty's relationship with NMR would, in combination with the existing structural conflict, justify some degree of heightened review not only of Dr. Bomalaski's opinion but also of the entire record. Liberty, however, protests both the discovery that the district court allowed and the sanction that the court imposed for its refusal to comply. It urges that we disregard the discovery admitted into the record and reject the heightened standard of review that the district court applied to Dr. Bomalaski's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Denmark's silence on the link between the particularized conflict evidence and an altered standard of review for the entire record, we need not decide whether such alteration of the overall standard of review would have been appropriate under our precedents suggesting that proof of an actual conflict (rather than a structural conflict) might justify review with \"more bite.\" However, the panel has divided on its response to the sanction imposed by the district court for Liberty's refusal to comply with the discovery order. Judge Selya concludes that the sanction was a proper exercise of the district court's authority. Judge Howard does not reach the sanction issue because his view of the case does not depend on whether a higher level of scrutiny is applied to the report of Dr. Bomalaski. In my view, the district court erred in applying heightened review to Dr. Bomalaski's opinion as a sanction for failure to comply with the discovery it orders. This piecemeal approach to the standard of review is not supported by any precedents that I could find.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that the district court's implementation of its piecemeal approach demonstrates the problem with such an approach. It first applied heightened review to conclude that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was \"not fully supported, although still relevant.\" It then factored its skeptical assessment of Dr. Bomalaski's opinion into the overall arbitrary and capricious analysis, essentially running Dr. Bomalaski's opinion through two levels of analysis. Although arguably manageable as a mode of analysis here because this case involves only one expert's opinion, one can easily imagine cases in which this piecemeal approach would be unmanageable if conflicts affected numerous, discrete portions of the record. I cannot approve such an unwieldy approach to the standard of review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Therefore, in applying that arbitrary and capricious standard of review as articulated in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe</i> to the administrative record, I will not apply heightened review to the report submitted by Dr. Bomalaski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no reason to depart from the arbitrary and capricious standard, I turn to the administrative record, applying that standard as articulated in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under arbitrary and capricious review, this court will uphold an administrator's decision to deny benefits to a beneficiary if the decision was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence. <i>Wright,</i> 402 F.3d at 74. Evidence is substantial when it is reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion, and contrary evidence does not make the decision unreasonable. <i>Id.</i> While arbitrary and capricious review is not the equivalent of a \"`rubber stamp,'\" <i>Lopes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 332 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003) (citation omitted), \"`a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the [decisionmaker],'\" <i>Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, I will review the LTD benefits denial by examining in turn Liberty's review of the medical opinions, its insistence on objective evidence, its reliance on the surveillance evidence, and its refusal to consider the favorable Social Security determination. After such review, I conclude that Liberty's denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Review of Medical Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her claim that Liberty's decision was not supported by substantial evidence, Denmark first argues, as a general proposition, that Liberty improperly based its decision on the opinions of medical personnel who did not examine her. She then discusses the reports of these medical personnel on an individual basis, arguing that these opinions were unreliable. Liberty counters that the opinions were consistent with the claims file and that, consequently, it could rely on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Nonexamining Medical Personnel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark objects to Liberty's reliance on the opinions of Nurse Kaye and Dr. Miller over the opinions of three doctors who conducted physical examinations: Dr. Malanoski, Dr. Goodman, and Dr. Schur. She relies on <i>Calvert v. Firstar Finance, Inc.,</i> 409 F.3d 286, 295 (6th Cir. 2005), in which the court found that while \"reliance on a file review does not, standing alone, require the conclusion that [the insurer] acted improperly, we find that the failure to conduct a physical examination . . . may, in some cases, raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Supreme Court held in <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> 538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003), that courts \"have no warrant to require plan administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician; nor may courts impose on such administrators a discrete burden of explanation when such administrators credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician's evaluation.\" Moreover, as <i>Calvert</i> acknowledges, the absence of a physical exam is not determinative. 409 F.3d at 295. Finally, in <i>Gannon v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.,</i> 360 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir.2004), this court noted that \"we have treated a nonexamining physician's review of a claimant's file as reliable medical evidence on several occasions.\" Thus, I conclude that it was permissible for Liberty to rely on the reports of nonexamining physicians over those of examining physicians.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Nurse Kaye's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to her objection to Nurse Kaye's nonexamining role, Denmark argues that Liberty should not have relied on the opinion of a nurse over the opinions of doctors. Moreover, she contends that Kaye made an improper credibility finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark directs this panel to <i>Gellerman v. Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Co.,</i> 376 F.Supp.2d 724, 735 (S.D.Tex. 2005), in which one district court found that \"the level of deference due nurses should generally be less than that extended to doctors whose professions concentrate in the relevant field.\" Although that district court admitted that little precedent supports this exact proposition, \"other courts, at least in the context of determining medical necessity, have been wary of giving nurses broad deference.\" <i>Id.</i> at 735-36 (citing <i>C.N.S., Inc. v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 9 F.Supp.2d 194, 198 (E.D.N.Y.1998); <i>Pritt v.

On April 12, 2002, as part of the STD appeal, Dr. Schur evaluated Denmark and found that \"at least for the time being, she is clearly disabled not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" Denmark's application for LTD benefits in June 2002 then began a new phase of the process, and Denmark failed to submit any additional medical reports during this part of the process. Evaluating Denmark's LTD claim on August 8, Nurse Kaye found that \"inferences into the status of [the Plaintiff's] conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Although in fact only four months had elapsed, Dr. Schur's own limitation on his opinion to \"the time being\" and Denmark's failure to submit additional medical reports resulted in a lack of evidence showing that, on an ongoing basis, Denmark was \"unable to perform the Material and Substantial Duties\" of her own occupation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Consequently, I find that Nurse Kaye's assessment was not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also contends that Liberty should not have relied on Kaye's opinion due to an apparent credibility determination that Kaye made in her review of Denmark's file. Denmark cites <i>Smith v. Continental Casualty Co.,</i> 450 F.3d 253, 263-64 (6th Cir.2006), in which the court found that an insurer's reliance on a credibility determination by a nonexamining physician, in conjunction with its refusal to seek an independent medical examination, supported a finding that the decision was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the claim log, Kaye observed: \"[Denmark] may be self-limiting her work or social activities . . . . Barriers to recovery are clmnt's perception that she is unable to work &amp; is seeking permanent benefits.\" However, this apparent credibility determination was only one of many statements by Kaye evaluating Denmark's record. There is no indication that this statement dictated the outcome of the benefits decision. Kaye also thoroughly reviewed each piece of evidence in Denmark's file and requested a peer review \"to fully define\" Denmark's condition and to \"determine if the [restrictions/limitations] are supported.\" This review evinces a full evaluation of the evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Dr. Miller's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark challenges Liberty's reliance on the opinion of Dr. Miller on the grounds that he did not examine her, that he required objective evidence of her condition, and that he did not consider her entire medical record. For the reasons discussed <i>supra,</i> Dr. Miller's evaluation is not unreliable simply because he did not examine Denmark. And, as explained <i>infra,</i> the emphasis on objective evidence of Denmark's inability to work does not render Dr. Miller's opinion unreliable. Finally, Denmark's only evidence that Dr. Miller did not examine her entire medical file was his fax report accompanied by only three pages of medical records. However, this fact alone does not demonstrate that he did not also consider the remainder of her file; in fact, his report refers to several documents in Denmark's file that were not among those that accompanied the fax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Dr. Bomalaski's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark contends that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was unreliable because he did not identify the records that he reviewed and because his conclusion that she could work full time in her own occupation did not follow from surveillance evidence documenting her activities for a few hours at a time. Liberty counters that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was based on both the surveillance evidence and the medical information in the file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bomalaski's opinion specifically refers to the opinions of Drs. Malanoski, Goodman, Taylor and Schur, the Functional Capacities Form, and the surveillance evidence, indicating that he examined these records. He first found that \"[t]he clinical medical evidence does not clearly support severe impairment because as noted the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question not only by this reviewer but also by Dr. Schur.\" Given that Liberty does not contest the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, this statement is largely irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, Dr. Bomalaski relied on the surveillance evidence to conclude that Denmark could engage in activities such as sitting, standing, walking, driving, reading, and lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\" meaning \"up to 1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able to lift a gallon of water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in car from grocery cart.\" Dr. Bomalaski concluded that \"Denmark is capable of working full time in a primarily sedentary position within the limitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities Form.\" His characterization of her occupation as \"primarily sedentary\" is supported by the Labor Market Survey's description of the physical demands as \"sedentary to light.\" Moreover, while his conclusion that she can perform the duties of her occupation does not follow necessarily from the surveillance evidence, it is not contradicted by objective evidence of Denmark's functional limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Requirement of Objective Evidence of Inability to Work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also contends that it was unreasonable for Liberty to require her to produce objective evidence of her inability to work. In evaluating the STD claim, Kaye sought a peer review from Dr. Miller asking whether \"the accompanying documentation provide[s] objective findings that would indicate a significant change in condition that was evident on or about the date of the disability (10/3/2001)[.]\" Dr. Miller responded that \"[t]here are no documented objective physical exam findings that support a decrease or significant change in this patient's physical condition.\" His conclusion is quoted and paraphrased throughout Liberty's claim log as well as in the letters denying Denmark's STD and LTD benefits claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously found it unreasonable for an insurer to require objective evidence to support a diagnosis of a condition that is not subject to verification through laboratory testing. <i>See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 320 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir.2003)(explaining that it was unreasonable for an insurer to require a claimant to provide \"clinical objective\" evidence that she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome). The district court correctly found that fibromyalgia is also a condition that is not subject to objective verification because, as Dr. Malanoski explained, it is a \"condition lacking abnormalities in blood testing or specific abnormalities in physical exam.\" In accordance with this precedent, Liberty did not base its denial of LTD benefits on reservations about Denmark's diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this court draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis, which is impermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification, and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work, which is allowed. In <i>Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America,</i> 337 F.3d 9, 17 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003), we held that \"[w]hile the diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to objective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective analysis.\" We concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the specialists that have treated Ms. Boardman in the past two years have indicated any limitations or restrictions, based on objective findings, that would preclude Ms. Boardman from performing any occupation for which she is suited. Therefore, we have determined that Ms. Boardman does not meet the definition of disability as required by the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 16-17. Thus, it fell within the parameters defined in <i>Boardman</i> for Liberty to require Denmark to provide objective evidence of functional limitations or restrictions that would prevent her from working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark attempts to distinguish <i>Boardman</i> on the ground that, unlike the plaintiff in that case, she submitted evidence of impairment rather than mere conclusions from the treating physician. Moreover, she argues that, unlike the IME in <i>Boardman,</i> the IME in this case agreed with the conclusions of the treating physician. Dr. Schur stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her muscle tone is very poor throughout; she has about 30 tender points all over, including her hands, wrists, elbows, around her shoulders, back and neck, upper back, middle and low back, as well as lower extremity. . . . [S]he has decreased abduction in both shoulders, more on the right than on the left, and decreased rotation in both shoulders, some decreased rotation in both hips. I cannot do straight leg raising on either side because of back discomfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark argues that Dr. Schur's findings provide the objective evidence that was lacking in <i>Boardman.</i> However, while Denmark is correct that Dr. Schur's evaluation does provide some objective support for her physical restrictions, it does not demonstrate objectively her inability to work because the evaluation does not sufficiently relate those restrictions either to the specific physical requirements of her job or to her overall stamina.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Consequently, Liberty's emphasis on objective evidence was not impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Reliance on Surveillance Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also argues that Liberty relied unreasonably on the surveillance evidence it obtained. She dismisses the surveillance evidence against her as \"worthless,\" emphasizing that she was never out of her house for more than a few hours at a time and that on two of the four days she did not leave her house at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty counters that the surveillance directly contradicted Denmark's self-reported limitations in her activities questionnaire. She was observed driving for up to twenty minutes at a time, when her activities questionnaire had reported that she could drive for only five minutes at a time. She was also observed lifting and carrying groceries from the store to her car and from her car to her house, when her activities questionnaire had reported that she needed help with these tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I conclude that Liberty was entitled to consider the surveillance evidence along with the other medical opinions and evidence that it had at its disposal. Liberty itself acknowledged the limitations of the evidence, explaining that the investigator \"didn't have a video camera to document [Denmark's] activities only a photo camera which can't detail how fluid her movements were and how long she was doing the activities.\" However, Denmark does not contest that she performed the activities described by the surveillance investigator, and it was not improper for Liberty to use the investigator's report and photographs in making the LTD benefit determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Refusal to Consider Social Security Determination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Denmark argues that Liberty should have reconsidered her claim in light of her favorable decision from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). As the district court correctly noted, \"[a]lthough the SSA's determination of a claimant's entitlement to social security disability benefits is not binding on disability insurers, it can be relevant to an insurer's determination whether that claimant is eligible for disability benefits.\" <i>See Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court also correctly concluded that the timing in this case forecloses Denmark's argument. Liberty initially decided Denmark's LTD claim on August 20, 2002. It then denied Denmark's appeal in a letter dated December 10, 2002, which stated that Denmark's \"administrative right of review has been exhausted and no further review will be conducted by Liberty.\" On January 13, 2004, more than thirteen months later, the SSA issued its decision for Denmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark relies heavily on <i>Calvert,</i> 409 F.3d 286, in which the Sixth Circuit held that an insurer's refusal to consider a Social Security benefits decision contributed to a finding that its decision was arbitrary and capricious. In <i>Calvert,</i> however, the SSA's decision was issued more than two years <i>before</i> Liberty denied the claimant's appeal. We have observed that \"in order to find that an insurer has abused its discretion under the contract, we would have to conclude that the insurer's eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it\" when it made its decision. <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 519 (\"[T]he final administrative decision acts as a temporal cut off point. The claimant may not come to a court and ask it to consider post-denial medical evidence in an effort to reopen the administrative decision.\"). Because the SSA decision was not available to Liberty when it made its decision, Liberty cannot be faulted for failing to factor the SSA decision into its final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying arbitrary and capricious review, I conclude that Liberty's benefits determination was supported by substantial evidence. Liberty reasonably relied on the opinions of three nonexamining medical personnel: Nurse Kaye, Dr. Miller, and Dr. Bomalaski. These reports, in conjunction with the lack of objective evidence to support Denmark's inability to work, and the surveillance evidence, provide substantial evidence to support Liberty's decision to deny Denmark's claim for LTD benefits. Finally, I cannot fault Liberty for refusing to reconsider its decision to deny benefits in light of the subsequent SSA decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Judge Selya does not join my analysis of the administrative record, he agrees with my conclusion that substantial evidence in that record supports Liberty's decision. Thus, we affirm the district court's determination that Liberty's decision to deny Denmark's claim for long term disability benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Denmark's appeal concerns only the denial of her LTD claim.

Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 320 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.2003), that Liberty's rejection of the opinions of Drs. Malanoski, Goodman, and Schur is particularly suspect because the treating physicians and the IME were in agreement. Part of the basis for our decision in <i>Cook</i> was the insurer's failure to seek an IME or subject the claimant's file to review by another physician. <i>Id.</i> at 23. However, we did not hold that, where an IME agrees with a treating physician, an insurer cannot reach an opposite conclusion as to the claimant's disability status. In fact, we stated that \"[t]here may well be cases where the opinion of the claimant's treating physician can be rejected without reliance on any contradictory medical evidence developed by the plan administrator.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, Dr. Schur's IME report was submitted as part of the STD appeals process, and Denmark submitted no additional medical reports during the subsequent LTD benefits determination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Following the denial of Denmark's LTD benefits appeal, Drs.

First Union Long-Term Disability Plan,</i> 326 F.3d 914, 918 (7th Cir.2003). In this case, however, it was Denmark and her physicians who initially claimed that her condition worsened around the date of disability.

For the reasons elucidated by Judge Lipez and by the court below, the benefits determination made by Liberty, <i>qua</i> plan fiduciary, was within the universe of plausible outcomes. Consequently, that determination was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <i>See, e.g., Leahy v.

While I must confess that the sanction&#8212;reading the report of Dr. John Bomalaski with an increased level of scrutiny&#8212;is an unorthodox one, I do not think that the sanction goes beyond the limits of the district court's authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black-letter law that district courts have wide authority to fashion sanctions that are appropriate to the circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Santiago-D&#237;az v.

The more unusual the circumstances of the misconduct, the more a need for inventiveness may arise. <i>See generally Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2002) (encouraging case-by-case review of choice of sanction because \"the circumstances attendant to noncompliance are apt to differ widely\"). Busy district courts must be able to control their dockets and to manage burgeoning case-loads effectively.

Although I would not recommend this form of sanction for everyday use, I am not prepared to say that it falls outside the extensive armamentarium of sanctions available to a federal district court. I would, therefore, unlike Judge Lipez, uphold the sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having made this point, I eschew any further elaboration. The situation is sui generis, and Judge Lipez's refusal to enforce the sanction&#8212;while mistaken in my view&#8212;is of no consequence in the long run. Either way&#8212;that is, with or without effectuating the sanction&#8212;the district court's affirmance of the benefits-denial determination merits our approbation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings me to a more important, more global area of concern. I wish to disassociate myself from the lead opinion's survey of the standard-of-review cases (which I find more nuanced than that opinion indicates) and from its conclusion that our own standard of review, most clearly set forth in <i>Doe v. Travelers Insurance Co.,</i> 167 F.3d 53, 56-57 (1st Cir.1999), requires reexamination en banc. The <i>Doe</i> standard, in my view, is not only correct but also sufficiently flexible to permit us to take into account singular factors and circumstances that might heighten conflict-of-interest concerns in a particular case. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 57 (terming the requirement that the fiduciary's determination be \"reasonable\" as \"the basic touchstone\" of our standard of review). Indeed, we have recognized that, in developing this standard of review in <i>Doe</i> and its lineal ancestor, <i>Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Co.,</i> 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.1998), \"we took into account the potential for conflict in considering whether the insurer's decision had strayed outside the bounds of reasonableness to become an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accid. Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir.2000). I have no desire to revisit this well-ploughed terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I need not wax longiloquent. It suffices to say that the <i>Doe</i> standard has served us well. I continue to believe, as I remarked in a different context, that \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" <i>United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 310 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Lawrence \"Yogi\" Berra). In my judgment, our court would do well to heed that piece of folk wisdom here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more is needed&#8212;and I doubt that it is&#8212;en banc proceedings tend to be notoriously wasteful of scarce judicial resources. There seems to me to be little point in trading a workable and battle-tested standard of review for yet another plunge into the vortex of en banc consideration&#8212;a plunge that threatens to splinter the court and to make the standard of review less transparent. Even if one assumes, for argument's sake, that our standard of review could profit from an attempted clarification with respect to \"structural conflict\" cases, the unevenness in the decisions of the various courts of appeals strongly suggests that any such undertaking should be left to the Supreme Court (when and if the Justices deem the time propitious).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these brief comments, I concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For essentially the reasons stated by Judge Lipez, I agree that we ought to reexamine our approach to reviewing an administrator's denial of benefits under a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 <i>et seq.</i> (\"ERISA\"), when those benefits stand to be paid out of the administrator's own assets. I think, however, that, even under the standard of review now in place, we should reverse the decision by Liberty Life Assurance Company (\"Liberty\") to deny long-term disability benefits to Diane Denmark. In my view, the denial \"was `unreasonable in light of the information available' to Liberty at the time of its decision.\" <i>Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 320 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir.2000)). As my view does not depend on whether a higher level of scrutiny is applied to the report of the outside physician who reviewed Denmark's file for Liberty, Dr. John Bomalaski, <i>see infra</i> note 4, I do not reach whether the district court permissibly applied a higher level of scrutiny as a sanction for Liberty's refusal to provide discovery on whether Dr. Bomalaski's employer routinely approved Liberty's benefit decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Judge Lipez's lead opinion observes, Liberty does not dispute that Denmark has fibromyalgia, but only that the condition rendered her disabled under the terms of the plan when she stopped working in October 2001. Around that time, Denmark's treating physician rated her as having a \"severe limitation of functional capacity\" and being \"incapable of physical activity,\" while her rheumatologist called her \"disabled by exhaustion and myalgia which makes it difficult for her to stay at work for any appreciable amount of time.\" At her employer's insistence, Denmark then obtained a third opinion, in the form of an independent medical examination conducted by Dr. Peter Schur (\"the IME\"). Schur found that Denmark was \"clearly disabled, not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" While he expressed hope that changes to Denmark's drug regime and increased exercise \"will improve matters so that she can get her stamina back and get back to work,\" he concluded that \"until that is accomplished, which may take months, she is clearly disabled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of this consensus among the doctors who had examined Denmark, Liberty concluded that she was not, in fact, disabled because \"there was no significant change in [her] condition\" on the date she stopped working. This rationale, however, bears no relationship to any requirement for long-term disability benefits imposed by the plan itself. Instead, it amounts to an argument that, because Denmark has suffered from fibromyalgia since at least 1996 but continued working nonetheless, she cannot rely on fibromyalgia as a reason for not working in 2001 unless she can show that her condition has worsened. The argument does not survive even minimal scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a number of other courts have recognized, there is no \"logical incompatibility between working full time and being disabled from working full time. A desperate person might force himself to work despite an illness that everyone agreed was totally disabling. Yet even a desperate person might not be able to maintain the necessary level of effort indefinitely.\" <i>Hawkins v. First Union Long-Term Disability Plan,</i> 326 F.3d 914, 918 (7th Cir.2003) (citations omitted); <i>accord Seitz v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 433 F.3d 647, 651 (8th Cir. 2006); <i>Lasser v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 344 F.3d 381, 392 (3d Cir.2003); <i>Marecek v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc.,</i> 49 F.3d 702, 706 (11th Cir.1995). In addition to its appeal as a matter of human experience, this reasoning also furthers an important policy objective, namely that \"[a] disabled person should not be punished for heroic efforts to work by being held to have forfeited his entitlement to disability benefits should he stop working.\" <i>Hawkins,</i> 326 F.3d at 918.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than engaging this line of authority here, the lead opinion sidesteps the issue, concluding that, because Denmark herself asserted that her condition had worsened at the time she stopped working, Liberty was entitled to rely on her failure to support that assertion in denying her claim. Under the plan, however, Denmark's entitlement to long-term disability payments does not depend on whether her fibromyalgia had intensified around the time she stopped working. It depends on whether she was then \"unable to perform the Material and Substantial Duties of [her] Own Occupation.\" Denmark's treating physicians, as well the independent doctor hired by her employer, all concluded that she was. Liberty could not have reasonably reached the opposite conclusion based on Denmark's failure to prove a fact that is inessential, and logically unconnected, to her contractual right to long-term disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion also downplays the importance of this factor to Liberty's ultimate decision, focusing instead on the asserted absence of objective evidence of Denmark's inability to work. But the lack of a change in Denmark's condition at the time she stopped working was the sole explanation the insurer gave for denying both short-term and long-term disability benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> In any event, Denmark presented objective evidence of her inability to work in the form of the IME, where Dr. Schur observed \"tender points all over,\" a decreased range of motion in the shoulders and hips, and \"back discomfort\" during an extensive physical examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion treats this as \"some objective evidence of [Denmark's] physical restrictions,\" but concludes that \"it does not demonstrate objectively her inability to work because the evaluation does not specifically relate those restrictions either to the physical requirements of the job or to her <i>overall stamina</i>\" (emphasis added). As this passage recognizes, a condition that saps a claimant of her energy would make her unable to perform the duties of nearly any occupation. <i>See, e.g., Rose v. Shalala,</i> 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.1994). Dr. Schur's report characterizes Denmark's fibromyalgia in precisely that way: he endorses a course of treatment \"to try and cut down on pain and help her sleep . . . so that she isn't so tired and, hopefully, can get some of her stamina back,\" but opines that, \"until that is accomplished, which may take months, she is clearly disabled not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" The IME therefore expressly relates the objective manifestations of Denmark's condition&#8212; the pain Dr. Schur observed in various points throughout her body&#8212;to her inability to work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this diagnosis, our decision in <i>Boardman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 337 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2003), does not support the outcome reached by the majority. In <i>Boardman,</i> we upheld the insurer's denial of long-term disability benefits to the claimant based on two factors: \"(1) the absence of adequate evidence in [her] medical records indicating that [her] condition imposed limitation on her ability to perform the material and substantial duties of her own occupation . . . and (2) the evidence to the contrary provided in the [IME] reports. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. Here, in stark contrast, the IME unequivocally concludes, based on objective observations, that Denmark is disabled, and that conclusion squares with the opinions of her treating physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty's contrary finding, then, much more closely resembles the decision we overturned in <i>Cook.</i> There, as here, the physician who had examined the claimant opined that she was disabled from fatigue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> but Liberty relied on purported defects in the opinion&#8212;identified by an in-house analyst who had <i>not</i> examined the claimant&#8212;to conclude otherwise. 320 F.3d at 20-23. In criticizing this approach, we suggested that an insurer who doubts a treating doctor's diagnosis ordinarily should seek a second opinion, either in the form of peer review or an IME. <i>Id.</i> at 23. Here, of course, the IME confirmed the diagnoses of Denmark's treating physicians. So Liberty reached the contrary conclusion based on purported defects in the IME identified by an in-house analyst who had not examined Denmark&#8212;using, in essence, the same approach we took such a dim view of in <i>Cook.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Liberty's efforts to discount the IME do not hold up, even under our deferential standard of review. In seeking to diminish Dr. Schur's conclusion that Denmark is disabled, Liberty's in-house nurse argued that \"since an IME provides an examination on a specific date in time, its scope is limited on that inferences to the status of conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Under this logic, however, a medical examination&#8212;which, by its nature, always occurs \"on a specific date in time\"&#8212;can never \"accurately assess\" the patient's condition prior to having walked into the examination room. Either that premise is demonstrably false, or a patient is subjected to a pointless exercise every time she undergoes an IME. <i>Cf. Cook,</i> 320 F.3d at 23. Liberty's reasons for spurning Dr. Schur's opinion here, then, are no more supportable than its reasons for spurning the treating doctor's opinion in <i>Cook.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize, as we did in <i>Cook,</i> the possibility of \"cases where the opinion of the claimant's treating physician can be rejected without reliance on any contradictory medical evidence developed by the plan administrator.\" 320 F.3d at 23. But rejecting the opinions of the claimant's treating physicians, <i>and</i> the corroborating view of an independent medical examiner, ought to require a considerably stronger justification than the one relied on here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Accordingly, I would overturn Liberty's denial of long-term disability benefits to Denmark, even under our present standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Liberty's letter reaffirming its denial of long-term disability benefits does cite the absence of \"support of a severity of impairment that would preclude Ms. Denmark from performing her own occupational job duties,\" but, as the lead opinion observes, a contemporaneous explanation in Liberty's case log again notes the \"limited evidence to support a need to cease working.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The lead opinion devalues Dr. Schur's report based on its view that it does not speak to the current level of Denmark's fatigue or its effect on her ability to do her job. But, again, the report states that Denmark's fatigue has left her unable to work or to care for her household. I do not know how the report could have described the level of fatigue any more clearly, or pertinently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The claimant in<i>Cook</i> suffered from asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia. 320 F.3d at 15.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Liberty also subjected the IME to peer review by Dr. Bomalaski, who concluded that \"[t]he clinical medical evidence does not clearly support severe impairment because as noted, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question. . . .\" As Judge Lipez notes, this conclusion is irrelevant because Liberty has never contested the diagnosis itself. The closest Dr. Bomalaski's report comes to supporting Liberty's position that Denmark is not disabled is its observation that \"[l]imitations of ability to function are difficult to assess. . . .\" The report therefore does little to bolster Liberty's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The lead opinion finds Liberty's criticism of the IME \"not unreasonable given that Dr. Schur himself had limited his evaluation to `the time being.'\" While Dr. Schur's report indeed contains the phrase \"at least for the time being,\" it is clearly not intended to limit Dr. Schur's opinion retrospectively, but prospectively: in both the paragraph immediately preceding the phrase and the sentence immediately following it, Dr. Schur suggests interventions for Denmark that \"hopefully will improve matters, so that she can get her stamina back and get back to work.\" Accordingly, I do not see how the phrase \"for the time being\" can reasonably be read to support Liberty's exceedingly narrow view of Dr. Schur's opinion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> While Liberty also relied on its surveillance of Denmark to support its decision, I agree with the district court that this evidence does not speak to whether she can consistently work full days as her job requires.

In fact, the issues are so difficult that this case has generated three opinions. Although I agree with the district court that the insurer's denial of disability benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious, I believe that our circuit should reexamine in an en banc proceeding the standard of review that applies when an insurer both reviews and pays disability claims, resulting in a structural conflict of interest. Judge Selya concurs in the judgment affirming the decision of the district court, but disagrees with my assessment of the standard of review. Finally, although Judge Howard dissents, believing that the disability benefits denial was arbitrary and capricious under our current standard of review, he joins me in concluding that our circuit should reexamine our standard of review in these structural conflict cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Diane Denmark (\"Denmark\") is a former participant in a group long term disability insurance plan offered through her employer, GenRad, Inc.

Appellee Liberty Life Assurance Company (\"Liberty\"), the plan insurer, denied Denmark's claim for long term disability benefits on August 20, 2002. After exhausting her administrative appeals, Denmark filed suit.

This opinion will recite them here in some detail to facilitate the analysis of the issues raised by the parties. Denmark began working at GenRad on April 2, 1973 as a Group Leader in Manufacturing Inspection.

Liberty served as the claims administrator for the STD plan, providing an initial claims review and a decision for STD claims submitted by GenRad employees. GenRad then reviewed appeals of STD benefit denials and paid meritorious claims. For the LTD plan, Liberty both made benefits determinations and paid for claims out of its own assets. At some point in late 2001, Teradyne acquired GenRad, but Denmark's disability benefits under the two plans remained the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Nurse Kaye again reviewed Denmark's medical file, focusing on the information added since the conclusion of Liberty's initial review of Denmark's claim on December 10, 2001. Since that time, Denmark had submitted Dr. Goodman's letter of December 11, 2001, Dr. Malanoski's letter of January 14, 2002 and Dr. Schur's IME report as part of the STD appeals process conducted by Teradyne.

She also stated that she spends fourteen hours a day in bed and needs help grocery shopping, carrying groceries, and washing and drying her hair.

This description listed the physical requirements of Denmark's job as \"Light,\" stating that she would need to lift, carry or pull 20 pounds \"occasionally,\" up to ten pounds \"frequently,\" and smaller weights \"constantly.\" The job could include frequent walking and standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her review, Kaye again concluded that there had been no \"significant change\" in Denmark's condition around her claimed date of disability. Denmark had had fibromyalgia for six years and \"managed to maintain occupational functioning during that time, even during periods of exacerbation. This diagnosis has been confirmed by multiple providers.\" Kaye limited the significance of the IME report by Dr. Schur, noting that \"[s]ince an IME provides an examination on a specific date in time, its scope is limited in that inferences to the status of conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Finally, Kaye questioned the extent of Denmark's disability, stating that she \"may be self-limiting her work or social activities, with no objective medical basis to support [restrictions and limitations]\" and that her \"perception that she is unable to work &amp; is seeking permanent benefits\" was a \"barrier[ ] to recovery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 20, 2002, Liberty denied Denmark's LTD benefits claim, citing the reports of Drs.

She provided all of her medical records, including a report from a psychological examination by Dr. Taylor that was completed on July 24, 2002, but apparently was not included in Nurse Kaye's review. Dr. Taylor described Denmark's illness as \"well documented,\" and concluded: \"She presents in an honest and straightforward manner and I suspect that she has some significant physical limitations, as noted by Dr. Schur, M.D. I do not believe that her depression, in and of itself, is of sufficient severity to prevent her from gainful employment.\" Again, however, Denmark did not add any additional medical reports regarding her physical limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty arranged for surveillance of Denmark to monitor her activity level on October 24 and November 2, 4, and 5, 2002. On October 24, the investigator observed Denmark running errands for about two and a half hours. The investigator photographed her lifting groceries such as a gallon of water with one hand and placing them in her car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The investigator also reported that Denmark was \"walking and moving in a fluid non-obstructed manner, bending and lifting items such as a case of soda and gallon of milk without difficulties.\" On another day Denmark ran errands for about an hour and a half, and on the last two days the investigator did not observe any activity. Liberty's claim log notes that the activity check \"found her to be very active running errands,\" but that \"the investigator had no video camera on him . . . so we only have stills of her and not actual moving footage.

He stated that the primary diagnosis \"may be\" fibromyalgia, but that \"[t]he physical examination and testing do not support the diagnosis of Ms. Denmark's treating physicians, at least within the records provided. There is no documentation of laboratory testing ruling out coexisting causes of myalgia.\" Dr. Bomalaski stated that \"the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question not only by this reviewer but also by Dr. Schur, the consultant rheumatologist who had examined Ms. Denmark at the request of her treating rheumatologist, Dr. Goodman.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bomalaski also evaluated Denmark's functional limitations. Relying on the surveillance evidence, he noted that she can engage in activities such as sitting, standing, walking, driving, reading, and lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\" meaning \"up to 1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able to lift a gallon of water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in car from grocery cart.\" He concluded that Denmark was \"capable of working full time in a primarily sedentary position within the limitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities Form.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, 2002, Liberty informed Denmark's attorney that Liberty was upholding its decision to deny LTD benefits. The denial letter states that the review found no impairment that would prevent Denmark from performing her own occupational job duties. Liberty's case log states that \"there was limited evidence to support a need to cease working and she was able in fact to work at her own occupation for long hours. There was no indication of what changed in her condition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Social Security Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 2004, an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") issued a decision that Denmark was entitled to Social Security disability benefits retroactive to October 2, 2001, the day before she stopped working. The ALJ concluded that Denmark had been \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act since that date, because her \"severe pain, limitations, and restrictions . . . prevent [ ] her from performing her past relevant work\" and because she has suffered a \"substantial loss of ability necessary to perform a significant number of jobs\" identified as unskilled sedentary occupations. The ALJ noted that Denmark's testimony was credible and gave controlling weight to additional reports that Drs. Goodman and Hack submitted for the Social Security benefits determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this favorable decision, Denmark again requested that Liberty review the denial of LTD benefits and submitted a new letter from Dr. Goodman. However, Liberty replied on June 3, 2004 that the Social Security disability benefits decision did not affect its prior denial determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 2004, Denmark filed an action against Liberty in Superior Court in Massachusetts seeking LTD benefits allegedly due under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1132(a)(1)(B), (2) and (3), and for breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> On October 27, Liberty removed the case to federal district court in Massachusetts. Denmark did not pursue her breach of contract claim in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery was completed, both parties moved for summary judgment. In a detailed opinion, the district court granted summary judgment for Liberty. The court found that, because the ERISA plan granted discretionary authority to Liberty, the benefits decision should be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard. Although the court acknowledged the potential financial conflict of interest presented by Liberty's dual responsibility for making benefits determinations and paying claims, it found no evidence that this financial arrangement had risen to the level of an actual conflict that would warrant altering the standard of review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court then thoroughly examined the evidence supporting Liberty's denial of LTD benefits to Denmark, ultimately concluding that this denial, supported by substantial evidence, was neither arbitrary nor capricious. In light of the record and precedents, this decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

In the ERISA context, however, we have held that \"the district court sits more as an appellate tribunal than as a trial court\"; instead of considering affidavits submitted to the court, it \"evaluates the reasonableness of an administrative determination in light of the record compiled before the plan fiduciary.\" <i>Leahy v.

However, the issue of what standard of review this court applies to the administrative record can raise more difficult questions. Denmark makes three arguments in support of <i>de novo</i> review. First, she claims that <i>de novo</i> review is warranted because Liberty was not granted discretionary authority under the terms of the LTD plan. Second, she requests that we reconsider our precedent and hold that, because Liberty both reviews and pays claims, there is a structural conflict of interest requiring <i>de novo</i> review. Finally, she argues that the entire review process was \"infected with conflict.\" This opinion will address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Section 7 of the policy provides that \"Liberty shall possess the authority, in its sole discretion, to construe the terms of this policy and to determine benefit eligibility hereunder. Liberty's decisions regarding construction of the terms of this policy and benefit eligibility shall be conclusive and binding.\" In light of this language, the district court concluded that \"the record unequivocally shows that Liberty is a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA because it acted within the capacity of manager and administrator of GenRad's LTD benefits plan,\" and consequently held that the decision denying Denmark LTD benefits was subject to arbitrary and capricious review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark argues that Liberty \"granted discretion to itself without authority to do so.\" While acknowledging that the language in Section 7 could provide a sufficient grant of discretionary authority, she protests that in this case authority was not properly delegated to Liberty in an ERISA plan instrument. Denmark first contends that the LTD policy in the record was not an ERISA plan instrument, but rather an insurance policy that Liberty itself wrote. She then asserts that GenRad never properly delegated discretionary authority to Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The improper delegation argument involves the interaction of several provisions of ERISA. As an employer who established the LTD plan, GenRad &#8212; later Teradyne &#8212; is the plan's sponsor. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(16)(B). Because the LTD policy does not designate an administrator, GenRad is also the administrator. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1002(16)(A). In light of GenRad's statutorily defined role as plan administrator, Denmark argues that the LTD policy did not contain a sufficient delegation of fiduciary authority from GenRad to Liberty. ERISA states that \"[t]he instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly provide for procedures (A) for allocating fiduciary responsibilities . . . among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named fiduciaries to designate persons . . . to carry out fiduciary responsibilities.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1105(c)(1). Denmark thus argues that the LTD policy needed to designate Liberty to carry out fiduciary responsibilities with an explicit statement such as \"GenRad vests Liberty with fiduciary responsibility including making benefit decisions.\" Liberty counters that an insurance policy can serve as an ERISA plan instrument. Moreover, it argues that the lack of explicit delegation is irrelevant because, for all practical purposes, it performed the role of a fiduciary of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1102(a)(1), \"[e]very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\" Courts have held that an insurance policy may serve as this written instrument. <i>See, e.g., Krohn v.

Section 4 also provides a detailed description of benefits. These provisions satisfy requirements (1) and (4). As previously quoted, Section 7 explains that \"Liberty shall possess the authority, in its sole discretion, to construe the terms of the policy and to determine benefit eligibility hereunder.\" This provision satisfies requirement (2). Section 7 also states: \"This Policy may be changed in whole or in part. Only an officer of Liberty can approve a change.

We denied the petition, and she now renews her argument that, where an insurer both reviews and pays claims, there is a \"structural irreconcilable conflict of interest that requires an initial de novo review of an adverse benefit decision.\" Liberty responds that the financial self-interest of an insurer who both reviews and pays claims is counterbalanced by the insurer's desire to remain attractive to employers, and emphasizes the desirability of a simple procedure for reviewing denials of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuits have adopted varying approaches to the issue of whether the structural conflict that arises when an insurer both reviews and pays claims justifies less deferential review. In addition to this court, the Seventh and Second Circuits have held that a structural conflict alone is insufficient to alter the standard of review. Instead, these circuits require an actual showing that the conflict of interest affected the benefits decision before there will be any alteration in the standard of review. <i>See Rud v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793385\"><a href=\"/opinion/793385/allan-e-rud-v-liberty-life-assurance-company-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 776-77 (7th Cir.2006)(holding that a structural conflict of interest, without more, does not affect the standard of review); <i>Sullivan v.

Of these six circuits, all except one have adopted a \"sliding scale\" approach to the standard of review, in which the court applies less deferential review to the extent that a conflict of interest exists. <i>See, e.g., Fought v.

It first determines, under <i>de novo</i> review, whether the decision was wrong; if it was, and if an inherent conflict of interest exists, \"the burden shifts to the claims administrator to prove that its interpretation of the plan is not tainted by self-interest.\" <i>HCA Health Servs., Inc. v.

Circuit has not yet established a standard of review in cases involving a structural conflict of interest. <i>See Wagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan-Non Bargained Program,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186441\"><a href=\"/opinion/186441/wagener-marian-v-sbc-pension-benefit/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 402 (D.C.Cir.2005)(finding that the result would be the same under either arbitrary and capricious or de novo review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This survey of the circuits reflects the difficulty of the standard of review issue. It remains an issue of considerable importance, as the number of amicus curiae briefs filed in this case demonstrates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> However, this court's prior decision in <i>Doyle</i> cannot be overruled by a panel of the court. Thus, we are bound by our precedent, and must apply arbitrary and capricious review in situations where the conflict of interest is purely structural.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I think our standard of review in cases in which an insurer also makes benefits determinations is increasingly difficult to defend. In light of the development of the law since we first addressed the issue in <i>Doyle,</i> and because our position is now a minority view, I think it is time to reexamine the standard of review issue in an en banc proceeding. Although Judge Howard dissents from the judgment agreed to by Judge Selya and myself, he agrees with me, as indicated in his dissent, that we should reexamine the standard of review issue. In such a proceeding, I would be inclined to favor the \"sliding scale\" approach explicitly adopted by the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits. Under this approach, \"`the fiduciary decision will be entitled to some deference, but this deference will be lessened to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict.'\" <i>Pinto,</i> 214 F.3d at 391 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Other Evidence of Conflict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This panel must also consider, however, whether other evidence, in addition to this structural conflict, warrants alteration of the standard of review. In her broadest argument, Denmark asserts that \"[t]he District Court should have reviewed the entire Liberty analysis with no less than a heightened standard of review, because the entire claims process . . . was infected with conflict.\" In support of this argument, she contends that Liberty chose to rely on unreliable medical opinions and improperly imposed a requirement that she produce objective evidence of her inability to work, thereby demonstrating its bias against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is essentially another request that we reject our precedents in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe.</i> The evidence to which Denmark refers is part of the record on which Liberty based its benefits decision, and is thus properly evaluated under the \"essential requirement of reasonableness\" that we apply to that decision, <i>Doe,</i> 167 F.3d at 57, rather than as evidence of a conflict of interest. As the district court acknowledged, <i>Wright</i> entertained&#8212;and rejected&#8212;a plaintiff's claim that there was a conflict of interest based on certain factual circumstances surrounding the claim. 402 F.3d at 76. Here, however, the evidence in question falls within the scope of the reasonableness analysis, and this opinion will consider it using that framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the district court, Denmark made one additional attempt to demonstrate a conflict of interest. She filed a motion for discovery of information relating to the financial relationship between Liberty and NMR, arguing that such information would help her establish that Liberty referred claims to NMR for reasons of financial self-interest. The district court granted the motion and ordered Liberty to produce information about how much money it paid NMR, answer Denmark's interrogatory as to how many files it referred to NMR, and stipulate the number of cases in which NMR has accepted a claim. Liberty produced information showing that between 2001 and 2003 it had paid $2,004,656 and referred 1,204 files to NMR, but stated that it was unable to make the stipulation described by the district court \"due to the very substantial burden and expense that would be involved in retrieving and manually reviewing the over 1,200 claims files that were referred to NMR physicians from 2001 to 2003.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its order granting summary judgment to Liberty, the district court interpreted \"the First Circuit's reluctant concurrence with past precedent in <i>Wright</i> as a suggestion that additional evidence of the ERISA plan administrator's efforts to maximize profits could be enough to turn apparent conflict into real conflict.\" Moreover, it stated that the discovery Denmark requested was appropriate because \"[a] claimant cannot meet the burden of demonstrating a conflict of interest if she cannot supplement the record with relevant evidence.\" To sanction Liberty for its refusal to comply with this discovery order, the district court determined that it would \"draw the inference suggested by the Plaintiff, namely that NMR has not found in favor of a single claimant in connection with the 1,204 Liberty files referred to NMR during the years 2001-2003.\" The court concluded that, if NMR never found in favor of claimants in its evaluations, Liberty would have a \"`clear incentive' to contract with NMR to obtain peer reviews that support denial of disability benefits, justifying a review with `more bite.'\" However, the court also determined that to \"calibrate the sanction\" it would apply the heightened standard of review only to Liberty's reliance on Dr. Bomalaski's opinion because no other evidence in the record would have been affected by the conflict with NMR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark does not advance the argument that, under this court's existing precedent, the evidence of Liberty's relationship with NMR would, in combination with the existing structural conflict, justify some degree of heightened review not only of Dr. Bomalaski's opinion but also of the entire record. Liberty, however, protests both the discovery that the district court allowed and the sanction that the court imposed for its refusal to comply. It urges that we disregard the discovery admitted into the record and reject the heightened standard of review that the district court applied to Dr. Bomalaski's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Denmark's silence on the link between the particularized conflict evidence and an altered standard of review for the entire record, we need not decide whether such alteration of the overall standard of review would have been appropriate under our precedents suggesting that proof of an actual conflict (rather than a structural conflict) might justify review with \"more bite.\" However, the panel has divided on its response to the sanction imposed by the district court for Liberty's refusal to comply with the discovery order. Judge Selya concludes that the sanction was a proper exercise of the district court's authority. Judge Howard does not reach the sanction issue because his view of the case does not depend on whether a higher level of scrutiny is applied to the report of Dr. Bomalaski. In my view, the district court erred in applying heightened review to Dr. Bomalaski's opinion as a sanction for failure to comply with the discovery it orders. This piecemeal approach to the standard of review is not supported by any precedents that I could find.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that the district court's implementation of its piecemeal approach demonstrates the problem with such an approach. It first applied heightened review to conclude that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was \"not fully supported, although still relevant.\" It then factored its skeptical assessment of Dr. Bomalaski's opinion into the overall arbitrary and capricious analysis, essentially running Dr. Bomalaski's opinion through two levels of analysis. Although arguably manageable as a mode of analysis here because this case involves only one expert's opinion, one can easily imagine cases in which this piecemeal approach would be unmanageable if conflicts affected numerous, discrete portions of the record. I cannot approve such an unwieldy approach to the standard of review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Therefore, in applying that arbitrary and capricious standard of review as articulated in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe</i> to the administrative record, I will not apply heightened review to the report submitted by Dr. Bomalaski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no reason to depart from the arbitrary and capricious standard, I turn to the administrative record, applying that standard as articulated in <i>Doyle</i> and <i>Doe.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under arbitrary and capricious review, this court will uphold an administrator's decision to deny benefits to a beneficiary if the decision was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence. <i>Wright,</i> 402 F.3d at 74.

On April 12, 2002, as part of the STD appeal, Dr. Schur evaluated Denmark and found that \"at least for the time being, she is clearly disabled not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" Denmark's application for LTD benefits in June 2002 then began a new phase of the process, and Denmark failed to submit any additional medical reports during this part of the process. Evaluating Denmark's LTD claim on August 8, Nurse Kaye found that \"inferences into the status of [the Plaintiff's] conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Although in fact only four months had elapsed, Dr. Schur's own limitation on his opinion to \"the time being\" and Denmark's failure to submit additional medical reports resulted in a lack of evidence showing that, on an ongoing basis, Denmark was \"unable to perform the Material and Substantial Duties\" of her own occupation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Consequently, I find that Nurse Kaye's assessment was not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also contends that Liberty should not have relied on Kaye's opinion due to an apparent credibility determination that Kaye made in her review of Denmark's file. Denmark cites <i>Smith v. Continental Casualty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794560\"><a href=\"/opinion/794560/jennifer-lee-smith-v-continental-casualty-co-countrywide-credit/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 263-64 (6th Cir.2006), in which the court found that an insurer's reliance on a credibility determination by a nonexamining physician, in conjunction with its refusal to seek an independent medical examination, supported a finding that the decision was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the claim log, Kaye observed: \"[Denmark] may be self-limiting her work or social activities . . . . Barriers to recovery are clmnt's perception that she is unable to work &amp; is seeking permanent benefits.\" However, this apparent credibility determination was only one of many statements by Kaye evaluating Denmark's record. There is no indication that this statement dictated the outcome of the benefits decision. Kaye also thoroughly reviewed each piece of evidence in Denmark's file and requested a peer review \"to fully define\" Denmark's condition and to \"determine if the [restrictions/limitations] are supported.\" This review evinces a full evaluation of the evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Dr. Miller's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark challenges Liberty's reliance on the opinion of Dr. Miller on the grounds that he did not examine her, that he required objective evidence of her condition, and that he did not consider her entire medical record. For the reasons discussed <i>supra,</i> Dr. Miller's evaluation is not unreliable simply because he did not examine Denmark. And, as explained <i>infra,</i> the emphasis on objective evidence of Denmark's inability to work does not render Dr. Miller's opinion unreliable. Finally, Denmark's only evidence that Dr. Miller did not examine her entire medical file was his fax report accompanied by only three pages of medical records. However, this fact alone does not demonstrate that he did not also consider the remainder of her file; in fact, his report refers to several documents in Denmark's file that were not among those that accompanied the fax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Dr. Bomalaski's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark contends that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was unreliable because he did not identify the records that he reviewed and because his conclusion that she could work full time in her own occupation did not follow from surveillance evidence documenting her activities for a few hours at a time. Liberty counters that Dr. Bomalaski's opinion was based on both the surveillance evidence and the medical information in the file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Bomalaski's opinion specifically refers to the opinions of Drs. Malanoski, Goodman, Taylor and Schur, the Functional Capacities Form, and the surveillance evidence, indicating that he examined these records. He first found that \"[t]he clinical medical evidence does not clearly support severe impairment because as noted the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question not only by this reviewer but also by Dr. Schur.\" Given that Liberty does not contest the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, this statement is largely irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, Dr. Bomalaski relied on the surveillance evidence to conclude that Denmark could engage in activities such as sitting, standing, walking, driving, reading, and lifting up to twenty pounds \"occasionally,\" meaning \"up to 1/3 of the time,\" and observed that she is \"able to lift a gallon of water (10 pounds) with one hand and place in car from grocery cart.\" Dr. Bomalaski concluded that \"Denmark is capable of working full time in a primarily sedentary position within the limitations and restrictions noted on the Functional Capacities Form.\" His characterization of her occupation as \"primarily sedentary\" is supported by the Labor Market Survey's description of the physical demands as \"sedentary to light.\" Moreover, while his conclusion that she can perform the duties of her occupation does not follow necessarily from the surveillance evidence, it is not contradicted by objective evidence of Denmark's functional limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Requirement of Objective Evidence of Inability to Work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also contends that it was unreasonable for Liberty to require her to produce objective evidence of her inability to work. In evaluating the STD claim, Kaye sought a peer review from Dr. Miller asking whether \"the accompanying documentation provide[s] objective findings that would indicate a significant change in condition that was evident on or about the date of the disability (10/3/2001)[.]\" Dr. Miller responded that \"[t]here are no documented objective physical exam findings that support a decrease or significant change in this patient's physical condition.\" His conclusion is quoted and paraphrased throughout Liberty's claim log as well as in the letters denying Denmark's STD and LTD benefits claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously found it unreasonable for an insurer to require objective evidence to support a diagnosis of a condition that is not subject to verification through laboratory testing. <i>See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2003)(explaining that it was unreasonable for an insurer to require a claimant to provide \"clinical objective\" evidence that she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome). The district court correctly found that fibromyalgia is also a condition that is not subject to objective verification because, as Dr. Malanoski explained, it is a \"condition lacking abnormalities in blood testing or specific abnormalities in physical exam.\" In accordance with this precedent, Liberty did not base its denial of LTD benefits on reservations about Denmark's diagnosis of fibromyalgia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this court draws a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis, which is impermissible for a condition such as fibromyalgia that does not lend itself to objective verification, and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work, which is allowed. In <i>Boardman v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200561\"><a href=\"/opinion/200561/boardman-v-prudential-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 17 n. 5 (1st Cir.2003), we held that \"[w]hile the diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to objective clinical findings, the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective analysis.\" We concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the specialists that have treated Ms. Boardman in the past two years have indicated any limitations or restrictions, based on objective findings, that would preclude Ms. Boardman from performing any occupation for which she is suited. Therefore, we have determined that Ms. Boardman does not meet the definition of disability as required by the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 16-17. Thus, it fell within the parameters defined in <i>Boardman</i> for Liberty to require Denmark to provide objective evidence of functional limitations or restrictions that would prevent her from working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark attempts to distinguish <i>Boardman</i> on the ground that, unlike the plaintiff in that case, she submitted evidence of impairment rather than mere conclusions from the treating physician. Moreover, she argues that, unlike the IME in <i>Boardman,</i> the IME in this case agreed with the conclusions of the treating physician. Dr. Schur stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her muscle tone is very poor throughout; she has about 30 tender points all over, including her hands, wrists, elbows, around her shoulders, back and neck, upper back, middle and low back, as well as lower extremity. . . . [S]he has decreased abduction in both shoulders, more on the right than on the left, and decreased rotation in both shoulders, some decreased rotation in both hips. I cannot do straight leg raising on either side because of back discomfort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark argues that Dr. Schur's findings provide the objective evidence that was lacking in <i>Boardman.</i> However, while Denmark is correct that Dr. Schur's evaluation does provide some objective support for her physical restrictions, it does not demonstrate objectively her inability to work because the evaluation does not sufficiently relate those restrictions either to the specific physical requirements of her job or to her overall stamina.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Consequently, Liberty's emphasis on objective evidence was not impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Reliance on Surveillance Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denmark also argues that Liberty relied unreasonably on the surveillance evidence it obtained. She dismisses the surveillance evidence against her as \"worthless,\" emphasizing that she was never out of her house for more than a few hours at a time and that on two of the four days she did not leave her house at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty counters that the surveillance directly contradicted Denmark's self-reported limitations in her activities questionnaire. She was observed driving for up to twenty minutes at a time, when her activities questionnaire had reported that she could drive for only five minutes at a time. She was also observed lifting and carrying groceries from the store to her car and from her car to her house, when her activities questionnaire had reported that she needed help with these tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I conclude that Liberty was entitled to consider the surveillance evidence along with the other medical opinions and evidence that it had at its disposal. Liberty itself acknowledged the limitations of the evidence, explaining that the investigator \"didn't have a video camera to document [Denmark's] activities only a photo camera which can't detail how fluid her movements were and how long she was doing the activities.\" However, Denmark does not contest that she performed the activities described by the surveillance investigator, and it was not improper for Liberty to use the investigator's report and photographs in making the LTD benefit determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Refusal to Consider Social Security Determination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Denmark argues that Liberty should have reconsidered her claim in light of her favorable decision from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). As the district court correctly noted, \"[a]lthough the SSA's determination of a claimant's entitlement to social security disability benefits is not binding on disability insurers, it can be relevant to an insurer's determination whether that claimant is eligible for disability benefits.\" <i>See Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court also correctly concluded that the timing in this case forecloses Denmark's argument. Liberty initially decided Denmark's LTD claim on August 20, 2002. It then denied Denmark's appeal in a letter dated December 10, 2002, which stated that Denmark's \"administrative right of review has been exhausted and no further review will be conducted by Liberty.\" On January 13, 2004, more than thirteen months later, the SSA issued its decision for Denmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Denmark relies heavily on <i>Calvert,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></span>, in which the Sixth Circuit held that an insurer's refusal to consider a Social Security benefits decision contributed to a finding that its decision was arbitrary and capricious. In <i>Calvert,</i> however, the SSA's decision was issued more than two years <i>before</i> Liberty denied the claimant's appeal. We have observed that \"in order to find that an insurer has abused its discretion under the contract, we would have to conclude that the insurer's eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it\" when it made its decision. <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins.

The claimant may not come to a court and ask it to consider post-denial medical evidence in an effort to reopen the administrative decision.\"). Because the SSA decision was not available to Liberty when it made its decision, Liberty cannot be faulted for failing to factor the SSA decision into its final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying arbitrary and capricious review, I conclude that Liberty's benefits determination was supported by substantial evidence. Liberty reasonably relied on the opinions of three nonexamining medical personnel: Nurse Kaye, Dr. Miller, and Dr. Bomalaski. These reports, in conjunction with the lack of objective evidence to support Denmark's inability to work, and the surveillance evidence, provide substantial evidence to support Liberty's decision to deny Denmark's claim for LTD benefits. Finally, I cannot fault Liberty for refusing to reconsider its decision to deny benefits in light of the subsequent SSA decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Judge Selya does not join my analysis of the administrative record, he agrees with my conclusion that substantial evidence in that record supports Liberty's decision.

Even if one assumes, for argument's sake, that our standard of review could profit from an attempted clarification with respect to \"structural conflict\" cases, the unevenness in the decisions of the various courts of appeals strongly suggests that any such undertaking should be left to the Supreme Court (when and if the Justices deem the time propitious).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these brief comments, I concur in the judgment of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For essentially the reasons stated by Judge Lipez, I agree that we ought to reexamine our approach to reviewing an administrator's denial of benefits under a plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 <i>et seq.</i> (\"ERISA\"), when those benefits stand to be paid out of the administrator's own assets. I think, however, that, even under the standard of review now in place, we should reverse the decision by Liberty Life Assurance Company (\"Liberty\") to deny long-term disability benefits to Diane Denmark. In my view, the denial \"was `unreasonable in light of the information available' to Liberty at the time of its decision.\" <i>Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting <i>Pari-Fasano v.

As my view does not depend on whether a higher level of scrutiny is applied to the report of the outside physician who reviewed Denmark's file for Liberty, Dr. John Bomalaski, <i>see infra</i> note 4, I do not reach whether the district court permissibly applied a higher level of scrutiny as a sanction for Liberty's refusal to provide discovery on whether Dr. Bomalaski's employer routinely approved Liberty's benefit decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Judge Lipez's lead opinion observes, Liberty does not dispute that Denmark has fibromyalgia, but only that the condition rendered her disabled under the terms of the plan when she stopped working in October 2001. Around that time, Denmark's treating physician rated her as having a \"severe limitation of functional capacity\" and being \"incapable of physical activity,\" while her rheumatologist called her \"disabled by exhaustion and myalgia which makes it difficult for her to stay at work for any appreciable amount of time.\" At her employer's insistence, Denmark then obtained a third opinion, in the form of an independent medical examination conducted by Dr. Peter Schur (\"the IME\"). Schur found that Denmark was \"clearly disabled, not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" While he expressed hope that changes to Denmark's drug regime and increased exercise \"will improve matters so that she can get her stamina back and get back to work,\" he concluded that \"until that is accomplished, which may take months, she is clearly disabled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of this consensus among the doctors who had examined Denmark, Liberty concluded that she was not, in fact, disabled because \"there was no significant change in [her] condition\" on the date she stopped working. This rationale, however, bears no relationship to any requirement for long-term disability benefits imposed by the plan itself. Instead, it amounts to an argument that, because Denmark has suffered from fibromyalgia since at least 1996 but continued working nonetheless, she cannot rely on fibromyalgia as a reason for not working in 2001 unless she can show that her condition has worsened. The argument does not survive even minimal scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a number of other courts have recognized, there is no \"logical incompatibility between working full time and being disabled from working full time.

In addition to its appeal as a matter of human experience, this reasoning also furthers an important policy objective, namely that \"[a] disabled person should not be punished for heroic efforts to work by being held to have forfeited his entitlement to disability benefits should he stop working.\" <i>Hawkins,</i> 326 F.3d at 918.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than engaging this line of authority here, the lead opinion sidesteps the issue, concluding that, because Denmark herself asserted that her condition had worsened at the time she stopped working, Liberty was entitled to rely on her failure to support that assertion in denying her claim. Under the plan, however, Denmark's entitlement to long-term disability payments does not depend on whether her fibromyalgia had intensified around the time she stopped working. It depends on whether she was then \"unable to perform the Material and Substantial Duties of [her] Own Occupation.\" Denmark's treating physicians, as well the independent doctor hired by her employer, all concluded that she was. Liberty could not have reasonably reached the opposite conclusion based on Denmark's failure to prove a fact that is inessential, and logically unconnected, to her contractual right to long-term disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion also downplays the importance of this factor to Liberty's ultimate decision, focusing instead on the asserted absence of objective evidence of Denmark's inability to work. But the lack of a change in Denmark's condition at the time she stopped working was the sole explanation the insurer gave for denying both short-term and long-term disability benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> In any event, Denmark presented objective evidence of her inability to work in the form of the IME, where Dr. Schur observed \"tender points all over,\" a decreased range of motion in the shoulders and hips, and \"back discomfort\" during an extensive physical examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion treats this as \"some objective evidence of [Denmark's] physical restrictions,\" but concludes that \"it does not demonstrate objectively her inability to work because the evaluation does not specifically relate those restrictions either to the physical requirements of the job or to her <i>overall stamina</i>\" (emphasis added). As this passage recognizes, a condition that saps a claimant of her energy would make her unable to perform the duties of nearly any occupation. <i>See, e.g., Rose v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677318\"><a href=\"/opinion/677318/45-socsecrepser-483-unemplinsrep-cch-p-14101b-gary-m-rose-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1994). Dr. Schur's report characterizes Denmark's fibromyalgia in precisely that way: he endorses a course of treatment \"to try and cut down on pain and help her sleep . . . so that she isn't so tired and, hopefully, can get some of her stamina back,\" but opines that, \"until that is accomplished, which may take months, she is clearly disabled not only from work, but from being able to take care of her household.\" The IME therefore expressly relates the objective manifestations of Denmark's condition&#8212; the pain Dr. Schur observed in various points throughout her body&#8212;to her inability to work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this diagnosis, our decision in <i>Boardman v.

In <i>Boardman,</i> we upheld the insurer's denial of long-term disability benefits to the claimant based on two factors: \"(1) the absence of adequate evidence in [her] medical records indicating that [her] condition imposed limitation on her ability to perform the material and substantial duties of her own occupation . . . and (2) the evidence to the contrary provided in the [IME] reports. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. Here, in stark contrast, the IME unequivocally concludes, based on objective observations, that Denmark is disabled, and that conclusion squares with the opinions of her treating physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty's contrary finding, then, much more closely resembles the decision we overturned in <i>Cook.</i> There, as here, the physician who had examined the claimant opined that she was disabled from fatigue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> but Liberty relied on purported defects in the opinion&#8212;identified by an in-house analyst who had <i>not</i> examined the claimant&#8212;to conclude otherwise. 320 F.3d at 20-23. In criticizing this approach, we suggested that an insurer who doubts a treating doctor's diagnosis ordinarily should seek a second opinion, either in the form of peer review or an IME. <i>Id.</i> at 23. Here, of course, the IME confirmed the diagnoses of Denmark's treating physicians. So Liberty reached the contrary conclusion based on purported defects in the IME identified by an in-house analyst who had not examined Denmark&#8212;using, in essence, the same approach we took such a dim view of in <i>Cook.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Liberty's efforts to discount the IME do not hold up, even under our deferential standard of review. In seeking to diminish Dr. Schur's conclusion that Denmark is disabled, Liberty's in-house nurse argued that \"since an IME provides an examination on a specific date in time, its scope is limited on that inferences to the status of conditions 6 months previous cannot be accurately assessed.\" Under this logic, however, a medical examination&#8212;which, by its nature, always occurs \"on a specific date in time\"&#8212;can never \"accurately assess\" the patient's condition prior to having walked into the examination room. Either that premise is demonstrably false, or a patient is subjected to a pointless exercise every time she undergoes an IME. <i>Cf. Cook,</i> 320 F.3d at 23. Liberty's reasons for spurning Dr. Schur's opinion here, then, are no more supportable than its reasons for spurning the treating doctor's opinion in <i>Cook.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize, as we did in <i>Cook,</i> the possibility of \"cases where the opinion of the claimant's treating physician can be rejected without reliance on any contradictory medical evidence developed by the plan administrator.\" 320 F.3d at 23. But rejecting the opinions of the claimant's treating physicians, <i>and</i> the corroborating view of an independent medical examiner, ought to require a considerably stronger justification than the one relied on here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Accordingly, I would overturn Liberty's denial of long-term disability benefits to Denmark, even under our present standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> Liberty's letter reaffirming its denial of long-term disability benefits does cite the absence of \"support of a severity of impairment that would preclude Ms. Denmark from performing her own occupational job duties,\" but, as the lead opinion observes, a contemporaneous explanation in Liberty's case log again notes the \"limited evidence to support a need to cease working.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The lead opinion devalues Dr. Schur's report based on its view that it does not speak to the current level of Denmark's fatigue or its effect on her ability to do her job. But, again, the report states that Denmark's fatigue has left her unable to work or to care for her household. I do not know how the report could have described the level of fatigue any more clearly, or pertinently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The claimant in<i>Cook</i> suffered from asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia. 320 F.3d at 15.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Liberty also subjected the IME to peer review by Dr. Bomalaski, who concluded that \"[t]he clinical medical evidence does not clearly support severe impairment because as noted, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remains in question. . . .\" As Judge Lipez notes, this conclusion is irrelevant because Liberty has never contested the diagnosis itself. The closest Dr. Bomalaski's report comes to supporting Liberty's position that Denmark is not disabled is its observation that \"[l]imitations of ability to function are difficult to assess. . . .\" The report therefore does little to bolster Liberty's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The lead opinion finds Liberty's criticism of the IME \"not unreasonable given that Dr. Schur himself had limited his evaluation to `the time being.'\" While Dr. Schur's report indeed contains the phrase \"at least for the time being,\" it is clearly not intended to limit Dr. Schur's opinion retrospectively, but prospectively: in both the paragraph immediately preceding the phrase and the sentence immediately following it, Dr. Schur suggests interventions for Denmark that \"hopefully will improve matters, so that she can get her stamina back and get back to work.\" Accordingly, I do not see how the phrase \"for the time being\" can reasonably be read to support Liberty's exceedingly narrow view of Dr. Schur's opinion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> While Liberty also relied on its surveillance of Denmark to support its decision, I agree with the district court that this evidence does not speak to whether she can consistently work full days as her job requires. Denmark was observed leaving her house on only two of the four days she was being watched and, even then, was out for only a few hours</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
