George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          William Maselli for appellant.\n\n          Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula\nD. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 3, 2003\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       Garry Julien was charged with\n\nconspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine base and possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\nยง 841 (2000) and 18 U.S.C. ยง 2 (2000).       He was tried in December\n\n2001 along with a codefendant, Brian Goodine.      The five-day trial\n\nended with a conviction for Goodine but a hung jury for Julien;\n\nover Julien's objection, the district court declared a mistrial on\n\nthe charges against him.\n\n           After trial, Julien moved to dismiss the indictment on\n\nthe basis that a second trial on the charges would violate the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.    U.S. Const. amend. V.   The district court\n\ndenied the motion.   At the second trial, Julien was convicted on\n\nthe possession with intent charge.       He now appeals the denial of\n\nhis motion to dismiss the indictment. He also raises insufficiency\n\nof the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct claims. We reject all\n\nof his claims and affirm the conviction.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           We sketch only the basic facts here, and delve into the\n\ndetails, where they are relevant, in the legal analysis.       Julien\n\nwas arrested on March 19, 2001, when the police responded to a\n\nreport from a motel manager in Saco, Maine about the odor of\n\nmarijuana coming from a room.   When the police entered, they found\n\nJulien, Goodine, and two other occupants (Ricardo King and Bertram\n\nLeslie).   There was drug paraphernalia, cash, and a small quantity\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fof loose marijuana and bagged crack cocaine in the room.         On the\n\nground   outside   the   room's   open     window,   police   discovered\n\napproximately 200 grams of crack cocaine in a plastic bag, as well\n\nas some marijuana, razor blades, an electronic scale, and a plate\n\nwith what appeared to be cocaine residue.            Julien, King, and\n\nGoodine were indicted; King became a cooperating witness against\n\nthe others and testified at both trials.       Leslie was not charged;\n\nhe also testified at both trials.\n\n          The first trial, with Julien and Goodine as defendants,\n\nbegan on Monday, December 10, 2001.       The jury heard some fourteen\n\nhours of testimony over the following three and a half days, and\n\nbegan deliberating just before 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13.\n\nThe next day at 8 p.m., after sixteen total hours of deliberations,\n\nthe jury indicated that it was deadlocked on charges against one\n\ndefendant.   The court accepted a guilty verdict as to Goodine and\n\ndeclared a mistrial as to Julien.\n\n          Julien moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds on December 21, 2001.     In a comprehensive Memorandum and\n\nOrder issued January 4, 2002, the district court denied the motion.\n\nJulien did not take an interlocutory appeal of that denial before\n\nthe second trial, as he was entitled to do under Abney v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 651, 662 (1977).       Instead he chose to undergo the\n\nsecond trial before raising the double jeopardy issue on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           Julien's second trial, held before a different judge in\n\nMarch 2002, ended with his conviction on the charge of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute; there was a hung jury on the conspiracy\n\ncount.    On    the   government's    motion,   the   indictment   on   the\n\nconspiracy charge was dismissed on June 12, 2002.\n\n                                     II.\n\n          Julien's appeal raises four issues.         He argues that\n\nthere was no manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial\n\nin the first trial; that there was insufficient evidence at the\n\nfirst trial to support a conviction, both as to conspiracy and as\n\nto possession with intent to distribute; that the evidence on both\n\ncounts was insufficient at the second trial; and that certain\n\nactions by the prosecution in the two trials constitute government\n\nmisconduct.\n\nA.   Mistrial and Double Jeopardy\n\n           The Double Jeopardy Clause requires that no person \"be\n\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\n\nlimb.\"   U.S. Const. amend. V.\n\n           For a defendant, there are serious consequences stemming\n\nfrom enduring two trials on a single set of criminal charges.\n\nAmong other things, the government may gain an advantage at the\n\nsecond trial for having seen the defense case at the first trial.\n\nAs a result, courts do not lightly grant mistrials after jeopardy\n\nhas attached.     See Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 471\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f(1973).     Still, a hung jury is the classic instance where a\n\nmistrial    may    be   warranted,     and    that   has    been    so   in   our\n\njurisprudence for at least 175 years.          See United States v. Perez,\n\n22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 (1824) (Story, J.).                 The government must\n\nshoulder     the   \"heavy\"    burden     of   justifying      a    mistrial   by\n\ndemonstrating the \"manifest necessity\" for a mistrial when the\n\ndefendant objects.        Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505\n\n(1978).\n\n            Our review of a district court's decision that there was\n\nmanifest necessity justifying the declaration of a mistrial is for\n\nabuse of discretion.          Id. at 510 & n.28.           There is case law\n\nsuggesting that where constitutional concerns are raised by the\n\ndenial of a motion to dismiss premised on double jeopardy grounds,\n\nas here, then the ultimate conclusion is reviewed de novo, see\n\nUnited States v. DiPietro, 936 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1991), while the\n\nsubsidiary factual determinations are reviewed only for clear\n\nerror.     United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 291 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     In practice, though, the reviewing court reviews whether\n\nthe district court abused its discretion, subject to heightened\n\nrigor in the review.         United States v. Keene, 287 F.3d 229, 233\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Bradshaw, 281 F.3d at 291.                 Errors of law, of\n\ncourse, constitute abuse of discretion. Koon v. United States, 518\n\nU.S. 81, 100 (1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           In reviewing the mistrial determination we look, inter\n\nalia, at whether the district court considered all the relevant\n\nfactors, including the availability of alternatives to mistrial;\n\nthe positions taken by the parties at trial and whether they had an\n\nopportunity to state their positions; and whether the court's\n\ndecision was deliberative in nature.        See Keene, 287 F.3d at 234;\n\nUnited States v. Simonetti, 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Julien makes two assertions to be evaluated in this\n\nmanner against the facts and the trial court's decision. First, he\n\nsays that the mistrial was declared at 8 p.m. on Friday night, when\n\nthe jury was exhausted and should have been given the option of\n\ngoing home for the weekend and returning refreshed on Monday\n\nmorning.   Second, he notes that the jury deliberated for three\n\nhours after stating that it had reached a verdict on one defendant\n\nbut not the other; he argues that the jury therefore spent only\n\nthree   hours   focused   on   Julien    alone   and   that   this    was   an\n\ninsufficient amount of time.\n\n           The course of deliberations was as follows.               The jury\n\nbegan deliberations at 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13.               At 5:30\n\np.m., in response to an offer from the court to send in dinner, the\n\nforeperson sent a note which read, \"We are not even close to a\n\nverdict in either, do we have the option of coming back tomorrow?\n\nWe are very far apart.\" After consultation with counsel, the court\n\ngave the jury the choice between deliberating longer that night or\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fresuming in the morning.     The jurors opted to go home for the\n\nevening.\n\n           The jury deliberated the second day, Friday, from 8:30\n\na.m. until 4:30 p.m.    Shortly before 4 p.m. the foreperson sent a\n\nquestion asking why the jury had to decide drug quantities on the\n\nverdict form.   The court answered the question and half an hour\n\nlater another note came, stating in full, \"We have reached a\n\ndecision on one defendant, but cannot agree on the second.\"   After\n\nsome consultation between the judge and counsel, Julien proposed\n\nthat the court deliver an Allen instruction, see Allen v. United\n\nStates, 164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896), and then have the jury deliberate\n\nfor another hour before accepting its partial verdict.\n\n           The court gave a modified Allen charge. It then inquired\n\nwhether the jury wanted to keep working that evening or \"whether\n\nyou feel at this time the jury is so exhausted that you need to go\n\nhome and return on Monday morning.\"      The jurors chose to work\n\nfurther that evening.    An hour later, the jury asked a question\n\nabout the dates of the conspiracy, which the court answered.\n\n           At 7:50 p.m., nearly three hours after the Allen charge,\n\nanother note came:   \"The jury is deadlocked on both counts for one\n\nof the defendants.   There has been no movement and [we] foresee no\n\nmovement in further deliberations.\"   Julien asked that the jury be\n\nsent home and resume deliberations on Monday.      The trial court\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fdecided to take the verdict on one defendant and declare a manifest\n\nnecessity mistrial on the other.\n\n            As the district court noted, the jurors had indicated\n\ndifficulty reaching agreement three times:           first saying they were\n\n\"far apart,\" then that they \"cannot agree,\" and finally that they\n\nwere \"deadlocked.\"     The last note came after a total of sixteen\n\nhours of deliberation in a case which was not complex and involved\n\nonly fourteen hours of testimony.         See United States v. Barbioni,\n\n62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding manifest necessity mistrial\n\nafter almost ten hours of deliberations following short, simple\n\ntrial).      Counsel was consulted at every stage.             Contrary to\n\nJulien's assertions, the record does not establish that the jurors\n\nwere too exhausted to deliberate further; the court asked them if\n\nthey were, and they elected to continue deliberating. Nor does the\n\nrecord    indicate,   as   Julien   argues,   that    the   jurors   had   not\n\ncompleted significant deliberations concerning Julien before the\n\nnote indicating agreement on Goodine; rather, the jury's questions\n\nand other notes suggest that it was conscientiously considering the\n\ncharges against both defendants.\n\n            The jury had reported that further efforts would be\n\nfruitless.    As the trial judge surely was concerned, there was a\n\nrisk that a jury forced to continue to deliberate after it reported\n\ndeadlock would compromise too easily, simply to be able to go home.\n\nSuch compromise might well have worked to Julien's detriment rather\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthan to his benefit.       There was no abuse of discretion in granting\n\nthe mistrial or in denying the subsequent motion to dismiss.1\n\nB.   Sufficiency of Evidence at First Trial\n\n            Julien argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a conviction at the first trial.            Although not argued as\n\nsuch, Julien's theory seems to be that if the evidence at the first\n\ntrial is insufficient and the trial ends in a mistrial, a different\n\ndouble jeopardy argument is presented to bar the government from\n\nproceeding to retrial.      Julien does not indicate a basis in law for\n\nhim to present this issue.\n\n            The   government      replies   that,   because   there   was    no\n\nconviction at the first trial, this claim is moot.            The government\n\ncorrectly   notes   that    the   conspiracy   count   did    not   result   in\n\nconviction at the second trial and has now been dismissed, and so\n\nthere is no live controversy as to that count.           That still leaves\n\nthe possession with intent to distribute count.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         The government raises, but does not press, the\nquestion of whether this court should consider Julien to have\nwaived any double jeopardy argument by declining to take the\ninterlocutory appeal to which he was entitled under Abney, 431\nU.S. at 662, and instead submitting to a second trial before\nhe raised the double jeopardy grounds on appeal. This court\nhas not ruled on the question, nor has the Supreme Court.\nAbney itself says that in such circumstances \"a defendant may\nseek immediate appellate review,\" id. at 663 (emphasis added),\nnot that he must do so. There are reasoned arguments to be\nmade on both sides of this question. We need not decide the\nissue, since we uphold the manifest necessity finding.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f             We will assume dubitante, in Julien's favor, that he is\n\nin fact asserting a double jeopardy argument.               Nonetheless, Julien\n\ndoes not present a viable issue.            In Richardson v. United States,\n\n468 U.S. 317 (1984), the Supreme Court held:\n\n             the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause by its terms\n             applies only if there has been some event, such as an\n             acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy. Since\n             jeopardy attached here when the jury was sworn,\n             petitioner's argument necessarily assumes that the\n             judicial declaration of a mistrial was an event which\n             terminated jeopardy in his case and which allowed him to\n             assert a valid claim of double jeopardy.\n\n             ... [T]he failure of a jury to reach a verdict is not an\n             event which terminates jeopardy.\n\n\nId. at 325 (citations omitted); see also Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania,\n\n123 S. Ct. 732, 737-39 (2003) (comparing different effects of\n\nmistrial and acquittal on double jeopardy protections).                   Because\n\njeopardy does       not   terminate   when    the   court    declares    a   valid\n\nmistrial based on the inability of the jury to agree, defendant's\n\nclaim of insufficiency of the evidence at the first trial presents\n\n\"no    valid   double     jeopardy    claim    to   prevent     his     retrial.\"\n\nRichardson, 468 U.S. at 326; accord United States v. Willis, 102\n\nF.3d 1078, 1081 (10th Cir. 1996); United States v. Coleman, 862\n\nF.2d 455 (3d Cir. 1988).\n\n             To give Julien the benefit of all conceivable arguments,\n\nwe consider whether there is a due process or non-constitutional\n\nclaim, separate from the double jeopardy claim, that he is entitled\n\nto    have   the   sufficiency   of   the    evidence   at    the   first    trial\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdetermined at some point.   Under Richardson, a denial of a motion\n\nto dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence is an interlocutory\n\norder; it is not appealable after a mistrial and before a second\n\ntrial except on double jeopardy grounds (grounds which the Supreme\n\nCourt has rejected on the merits).     The defense argument would be\n\nthat there is a final appealable judgment after a conviction at the\n\nsecond trial, and Julien may then appeal otherwise non-final\n\nrulings when he appeals from that judgment of guilt.        Although\n\nRichardson does not expressly foreclose this point, there is\n\nlanguage in both Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion and Justice\n\nStevens' dissent which tends to demonstrate that the Supreme\n\nCourt's majority would be inhospitable to such a claim.     See 468\n\nU.S. at 326; id. at 334-35 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also 15B\n\nWright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 3918.5, at\n\n496-97 (2d ed. 1992). That inhospitality governs our decision. We\n\nhold that defendant may not, on appeal from a judgment of guilt in\n\na second trial following a mistrial, then raise a claim that he was\n\nwrongly denied his motion for acquittal on insufficiency of the\n\nevidence at the first trial.\n\n          This court has also applied Richardson in a related\n\ncontext to hold that a defendant may not argue that the vacating of\n\nhis conviction for legal error on direct appeal from his first\n\ntrial permits an evaluation of the sufficiency of the remaining\n\nevidence at the first trial.   United States v. Porter, 807 F.2d 21,\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f24 (1st Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34\n\nF.3d 33, 38-39 (1st Cir. 1994) (double jeopardy claim concerning\n\ninsufficiency of evidence at first trial waived by defendant's\n\nrequest for mistrial, but Richardson would foreclose claim even if\n\npreserved); United States v. Reis, 788 F.2d 54, 56-57 (1st Cir.\n\n1986) (no different standard applies to motion of acquittal after\n\nmistrial compared to other motions for acquittal).   It is not open\n\nto Julien to make an argument based on insufficiency of the\n\nevidence at a trial which ended in a mistrial.\n\nC.   Sufficiency of Evidence at Second Trial\n\n           Julien also argues that the evidence at the second trial\n\nwas insufficient to show possession with intent to distribute.2   In\n\nreviewing this claim we take the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government; Julien must show that no rational jury\n\ncould have convicted him.    United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216\n\nF.3d 163, 191 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Julien argues that the jury most likely convicted him on\n\nan aiding and abetting theory as to the events on March 19, 2001,\n\nthe date of his arrest in the motel room.        He argues that the\n\nevidence established only that he was present that day, with\n\nknowledge that others there possessed drugs, perhaps for sale.    In\n\nany event, he says, proof was not beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n      2\n         As noted above, no challenge to the evidence on the\nconspiracy charge is available because that charge was\ndismissed.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          There was sufficient evidence at the second trial of\n\npossession with intent to distribute cocaine.           King testified that\n\nJulien obtained cocaine from his own sources in New York and sold\n\nthe drugs in Maine.         There was evidence that Julien had rented\n\nanother motel room in Old Orchard Beach from which drugs were sold.\n\nTelephone records showed calls were made from the room to a number\n\nof crack cocaine users in the area.        Penny Oulette testified that\n\nshe had regularly purchased crack cocaine from Julien, King, and\n\nGoodine, including on a visit to the raided motel room a day or two\n\nbefore the arrests.\n\n          When the police entered the motel room on March 19,\n\nJulien and King were both near the open window; the jury could\n\ninfer that Julien threw the incriminating evidence out the window.\n\nAfter the police entered, an officer saw Julien jump from beside\n\nthe window to the nearest bed.         Under the bed where Julien landed\n\nwas $900 in cash.\n\n          Julien testified in his own defense that it was King who\n\nthrew the drugs and paraphernalia out the window, that he did not\n\ndeal cocaine, that he had rented the Old Orchard Beach motel room\n\nas a favor to King, and that he knew nothing of the cash or the\n\ndrug paraphernalia in the Saco motel room.           Goodine also testified\n\non Julien's behalf, denying that either of them sold drugs.\n\n          The jury's decision came down to an assessment of the\n\ncredibility   of    these    various    witnesses.      Julien   had   ample\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fopportunity to impeach the government's witnesses.     A reasonable\n\njury could certainly conclude that Julien was in knowing possession\n\nof drugs intending to sell them or that, at least, he was aiding\n\nand abetting others who were doing so.   Julien has not met the high\n\nbar required to overturn a jury verdict.\n\nD.   Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n          Julien makes prosecutorial misconduct claims arising out\n\nof both the first and second trials.   There are no claims available\n\nrelated to the first trial because no conviction resulted.

He was tried in December 2001 along with a codefendant, Brian Goodine. The five-day trial ended with a conviction for Goodine but a hung jury for Julien; over Julien's objection, the district court declared a mistrial on the charges against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, Julien moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that a second trial on the charges would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. U.S. Const. amend. V. The district court denied the motion. At the second trial, Julien was convicted on the possession with intent charge. He now appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. He also raises insufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct claims. We reject all of his claims and affirm the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch only the basic facts here, and delve into the details, where they are relevant, in the legal analysis. Julien was arrested on March 19, 2001, when the police responded to a report from a motel manager in Saco, Maine about the odor of marijuana coming from a room. When the police entered, they found Julien, Goodine, and two other occupants (Ricardo King and Bertram Leslie). There was drug paraphernalia, cash, and a small quantity of loose marijuana and bagged crack cocaine in the room. On the ground outside the room's open window, police discovered approximately 200 grams of crack cocaine in a plastic bag, as well as some marijuana, razor blades, an electronic scale, and a plate with what appeared to be cocaine residue. Julien, King, and Goodine were indicted; King became a cooperating witness against the others and testified at both trials. Leslie was not charged; he also testified at both trials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first trial, with Julien and Goodine as defendants, began on Monday, December 10, 2001. The jury heard some fourteen hours of testimony over the following three and a half days, and began deliberating just before 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13. The next day at 8 p.m., after sixteen total hours of deliberations, the jury indicated that it was deadlocked on charges against one defendant. The court accepted a guilty verdict as to Goodine and declared a mistrial as to Julien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds on December 21, 2001. In a comprehensive Memorandum and Order issued January 4, 2002, the district court denied the motion. Julien did not take an interlocutory appeal of that denial before the second trial, as he was entitled to do under <i>Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977). Instead he chose to undergo the second trial before raising the double jeopardy issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien's second trial, held before a different judge in March 2002, ended with his conviction on the charge of possession with intent to distribute; there was a hung jury on the conspiracy count. On the government's motion, the indictment on the conspiracy charge was dismissed on June 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien's appeal raises four issues. He argues that there was no manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial in the first trial; that there was insufficient evidence at the first trial to support a conviction, both as to conspiracy and as to possession with intent to distribute; that the evidence on both counts was insufficient at the second trial; and that certain actions by the prosecution in the two trials constitute government misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Mistrial and Double Jeopardy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause requires that no person \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a defendant, there are serious consequences stemming from enduring two trials on a single set of criminal charges. Among other things, the government may gain an advantage at the second trial for having seen the defense case at the first trial. As a result, courts do not lightly grant mistrials after jeopardy has attached. <i>See Illinois v. Somerville,</i> 410 U.S. 458, 471, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973). Still, a hung jury is the classic instance where a mistrial may be warranted, and that has been so in our jurisprudence for at least 175 years. <i>See United States v. Perez,</i> 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824) (Story, J.). The government must shoulder the \"heavy\" burden of justifying a mistrial by demonstrating the \"manifest necessity\" for a mistrial when the defendant objects. <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's decision that there was manifest necessity justifying the declaration of a mistrial is for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 510 &amp; n. 28, 98 S.Ct. 824. There is case law suggesting that where constitutional concerns are raised by the denial of a motion to dismiss premised on double jeopardy grounds, as here, then the ultimate conclusion is reviewed de novo, <i>see United States v. DiPietro,</i> 936 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1991), while the subsidiary factual determinations are reviewed only for clear error. <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 291 (1st Cir.2002). In practice, though, the reviewing court reviews whether the district court abused its discretion, subject to heightened rigor in the review. <i>United States v. Keene,</i> 287 F.3d 229, 233 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 291. Errors of law, of course, constitute abuse of discretion. <i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the mistrial determination we look, inter alia, at whether the district court considered all the relevant factors, including the availability of alternatives to mistrial; the positions taken by the parties at trial and whether they had an opportunity to state their positions; and whether the court's decision was deliberative in nature. <i>See Keene,</i> 287 F.3d at 234; <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien makes two assertions to be evaluated in this manner against the facts and the trial court's decision. First, he says that the mistrial was declared at 8 p.m. on Friday night, when the jury was exhausted and should have been given the option of going home for the weekend and returning refreshed on Monday morning. Second, he notes that the jury deliberated for three hours after stating that it had reached a verdict on one defendant but not the other; he argues that the jury therefore spent only three hours focused on Julien alone and that this was an insufficient amount of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The course of deliberations was as follows. The jury began deliberations at 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13. At 5:30 p.m., in response to an offer from the court to send in dinner, the foreperson sent a note which read, \"We are not even close to a verdict in either, do we have the option of coming back tomorrow? We are very far apart.\" After consultation with counsel, the court gave the jury the choice between deliberating longer that night or resuming in the morning. The jurors opted to go home for the evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury deliberated the second day, Friday, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Shortly before 4 p.m. the foreperson sent a question asking why the jury had to decide drug quantities on the verdict form. The court answered the question and half an hour later another note came, stating in full, \"We have reached a decision on one defendant, but cannot agree on the second.\" After some consultation between the judge and counsel, Julien proposed that the court deliver an <i>Allen</i> instruction, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896), and then have the jury deliberate for another hour before accepting its partial verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court gave a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. It then inquired whether the jury wanted to keep working that evening or \"whether you feel at this time the jury is so exhausted that you need to go home and return on Monday morning.\" The jurors chose to work further that evening. An hour later, the jury asked a question about the dates of the conspiracy, which the court answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 7:50 p.m., nearly three hours after the <i>Allen</i> charge, another note came: \"The jury is deadlocked on both counts for one of the defendants. There has been no movement and [we] foresee no movement in further deliberations.\" Julien asked that the jury be sent home and resume deliberations on Monday. The trial court decided to take the verdict on one defendant and declare a manifest necessity mistrial on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the jurors had indicated difficulty reaching agreement three times: first saying they were \"far apart,\" then that they \"cannot agree,\" and finally that they were \"deadlocked.\" The last note came after a total of sixteen hours of deliberation in a case which was not complex and involved only fourteen hours of testimony. <i>See United States v. Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding manifest necessity mistrial after almost ten hours of deliberations following short, simple trial). Counsel was consulted at every stage. Contrary to Julien's assertions, the record does not establish that the jurors were too exhausted to deliberate further; the court asked them if they were, and they elected to continue deliberating. Nor does the record indicate, as Julien argues, that the jurors had not completed significant deliberations concerning Julien before the note indicating agreement on Goodine; rather, the jury's questions and other notes suggest that it was conscientiously considering the charges against both defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury had reported that further efforts would be fruitless. As the trial judge surely was concerned, there was a risk that a jury forced to continue to deliberate after it reported deadlock would compromise too easily, simply to be able to go home. Such compromise might well have worked to Julien's detriment rather than to his benefit. There was no abuse of discretion in granting the mistrial or in denying the subsequent motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence at First Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction at the first trial. Although not argued as such, Julien's theory seems to be that if the evidence at the first trial is insufficient and the trial ends in a mistrial, a different double jeopardy argument is presented to bar the government from proceeding to retrial. Julien does not indicate a basis in law for him to present this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government replies that, because there was no conviction at the first trial, this claim is moot. The government correctly notes that the conspiracy count did not result in conviction at the second trial and has now been dismissed, and so there is no live controversy as to that count. That still leaves the possession with intent to distribute count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume <i>dubitante,</i> in Julien's favor, that he is in fact asserting a double jeopardy argument. Nonetheless, Julien does not present a viable issue. In <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 317, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984), the Supreme Court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause by its terms applies only if there has been some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates the original jeopardy. Since jeopardy attached here when the jury was sworn, petitioner's argument necessarily assumes that the judicial declaration of a mistrial was an event which terminated jeopardy in his case and which allowed him to assert a valid claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [T]he failure of a jury to reach a verdict is not an event which terminates jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 325, 104 S.Ct. 3081 (citations omitted); <i>see also Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 123 S.Ct. 732, 737-39, 154 L.Ed.2d 588 (2003) (comparing different effects of mistrial and acquittal on double jeopardy protections). Because jeopardy does not terminate when the court declares a valid mistrial based on the inability of the jury to agree, defendant's claim of insufficiency of the evidence at the first trial presents \"no valid double jeopardy claim to prevent his retrial.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 468 U.S. at 326, 104 S.Ct. 3081; <i>accord United States v. Willis,</i> 102 F.3d 1078, 1081 (10th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Coleman,</i> 862 F.2d 455 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To give Julien the benefit of all conceivable arguments, we consider whether there is a due process or non-constitutional claim, separate from the double jeopardy claim, that he is entitled to have the sufficiency of the evidence at the first trial determined at some point. Under <i>Richardson,</i> a denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence is an interlocutory order; it is not appealable after a mistrial and before a second trial except on double jeopardy grounds (grounds which the Supreme Court has rejected on the merits). The defense argument would be that there is a final appealable judgment after a conviction at the second trial, and Julien may then appeal otherwise non-final rulings when he appeals from that judgment of guilt. Although <i>Richardson</i> does not expressly foreclose this point, there is language in both Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion and Justice Stevens' dissent which tends to demonstrate that the Supreme Court's majority would be inhospitable to such a claim. <i>See</i> 468 U.S. at 326, 104 S.Ct. 3081; <i>id.</i> at 334-35, 104 S.Ct. 3081 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <i>see also</i> 15B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 3918.5, at 496-97 (2d ed.1992). That inhospitality governs our decision. We hold that defendant may not, on appeal from a judgment of guilt in a second trial following a mistrial, then raise a claim that he was wrongly denied his motion for acquittal on insufficiency of the evidence at the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has also applied <i>Richardson</i> in a related context to hold that a defendant may not argue that the vacating of his conviction for legal error on direct appeal from his first trial permits an evaluation of the sufficiency of the remaining evidence at the first trial. <i>United States v. Porter,</i> 807 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1986); <i>see also United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa,</i> 34 F.3d 33, 38-39 (1st Cir.1994) (double jeopardy claim concerning insufficiency of evidence at first trial waived by defendant's request for mistrial, but <i>Richardson</i> would foreclose claim even if preserved); <i>United States v. Reis,</i> 788 F.2d 54, 56-57 (1st Cir.1986) (no different standard applies to motion of acquittal after mistrial compared to other motions for acquittal). It is not open to Julien to make an argument based on insufficiency of the evidence at a trial which ended in a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence at Second Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien also argues that the evidence at the second trial was insufficient to show possession with intent to distribute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In reviewing this claim we take the evidence in the light most favorable to the government; Julien must show that no rational jury could have convicted him. <i>United States v. Collazo-Aponte,</i> 216 F.3d 163, 191 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien argues that the jury most likely convicted him on an aiding and abetting theory as to the events on March 19, 2001, the date of his arrest in the motel room. He argues that the evidence established only that he was present that day, with knowledge that others there possessed drugs, perhaps for sale. In any event, he says, proof was not beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence at the second trial of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. King testified that Julien obtained cocaine from his own sources in New York and sold the drugs in Maine. There was evidence that Julien had rented another motel room in Old Orchard Beach from which drugs were sold. Telephone records showed calls were made from the room to a number of crack cocaine users in the area. Penny Oulette testified that she had regularly purchased crack cocaine from Julien, King, and Goodine, including on a visit to the raided motel room a day or two before the arrests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the police entered the motel room on March 19, Julien and King were both near the open window; the jury could infer that Julien threw the incriminating evidence out the window. After the police entered, an officer saw Julien jump from beside the window to the nearest bed. Under the bed where Julien landed was $900 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien testified in his own defense that it was King who threw the drugs and paraphernalia out the window, that he did not deal cocaine, that he had rented the Old Orchard Beach motel room as a favor to King, and that he knew nothing of the cash or the drug paraphernalia in the Saco motel room. Goodine also testified on Julien's behalf, denying that either of them sold drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury's decision came down to an assessment of the credibility of these various witnesses. Julien had ample opportunity to impeach the government's witnesses. A reasonable jury could certainly conclude that Julien was in knowing possession of drugs intending to sell them or that, at least, he was aiding and abetting others who were doing so. Julien has not met the high bar required to overturn a jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien makes prosecutorial misconduct claims arising out of both the first and second trials. There are no claims available related to the first trial because no conviction resulted. The principal claims of misconduct in the second trial arise out of the government's use of King and Leslie as witnesses. Julien says Leslie's testimony at the second trial was inconsistent with his testimony at the first trial, that aspects of King's testimony were inherently implausible, and that the government recognized as much. Julien was able to take advantage of both points on impeachment. The trial court properly instructed that issues of credibility were for the jury. There was no misconduct; neither was there error. Julien received a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government raises, but does not press, the question of whether this court should consider Julien to have waived any double jeopardy argument by declining to take the interlocutory appeal to which he was entitled under<i>Abney,</i> 431 U.S. at 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, and instead submitting to a second trial before he raised the double jeopardy grounds on appeal. This court has not ruled on the question, nor has the Supreme Court. <i>Abney</i> itself says that in such circumstances \"a defendant <i>may</i> seek immediate appellate review,\" <i>id.</i> at 663, 97 S.Ct. 2034 (emphasis added), not that he must do so. There are reasoned arguments to be made on both sides of this question. We need not decide the issue, since we uphold the manifest necessity finding.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As noted above, no challenge to the evidence on the conspiracy charge is available because that charge was dismissed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Julien was arrested on March 19, 2001, when the police responded to a report from a motel manager in Saco, Maine about the odor of marijuana coming from a room. When the police entered, they found Julien, Goodine, and two other occupants (Ricardo King and Bertram Leslie). There was drug paraphernalia, cash, and a small quantity of loose marijuana and bagged crack cocaine in the room. On the ground outside the room's open window, police discovered approximately 200 grams of crack cocaine in a plastic bag, as well as some marijuana, razor blades, an electronic scale, and a plate with what appeared to be cocaine residue. Julien, King, and Goodine were indicted; King became a cooperating witness against the others and testified at both trials. Leslie was not charged; he also testified at both trials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first trial, with Julien and Goodine as defendants, began on Monday, December 10, 2001. The jury heard some fourteen hours of testimony over the following three and a half days, and began deliberating just before 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13. The next day at 8 p.m., after sixteen total hours of deliberations, the jury indicated that it was deadlocked on charges against one defendant. The court accepted a guilty verdict as to Goodine and declared a mistrial as to Julien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds on December 21, 2001. In a comprehensive Memorandum and Order issued January 4, 2002, the district court denied the motion. Julien did not take an interlocutory appeal of that denial before the second trial, as he was entitled to do under <i>Abney v.

On the government's motion, the indictment on the conspiracy charge was dismissed on June 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien's appeal raises four issues. He argues that there was no manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial in the first trial; that there was insufficient evidence at the first trial to support a conviction, both as to conspiracy and as to possession with intent to distribute; that the evidence on both counts was insufficient at the second trial; and that certain actions by the prosecution in the two trials constitute government misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Mistrial and Double Jeopardy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause requires that no person \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Among other things, the government may gain an advantage at the second trial for having seen the defense case at the first trial. As a result, courts do not lightly grant mistrials after jeopardy has attached. <i>See Illinois v.

First, he says that the mistrial was declared at 8 p.m. on Friday night, when the jury was exhausted and should have been given the option of going home for the weekend and returning refreshed on Monday morning. Second, he notes that the jury deliberated for three hours after stating that it had reached a verdict on one defendant but not the other; he argues that the jury therefore spent only three hours focused on Julien alone and that this was an insufficient amount of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The course of deliberations was as follows. The jury began deliberations at 1 p.m. on Thursday, December 13. At 5:30 p.m., in response to an offer from the court to send in dinner, the foreperson sent a note which read, \"We are not even close to a verdict in either, do we have the option of coming back tomorrow? We are very far apart.\" After consultation with counsel, the court gave the jury the choice between deliberating longer that night or resuming in the morning. The jurors opted to go home for the evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury deliberated the second day, Friday, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Shortly before 4 p.m. the foreperson sent a question asking why the jury had to decide drug quantities on the verdict form. The court answered the question and half an hour later another note came, stating in full, \"We have reached a decision on one defendant, but cannot agree on the second.\" After some consultation between the judge and counsel, Julien proposed that the court deliver an <i>Allen</i> instruction, <i>see Allen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94565\"><a href=\"/opinion/94565/allen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 501, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></span> (1896), and then have the jury deliberate for another hour before accepting its partial verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court gave a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. It then inquired whether the jury wanted to keep working that evening or \"whether you feel at this time the jury is so exhausted that you need to go home and return on Monday morning.\" The jurors chose to work further that evening. An hour later, the jury asked a question about the dates of the conspiracy, which the court answered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 7:50 p.m., nearly three hours after the <i>Allen</i> charge, another note came: \"The jury is deadlocked on both counts for one of the defendants. There has been no movement and [we] foresee no movement in further deliberations.\" Julien asked that the jury be sent home and resume deliberations on Monday. The trial court decided to take the verdict on one defendant and declare a manifest necessity mistrial on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the jurors had indicated difficulty reaching agreement three times: first saying they were \"far apart,\" then that they \"cannot agree,\" and finally that they were \"deadlocked.\" The last note came after a total of sixteen hours of deliberation in a case which was not complex and involved only fourteen hours of testimony. <i>See United States v. Barbioni,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196231\"><a href=\"/opinion/196231/united-states-v-barbioni/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding manifest necessity mistrial after almost ten hours of deliberations following short, simple trial). Counsel was consulted at every stage. Contrary to Julien's assertions, the record does not establish that the jurors were too exhausted to deliberate further; the court asked them if they were, and they elected to continue deliberating. Nor does the record indicate, as Julien argues, that the jurors had not completed significant deliberations concerning Julien before the note indicating agreement on Goodine; rather, the jury's questions and other notes suggest that it was conscientiously considering the charges against both defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury had reported that further efforts would be fruitless. As the trial judge surely was concerned, there was a risk that a jury forced to continue to deliberate after it reported deadlock would compromise too easily, simply to be able to go home. Such compromise might well have worked to Julien's detriment rather than to his benefit. There was no abuse of discretion in granting the mistrial or in denying the subsequent motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of Evidence at First Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction at the first trial. Although not argued as such, Julien's theory seems to be that if the evidence at the first trial is insufficient and the trial ends in a mistrial, a different double jeopardy argument is presented to bar the government from proceeding to retrial. Julien does not indicate a basis in law for him to present this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government replies that, because there was no conviction at the first trial, this claim is moot. The government correctly notes that the conspiracy count did not result in conviction at the second trial and has now been dismissed, and so there is no live controversy as to that count. That still leaves the possession with intent to distribute count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume <i>dubitante,</i> in Julien's favor, that he is in fact asserting a double jeopardy argument.

Under <i>Richardson,</i> a denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence is an interlocutory order; it is not appealable after a mistrial and before a second trial except on double jeopardy grounds (grounds which the Supreme Court has rejected on the merits). The defense argument would be that there is a final appealable judgment after a conviction at the second trial, and Julien may then appeal otherwise non-final rulings when he appeals from that judgment of guilt. Although <i>Richardson</i> does not expressly foreclose this point, there is language in both Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion and Justice Stevens' dissent which tends to demonstrate that the Supreme Court's majority would be inhospitable to such a claim. <i>See</i> 468 U.S. at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/111246/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He argues that the evidence established only that he was present that day, with knowledge that others there possessed drugs, perhaps for sale.

King testified that Julien obtained cocaine from his own sources in New York and sold the drugs in Maine. There was evidence that Julien had rented another motel room in Old Orchard Beach from which drugs were sold. Telephone records showed calls were made from the room to a number of crack cocaine users in the area. Penny Oulette testified that she had regularly purchased crack cocaine from Julien, King, and Goodine, including on a visit to the raided motel room a day or two before the arrests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the police entered the motel room on March 19, Julien and King were both near the open window; the jury could infer that Julien threw the incriminating evidence out the window. After the police entered, an officer saw Julien jump from beside the window to the nearest bed. Under the bed where Julien landed was $900 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien testified in his own defense that it was King who threw the drugs and paraphernalia out the window, that he did not deal cocaine, that he had rented the Old Orchard Beach motel room as a favor to King, and that he knew nothing of the cash or the drug paraphernalia in the Saco motel room. Goodine also testified on Julien's behalf, denying that either of them sold drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury's decision came down to an assessment of the credibility of these various witnesses. Julien had ample opportunity to impeach the government's witnesses. A reasonable jury could certainly conclude that Julien was in knowing possession of drugs intending to sell them or that, at least, he was aiding and abetting others who were doing so. Julien has not met the high bar required to overturn a jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien makes prosecutorial misconduct claims arising out of both the first and second trials. There are no claims available related to the first trial because no conviction resulted. The principal claims of misconduct in the second trial arise out of the government's use of King and Leslie as witnesses. Julien says Leslie's testimony at the second trial was inconsistent with his testimony at the first trial, that aspects of King's testimony were inherently implausible, and that the government recognized as much. Julien was able to take advantage of both points on impeachment. The trial court properly instructed that issues of credibility were for the jury. There was no misconduct; neither was there error. Julien received a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Julien's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government raises, but does not press, the question of whether this court should consider Julien to have waived any double jeopardy argument by declining to take the interlocutory appeal to which he was entitled under<i>Abney,</i> 431 U.S. at 662, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2034</span></a></span>, and instead submitting to a second trial before he raised the double jeopardy grounds on appeal. This court has not ruled on the question, nor has the Supreme Court. <i>Abney</i> itself says that in such circumstances \"a defendant <i>may</i> seek immediate appellate review,\" <i>id.</i> at 663, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2034</span></a></span> (emphasis added), not that he must do so. There are reasoned arguments to be made on both sides of this question. We need not decide the issue, since we uphold the manifest necessity finding.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As noted above, no challenge to the evidence on the conspiracy charge is available because that charge was dismissed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
