Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael R. Hasse, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Mariana E. Bauzá-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 21, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      Former Puerto Rico police officer\n\nOsvaldo Caraballo-Rodriguez (Caraballo) seeks on appeal to withdraw\n\nhis plea of guilty to the crime of misprision of felony, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4.   The plea was entered as part of a plea bargain under which\n\nmuch more serious drug conspiracy charges were dismissed. In order\n\nto withdraw his plea, Caraballo must, as he admits, meet the plain\n\nerror standard of showing that, on the facts charged, no crime of\n\nmisprision could be stated, that this error was plain at the time,\n\nthat his substantial rights were affected (including that he would\n\notherwise not have entered the plea agreement), and that the error\n\nimplicated    the    fairness,    integrity,    or   public     reputation     of\n\njudicial proceedings.      This is a daunting task, and Caraballo does\n\nnot accomplish it.\n\n            The     prosecution's    allegations     were      that   Caraballo\n\ncommitted    misprision    by    concealing    and   failing    to    report   an\n\nunderlying drug crime in which he was involved (1) when he gave\n\naccurate information in an anonymous tip to the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) about the crime, but refused to provide\n\nadditional requested information, and (2) when he refused to\n\nprovide additional information despite his duty as a Puerto Rico\n\npolice officer to disclose crimes.\n\n            Caraballo makes a serious argument that this court should\n\nadopt an interpretation of the misprision statute, as many circuits\n\nhave done, which requires that there be an affirmative act of\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fconcealment, and hold that the facts in this case cannot sustain\n\nsuch a conviction.       We do not rule on that question because even if\n\nthere were error, it is not plain, and Caraballo has not shown\n\neither that his substantial rights were affected or that entry of\n\nthis     plea    undermined    the    integrity       of    the   proceedings     or\n\nconstituted a miscarriage of justice.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            In    a   sting   investigation      in    2000-2001    named   \"Honor\n\nPerdido\" or \"Lost Honor,\" the FBI uncovered, and then the United\n\nStates successfully prosecuted, a number of corrupt Puerto Rican\n\npolice officers who assisted in the transportation and protection\n\nof illegal drugs in exchange for money.                     See United States v.\n\nSánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 71-72 (1st Cir. 2005); United States\n\nv. Villafane Jimenez, 410 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Vázquez Guadalupe, 407 F.3d 492, 494 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d 170, 172-73 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            One    of   the   officers      netted    was    Caraballo.     He   was\n\nindicted    and    arrested    in    August    2001   in    Cr.   No.   01-613   for\n\nproviding armed protection for a successful drug transport of more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine.             A second superseding indictment\n\nnamed sixteen defendants in total, charging Caraballo and others\n\nwith (1) conspiracy to knowingly and intentionally possess with\n\nintent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; (2) attempt to distribute more than\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; and (3)\n\naiding and abetting in knowingly carrying firearms during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(i).         There was also a forfeiture count against all\n\nsixteen defendants under 21           U.S.C. § 853.\n\n             The    second     superseding        indictment      charged     that    the\n\nconspirators \"use[d] their official positions as law enforcement\n\nofficers and . . . use[d] official government vehicles in order to\n\nensure      that    no   law    enforcement         agency     or   competing        drug\n\norganizations would attempt to stop the vehicle in which the\n\ncocaine was concealed and seize the same.\"                   It also alleged that\n\nthe defendants \"possess[ed] and carr[ied] firearms in order to\n\nprotect     the    shipments     of   multiple       kilogram[s]       of   purported\n\ncocaine.\"     If convicted on the drug conspiracy or attempt charge,\n\nCaraballo faced a statutory minimum of ten years of imprisonment.\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 846.                   Defendant faced at least an\n\nadditional five years if convicted of the firearms charge.                             18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).\n\n             Although      Caraballo       agreed    to    help     protect    a     drug\n\ntransport, he took some unusual steps.                He first partially tipped\n\nthe   DEA    to    the   existence    of    the     drug   conspiracy.         He    then\n\npersonally participated in the conspiracy.                   And he later met with\n\nthe DEA to offer information and confess. Specifically, on May 24,\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe day before he assisted with the transfer of some ten kilograms\n\nof what was purported to be cocaine, he placed an anonymous call to\n\nthe DEA.   Caraballo indicated that he had information about police\n\nofficers involved in drug trafficking, and stated that he had been\n\napproached by a female officer about participating in a drug\n\nsmuggling operation. On questioning from DEA agents, he refused to\n\ngive    information    that     might    identify   himself   or   his   co-\n\nconspirators, or to furnish specific information about the plot.\n\nHe withheld information he knew about the drug transport that might\n\nhave enabled the federal agents to interrupt the conspiracy.             In\n\ntruth, since this was a sting operation, the DEA had no desire to\n\ninterrupt the conspiracy.\n\n           Close to two weeks after participating in the May 25 drug\n\ntransport, on June 8, Caraballo contacted the DEA again, indicating\n\nthat he wanted to provide information about police corruption and\n\ndrug trafficking.     Later that day, Caraballo met with two federal\n\nagents and described the transport of drugs that took place two\n\nweeks   earlier.      Caraballo    provided   names   of   co-conspirators,\n\nadmitted his own participation in the drug transport, and stated\n\nthat he received $4,000 for his efforts.              Caraballo agreed to\n\ncooperate with the FBI.        The record does not establish whether he\n\nmade full disclosure.         It is clear that his later disclosure to\n\nauthorities was not made as soon as possible after he had knowledge\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fof the crime. Despite his cooperation in June, Caraballo was still\n\nindicted in August.\n\n               After he was charged, Caraballo, represented by counsel,\n\nnegotiated a plea agreement with the prosecution.                   He received a\n\nnumber of benefits. The government agreed to a new charge, brought\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 4, of misprision of felony, to which Caraballo\n\nagreed    to    waive    indictment     and   plead   guilty.        This    was    a\n\nconsiderably less significant charge than the drug conspiracy,\n\nattempt, and firearms charges.\n\n               There was another benefit to Caraballo as well.              For the\n\nlimited purpose of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that\n\nCaraballo would be held accountable for having knowledge of, and\n\nconcealing, the underlying felony of conspiracy to distribute at\n\nleast 400 grams but less than 500 grams of cocaine.                    Under the\n\nearlier drug conspiracy indictment, Caraballo had been charged with\n\nbeing accountable for more than five kilograms of cocaine, not a\n\nmere 400 to 500 grams.\n\n               And there were other benefits to Caraballo.            The parties\n\nalso   agreed     that   they   would   jointly   recommend     a    sentence      of\n\nimprisonment equivalent to the time Caraballo spent in pre-trial\n\ndetention.       Upon imposition of sentence, the United States agreed\n\nto move to dismiss the charges pending against defendant in Cr. No.\n\n01-613.    The agreement, signed on December 4, 2002 by Caraballo,\n\nwho was represented by counsel, acknowledged that \"he is pleading\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fguilty freely and voluntarily because he is in fact guilty [of the\n\ncrime of misprision].\"\n\n                               II.\n\n          The misprision information, filed in Cr. No. 02-463 on\n\nthe same day that defendant signed the plea agreement, alleged that\n\nCaraballo had knowledge of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine but\n\n\"did conceal the same by withholding information and the identities\n\nof conspirators in communications with federal law enforcement\n\nagents, and did not as soon as possible make known the conspiracy\n\nto some . . . authority.\"   On the misprision charge, Caraballo's\n\nmaximum term of imprisonment was three years, his maximum fine was\n\n$250,000, and the maximum term of supervised release was one year.\n\n          The plea agreement contained a signed stipulation of\n\nfacts, as follows:\n\n          1.   In November 2000, Arturo Ortiz-Colon, a\n          former   police   officer   cooperating   with\n          government investigators, told DIANA DIAZ-\n          CRISPIN, then a police officer of the Puerto\n          Rico Police Department, that a Colombian drug\n          trafficker referred to as \"El Viejo\" sought to\n          hire police officers to escort and protect\n          multiple kilogram shipments of cocaine. DIANA\n          DIAZ-CRISPIN agreed to escort and protect the\n          cocaine shipments, and additionally agreed to\n          recruit other police officers to escort\n          shipments of cocaine.\n\n          2.   In May 2001, . . . DIANA DIAZ-CRISPIN\n          invited OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ to assist\n          in [the] transportation and protection of a\n          cocaine shipment.     DIANA DIAZ-CRISPIN and\n          Arturo Ortiz Colon informed OSVALDO CARABALLO-\n          RODRIGUEZ of the plan to escort a shipment of\n          cocaine.\n\n                               -7-\n\f           3.    Although a police officer, OSVALDO\n           CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ did not timely report the\n           conspiracy to distribute cocaine to other\n           police officers. Although OSVALDO CARABALLO-\n           RODRIGUEZ spoke with agents of the Drug\n           Enforcement   Administration  prior   to  the\n           transport of the purported cocaine, he did so\n           anonymously and withheld information that\n           might have enabled the federal agents to\n           interrupt the conspiracy. More specifically,\n           when agents asked OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ\n           for information regarding the conspiracy,\n           OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ at that time\n           declined to identify the conspirators or to\n           furnish specific information regarding their\n           plot.\n\n           4.   On May 25, 2001, DIANA DIAZ-CRISPIN and\n           other members of her conspiracy successfully\n           transported packages purported to contain\n           cocaine from one point to another point in\n           Puerto Rico.\n\n           With   Caraballo's   consent,   his   plea   was   entered   on\n\nDecember 4, 2004 before a magistrate judge who followed the usual\n\nprocedural requirements under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n11.   During the colloquy, the following exchange took place:\n\n           THE COURT:   And the charge says, generally,\n           that you concealed the same by withholding\n           information   and   the  identities   of   the\n           conspirators in communications with federal\n           law enforcement agents and you did not as soon\n           as possible make known the conspiracy to some\n           Judge or other person in a civil or a military\n           authority under the United States.\n\n           Do you understand that?\n\n           THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\n           THE COURT: And that's the charge that you're\n           pleading guilty to, is that correct?\n\n           THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fThere is no doubt that the government made explicit its theory of\n\nwhat constituted both the underlying felony and the misprision\n\ncharge.\n\n          As for the factual basis for the plea, the government\n\nbegan its recitation of the facts at the plea hearing by noting\n\nthat \"the evidence to prove the information in this case is closely\n\ntied to the evidence in Criminal Case 0[1]-0613,\"1 which was before\n\nthe same district judge.   The government continued:\n\n                 [I]f we'd gone to trial the United\n          States would have presented testimony and\n          audio and video recordings to show that in\n          November of 2000 a cooperating witness by the\n          name of Arturo Ortiz Colon contacted a police\n          officer, Diana Diaz Crispin, and offered her a\n          job on behalf of the Colombian drug trafficker\n          known   as   \"El   Viejo[,\"]   escorting   and\n          protecting cocaine shipments.\n\n                 Diana Diaz agreed to do this and also\n          agreed to recruit other police officers.\n\n                 In May 2001 Diana Diaz Crispin invited\n          this Defendant Osvaldo Caraballo Rodriguez to\n          assist in the transportation and protection of\n          the cocaine shipment.\n\n                 She further informed this Defendant, as\n          well as Arturo Ortiz Colon informing this\n          Defendant, as well as the details of the plan\n          to escort a shipment of the cocaine.\n\n                 Although he was a police officer at the\n          time[,] this Defendant did not timely report\n          this conspiracy to any other police officers\n          or the Puerto Rico Police Department.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although the prosecutor cited Cr. No. 00-0613, it is clear\nthat he meant to refer to Cr. No. 01-613.\n\n                                -9-\n\f                  What's more, although he spoke with the\n           agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration\n           prior to the transport of the purported\n           cocaine, that is on May 24, he did so\n           anonymously and with no information that would\n           have enabled the federal agents to interrupt\n           the conspiracy.\n\n                  Specifically, when the agents asked him\n           for information regarding the conspiracy that\n           might identify the Defendant or his co-\n           conspirators or the conspirators in the\n           case[,] he declined to furnish the specific\n           information regarding the plot at that time.\n\n                  Thus, [o]n May 25, 2001 Diana Diaz\n           Crispin and other members of the conspiracy\n           successfully transported packages purported to\n           contain cocaine from one point to another in\n           Puerto Rico.\n\nNotably,   the   prosecutor   referred   to   \"Defendant    or    his   co-\n\nconspirators,\" making clear that the government believed it had\n\nevidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Caraballo had at\n\nsome point joined the conspiracy.     The prosecutor also stated that\n\nthe drug conspirators successfully transported packages purported\n\nto contain cocaine from one point to another in Puerto Rico.\n\nCaraballo agreed with this recitation of the facts:\n\n           THE COURT: Mr. Caraballo, did you listen to\n           what the Prosecutor said?\n\n           THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\n           THE COURT:   Do you agree with his statement?\n\n           THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\n           THE COURT:     Is there anything        in      that\n           statement that you disagree with?\n\n           THE WITNESS:   No, sir.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          THE COURT:   Do you still wish to plead guilty?\n\n          THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\nThe transcript of the plea hearing makes clear that, as to the\n\nunderlying drug conspiracy, Caraballo agreed that he had been a\n\nconspirator.2\n\n\n     2\n      Caraballo has moved to strike the government's supplemental\nappendix, which contains FBI interview notes relating to\nCaraballo's participation in the underlying drug offense.       The\nnotes contain admissions from Caraballo that he participated in the\nconspiracy.    Since he already agreed with the prosecutor's\nrecitation of facts at the plea colloquy, it is unclear what the\nmotion to strike on appeal is intended to accomplish.\n     Caraballo wrongly argues that the papers are outside of the\nrecord because they appeared first in the record of the underlying\ndrug case, Cr. No. 01-613.       Under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 10(a)(1), the record consists of \"the original papers and\nexhibits filed in the district court.\" But the interview notes\nwere also on file in this misprision case. The notes independently\nappear in the file for this case, stapled to Caraballo's plea\nagreement, and thus they appear to have been filed in Cr. No. 02-\n463 under docket number 3. Indeed, that docket entry is described\nby the district court as \"Plea Agreement with government's version\nof the facts attached.\" The record in this case as transmitted by\nthe district court on appeal did in fact contain the documents,\ncontrary to the dissent.     Further, Caraballo himself submitted\nthese same interview notes to this court in a pro se brief he filed\nin this case.\n     Even if the notes had not been filed in Cr. No. 02-463, the\nnotes were clearly filed in the related proceeding, Cr. No. 01-613,\nand both cases proceeded before the same district judge.       That\nmeans that the district judge who accepted Caraballo's guilty plea\nand sentenced him had these interview notes in the case files. The\ncases are so intertwined that the sentencing transcript in Cr. No.\n02-463 contains the government's formal dismissal of all charges in\nCr. No. 01-613. Accordingly, even if the interview notes had only\nbeen filed in Cr. No. 01-613, we would deem them as within the\nscope of Rule 10. Cf. United States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263, 267-\n68 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that sentencing court may rely on\ninformation derived from a co-defendant's trial before the same\njudge).\n     Further, the district court has now supplemented the record\nand certified that the interview notes are part of the record on\n\n                                -11-\n\f              The   magistrate     judge    found    defendant's       plea    to    the\n\nmisprision charge to be knowing and voluntary, accepted the plea,\n\nand made a report and recommendation to the district court on\n\nDecember 6, 2002.        Caraballo filed no objection with the district\n\ncourt.\n\n              On April 30, 2003, Caraballo appeared before the district\n\ncourt    for       sentencing.       The     court     accepted       the     parties'\n\nrecommendation and imposed a sentence of time served.                       Caraballo\n\nwas arrested on August 14, 2001 and remained in prison until\n\nDecember      4,    2002,   when     he    was     released     on    his     personal\n\nrecognizance.        No fine was imposed beyond the required special\n\nmonetary assessment of $100.\n\n              On May 6, 2003, Caraballo appealed from the judgment of\n\nconviction and his sentence. His appellate counsel initially filed\n\nan   Anders    brief,    which     this    court    rejected.        See    Anders   v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967). We directed counsel to brief\n\nthe issue of whether there was a factual basis for Caraballo's plea\n\nas to each element of the offense charged under 18 U.S.C. § 4, and\n\n\n\nthis appeal. The clerk of the district court certified that the\ntransmitted documents \"constitute the supplemental record on appeal\nin the case,\" clearly referring to Cr. No. 02-463.\n     Caraballo's other ground for striking the appendix is that the\ninterview notes are not admissible under the rules of evidence.\nBut there is no requirement, under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 10, that a document must be admissible in evidence to be\npart of the record on appeal. Nor is a sentencing court bound by\nthe rules of evidence. United States v. Green, 426 F.3d 64, 66\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fin particular whether a failure to make full disclosure constitutes\n\nan act of concealment under the misprision statute.          We directed\n\ncounsel's attention to United States v. Cefalu, 85 F.3d 964 (2d\n\nCir. 1996); United States v. Walters, 885 F.2d 1266, 1274 (5th Cir.\n\n1989); and United States v. Ciambrone, 750 F.2d 1416, 1418 (9th\n\nCir. 1985).     On the further submission of an Anders brief, we\n\npermitted   Caraballo's   counsel    to   withdraw   and   appointed   new\n\ncounsel, who has briefed this appeal.3\n\n                                III.\n\n            The essence of Caraballo's claim is that he pled guilty\n\nto activities which do not constitute the crime of misprision and\n\nso his plea must be vacated.        See United States v. Johnson, 546\n\nF.2d 1225, 1227 (5th Cir. 1977) (reversing conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4 by guilty plea on preserved claim where factual basis\n\nfor plea showed mere failure to report a felony and court held this\n\ndid not constitute misprision). He also characterizes the district\n\ncourt as having affirmatively misstated an element of the offense\n\nat the plea colloquy in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Counsel was required to consult with his client on whether\nCaraballo wished to pursue an appeal which, if successful, might\nlead to the government's reinstituting the conspiracy, attempt,\nfirearms, and criminal forfeiture charges against Caraballo.\nCounsel has done so, and Caraballo has chosen to go forward.\n\n                                -13-\n\fProcedure 11. See United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 3-\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2000).4\n\n          Rule 11 requires a court to determine that there is a\n\nfactual basis for a plea before entering judgment.   Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(b)(3).   Rule 11 also requires a court to ensure that a\n\ndefendant understands the nature of each charge to which he pleads\n\nguilty.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G).     There was certainly a\n\nfactual basis for the plea on the government's theory.         The\n\nquestion is rather whether the government's theory, which was\n\nexplained to Caraballo at the plea colloquy, permissibly stated an\n\noffense under 18 U.S.C. § 4.\n\nA.        Standard of Review\n\n          Caraballo failed to call the district court's attention\n\nto the alleged lack of a factual basis for the plea, or to present\n\nto the district court the legal arguments now asserted.   Caraballo\n\nalso never moved to withdraw his plea.\n\n          As a result, our review is for plain error.       United\n\nStates v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 58-59 (2002); United States v. Negrón-\n\nNarváez, 403 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).5    \"To establish plain\n\n\n     4\n      Further, Caraballo attempts to color his claim as raising\nconstitutional due process concerns.\n     5\n      To the extent defendant argues that the asserted error\ninvolves structural error, invoking a more demanding standard of\nreview, we reject any such claim. See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\nU.S. 279, 310 (1991) (explaining that structural error involves a\n\"structural defect affecting the framework within which the trial\nproceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process\n\n                               -14-\n\ferror, a defendant must demonstrate that: (1) there was error; (2)\n\nthe   error    was   plain;   (3)   the   error   affected   the   defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights; and (4) the error adversely impacted the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-36 (1993); United States\n\nv. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000)); see also United States\n\nv. Ramirez-Benitez, 292 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).           The burden is\n\non the defendant to establish each element of plain error.\n\n              In applying plain error analysis in guilty plea cases, a\n\ndefendant must, in order to demonstrate that his substantial rights\n\nwere affected, \"show a reasonable probability that, but for the\n\nerror, he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\" United States\n\nv. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 83 (2004); see also United\n\nStates v. Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(applying plain error analysis where defendant argued there was no\n\nfactual basis to support his guilty plea).           \"A defendant must thus\n\nsatisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire\n\n\n\nitself\"); United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 219 (1st Cir.\n2005) (en banc) (noting that \"[t]he category of structural error\nhas been reserved for a very limited class of cases\" involving\n\"only the most pervasive and debilitating errors,\" such as \"a total\nwithholding of the right to counsel at trial,\" \"a denial of the\nright of self-representation at trial,\" or \"the specter of a biased\njudge presiding over a case\" (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).     Here, defendant has not alleged an error\naffecting the \"entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end.\"\nFulminante, 499 U.S. at 309.\n\n                                      -15-\n\frecord, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\"    Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. at 83 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nB.        Misprision of Felony -- Was There Plain Error?\n\n          The prosecution has articulated the elements of the\n\noffense as follows:\n\n          In   the   instant  case,   the   offense   of\n          conviction, misprision of felony, requires\n          proof that: \"1) the principal committed and\n          completed the alleged felony; 2) defendant had\n          full knowledge of that fact; 3) defendant\n          failed to notify the authorities; and 4)\n          defendant took steps to conceal the crime.\"\n\nSee Cefalu, 85 F.3d at 969 (citing Ciambrone, 750 F.2d at 1417;\n\nUnited States v. Baez, 732 F.2d 780, 782 (10th Cir. 1984)).\n\nCaraballo has not materially contested this formulation, and we\n\naccept it arguendo.\n\n          This is an unusual case in that Caraballo had several\n\noverlapping roles.    First, he had full knowledge, both before and\n\nafter, of a crime.    Second, he was a participant in that crime and\n\nnot a mere witness.      Third, although he did initially notify\n\nauthorities, he did not provide authorities with his full knowledge\n\nof the drug conspiracy despite requests that he do so.     Fourth, he\n\nwas not a mere member of the public but was a police officer.   Each\n\nof these roles factors into the analysis.\n\n          Applying the plain error test, we ask whether Caraballo's\n\nproposed construction -- that a partial truthful disclosure cannot\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fbe an affirmative act and an affirmative act is required -- is\n\ncompelled by the language of the statute itself, construction of\n\nthe statute in light of the common law, or binding judicial\n\nconstruction of the statute.        We hold that Caraballo has not met\n\nhis burden of showing there was an error which was plain, for\n\nseveral basic reasons.      In doing so, we do not make any ruling on\n\nthe merits of the issues discussed under the misprision statute.\n\n            First, while this court and the Supreme Court may someday\n\nadopt the majority rule in the circuits that an affirmative act is\n\nrequired    for   a   misprision   offense,    there   is   now   no   binding\n\nprecedent to that effect.          Caraballo does not argue otherwise.\n\nNone of our misprision cases has adopted Caraballo's proposed rule.\n\nFurther, in United States v. Vazquez-Alomar, 342 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\n\nCir. 2003), we suggested that a federal prisoner had violated 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4 when he did not inform federal authorities that he had\n\nengaged    in   telephone   conversations     with   others   about    crimes.\n\nConsequently, there can be no plain error.              Thus, we need not\n\nresolve the greyer areas of what constitutes an affirmative act.\n\nSecondly, we cannot say there is plain error because the government\n\narticulates a new theory, not accepted, but not rejected by any\n\ncourt, based on Caraballo's obligations as a police officer.               The\n\ntheory has some support at English common law.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f          Caraballo's argument that there was plain error is not\n\nproven by the language of the statute itself. Misprision of felony\n\nis defined at 18 U.S.C. § 4:\n\n          Whoever, having knowledge of the actual\n          commission of a felony cognizable by a court\n          of the United States, conceals and does not as\n          soon as possible make known the same to some\n          judge or other person in civil or military\n          authority under the United States, shall be\n          fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n          than three years, or both.\n\nThe underlying felony in this case was the drug conspiracy charged\n\nin Cr. No. 01-613.   At issue is whether the facts alleged satisfy\n\nthe statutory terms \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make\n\nknown.\"\n\n          The dictionary definitions of \"conceal\" and \"concealment\"\n\ndo not prove Caraballo's claim.       The Oxford English Dictionary\n\nrefers to both a common usage of keeping secret of any information\n\nand a legal usage of intentional suppression of truth.     3 Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary 647 (2d ed. 1989).       Black's Law Dictionary\n\ndefines the primary meaning of \"concealment\" as \"[t]he act of\n\nrefraining from disclosure[, especially] an act by which one\n\nprevents or hinders the discovery of something.\"       Black's Law\n\nDictionary 306 (8th ed. 2004).    Neither source compels only one\n\nreading of the term \"conceals\" in 18 U.S.C. § 4.\n\n          Nor does the common law background of the statute compel\n\nCaraballo's reading.   The statute at issue derives from a common\n\nlaw offense. Misprision of felony was a crime under English common\n\n                               -18-\n\flaw, dating back centuries.     Sykes v. Dir. Pub. Prosecutions,\n\n[1962] A.C. 528, 555 (H.L.) (U.K.) (stating that misprision of\n\nfelony \"has been an offence for the last 700 years or more,\" though\n\nnot always under that name); C.W. Mullis, Comment, Misprision of\n\nFelony: A Reappraisal, 23 Emory L.J. 1095, 1095 (1974) (noting that\n\n\"[t]he offense of failing to report a felony was first labeled\n\n'misprision' by Sir William Staun[]ford in 1557\").\n\n           Congress, in 1790, enacted a federal misprision statute\n\nwhich is essentially the same as 18 U.S.C. § 4 today.   See Act of\n\nApr. 30, 1790, § 6, 1 Stat. 113.       There are some differences,\n\nhowever, between the English common law doctrine and how the\n\nfederal statute has been interpreted in the United States.     See\n\nC.M. Curenton, Comment, The Past, Present, and Future of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4: An Exploration of the Federal Misprision of Felony Statute, 55\n\nAla. L. Rev. 183, 183-84, 186 (2003); Mullis, supra, at 1098-99,\n\n1101-04.\n\n           At English common law, \"[e]ver since the days of hue and\n\ncry, it [was] the duty of a man, who kn[ew] that a felony ha[d]\n\nbeen committed, to report it to the proper authority so that steps\n\n[could] be taken to apprehend the felon and bring him to justice.\"\n\nSykes, [1962] A.C. at 555.   Accordingly, Staunford in 1557 defined\n\nmisprision as follows: \"Misprision . . . is properly when anyone\n\nlearns or knows that another has committed treason or felony, and\n\nhe does not choose to denounce him to the King or to his Council,\n\n\n                                -19-\n\for to any magistrate, but conceals his offense.\"                Id. at 557.    In\n\nlight       of   this   history,   Lord    Denning   of   the   House   of   Lords\n\npronounced that a person accused of misprision of felony \"need not\n\nhave done anything active: but it is his duty by law to disclose to\n\nproper authority all material facts known to him relative to the\n\noffence.\"        Id. at 563.   Lord Guest, for his part, observed that he\n\ncould not find in the \"numerous institutional writers who have\n\ndefined [misprision of felony] . . . any statement that active\n\nsteps of concealment are required to constitute the offence.\"                 Id.\n\nat 572.\n\n                 Nor has the Supreme Court adopted Caraballo's reading.\n\nThe Court, in Roberts v. United States, 445 U.S. 552 (1980),6\n\ndiscussed the obligations of citizens not to conceal crimes, first\n\nas a matter of common law and then as defined and enforced through\n\n18 U.S.C. § 4.          As Roberts stated:\n\n                 Concealment of crime has been condemned\n                 throughout our history. The citizen's duty to\n                 \"raise the 'hue and cry' and report felonies\n                 to the authorities,\" Branzburg v. Hayes, 408\n                 U.S. 665, 696 (1972), was an established tenet\n                 of Anglo-Saxon law at least as early as the\n                 13th century.    2 W. Holdsworth, History of\n\n\n        6\n      Roberts dealt with the analogous question of whether a\nsentencing court could take into account the fact that a defendant\nonly partially cooperated with the police investigation.       The\ndefendant provided information about drug transactions and\nexplained the meaning of certain code words, but gave evasive\nanswers when asked to name suppliers. 445 U.S. at 554. Roberts,\nin a pre-guidelines era, held that the judge could properly take\nthe defendant's lack of full cooperation into account at\nsentencing. Id. at 561-62.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f             English Law 101-102 (3d ed. 1927); 4 id., at\n             521-522; see Statute of Westminster First, 3\n             Edw. 1, ch. 9, p. 43 (1275); Statute of\n             Westminster Second, 13 Edw. 1, chs. 1, 4, and\n             6, pp. 112-115 (1285). The first Congress of\n             the United States exacted a statute imposing\n             criminal penalties upon anyone who, \"having\n             knowledge of the actual commission of [certain\n             felonies,] shall conceal, and not as soon as\n             may be disclose and make known the same to\n             [the appropriate] authority . . . .\" Act of\n             Apr. 30, 1790, § 6, 1 Stat. 113. Although the\n             term \"misprision of felony\" now has an archaic\n             ring, gross indifference to the duty to report\n             known criminal behavior remains a badge of\n             irresponsible citizenship.\n\n445 U.S. at 557-58 (alterations in original) (footnote omitted).\n\nRoberts made explicit that 18 U.S.C. § 4 can be applied where, as\n\nhere, the witness to the crime is a participant himself in the\n\nunderlying     criminal   activities,    subject   to   Fifth   Amendment\n\nconcerns7:\n\n\n     7\n      Where the person with knowledge of an underlying crime is\nalso involved in the crime, there are tensions between the Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and the statutory\nobligation to provide disclosure.     See, e.g., United States v.\nKing, 402 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir. 1968); see also United States v.\nKuh, 541 F.2d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 1976) (\"If the duty to notify\nfederal authorities is precluded by constitutional privilege, it is\ndifficult to understand how a conviction [under 18 U.S.C. § 4]\ncould be substantiated.\"). But see United States v. Daddano, 432\nF.2d 1119, 1125, 1129 (7th Cir. 1970) (discussing argument that the\nmisprision statute could not be applied to defendants because of\nFifth Amendment privilege, but ultimately affirming convictions).\nCaraballo has not argued there are any Fifth Amendment privilege\nissues in this appeal. Caraballo has not established that he was\nentitled to assert any Fifth Amendment privilege at the time of his\ninitial tip.   The record established only that he knew of the\nconspiracy, and does not establish that he had in fact agreed to\nparticipate in the conspiracy. He waived any privilege as of the\ntime he disclosed to the police after he participated in the crime.\nNor does Caraballo argue that the Fifth Amendment shielded him from\n\n                                  -21-\n\f          This deeply rooted social obligation is not\n          diminished when the witness to crime is\n          involved   in  illicit   activities  himself.\n          Unless his silence is protected by the\n          privilege against self-incrimination . . .,\n          the criminal defendant no less than any other\n          citizen is obliged to assist the authorities.\n\nId. at 558. Putting constitutional concerns aside momentarily, the\n\nstatutory text applies to \"whoever\" meets its criteria, and does\n\nnot necessarily exclude participants in crimes.8\n\n          Still, in Caraballo's favor is the fact that neither the\n\ncommon law crime nor the statute was meant to punish in every\n\ninstance every person who knows of a crime but does not report it.\n\nIn 1822, Chief Justice Marshall noted, \"It may be the duty of a\n\ncitizen to accuse every offender, and to proclaim every offense\n\nwhich comes to his knowledge; but the law which would punish him in\n\nevery case for not performing this duty is too harsh for man.\"\n\nMarbury v. Brooks, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 556, 575-76 (1822). Further,\n\n\napplication of the statute.\n     The privilege may be waived, as Caraballo has done, thus\npermitting plea bargains of this sort.\n     It may also be that the statute is curtailed by common law\nprivileges, such as the attorney-client privilege or spousal\nimmunity. See Mullis, supra, at 1099, 1110; see also Sykes, [1962]\nA.C. at 564 (dismissing claim that \"the offence of misprision is\nimpossibly wide,\" reasoning that \"[n]on-disclosure may sometimes be\njustified or excused on the ground of privilege,\" such as that\nbetween attorneys and clients or between doctors and patients).\nNone of those common law privileges is involved here.\n     8\n      In Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 696 n.36 (1972), the\nSupreme Court also noted that some lower courts had construed the\nstatute to require both knowledge of a crime and an affirmative act\nof concealment or participation, but the Court did not adopt that\nconstruction.\n\n                               -22-\n\fit is clear that misprision of felony cannot be read so broadly as\n\nto \"make a criminal of anyone who, as the victim of a crime or\n\nfaced with a criminal threat, resisted a . . . suggestion that the\n\npolice be called.\"     United States v. Rakes, 136 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   The scope of the obligations imposed by the statute is an\n\nimportant issue in today's society where police investigations are\n\noften hampered by codes of silence and fearful refusal by witnesses\n\nto cooperate.    Those issues are beyond the scope of this opinion.\n\n            Rather,     Caraballo's      argument    turns   on   judicial\n\nconstruction of the statute; since we have not yet adopted the\n\nconstruction he urges, there is no plain error.         However, we do not\n\nforeclose   later     adoption   of   such   a   construction.    Caraballo\n\nparticularly stresses the fact that many courts have interpreted\n\nthe \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make known\" language\n\nas requiring an affirmative act of concealment.

United States, 73 F.2d 795, 797-98 (10th Cir. 1934) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Farrar, 38 F.2d 515, 517 (D. Mass), aff'd on\n\ndifferent grounds, 281 U.S. 624 (1930)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f              Whether it is a proper construction of the statute to\n\nrequire an affirmative act of concealment has been questioned.\n\nMullis, supra, at 1104 (\"The possibility that such a requirement\n\nwas originally intended by Congress is rather slim, since, by the\n\ndate of the statute's first enactment [in 1790], such a requirement\n\nhad never before been applied to the crime.          It is much more\n\nreasonable to conclude that Congress intended 'conceal and' to\n\nsignify a conscious and intentional non-disclosure.\").\n\n              Caraballo argues that, in any of his capacities, he did\n\nnot conceal the drug conspiracy.      Rather, he disclosed it, and his\n\nrefusal to provide the additional requested information cannot be\n\npunished as an act of concealment.9      Caraballo relies on a series\n\nof cases holding that mere silence does not qualify as an act of\n\nconcealment.      See Goldberg, 862 F.2d at 105-06; Johnson, 546 F.2d\n\nat 1227; Lancey, 356 F.2d at 410; Neal, 102 F.2d at 650;     Bratton,\n\n73 F.2d at 798.       But mere silence cases do not necessarily help\n\nhim.       Caraballo did not remain merely silent.   He affirmatively\n\nsought out federal agents to make partial disclosure, but then\n\ndeclined to provide requested information.\n\n              Caraballo places special emphasis on Ciambrone, a Ninth\n\nCircuit case.      Ciambrone is not a mere silence case, but a partial\n\ndisclosure case.      The defendant in Ciambrone truthfully, but only\n\n\n       9\n      In most cases, it is irrelevant whether the government had\nother knowledge of the crime, as it apparently did here. Lancey,\n356 F.2d at 409-10.\n\n                                  -24-\n\fpartially, disclosed his knowledge about a counterfeiting operation\n\nto a Secret Service agent.        750 F.2d at 1417.    The court held that\n\npartial disclosure could not constitute misprision because if some\n\ninformation were offered, there could be no greater concealment of\n\nthe felony than if the defendant who had knowledge of the crime had\n\nsaid nothing.      Id. at 1418.    Ciambrone required an affirmative act\n\nand implicitly held that the act of coming forward to provide\n\ninformation, but refusing to answer other questions, does not\n\nqualify as an affirmative act of concealment.           None of the other\n\ncases cited by Caraballo adopts Ciambrone's position with respect\n\nto partial disclosures.         Indeed, no federal court has followed\n\nCiambrone in holding that a truthful, but partial, disclosure is\n\ninsufficient to support a misprision conviction.\n\n          The Ciambrone logic, then, departs from the common law\n\nposition that there is a general duty on citizens to disclose, and\n\ninstead relies on a more limited rationale for the statute that\n\nmisprision    is    concerned     only   with   situations   in   which   the\n\ngovernment may be put in a worse situation or misled.\n\n          Caraballo      admits     that    courts   have    sustained    the\n\napplication of the misprision statute in cases where someone with\n\nknowledge of a felony provided untruthful information. See Sampol,\n\n636 F.2d at 656; cf. United States v. Salinas, 956 F.2d 80, 81 (5th\n\nCir. 1992).   He distinguishes these cases on the facts here, on the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fbasis that it is not alleged that he provided false information to\n\nfederal agents.\n\n            There may be instances in which even partial truthful\n\ndisclosures     can   be    misleading.        Ciambrone    assumes   that    the\n\ngovernment may not be misled by receipt of truthful information,\n\neven if it is incomplete, 750 F.2d at 1418, but that is not\n\nnecessarily so.       For example, United States v. Sessions, Nos. 00-\n\n1756, 00-1791, 2000 WL 1456903 (8th Cir. Oct. 2, 2000) (unpublished\n\ndecision), held that the misprision statute was satisfied where the\n\ndefendant \"gave incomplete information to police regarding his\n\nknowledge of the [crime],\" at least where he \"gave the police\n\npartial information that was misleading.\"                Id. at *1.      If the\n\nstatute    is   geared     toward   avoiding    the   misleading   of    police,\n\nCiambrone, 750 F.2d at 1418, it is still possible, in concept and\n\nin fact, that even a truthful but partial disclosure could conceal\n\nby   misleading   the      government    through   the     withholding   of   key\n\ninformation.10\n\n\n\n      10\n      This concept is commonly accepted in other areas of law. See\nUnited States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12, 33 (1st Cir. 2003)\n(recognizing that omitted facts in a wiretap warrant affidavit may\nmislead); United States v. Reilly, 76 F.3d 1271, 1280 (2d Cir.\n1996) (commenting that a \"bare-bones description\" submitted to\njudge may have been \"calculated to mislead\"); United States v.\nStanert, 762 F.2d 775, 781 (9th Cir. 1985) (holding that omitted\nfacts in a warrant affidavit may mislead); United States v.\nPrevite, 648 F.2d 73, 85 (1st Cir. 1981) (noting that trial court's\nuse of slide transparencies to deliver jury instructions \"had some\npotential to mislead the jury, more by what they omitted than by\nwhat they contained\").\n\n                                        -26-\n\f            We cannot tell from the facts here whether the giving of\n\npartial information in this case in any way could have misled the\n\nDEA -- the information against Caraballo alleged only that he\n\nwithheld information and the identities of co-conspirators, and did\n\nnot   as   soon   as    possible    make   the    conspiracy      known    to   the\n\nappropriate authorities.           On plain error review, even under a\n\nmodified Ciambrone approach, it is defendant's burden to show that\n\nhis   truthful    but   partial    disclosure      was   not    misleading,     and\n\nCaraballo has not done so.\n\n            The government argues, as a second theory,11 that even if\n\nthere is a requirement for an affirmative misrepresentation from an\n\nordinary citizen, Caraballo had higher duties as a police officer.\n\nThis appears to present a novel interpretation of the statute. The\n\nprosecution's     theory    derives    from      the   obligations    on   police\n\nofficers to disclose information about crimes, irrespective of\n\nwhether civilians would have had such a duty.                  Caraballo was, at\n\n\n      11\n      At oral argument, but not in its brief, the government\npresented an additional argument -- that the \"concealment\"\nconsisted of defendant's actions during the underlying drug crime\nwhen, by providing a police escort, he tried to make it appear that\nthe transport of the drugs was legitimate. See United States v.\nGravitt, 590 F.2d 123, 125-26 (5th Cir. 1979) (defendant\ntransported robbers in his car to where stolen money was stashed\nand then returned to his apartment where money was divided); see\nalso Lancey, 356 F.2d at 410-11 (defendant either himself concealed\nor allowed bank robber to conceal numerous items related to\nrobbery). That was not the theory on which the plea was accepted.\nOn the other hand, had Caraballo raised questions before the\ndistrict court about the legitimacy of the government's misprision\ntheory, the government might have filed a new or amended\ninformation raising this alternate theory of concealment.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fthe time, a police officer who had an affirmative duty to act on\n\ninformation about a crime under Puerto Rican law.        See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 25, § 3102 (duty of the \"Puerto Rico Police\" is to\n\n\"prevent, discover, investigate and persecute crime and, within the\n\nscope of its authority, enforce obedience of the laws\").\n\n            The   prosecution   argues   that   government   officials,\n\nparticularly police, who are already under an affirmative duty to\n\nreport crimes, inherently conceal when they do not meet their duty\n\nto disclose.      We have found no misprision cases discussing this\n\ntheory.12\n\n            Nonetheless, the argument, in light of the theory of law\n\nunder the misprision statute to which Caraballo pled guilty, cannot\n\nbe said to be plainly erroneous. Roberts itself referred to \"gross\n\n\n     12\n      Of the multiple misprision cases Caraballo cites in his\nbrief, only two involve defendants who were police officers. In\nneither case, apparently, was this argument made. The defendant in\nBratton was a peace officer who apprehended someone feloniously\npossessing alcohol. 73 F.2d at 796 n.1, 797. The officer released\nthe offender upon a promise of being paid a bribe, most of which\nwas in fact paid. Id. at 796 n.1. The Tenth Circuit, in 1934,\nreversed the conviction, finding no act of concealment. Id. at\n798-99.   The court did not, however, consider the import of\nBratton's status as an officer. Id.\n     In Daddano, one of the defendants was the Chief Investigator\nof the Special Investigations Unit for the county sheriff's\ndepartment. 432 F.2d at 1122. The Seventh Circuit held that the\njury could properly infer from the evidence that the officer had\narranged to have lie detector tests administered to a group of bank\nrobbers, at the request of a crime boss. Id. at 1122-23. The\ncourt held that the administration of the lie detector tests\nconstituted an affirmative act of concealment. Id. at 1124-25.\nBut, as in Bratton, the court did not consider whether the\ndefendant's occupation as a police officer imposed special duties.\nId. at 1123-25.\n\n                                  -28-\n\findifference to the duty to report\" and thought pertinent the\n\ndevelopment of this duty in Anglo-Saxon law. Indeed, there is some\n\nhistorical support in common law misprision doctrine for imposing\n\nspecial responsibilities on public officials.           In 1628, Lord Coke\n\nin his Third Institute noted that \"the concealment of felonies in\n\nsheriffs, or bailiffs of liberties is more severely punished than\n\nin others.\"     Sykes, [1962] A.C. at 558 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Professor Glazebrook, although arguing for a broader\n\nview of what constituted misprision under English common law, has\n\nrecognized    that   the   term   \"misprision\"   in    the   fourteenth    and\n\nfifteenth centuries was thought \"to have been . . . especially\n\nappropriate     to   the   misconduct    of   public    officers.\"        P.R.\n\nGlazebrook, Misprision of Felony -- Shadow or Phantom?, 8 Am. J.\n\nLegal Hist. 189, 191, 194 (1964).             As another commentator has\n\nnoted, \"In fact, a strong case can be made that misprision should\n\nhave particular applicability to public officers.            Even at common\n\nlaw, commission of misprision appears to have been especially\n\nculpable for public officers, since they received a higher penalty\n\nfor the crime than that received by ordinary citizens.\"              Mullis,\n\nsupra, at 1113 (citing W. Blackstone, 4 Commentaries 121). Because\n\nthe theory is novel under the statute, it has neither been accepted\n\nnor rejected.    The burden is on defendant to show that if there was\n\nany error, that error was plain.        Ramirez-Benitez, 292 F.3d at 27.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f          This background buttresses our conclusion that if there\n\nwas any error, it was not plain error.    We stress that we do not,\n\nand need not, rule on the merits of issues pertaining to the\n\njudicial construction of the statute. The analysis could end here,\n\nbut we comment briefly on the remaining prongs of the test.\n\nC.        Other Elements of Plain Error Test\n\n          Under the third prong, we must ask, as Caraballo has\n\nframed the issue of the voluntariness of the plea,13 whether there\n\nis a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged error,\n\nCaraballo would have decided not to plead guilty.     See Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. at 83.   We do so by looking at the entire record,\n\nand not just at what was directly before the district court during\n\nthe plea hearing.   Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d at 28-32.   In this\n\ncase, the plea was entirely voluntary, and defendant was fairly\n\napprised of both the law and the facts.   See United States v. Cruz-\n\nRivera, 357 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding defendant to\n\nguilty plea on plain error standard of review). Caraballo chose to\n\n\n     13\n      Caraballo has not argued more generally that he can show\n\"that the probability of a different result is sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\" Dominguez\nBenitez, 542 U.S. at 83 (internal quotation marks omitted). He has\nwaived any other argument based on the adequacy of the facts\nrecited. Even if the issue had not been waived, as it has been, it\nis without merit. The facts presented with the plea reasonably\nconstituted a basis on which the court could accept the plea. See\nUnited States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2006).\nFurther, even if this court were to adopt some sort of affirmative\nmisrepresentation requirement, Caraballo has not shown that his\nonly partial disclosures were not affirmative acts and did not have\nsome misleading effect.\n\n                                -30-\n\fplead guilty as part of an extremely favorable plea deal he and his\n\ncounsel    worked         out    with   the    government.          He   also    chose   to\n\ncooperate, and he admitted to participation in the drug conspiracy,\n\nfor which he received a benefit.                 At his plea colloquy, Caraballo\n\nagreed with the prosecutor's statement that he was a \"conspirator,\"\n\nan obvious reference to the drug conspiracy.                       Caraballo's deal was\n\nthus specifically structured to find a significantly less serious\n\noffense to which he could plead, and one which would permit him to\n\navoid    any    imprisonment          beyond    the   time    already        served.      As\n\nCaraballo's         own       counsel     stated      at   sentencing:          \"Initially\n\n[Caraballo] was tempted by the . . . economic gain that pervades\n\nthe drug traffic, and he wavered. . . . But he took certain steps\n\nafterwards      .    .    .     and   [the    prosecutor]     was     wise    enough     and\n\ninterested enough in justice that he reviewed that, and we came up\n\nwith [this plea bargain].\"                Thus, even if the district court had\n\nerred in its understanding of misprision law, there is nothing in\n\nthe record to suggest that the defendant would have been willing to\n\nrisk trial on the conspiracy charges in the absence of the error.\n\nSee United States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Caraballo's substantial rights were not affected.\n\n               Under      the    fourth      prong,   we     ask    whether     the    plea\n\narrangement calls into question the integrity of the judicial\n\nprocess.       This case does not present the sort of miscarriage of\n\njustice for which plain error is reserved.                           United States v.\n\n\n                                              -31-\n\fSavinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d 265, 269 (1st Cir. 2000).        Caraballo, who\n\nparticipated in a major drug conspiracy, had his cooperation\n\ngenerously rewarded.     He was sentenced to time served of less than\n\nsixteen months.    If convicted of the original drug conspiracy or\n\nattempt charge involving more than five kilograms of cocaine, he\n\nfaced a minimum sentence of \"not . . . less than 10 years\" under 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A) and 846.           If convicted of the original\n\nfirearms charge, he faced an additional five years of imprisonment\n\nor more under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). Other officers who were\n\nconvicted   in   this   same   conspiracy   received   lengthy   terms   of\n\nimprisonment on the order of twenty years.         Sánchez-Berríos, 424\n\nF.3d at 73; Villafane Jimenez, 410 F.3d at 78; Vázquez Guadalupe,\n\n407 F.3d at 495; Flecha-Maldonado, 373 F.3d at 174.       Whether or not\n\nthe lesser charge of misprision constituted, on these facts, a\n\nviable theory of criminal liability, Caraballo, who was advised by\n\ncounsel, not surprisingly agreed to plead guilty to that theory.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n             -Concurring and Dissenting Opinions Follow-\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.    From time to time in\n\nthe course of plea negotiations, the government and the defendant\n\njoin together in seeking to shoe-horn conduct into an offense less\n\nserious than that charged in the indictment.   If and when the plea\n\nis accepted, the defendant occasionally seeks to have it both ways\n\nby later attacking the conviction, asserting that what he did does\n\nnot constitute the crime of conviction.    The barriers to attacks\n\nbased on second thoughts are high.\n\n           If made in the trial court an attempted withdrawal of a\n\nguilty plea requires a \"fair and just reason\" for withdrawal. Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B).   If, as here, the effort is not made until\n\nthe appeal, relief is discretionary and the defendant must meet the\n\nvery stiff Olano standards for plain error: error, plainness,\n\nprejudice and something akin to a miscarriage of justice.    United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993); see also United States\n\nv. Mercedes Mercedes, 428 F.3d 355, 359 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Caraballo-Rodriguez made his anonymous telephone call to\n\nthe authorities after he may have already engaged in conduct that\n\nmight have amounted to aiding in a drug conspiracy.   Whether or not\n\nthe call was made in good faith or was an anchor to windward is\n\nunclear.   But the defendant was in some peril of being charged and\n\nconvicted of a crime that could have netted him a long sentence.\n\nBy the time of his guilty plea, he had already been indicted on\n\n\n\n\n                                -33-\n\fmultiple counts of conspiring to distribute large amounts of\n\ncocaine and on a related firearms charge.\n\n           As for the government, it may have wished to reward the\n\ndefendant's cooperation in securing convictions against others. Or\n\nthe prosecutor might have had concern that a jury would give undue\n\nweight to the anonymous telephone call as supporting a claim, if\n\nmade by the defendant, that he had no criminal intent and had\n\nmerely played along in the conspiracy.    And, any case settled by a\n\nguilty plea saves government resources for other prosecutions.\n\n           The district court held a hearing, described the offense,\n\nconsidered the proffer of evidence, heard the defendant admit guilt\n\nand found that there was a reasonable factual basis for the plea.\n\nNo request to withdraw the plea was made in the district court.        On\n\nappeal,   Caraballo-Rodriguez   says   that    misprision   requires   an\n\naffirmative act and that plain error occurred because the evidence\n\ndid not show such an act and the requirement was not fully\n\nexplained to him.\n\n           It turns out that, as the panel opinion shows, the law is\n\nfuzzy.    This circuit has not precisely defined \"concealment\" and,\n\neven if concealment generally requires an affirmative act of some\n\nkind (as may well be the case), just what constitutes such an act\n\nin this context is debatable: conceivably, Caraballo-Rodriguez's\n\nhalf-complete and anonymous telephone call could be regarded as\n\ndeceptive and affirmatively wrongful.         It should not be assumed\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fthat we must now resolve such issues as if this were an appeal\n\nafter a conviction.   Under Olano, far more is required for claims\n\nadvanced for the first time on appeal.\n\n          If the government and the defendant had invented a wholly\n\nimaginary offense, or the district court had fundamentally mis-\n\ndescribed the offense, or if the defendant had offered a factual\n\npredicate unrelated to the elements of the crime, letting the plea\n\nstand might well \"seriously impair[] the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the proceeding.\"      United States v. Negrón-\n\nNarváez, 403 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v.\n\nDelgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 28 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          But misprision of felony is a real crime and the district\n\njudge was required to do no more than give the required cautions,\n\ndescribe the crime and determine whether there was a factual basis\n\nfor the plea.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).14   This does not mean that\n\nthe judge had to give final instructions or find that the defendant\n\nwas guilty of the crime; it is enough that there was a rational\n\nbasis for the plea.   United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n\n     14\n      The district judge described the offense as charged in the\ninformation--concealment of information and the identities of\nconspirators in communications with federal agents--and defense\ncounsel assured the court that he had reviewed the charges with the\ndefendant. \"Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel,\nthe court usually may rely on that counsel's assurance that the\ndefendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of\nthe charge to which he is pleading guilty.\" Bradshaw v. Stumpf,\n545 U.S. 175, 183 (2005).\n\n                                -35-\n\f              We have previously declined to find plain error where\n\nthe issue was unsettled in the First Circuit and the law was not\n\ncrystal clear.     See United States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 97 (1st\n\nCir. 2002), and it is hard to say that there was plainly no basis\n\nfor the plea or that the colloquy was plain error.       Nor is it a\n\nmiscarriage of justice that the defendant--implicated in a serious\n\ndrug crime--should be convicted by guilty plea for a closely\n\nrelated lesser crime of which he might have been convicted at\n\ntrial.    See United States v. Colon-Nales, 464 F.3d 21, 28-29 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n           Even in criminal cases the two sides are allowed over a\n\nbroad range to reach their own accommodations.15    This serves both\n\nsides' interests or else the agreements would not be reached.    And\n\nif attempts to back out of such agreements were freely indulged,\n\nthe agreements would less often be made.    As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained, relief from a guilty plea \"will be difficult to get, as\n\nit should be.\"    United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 83\n\n& n.9 (2004).\n\n\n\n                     -Dissenting opinion follows-\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      In addition to plea agreements, examples include stipulations\nof fact or of elements of the offense or issues arising in\nsentencing, Alford (North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970))\nand nolo contendere pleas, and knowing waivers of possible\ndefenses.\n\n                                 -36-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, dissenting.           On May 24, 2001,\n\nOsvaldo Caraballo-Rodríguez learned of a conspiracy to commit drug\n\ntrafficking.   That same day, Caraballo contacted the DEA and told\n\nthem about the conspiracy, but refused to give his name or those of\n\nthe other participants in the conspiracy.            Caraballo was then\n\nconvicted, by guilty plea, of misprision of a felony, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4. Because partial but truthful disclosure of one's knowledge of\n\na criminal activity is insufficient to sustain a conviction for\n\nmisprision, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                     I. The Supplemental Appendix\n\n           Before I reach the substance of Caraballo's appeal, I\n\nmust first address the issue of the Government's \"supplemental\n\nappendix.\"   This \"supplemental appendix\" contains information not\n\nfrom   Caraballo's   conviction,   but    from   another    case   initially\n\nbrought against Caraballo but later dismissed.              The Government\n\nurges us to consider this information in deciding this case.            Our\n\nrules of procedure are clear.         Fed. R. App. P. 10 states in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n           (a) Composition of the Record on Appeal. The\n           following items constitute the record on\n           appeal:\n                   (1) the original papers and exhibits filed in the\n                       district court;\n                   (2) the transcript of proceedings, if\n                       any; and\n                   (3) a certified copy of the docket entries\n                       prepared by the district clerk.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fThe material offered by the Government was not part of the original\n\npapers or exhibits filed in the district court, nor is it a\n\ntranscript of the proceedings or a certified copy of the docket\n\nentries.16     Thus, we cannot consider it on appeal.               See, e.g.,\n\nRuiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales, 415 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); Lewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 215 n.7 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"It is elementary, however, that we review the record as it\n\nexisted at the time the district court rendered its ruling . . . .\"\n\n(emphasis added)).      The reasons for this rule are not trivial.          The\n\ndistrict court is better suited for reviewing evidence and making\n\nfindings of fact.       See Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U.S.\n\n225,    233    (1991)   (noting   that    \"the    respective      institutional\n\nadvantages of\" a trial court include \"the unchallenged superiority\n\nof the district court's factfinding ability\").               Because of these\n\ninstitutional     advantages,     we   accord    deference   to    trial   court\n\nrulings regarding the admissibility of evidence, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2002), and credibility,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 284 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).      Thus, we require that all evidence first be placed before\n\na district court because an appellate court's chief competence is\n\nnot evidentiary review.           This is especially true here, where\n\n\n       16\n      The district court eventually transmitted a record to this\ncourt which referred to the documents in the supplemental appendix,\nbut this record only noted that the documents were part of the\nrecord in the conspiracy case, No. 01-613, rather than the\nmisprision case.\n\n                                       -38-\n\fCaraballo raises a number of challenges to the admissibility and\n\ncredibility of the material the Government seeks to introduce.17\n\n          Furthermore, the fact that the judge was the same in both\n\ncriminal cases, or that the dockets are \"intertwined\" has no effect\n\non this conclusion; we generally do not allow parties in one case\n\nto sift through the dockets of other cases to come up with evidence\n\nto support their conclusions on appeal.   The majority, in reaching\n\nits conclusion, cites two cases for the proposition that judges may\n\nreach across case lines and disregard evidentiary rules in the\n\nsentencing context: United States v. Green, 426 F.3d 64, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (\"[T]he district court may consider all the evidence,\n\neven if inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, provided\n\nthat the information has 'sufficient indicia of reliability to\n\nsupport its probable accuracy.'\") and United States v. Canada, 960\n\nF.2d 263, 267-68 (1st Cir. 1992) (approving use of transcripts from\n\ncodefendant's trial at sentencing hearing).       These cases are\n\nunpersuasive for the simple fact that they address sentencing.\n\nCaraballo is not challenging his sentence; he is challenging his\n\nconviction, and we have not yet disregarded evidentiary rules when\n\nreviewing a conviction.   In any case, regardless of whether the\n\n\n     17\n      It is worth noting that although I agree with the majority\nthat a document need not be admissible in evidence to be part of\nthe record on appeal, it would need to be admissible for a district\njudge to consider it, and we would rule it error for the district\njudge to have relied on inadmissible evidence in coming to its\nconclusion. See Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme Química P.R.,\nInc., 447 F.3d 105, 114 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                               -39-\n\fsupplemental appendix is being used to sustain a conviction or a\n\nsentence, it was not presented to the district court in Caraballo's\n\nmisprision case, and as such, we may not consider it.                United\n\nStates v. Muriel-Cruz, 412 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Absent\n\nextraordinary circumstances, not present here, we consult only the\n\nrecord    extant   at   the   time   the    district   court   rendered   its\n\ndecision.\"); United States v. Onyejekwe, No. 94-1772, 1995 WL\n\n397015, at *1 n.1 (1st Cir. July 6, 1995) (unpublished opinion)\n\n(\"We note that appellant's appendix includes many documents which\n\nwere not filed in the district court--including transcripts of\n\ntestimony before the grand jury--and are, thus, outside the record.\n\nThese latter documents, of course, cannot inform our decision [on\n\nthe appellant's sentencing appeal].\" (citation omitted)).            Simply\n\nput, the majority offers no compelling reason for us to disregard\n\nour consistently applied rule that we only consider evidence\n\npresented in the district court.           I see no reason to disregard it\n\nin this case.18\n\n\n     18\n      In similar cases, where a defendant has challenged the\nfactual basis of a plea and the Government has responded with\nadditional evidence, other courts have suggested that a court might\neither vacate the plea entirely or simply remand the case to the\ndistrict court for consideration of the new evidence. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Goldberg, 862 F.2d 101, 107 (6th Cir. 1988) (\"The\nsecond alternative is to remand the case to permit the government\nto supplement the record on the issue of 'active concealment' in an\nattempt to satisfy the district court of the existence of a factual\nbasis for Goldberg's plea of guilty.\"). By deferring to a district\ncourt's expertise in fact-finding, this would seem to be a more\nsensible resolution of Caraballo's objection to the supplemental\nappendix.\n\n                                     -40-\n\f                         II. Caraballo's Plea\n\n            A. Standard of Review\n\n            Before accepting a plea agreement, the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure require that a district court \"determine that\n\nthere is a factual basis for the plea.\"       Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).\n\nThus, the district court must make a finding that \"on the record as\n\nit stands at the time of the plea,\" it has \"a reasoned basis to\n\nbelieve that the defendant actually committed the crime to which he\n\nis admitting guilt.\" United States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2006).          \"The purpose of this requirement is to\n\n'protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily\n\nwith an understanding of the nature of the charge but without\n\nrealizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the\n\ncharge.'\"   United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d 55, 59-60 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting Advisory Committee Notes to the 1966 Amendment\n\nto Fed. R. Crim P. 11.).\n\n            When an appellant pleads guilty and does not move to\n\nwithdraw his plea on the basis that the district court did not\n\ncomply   with   Rule   11,   the   Supreme   Court   has    held   that   the\n\nappropriate standard of review is plain error.             United States v.\n\nVonn, 535 U.S. 55, 58-59 (2002).      Thus, Caraballo must demonstrate\n\nthat \"(1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error\n\nadversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fjudicial proceedings.\"     United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          B. Was There Plain Error?\n\n          Caraballo pled guilty to misprision of a felony in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 4, which provides:\n\n          Whoever, having knowledge of the actual\n          commission of a felony cognizable by a court\n          of the United States, conceals and does not as\n          soon as possible make known the same to some\n          judge or other person in civil or military\n          authority under the United States, shall be\n          fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n          than three years, or both.\n\n          The majority and I are in general agreement on the facts.\n\nCaraballo was offered the opportunity to help his partner, a\n\ncorrupt police officer, with \"escorting\" cocaine to a drop-point at\n\nthe Carolina Mall in Puerto Rico.          Caraballo called the DEA and\n\ntold them of the plan, but refused to give his name or the names of\n\nthose involved.19\n\n\n     19\n       The majority's version of the facts relies heavily upon the\nsupplemental appendix provided by the Government, which, as I have\nstated, cannot be considered on appeal because it was not presented\nto the district court. Thus, for example, we may not consider any\nof the evidence presented that Caraballo had actually committed the\ncrime of conspiracy, a fact which has never been proven in any\ncourt. The prosecutor's fleeting reference to \"Caraballo and his\nco-conspirators\" does not establish Caraballo's guilt, especially\nwhen one considers that the full statement made during the plea\ncolloquy was \"Specifically, when the agents asked him for\ninformation regarding the conspiracy that might identify the\nDefendant or his co-conspirators, or the conspirators in the case,\nhe declined to furnish the specific information regarding the plot\nat that time.\"\n\n     However,   to   the   extent   that   the   majority   relies   on   the\n\n                                    -42-\n\f          There is no dispute that Caraballo had knowledge of the\n\n\"actual commission\" of a felony.20    For the purposes of argument,\n\nI will assume that Caraballo did not make the felony known \"as soon\n\nas possible\" to the authorities.21    The question then is whether\n\nCaraballo \"concealed\" the felony.     The majority acknowledges the\n\nabsence of any act of concealment on Caraballo's part and instead\n\nrelies on two theories without any support in the law, which\n\n\n\n\nGovernment's supplemental appendix, I would add that not only did\nCaraballo-Rodríguez make a full report to the DEA regarding what\nhappened during the cocaine escort, but he also gave the DEA all of\nthe money he had received, a fact not mentioned by the majority.\n     20\n       The only felony whose \"actual commission\" Caraballo is\nalleged to have known was a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 21\nU.S.C. § 846.     The majority also alleges that Caraballo was a\nmember of this conspiracy. Thus, in effect, the majority suggests\nthat we are able to punish Caraballo for failing to report his own\ncrime.    Certainly, criminally punishing someone for failing to\nincriminate themselves implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. See United States v. Kuh, 541 F.2d\n672, 677 (7th Cir. 1976) (\"If the duty to notify federal\nauthorities [of criminal conduct] is precluded by constitutional\nprivilege, it is difficult to understand how a conviction [for\nmisprision] could be substantiated [when the defendant is also\ninvolved in the criminal conduct].\"). The majority suggests that\nby pleading guilty, defendants waive this privilege. However, it\nwould be a very odd crime indeed which could only be prosecuted by\nguilty plea.\n     21\n      Although I assume this fact for the sake of argument, it is\nnot entirely clear.     First, in his initial call to the DEA,\nCaraballo did in fact make the conspiracy \"known,\" although he did\nnot provide additional details. In addition, under the majority's\nversion of the facts, which are tainted by reference to the\nsupplemental appendix, Caraballo later called the Government and\ninformed them in painstaking detail about the conspiracy.       The\nGovernment makes no attempt to argue that this later report was not\nmade \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n                               -43-\n\fconstitutes an overextension of the plain error doctrine, to\n\ncircumvent the affirmative act requirement.\n\n                      1. Misprision Requires An Affirmative Act\n\n             First, the majority suggests that, in fact, 18 U.S.C. § 4\n\ncontains no requirement that a defendant commit an affirmative act\n\nof concealment.           Thus, the majority attempts to write the word\n\n\"conceals\" out of the statute and suggests that Caraballo can be\n\nconvicted solely on the basis of (1) knowledge of a felony and (2)\n\ninaction.     In effect, the majority suggests that 18 U.S.C. § 4\n\nimposes an affirmative duty on every citizen to report any crime\n\nthat is \"known\" to them.             I agree with the majority that, in\n\ngeneral, it would be beneficial to have our citizenry report\n\ncrimes.     See Roberts v. United States, 445 U.S. 552, 558 (1980)\n\n(\"[G]ross    indifference       to   the    duty   to   report   known   criminal\n\nbehavior remains a badge of irresponsible citizenship.\").\n\n             That, however, is not the law.             The misprision statute\n\nimposes no legal obligation on citizens to report crime, especially\n\nwhere     failure    to    comply    with   that   obligation    is   criminally\n\npunishable.22       Every court to have considered the issue, including\n\n\n     22\n      In fact, it is the lack of affirmative duties (including a\nduty to report crimes) that remains one of the hallmarks of the\ndistinction between common law jurisdictions (such as the United\nStates) and civil law jurisdictions (such as those in Europe).\nCompare Martin Vranken, Duty to Rescue in Civil Law and Common Law:\nLes Extrêmes Se Touchent?, 47 Int'l & Comp.

See Roberts,\n\n445 U.S. at 558 n.5 (\"[The misprision statute] has been construed\n\nto require 'both knowledge of a crime and some affirmative act of\n\nconcealment or participation.'\");23 Branzburg v.

To the extent\nthat our system of law has imposed duties to act, they have been\nimposed in order to prevent harm or peril to another.           See\ngenerally Melody J.

L. 385, 392-96 (1998)\n(discussing the role of traditionally recognized criminal-law\nduties). Furthermore, criminal liability for omissions has been\nimposed only when the defendant's omission can be said to have\ncaused the harm or peril. See Arthur Leavens, A Causation Approach\nTo Criminal Omissions, 76 Cal. L. Rev. 547, 562 (1988) (recognizing\n\"the critical underlying premise that criminal omissions can occur\nonly in 'cause-and-result' crimes, that is, crimes that proscribe\nthe causation of a particular harm\").       The misprision statute\naddresses conduct after any harm has occurred because it punishes\nconcealment only after the actual commission of a felony.\nFurthermore, misprision does not appear to incorporate any element\nof causation, thus further suggesting that any common law analysis\nof criminal omission liability is inapposite.\n        23\n      It is worth noting that this is the \"footnote omitted\" in the\nlong quote from Roberts on pages 20-21 of the majority opinion.\n\n                                          -45-\n\fthat an element of misprision is that defendant \"took steps to\n\nconceal the crime\"); United States v.

Vázquez-Alomar did\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fnot involve any challenge to or question regarding the defendant's\n\nconviction for misprision.        This naked citation appears to have\n\nbeen provided merely as background to a case dealing with a\n\ndefendant's appeal of the district court's application of unrelated\n\nsentencing guidelines.       Id. at 5-6.    It is at a minimum difficult\n\nto conclude from this brief offhand comment in a sentencing case,\n\nunaccompanied     by   any   further    explanation,     that   this   Circuit\n\nintended to split with over seventy years of pronouncements on the\n\nelements of misprision by the Supreme Court and ten other courts of\n\nappeal.\n\n            The   majority    also     suggests   that   United   States   v.\n\nCiambrone, 750 F.2d 1416 (9th Cir. 1984), is of little use to\n\nCaraballo.     In fact, in Ciambrone, the Ninth Circuit found that\n\npartial but truthful disclosure of a crime to the police was not\n\nthe required \"affirmative act\" for the purposes of the misprision\n\nstatute.     Id. at 1418.     This conclusion is logical, given that a\n\npartial and truthful disclosure provides the authorities with, at\n\nworst, no information, and at best, some helpful information.\n\nAccordingly, such disclosures cannot be considered an \"affirmative\n\nact of concealment.\"         The majority criticizes Ciambrone on two\n\ngrounds.      First, the majority notes that no other court has\n\nfollowed Ciambrone.      But a number of courts have cited Ciambrone\n\nfor the proposition that an affirmative act of concealment is\n\nrequired.     See, e.g., Cefalu, 85 F.3d at 969; United States v.\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fVásquez-Chan, 978 F.2d 546, 555 (9th Cir. 1992); Goldberg, 862 F.2d\n\nat 104-105; United States v. Weekley, 389 F. Supp. 2d 1293, 1297\n\n(D. Ala. 2005).    The majority also argues that Ciambrone departs\n\nfrom the common law position that no affirmative act is required.24\n\nThis is true, but the common law position on misprision is of\n\nlimited relevance because Congress was free to depart from the\n\ncommon law in requiring an affirmative act for the misprision\n\noffense.     There are no federal common law crimes.           Liparota v.\n\nUnited States, 471 U.S. 419, 424 (1985).          Given the unanimity of\n\ndecisions stating that misprision does require an affirmative act,\n\nit is clear that Ciambrone does represent a proper interpretation\n\nof the law.\n\n           The   majority    then   departs   even   further     from   the\n\nmisprision    statute   in   suggesting    that   the   affirmative     act\n\nrequirement may be excused because Caraballo was a police officer,\n\nand he had a duty to report crime under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25,\n\n§ 3102. As an initial matter, the majority's references to English\n\ncommon law are of questionable relevance to this analysis.          It has\n\n\n\n     24\n      On page 26 and in footnote 10 of the majority opinion, the\nmajority also suggests that \"even a truthful but partial disclosure\ncould conceal by misleading.\"     This is another example of the\nmajority stretching the definition of the statute in favor of the\nGovernment. In addition, the Government made no allegation of fact\nin the district court that Caraballo's brief phone call to the DEA\nwas misleading.    That the partial disclosure might have been\nmisleading in other circumstances seems utterly irrelevant\nconsidering that the Government in this case had full knowledge of\nthe facts.\n\n                                    -49-\n\flong been understood that \"[t]he definition of the elements of a\n\ncriminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in\n\nthe case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.\"\n\nLiparota, 471 U.S. at 424; see also United States v. Hudson &\n\nGoodwin, 11 U.S. 32, 33 (1812) (deciding that federal courts could\n\nnot \"exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases.\"). That\n\nmisprision was thought to have been an appropriate charge for\n\nderelict officers in fifteenth century England is nothing more than\n\nan interesting historical footnote, unless the majority can show\n\nthat Congress considered and adopted this history in drafting 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4.25   Modern English law decisions are of even less\n\nrelevance, as they fail to reflect the common law as it existed\n\nwhen Congress was drafting the misprision statute.      Perhaps the\n\nmajority emphasizes the history of the misprision crime in England\n\nbecause in this country, there is no support in the plain language\n\nof the statute or the case law for excusing the affirmative act\n\nrequirement for police officers.26    Even the law review note cited\n\nby the majority agrees that current law provides no such support.\n\n\n     25\n      Of course, to date, no reported decision in the history of\njurisprudence in the United States has mentioned what would appear\nto be a fairly large \"exception\" to the affirmative act\nrequirement.\n     26\n      That Caraballo was a state police officer who is being\npunished for failing to report a federal crime to federal\nauthorities may raise federalism concerns. See Printz v. United\nStates, 521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997) (finding that requiring state\nofficers to enforce a federal gun-control law violates the tenth\nAmendment).\n\n                               -50-\n\fCurenton, supra, 55 Ala. L. Rev. at 185 (\"[U]nlike its English\n\ncounterpart,     the    phrasing       'conceals    and   does   not     as   soon    as\n\npossible make known' has been uniformly construed [by American\n\ncourts]   to    require    both       active   concealment    and    a    failure     to\n\ndisclose.\").\n\n            Even if the Government's second theory were plausible, it\n\nsuffers from an additional serious defect.                The class of people in\n\nthis country with some sort of duty to report crime is quite\n\nnumerous.       See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 547 (\"[E]ach United States\n\nattorney,      within   his     district,      shall--(1)    prosecute        for    all\n\noffenses against the United States.\"); Hagood v. Sonoma County\n\nWater Agency, 81 F.3d 1465, 1480 (9th Cir. 1996) (\"[A]ll federal\n\nemployees      labor    under     a    duty    to   report   fraud       against     the\n\ngovernment.\").         Although many officers of the Government labor\n\nunder such a duty to report wrongdoing, it is clear from Supreme\n\nCourt precedent that these duties to report crime are not absolute.\n\nWith respect to police officers, there is a \"deep-rooted nature of\n\nlaw-enforcement discretion, even in the presence of seemingly\n\nmandatory legislative commands.\"               Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzáles,\n\n545 U.S. 748, 760-61 (2005).            In fact, in Town of Castle Rock, the\n\nCourt explicitly stated that duty-to-report statutes (such as P.R.\n\nLaws. Ann. tit. 25, § 3102) \"clearly do not mean that a police\n\nofficer may not lawfully decline to make an arrest.\"                     Id. (quoting\n\n1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 1-4.5, commentary, at 1-124 to\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f1-125 (2d ed. 1980)).27         Given that Caraballo could have \"lawfully\n\ndecline[d] to make an arrest\" in this case, I have some difficulty\n\nwith the proposition expounded by the majority, based on irrelevant\n\nEnglish common law, that under the facts of this case he incurred\n\nfederal criminal liability under the misprision statute.\n\n                       2. Accepting Caraballo's Plea Was Plain Error\n\n                Finding no support for either of the aforementioned\n\ntheories, the majority then resorts to the plain error standard to\n\nsustain Caraballo's conviction.            Having conceded that it might be\n\nerror     for    the   court   to   have   overlooked      the    affirmative   act\n\nrequirement, the majority suggests that it was not plain error\n\nbecause     no    decision     of   this   Circuit   has    ever    rejected    the\n\nextraordinary theory that a citizen may be convicted under federal\n\nlaw for merely failing to report a crime.                        But in accepting\n\nCaraballo's plea, it was incumbent on the district court to examine\n\n\"the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits\n\nhaving committed.\"        McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467\n\n(1969).     Not only does the misprision statute make clear that an\n\nelement of \"concealment\" is required, but two Supreme Court cases\n\nand unanimity in the case law should be sufficient to make the\n\nerror in the majority's reasoning \"plain.\"                 See United States v.\n\n\n\n     27\n      Town of Castle Rock found that a police officer's failure to\nperform his statutory duty to report and investigate crime could\nnot even give rise to civil, let alone criminal, liability. Id. at\n766.\n\n                                       -52-\n\fRodríguez-Pacheco, 475 F.3d 434 (1st Cir. 2007) (discussing the\n\nfact that the majority's reading of an ambiguous question of prior\n\nprecedent \"agrees with that of every circuit that has addressed the\n\nquestion\"); see also Colby v. J.C. Penney Co., 811 F.2d 1119, 1123\n\n(7th Cir. 1987) (\"Bearing in mind the interest in maintaining a\n\nreasonable uniformity of federal law and in sparing the Supreme\n\nCourt the burden of taking cases merely to resolve conflicts\n\nbetween circuits, we give most respectful consideration to the\n\ndecisions of the other courts of appeals and follow them whenever\n\nwe can.\").      The decisions of the Supreme Court and our sister\n\ncircuits are most certainly difficult to overlook.    That our court\n\nhas not spoken as to the issue should not foreclose a finding of\n\n\"plain error,\" especially given the \"archaic\" and \"uncommon\" nature\n\nof the crime.    Roberts, 445 U.S. at 558; Goldberg, 862 F.2d at 109.\n\nOtherwise, under the majority's approach, any theory of conviction,\n\nregardless of its support in the law, could pass plain error review\n\nso long as we have not rejected it.\n\n          The majority also suggests that we may affirm Caraballo's\n\nconviction because the district court merely chose between two\n\ncompeting interpretations of the misprision statute.     Although we\n\nhave held that a court's choice of two competing interpretations of\n\na statute will not be disturbed on a plain error standard, these\n\ncompeting interpretations have had some support in the case law.\n\nSee, e.g., Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1196-97\n\n\n                                 -53-\n\f(1st    Cir.   1995)    (finding    support    for   both   plaintiff's    and\n\ndefendant's     interpretations      of   42   U.S.C.   §   1395dd(d)(2)   in\n\ndecisions from other circuits).           Here, as the majority concedes,\n\nany interpretation of the misprision statute that does not require\n\nan affirmative act is not truly \"competing\": no court anywhere has\n\nadopted either of the Government's proposed interpretations, and in\n\nfact, every court to have considered them has rejected them.28\n\n            The majority also suggests that even if there was plain\n\nerror, it was not prejudicial.              This conclusion rests on the\n\nstatement in United States v. Domínguez Benítez that to prove\n\nprejudice, a defendant must \"show a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for the error, he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\"\n\n542 U.S. 74, 83 (2004).      We have applied this standard before where\n\na defendant has argued that there was no factual basis to support\n\nhis guilty plea.       See United States v. Delgado-Hernández, 420 F.3d\n\n16, 20 (1st Cir. 2005).            Likewise, the majority suggests that\n\nCaraballo's conviction did not \"adversely impact[] the fairness,\n\n\n\n       28\n      Moreover, if Caraballo had taken the time to pore over all\nof the court decisions on this question, he would have found no\nindication whatsoever that his failure to report the conspiracy was\ncriminally punishable. \"Obviously, citizens should not be subject\nto punishment without fair notice that their conduct is prohibited\nby law.\" United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U.S. 505,\n525 (1992). There is no reason to think that this requirement is\nsomehow less valid when a defendant pleads guilty to a crime. By\ndodging the question of whether failure to report a felony\nconstitutes   misprision,   the   majority    creates   substantial\nuncertainty as to whether such omissions may be punished in the\nfuture.\n\n                                     -54-\n\fintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                     Riggs,\n\n287 F.3d at 224.\n\n              It is hard for me to see how Caraballo would not be\n\nprejudiced, or the public reputation of judicial proceedings would\n\nnot be adversely impacted if we affirm his conviction without any\n\nfactual basis to support it.          First, it is important to point out\n\nthat in Delgado-Hernández, we decided that the Defendant was not\n\nprejudiced by his guilty plea because it was supported by an\n\nadequate factual basis.             Id. at 32.        We found, based on the\n\nevidence placed on the record before the district court, that if\n\nthe Government had made a proper factual proffer, it could have\n\nestablished a factual basis for the defendant's plea.                      Id. at 29;\n\nsee also United States v. Sawyer, 239 F.3d 31, 50 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"To   justify    Sawyer's     guilty    plea,      it    was    enough     that    the\n\ngovernment pointed to evidence, or proffered facts, that would\n\nfurnish a rational basis for the plea.\") (Boudin, J., concurring).\n\nThe    same   cannot   be    said    here,    where      accepting    all     of    the\n\nGovernment's     factual     allegations      as    true,    there    is    still    no\n\nevidence to establish an affirmative act of concealment.\n\n              Furthermore,    the     entire       purpose      of   the    Rule     11\n\nrequirement that a district court find a factual basis for a plea\n\nis to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading\n\nvoluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but\n\nwithout realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within\n\n\n                                       -55-\n\fthe charge.\"   McCarthy, 394 U.S. at 467 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11, advisory committee's note).   To put it another way, we do not\n\nallow a defendant to plead guilty without making some sort of\n\ndetermination, however cursory, that the defendant's conduct is\n\ncriminally punishable.    As the record stands, even assuming the\n\ncomplete truth of the Government's allegations, Caraballo plainly\n\ndid not commit the crime of misprision because he did not commit an\n\naffirmative act of concealment. Nevertheless, he was allowed to be\n\nconvicted.   Thus, there is before us the conviction of a man who is\n\nplainly not guilty of the crime for which he was charged.         A\n\nmiscarriage of justice more prejudicial would be difficult to\n\nfind.29\n\n          The Chief Judge's concurrence improves on the majority\n\nopinion by not giving much credence to either of the Government's\n\nproposed theories.   But the concurrence still gets it wrong.   When\n\na defendant challenges a plea accepted by the district court, we\n\n\n\n     29\n      Many courts have stated that the government's failure to\nprove each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt at trial\nis both prejudicial and a miscarriage of justice.        See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Groves, 470 F.3d 311, 327-328 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(\"[A]llowing a conviction to stand without proof of an essential\nelement of the crime meets the standard for plain error . . . .\");\nUnited States v. Gaydos, 108 F.3d 505, 509 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"We\nbelieve that affirming a conviction where the government has failed\nto prove each essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt 'affects substantial rights,' and seriously impugns 'the\nfairness,   integrity    and   public   reputation    of   judicial\nproceedings.'\"). Here, the Government cannot even meet the minimal\nburden of showing that Caraballo committed a crime taking as true\nall of the facts that the Government alleged.\n\n                                -56-\n\fgrant the Government the extraordinary indulgence of not requiring\n\nthat they provide any evidence to support the plea.                    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Fountain, 777 F.2d 351, 355 (7th Cir. 1985) (\"A\n\nsufficient factual basis can be found even when the court engages\n\nin    the   most   rudimentary    questioning     of    the   defendant   if   the\n\nindictment     and    statement    of    the    prosecution's       evidence   are\n\nsufficiently specific to make clear to the defendant exactly what\n\nis being admitted to.\").          We will allow a plea to rest on the\n\nGovernment's allegations alone, so long as they were presented to\n\nthe    district     court.   Sawyer,      239    F.3d    at   50    (Boudin,   J.,\n\nconcurring).       This supports the policy of discouraging defendants\n\nfrom seeking to withdraw their pleas by later claiming, \"I didn't\n\ndo it.\"\n\n             However, the law does not allow us to affirm a plea\n\nsimply because the Government states \"the defendant committed a\n\ncrime.\" Rather, we must determine that the defendant's conduct, as\n\nalleged by the Government, constitutes a crime.               See United States\n\nv. Negrón-Nárvaez, 403 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"At its most\n\nabecedarian level, the requirement that a guilty plea must be\n\nsupported by an adequate factual basis ensures that the conduct to\n\nwhich the defendant admits constitutes the crime with which he is\n\ncharged.\").        Not \"maybe a crime,\" not \"possibly a crime,\" but a\n\ncrime as codified in the United States Code.                       The misprision\n\nstatute, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 4, requires \"concealment.\"                    Any\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\freasonable reading of this statute suggests that an affirmative act\n\nis required, as has been confirmed by years of unanimous precedent.\n\nThe majority and concurring opinions raise the question of whether\n\nwe should decide that a defendant can be convicted because he might\n\nhave committed a crime that we might define differently in the\n\nfuture.     In a system of justice that requires that defendants be\n\nprovided with notice of prohibited conduct, the answer is a clear\n\n\"No.\"\n\n            Finally, I think it is important to address the majority\n\nopinion's    concluding    statements.        The     majority    assuages   its\n\nconcerns about the result by stating that Caraballo \"participated\n\nin a major drug conspiracy,\" and that other officers in the\n\nconspiracy received lengthy terms of imprisonment.                     Thus, the\n\nmajority contends, Caraballo benefitted from his plea agreement and\n\nis now looking a gift-horse in the mouth.                It has long been my\n\nunderstanding that defendants are entitled to the presumption of\n\ninnocence until proven guilty.         Caraballo's indictment alone does\n\nnot establish that he is guilty of the crimes charged.                 Perhaps he\n\ndid, as the majority contends, plead guilty to avoid prison time on\n\nmore serious charges.       Perhaps the Government had an interest in\n\noffering Caraballo a plea, as the concurrence suggests, because the\n\nGovernment    had   concerns   about    its     own    ability    to    obtain   a\n\nconviction    in    the   conspiracy    case.         Perhaps    Caraballo   was\n\nerroneously told that misprision charge against him was airtight\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\fbecause it required no showing of an affirmative act.         We may never\n\nknow why Caraballo pled guilty to the misprision charge, but it is\n\nultimately irrelevant.    Our country is a nation of laws, and we do\n\nnot countenance the conviction of a defendant for a crime he did\n\nnot commit simply because we suspect that he was bad or may have\n\ncommitted other crimes.   A defendant must engage in the proscribed\n\ncharged conduct to be found guilty of a crime, whether by plea or\n\nby   trial.   Because   Caraballo   did   not   engage   in   the   conduct\n\nproscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 4, I would reverse his conviction.\n\nAccordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                -59-\n\f",

This is a daunting task, and Caraballo does not accomplish it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution's allegations were that Caraballo committed misprision by concealing and failing to report an underlying drug crime in which he was involved (1) when he gave accurate information in an anonymous tip to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) about the crime, but refused to provide additional requested information, and (2) when he refused to provide additional information despite his duty as a Puerto Rico police officer to disclose crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo makes a serious argument that this court should adopt an interpretation of the misprision statute, as many circuits have done, which requires that there be an affirmative act of concealment, and hold that the facts in this case cannot sustain such a conviction. We do not rule on that question because even if there were error, it is not plain, and Caraballo has not shown either that his substantial rights were affected or that entry of this plea undermined the integrity of the proceedings or constituted a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a sting investigation in 2000-2001 named \"Honor Perdido\" or \"Lost Honor,\" the FBI uncovered, and then the United States successfully prosecuted, a number of corrupt Puerto Rican police officers who assisted in the transportation and protection of illegal drugs in exchange for money. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 71-72 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States</i> v. <i>V&#225;zquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 494 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d 170, 172-73 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the officers netted was Caraballo. He was indicted and arrested in August 2001 in Cr. No. 01-613 for providing armed protection for a successful drug transport of more than five kilograms of cocaine. A second superseding indictment named sixteen defendants in total, charging Caraballo and others with (1) conspiracy to knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846; (2) attempt to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846; and (3) aiding and abetting in knowingly carrying firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i). There was also a forfeiture count against all sixteen defendants under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second superseding indictment charged that the conspirators \"use[d] their official positions as law enforcement officers and . . . use[d] official government vehicles in order to ensure that no law enforcement agency or competing drug organizations would attempt to stop the vehicle in which the cocaine was concealed and seize the same.\" It also alleged that the defendants \"possess[ed] and carr[ied] firearms in order to protect the shipments of multiple kilogram[s] of purported cocaine.\" If convicted on the drug conspiracy or attempt charge, Caraballo faced a statutory minimum of ten years of imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A), 846. Defendant faced at least an additional five years if convicted of the firearms charge. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Caraballo agreed to help protect a drug transport, he took some unusual steps. He first partially tipped the DEA to the existence of the drug conspiracy. He then personally participated in the conspiracy. And he later met with the DEA to offer information and confess. Specifically, on May 24, the day before he assisted with the transfer of some ten kilograms of what was purported to be cocaine, he placed an anonymous call to the DEA. Caraballo indicated that he had information about police officers involved in drug trafficking, and stated that he had been approached by a female officer about participating in a drug smuggling operation. On questioning from DEA agents, he refused to give information that might identify himself or his co-conspirators, or to furnish specific information about the plot. He withheld information he knew about the drug transport that might have enabled the federal agents to interrupt the conspiracy. In truth, since this was a sting operation, the DEA had no desire to interrupt the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Close to two weeks after participating in the May 25 drug transport, on June 8, Caraballo contacted the DEA again, indicating that he wanted to provide information about police corruption and drug trafficking. Later that day, Caraballo met with two federal agents and described the transport of drugs that took place two weeks earlier. Caraballo provided names of co-conspirators, admitted his own participation in the drug transport, and stated that he received $4,000 for his efforts. Caraballo agreed to cooperate with the FBI. The record does not establish whether he made full disclosure. It is clear that his later disclosure to authorities was not made as soon as possible after he had knowledge of the crime. Despite his cooperation in June, Caraballo was still indicted in August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After he was charged, Caraballo, represented by counsel, negotiated a plea agreement with the prosecution. He received a number of benefits. The government agreed to a new charge, brought under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, of misprision of felony, to which Caraballo agreed to waive indictment and plead guilty. This was a considerably less significant charge than the drug conspiracy, attempt, and firearms charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another benefit to Caraballo as well. For the limited purpose of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that Caraballo would be held accountable for having knowledge of, and concealing, the underlying felony of conspiracy to distribute at least 400 grams but less than 500 grams of cocaine. Under the earlier drug conspiracy indictment, Caraballo had been charged with being accountable for more than five kilograms of cocaine, not a mere 400 to 500 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And there were other benefits to Caraballo. The parties also agreed that they would jointly recommend a sentence of imprisonment equivalent to the time Caraballo spent in pre-trial detention. Upon imposition of sentence, the United States agreed to move to dismiss the charges pending against defendant in Cr. No. 01-613. The agreement, signed on December 4, 2002 by Caraballo, who was represented by counsel, acknowledged that \"he is pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because he is in fact guilty [of the crime of misprision].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misprision information, filed in Cr. No. 02-463 on the same day that defendant signed the plea agreement, alleged that Caraballo had knowledge of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine but \"did conceal the same by withholding information and the identities of conspirators in communications with federal law enforcement agents, and did not as soon as possible make known the conspiracy to some . . . authority.\" On the misprision charge, Caraballo's maximum term of imprisonment was three years, his maximum fine was $250,000, and the maximum term of supervised release was one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement contained a signed stipulation of facts, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In November 2000, Arturo Ortiz-Colon, a former police officer cooperating with government investigators, told DIANA DIAZ-CRISPIN, then a police officer of the Puerto Rico Police Department, that a Colombian drug trafficker referred to as \"El Viejo\" sought to hire police officers to escort and protect multiple kilogram shipments of cocaine. DIANA DIAZ-CRISPIN agreed to escort and protect the cocaine shipments, and additionally agreed to recruit other police officers to escort shipments of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Although a police officer, OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ did not timely report the conspiracy to distribute cocaine to other police officers. Although OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ spoke with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to the transport of the purported cocaine, he did so anonymously and withheld information that might have enabled the federal agents to interrupt the conspiracy. More specifically, when agents asked OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ for information regarding the conspiracy, OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ at that time declined to identify the conspirators or to furnish specific information regarding their plot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

We directed counsel to brief the issue of whether there was a factual basis for Caraballo's plea as to each element of the offense charged under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, and in particular whether a failure to make full disclosure constitutes an act of concealment under the misprision statute. We directed counsel's attention to <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cefalu,</i> 85 F.3d 964 (2d Cir.1996); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Warters,</i> 885 F.2d 1266, 1274 (5th Cir.1989); and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ciambrone,</i> 750 F.2d 1416, 1418 (9th Cir.1985). On the further submission of an <i>Anders</i> brief, we permitted Caraballo's counsel to withdraw and appointed new counsel, who has briefed this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essence of Caraballo's claim is that he pled guilty to activities which do not constitute the crime of misprision and so his plea must be vacated. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 546 F.2d 1225, 1227 (5th Cir.1977) (reversing conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 by guilty plea on preserved claim where factual basis for plea showed mere failure to report a felony and court held this did not constitute misprision). He also characterizes the district court as having affirmatively misstated an element of the offense at the plea colloquy in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir.2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 requires a court to determine that there is a factual basis for a plea before entering judgment.

There was certainly a factual basis for the plea on the government's theory. The question is rather whether the government's theory, which was explained to Caraballo at the plea colloquy, permissibly stated an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo failed to call the district court's attention to the alleged lack of a factual basis for the plea, or to present to the district court the legal arguments now asserted.

We hold that Caraballo has not met his burden of showing there was an error which was plain, for several basic reasons. In doing so, we do not make any ruling on the merits of the issues discussed under the misprision statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, while this court and the Supreme Court may someday adopt the majority rule in the circuits that an affirmative act is required for a misprision offense, there is now no binding precedent to that effect. Caraballo does not argue otherwise. None of our misprision cases has adopted Caraballo's proposed rule. Further, in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vazquez-Alomar,</i> 342 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2003), we suggested that a federal prisoner had violated 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 when he did not inform federal authorities that he had engaged in telephone conversations with others about crimes. Consequently, there can be no plain error. Thus, we need not resolve the greyer areas of what constitutes an affirmative act. Secondly, we cannot say there is plain error because the government articulates a new theory, not accepted, but not rejected by any court, based on Caraballo's obligations as a police officer. The theory has some support at English common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's argument that there was plain error is not proven by the language of the statute itself. Misprision of felony is defined at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying felony in this case was the drug conspiracy charged in Cr. No. 01-613. At issue is whether the facts alleged satisfy the statutory terms \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make known.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dictionary definitions of \"conceal\" and \"concealment\" do not prove Caraballo's claim. The Oxford English Dictionary refers to both a common usage of keeping secret of any information and a legal usage of intentional suppression of truth. 3 <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> 647 (2d ed.1989). Black's Law Dictionary defines the primary meaning of \"concealment\" as \"[t]he act of refraining from disclosure[, especially] an act by which one prevents or hinders the discovery of something.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 306 (8th ed.2004). Neither source compels only one reading of the term \"conceals\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the common law background of the statute compel Caraballo's reading. The statute at issue derives from a common law offense. Misprision of felony was a crime under English common law, dating back centuries. <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Dir. Pub. Prosecutions,</i> [1962] A.C. 528, 555 (H.L.) (U.K.) (stating that misprision of felony \"has been an offence for the last 700 years or more,\" though not always under that name); C.W. Mullis, Comment, <i>Misprision of Felony: A Reappraisal,</i> 23 Emory L.J. 1095, 1095 (1974) (noting that \"[t]he offense of failing to report a felony was first labeled `misprision' by Sir William Staun[]ford in 1557\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, in 1790, enacted a federal misprision statute which is essentially the same as 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 today. <i>See</i> Act of Apr. 30, 1790, &#167; 6, 1 Stat. 113. There are some differences, however, between the English common law doctrine and how the federal statute has been interpreted in the United States. <i>See</i> C.M. Curenton, Comment, <i>The Past, Present, and Future of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4: An Exploration of the Federal Misprision of Felony Statute,</i> 55 Ala. L.Rev. 183, 183-84, 186 (2003); Mullis, <i>supra,</i> at 1098-99, 1101-04.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At English common law, \"[e]ver since the days of hue and cry, it [was] the duty of a man, who kn[ew] that a felony ha[d] been committed, to report it to the proper authority so that steps [could] be taken to apprehend the felon and bring him to justice.\" <i>Sykes,</i> [1962] A.C. at 555. Accordingly, Staunford in 1557 defined misprision as follows: \"Misprision . . . is properly when anyone learns or knows that another has committed treason or felony, and he does not choose to denounce him to the King or to his Council, or to any magistrate, but conceals his offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 557. In light of this history, Lord Denning of the House of Lords pronounced that a person accused of misprision of felony \"need not have done anything active: but it is his duty by law to disclose to proper authority all material facts known to him relative to the offence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 563. Lord Guest, for his part, observed that he could not find in the \"numerous institutional writers who have defined [misprision of felony] . . . any statement that active steps of concealment are required to constitute the offence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has the Supreme Court adopted Caraballo's reading. The Court, in <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 445 U.S. 552, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> discussed the obligations of citizens not to conceal crimes, first as a matter of common law and then as defined and enforced through 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4. As <i>Roberts</i> stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concealment of crime has been condemned throughout our history. The citizen's duty to \"raise the `hue and cry' and report felonies to the authorities,\" <i>Branzburg</i> v. <i>Hayes,</i> 408 U.S. 665, 696, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972), was an established tenet of Anglo-Saxon law at least as early as the 13th century. 2 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 101-102 (3d ed.1927); 4 <i>id.,</i> at 521-522; see Statute of Westminster First, 3 Edw. 1, ch. 9, p. 43 (1275); Statute of Westminster Second, 13 Edw. 1, chs. 1, 4, and 6, pp. 112-115 (1285). The first Congress of the United States exacted a statute imposing criminal penalties upon anyone who, \"having knowledge of the actual commission of [certain felonies,] shall conceal, and not as soon as may be disclose and make known the same to [the appropriate] authority. . . .\" Act of Apr. 30, 1790, &#167; 6, 1 Stat. 113. Although the term \"misprision of felony\" now has an archaic ring, gross indifference to the duty to report known criminal behavior remains a badge of irresponsible citizenship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">445 U.S. at 557-58, 100 S.Ct. 1358 (alterations in original) (footnote omitted). <i>Roberts</i> made explicit that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 can be applied where, as here, the witness to the crime is a participant himself in the underlying criminal activities, subject to Fifth Amendment concerns<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deeply rooted social obligation is not diminished when the witness to crime is involved in illicit activities himself. Unless his silence is protected by the privilege against self-incrimination . . ., the criminal defendant no less than any other citizen is obliged to assist the authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 558, 100 S.Ct. 1358. Putting constitutional concerns aside momentarily, the statutory text applies to \"whoever\" meets its criteria, and does not necessarily exclude participants in crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, in Caraballo's favor is the fact that neither the common law crime nor the statute was meant to punish in every instance every person who knows of a crime but does not report it. In 1822, Chief Justice Marshall noted, \"It may be the duty of a citizen to accuse every offender, and to proclaim every offense which comes to his knowledge; but the law which would punish him in every case for not performing this duty is too harsh for man.\" <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Brooks,</i> 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 556, 575-76, 5 L.Ed. 522 (1822). Further, it is clear that misprision of felony cannot be read so broadly as to \"make a criminal of anyone who, as the victim of a crime or faced with a criminal threat, resisted a . . . suggestion that the police be called.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rakes,</i> 136 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1998). The scope of the obligations imposed by the statute is an important issue in today's society where police investigations are often hampered by codes of silence and fearful refusal by witnesses to cooperate. Those issues are beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Caraballo's argument turns on judicial construction of the statute; since we have not yet adopted the construction he urges, there is no plain error. However, we do not foreclose later adoption of such a construction. Caraballo particularly stresses the fact that many courts have interpreted the \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make known\" language as requiring an <i>affirmative</i> act of concealment. <i>See, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d 101, 104 (6th Cir.1988); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Davila,</i> 698 F.2d 715, 717 (5th Cir.1983); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sampol,</i> 636 F.2d 621, 653 (D.C.Cir.1980); <i>Daddano,</i> 432 F.2d at 1124; <i>Lancey</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 356 F.2d 407, 410 (9th Cir.1966); <i>Neal</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 102 F.2d 643, 646 (8th Cir. 1939); <i>Bratton</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 73 F.2d 795, 797-98 (10th Cir.1934) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Farrar,</i> 38 F.2d 515, 517 (D.Mass.), <i>aff'd on different grounds,</i> 281 U.S. 624, 50 S.Ct. 425, 74 L.Ed. 1078 (1930)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether it is a proper construction of the statute to require an affirmative act of concealment has been questioned. Mullis, <i>supra,</i> at 1104 (\"The possibility that such a requirement was originally intended by Congress is rather slim, since, by the date of the statute's first enactment [in 1790], such a requirement had never before been applied to the crime. It is much more reasonable to conclude that Congress intended `conceal and' to signify a conscious and intentional non-disclosure.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo argues that, in any of his capacities, he did not conceal the drug conspiracy. Rather, he disclosed it, and his refusal to provide the additional requested information cannot be punished as an act of concealment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Caraballo relies on a series of cases holding that mere silence does not qualify as an act of concealment. <i>See Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d at 105-06; <i>Johnson,</i> 546 F.2d at 1227; <i>Lancey,</i> 356 F.2d at 410; <i>Neal,</i> 102 F.2d at 650; <i>Bratton,</i> 73 F.2d at 798. But mere silence cases do not necessarily help him. Caraballo did not remain merely silent. He affirmatively sought out federal agents to make partial disclosure, but then declined to provide requested information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo places special emphasis on <i>Ciambrone,</i> a Ninth Circuit case. <i>Ciambrone</i> is not a mere silence case, but a partial disclosure case. The defendant in <i>Ciambrone</i> truthfully, but only partially, disclosed his knowledge about a counterfeiting operation to a Secret Service agent. 750 F.2d at 1417. The court held that partial disclosure could not constitute misprision because if some information were offered, there could be no greater concealment of the felony than if the defendant who had knowledge of the crime had said nothing. <i>Id.</i> at 1418. <i>Ciambrone</i> required an affirmative act and implicitly held that the act of coming forward to provide information, but refusing to answer other questions, does not qualify as an affirmative act of concealment. None of the other cases cited by Caraballo adopts <i>Ciambrone's</i> position with respect to partial disclosures. Indeed, no federal court has followed <i>Ciambrone</i> in holding that a truthful, but partial, disclosure is insufficient to support a misprision conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Ciambrone</i> logic, then, departs from the common law position that there is a general duty on citizens to disclose, and instead relies on a more limited rationale for the statute that misprision is concerned only with situations in which the government may be put in a worse situation or misled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo admits that courts have sustained the application of the misprision statute in cases where someone with knowledge of a felony provided <i>untruthful</i> information. <i>See Sampol,</i> 636 F.2d at 656; <i>cf. United States</i> v. <i>Salinas,</i> 956 F.2d 80, 81 (5th Cir.1992). He distinguishes these cases on the facts here, on the basis that it is not alleged that he provided false information to federal agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be instances in which even partial truthful disclosures can be misleading. <i>Ciambrone</i> assumes that the government may not be misled by receipt of truthful information, even if it is incomplete, 750 F.2d at 1418, but that is not necessarily so. For example, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sessions,</i> Nos. 00-1756, 00-1791, 2000 WL 1456903 (8th Cir. Oct.2, 2000) (unpublished decision), held that the misprision statute was satisfied where the defendant \"gave incomplete information to police regarding his knowledge of the [crime],\" at least where he \"gave the police partial information that was misleading.\" <i>Id.</i> at *1, 2000 WL 1456903. If the statute is geared toward avoiding the misleading of police, <i>Ciambrone,</i> 750 F.2d at 1418, it is still possible, in concept and in fact, that even a truthful but partial disclosure could conceal by misleading the government through the withholding of key information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot tell from the facts here whether the giving of partial information in this case in any way could have misled the DEA&#8212; information against Caraballo alleged only that he withheld information and the identities of co-conspirators, and did not as soon as possible make the conspiracy known to the appropriate authorities. On plain error review, even under a modified <i>Ciambrone</i> approach, it is defendant's burden to show that his truthful but partial disclosure was not misleading, and Caraballo has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, as a second theory,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> that even if there is a requirement for an affirmative misrepresentation from an ordinary citizen, Caraballo had higher duties as a police officer. This appears to present a novel interpretation of the statute. The prosecution's theory derives from the obligations on police officers to disclose information about crimes, irrespective of whether civilians would have had such a duty. Caraballo was, at the time, a police officer who had an affirmative duty to act on information about a crime under Puerto Rican law. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102 (duty of the \"Puerto Rico Police\" is to \"prevent, discover, investigate and persecute crime and, within the scope of its authority, enforce obedience of the laws\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution argues that government officials, particularly police, who are already under an affirmative duty to report crimes, inherently conceal when they do not meet their duty to disclose. We have found no misprision cases discussing this theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the argument, in light of the theory of law under the misprision statute to which Caraballo pled guilty, cannot be said to be plainly erroneous. <i>Roberts</i> itself referred to \"gross indifference to the duty to report\" and thought pertinent the development of this duty in Anglo-Saxon law. Indeed, there is some historical support in common law misprision doctrine for imposing special responsibilities on public officials. In 1628, Lord Coke in his Third Institute noted that \"the concealment of felonies in sheriffs, or bailiffs of liberties is more severely punished than in others.\" <i>Sykes,</i> [1962] A.C. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted). Professor Glazebrook, although arguing for a broader view of what constituted misprision under English common law, has recognized that the term \"misprision\" in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was thought \"to have been . . . especially appropriate to the misconduct of public officers.\" P.R. Glazebrook, <i>Misprision of Felony&#8212;Shadow or Phantom?,</i> 8 Am. J. Legal Hist. 189, 191, 194 (1964). As another commentator has noted, \"In fact, a strong case can be made that misprision should have particular applicability to public officers. Even at common law, commission of misprision appears to have been especially culpable for public officers, since they received a higher penalty for the crime than that received by ordinary citizens.\" Mullis, <i>supra,</i> at 1113 (citing W. Blackstone, 4 <i>Commentaries</i> 121). Because the theory is novel under the statute, it has neither been accepted nor rejected. The burden is on defendant to show that if there was any error, that error was plain. <i>Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This background buttresses our conclusion that if there was any error, it was not plain error. We stress that we do not, and need not, rule on the merits of issues pertaining to the judicial construction of the statute. The analysis could end here, but we comment briefly on the remaining prongs of the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Other Elements of Plain Error Test</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the third prong, we must ask, as Caraballo has framed the issue of the voluntariness of the plea,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged error, Caraballo would have decided not to plead guilty. <i>See Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333. We do so by looking at the entire record, and not just at what was directly before the district court during the plea hearing. <i>Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d at 28-32. In this case, the plea was entirely voluntary, and defendant was fairly apprised of both the law and the facts. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (holding defendant to guilty plea on plain error standard of review). Caraballo chose to plead guilty as part of an extremely favorable plea deal he and his counsel worked out with the government. He also chose to cooperate, and he admitted to participation in the drug conspiracy, for which he received a benefit. At his plea colloquy, Caraballo agreed with the prosecutor's statement that he was a \"conspirator,\" an obvious reference to the drug conspiracy. Caraballo's deal was thus specifically structured to find a significantly less serious offense to which he could plead, and one which would permit him to avoid any imprisonment beyond the time already served. As Caraballo's own counsel stated at sentencing: \"Initially [Caraballo] was tempted by the . . . economic gain that pervades the drug traffic, and he wavered. . . . But he took certain steps afterwards . . . and [the prosecutor] was wise enough and interested enough in justice that he reviewed that, and we came up with [this plea bargain].\" Thus, even if the district court had erred in its understanding of misprision law, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant would have been willing to risk trial on the conspiracy charges in the absence of the error. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Matos-Qui&#241;ones,</i> 456 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.2006). Caraballo's substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the fourth prong, we ask whether the plea arrangement calls into question the integrity of the judicial process. This case does not present the sort of miscarriage of justice for which plain error is reserved. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Savinon-Acosta,</i> 232 F.3d 265, 269 (1st Cir.2000). Caraballo, who participated in a major drug conspiracy, had his cooperation generously rewarded. He was sentenced to <i>time served</i> of less than sixteen months. If convicted of the original drug conspiracy or attempt charge involving more than five kilograms of cocaine, he faced a minimum sentence of \"not . . . less than 10 years\" under 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A) and 846. If convicted of the original firearms charge, he faced an additional five years of imprisonment or more under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A)(i). Other officers who were convicted in this same conspiracy received lengthy terms of imprisonment on the order of twenty years. <i>S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> 424 F.3d at 73; <i>Villafane-Jimenez,</i> 410 F.3d at 78; <i>V&#225;zquez-Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d at 495; <i>Flecha-Maldonado,</i> 373 F.3d at 174. Whether or not the lesser charge of misprision constituted, on these facts, a viable theory of criminal liability, Caraballo, who was advised by counsel, not surprisingly agreed to plead guilty to that theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the prosecutor cited Cr.

The notes contain admissions from Caraballo that he participated in the conspiracy. Since he already agreed with the prosecutor's recitation of facts at the plea colloquy, it is unclear what the motion to strike on appeal is intended to accomplish</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo wrongly argues that the papers are outside of the record because they appeared first in the record of the underlying drug case, Cr. No. 01-613. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(a)(1), the record consists of \"the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court.\" But the interview notes were also on file in this misprision case. The notes independently appear in the file for this case, stapled to Caraballo's plea agreement, and thus they appear to have been filed in Cr. No. 02-463 under docket number 3. Indeed, that docket entry is described by the district court as \"Plea Agreement with government's version of the facts attached.\" The record in this case as transmitted by the district court on appeal did in fact contain the documents, contrary to the dissent. Further, Caraballo himself submitted these same interview notes to this court in a pro se brief he filed in this case.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Even if the notes had not been filed in Cr. No. 02-463, the notes were clearly filed in the related proceeding, Cr. No. 01-613, and both cases proceeded before the same district judge. That means that the district judge who accepted Caraballo's guilty plea and sentenced him had these interview notes in the case files. The cases are so intertwined that the sentencing transcript in Cr. No. 02-463 contains the government's formal dismissal of all charges in Cr. No. 01-613. Accordingly, even if the interview notes had only been filed in Cr. No. 01-613, we would deem them as within the scope of Rule 10. <i>Cf. United States</i> v. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d 263, 267-68 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that sentencing court may rely on information derived from a co-defendant's trial before the same judge).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court has now supplemented the record and certified that the interview notes are part of the record on this appeal. The clerk of the district court certified that the transmitted documents \"constitute the supplemental record on appeal in the case,\" clearly referring to Cr. No. 02-463.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's other ground for striking the appendix is that the interview notes are not admissible under the rules of evidence. But there is no requirement, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10, that a document must be admissible in evidence to be part of the record on appeal.

The reasons for this rule are not trivial. The district court is better suited for reviewing evidence and making findings of fact. <i>See Salve Regina College</i> v. <i>Russell,</i> 499 U.S. 225, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991) (noting that \"the respective institutional advantages of\" a trial court include \"the unchallenged superiority of the district court's factfinding ability\"). Because of these institutional advantages, we accord deference to trial court rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence, <i>see, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2002), and credibility, <i>see, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Marshall,</i> 348 F.3d 281, 284 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, we require that all evidence first be placed before a district court because an appellate court's chief competence is not evidentiary review. This is especially true here, where Caraballo raises a number of challenges to the admissibility and credibility of the material the Government seeks to introduce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the fact that the judge was the same in both criminal cases, or that the dockets are \"intertwined\" has no effect on this conclusion; we generally do not allow parties in one case to sift through the dockets of other cases to come up with evidence to support their conclusions on appeal. The majority, in reaching its conclusion, cites two cases for the proposition that judges may reach across case lines and disregard evidentiary rules in the sentencing context: <i>United States</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 426 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he district court may consider all the evidence, even if inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, provided that the information has `sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.'\") and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d 263, 267-68 (1st Cir.1992) (approving use of transcripts from codefendant's trial at sentencing hearing). These cases are unpersuasive for the simple fact that they address sentencing. Caraballo is not challenging his sentence; he is challenging his conviction, and we have not yet disregarded evidentiary rules when reviewing a conviction. In any case, regardless of whether the supplemental appendix is being used to sustain a conviction or a sentence, it was not presented to the district court in Caraballo's misprision case, and as such, we may not consider it. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Muriel-Cruz,</i> 412 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Absent extraordinary circumstances, not present here, we consult only the record extant at the time the district court rendered its decision.\"); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Onyejekwe,</i> No. 94-1772, 1995 WL 397015, at *1 n. 1 (1st Cir.

These latter documents, of course, cannot inform our decision [on the appellant's sentencing appeal].\" (citation omitted)). Simply put, the majority offers no compelling reason for us to disregard our consistently applied rule that we only consider evidence presented in the district court.

Caraballo was offered the opportunity to help his partner, a corrupt police officer, with \"escorting\" cocaine to a drop-point at the Carolina Mall in Puerto Rico. Caraballo called the DEA and told them of the plan, but refused to give his name or the names of those involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that Caraballo had knowledge of the \"actual commission\" of a felony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> For the purposes of argument, I will assume that Caraballo did not make the felony known \"as soon as possible\" to the authorities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> The question then is whether Caraballo \"concealed\" the felony. The majority acknowledges the absence of any act of concealment on Caraballo's part and instead relies on two theories without any support in the law, which constitutes an overextension of the plain error doctrine, to circumvent the affirmative act requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Misprision Requires An Affirmative Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the majority suggests that, in fact, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 contains no requirement that a defendant commit an affirmative act of concealment. Thus, the majority attempts to write the word \"conceals\" out of the statute and suggests that Caraballo can be convicted solely on the basis of (1) knowledge of a felony and (2) inaction. In effect, the majority suggests that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 imposes an affirmative duty on every citizen to report any crime that is \"known\" to them. I agree with the majority that, in general, it would be beneficial to have our citizenry report crimes. <i>See Roberts v. United States,</i> 445 U.S. 552, 558, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980) (\"[G]ross indifference to the duty to report known criminal behavior remains a badge of irresponsible citizenship.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That, however, is not the law. The misprision statute imposes no legal obligation on citizens to report crime, especially where failure to comply with that obligation is criminally punishable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>Every court</i> to have considered the issue, including the Supreme Court, has reached the same conclusion. <i>See Roberts,</i> 445 U.S. at 558 n. 5, 100 S.Ct. 1358 (\"[The misprision statute] has been construed to require `both knowledge of a crime and some affirmative act of concealment or participation.'\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> <i>Branzburg v.

Gebbie,</i> 294 F.3d 540, 544 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that an element of misprision is that defendant \"took steps to conceal the crime\"); <i>United States v.

Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d 101, 104 (6th Cir. 1988) (\"[Misprision requires that] the defendant took affirmative steps to conceal the crime of the principal. Mere knowledge of the commission of the felony or failure to report the felony, standing alone, is insufficient to support a conviction for a misprision of a felony.\"); <i>United States v. Andrews,</i> 790 F.2d 803, 809 (10th Cir.1986) (\"the accused took an affirmative step to conceal the crime\"); <i>United States v. Sampol,</i> 636 F.2d 621, 653 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\"wilful concealment from the authorities by some affirmative act\"); <i>United States v. Kuh,</i> 541 F.2d 672, 676 (7th Cir.1976) (\"[Misprision] consists of an act of concealment in addition to failure to disclose, so that the statute did not purport to punish one solely for failure to report facts which he has reasonable fear might lead to his conviction of crime.\"). Legal commentators, including those cited by the majority, have been equally unanimous in their understanding that the misprision statute, as it currently stands, \"has been uniformly construed to require both active concealment and a failure to disclose.\" Christopher Mark Curenton, Comment, <i>The Past, Present, and Future of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4: An Exploration of the Federal Misprision of Felony Statute,</i> 55 Ala. L.Rev. 183, 185 (2003)(\"In order for a conviction to be sustained, there must be a concealment&#8212; not merely an omission or failure to report criminal activity.\"); <i>see also</i> Carl Wilson Mullis, III, Comment, <i>Misprision of Felony: A Reappraisal,</i> 23 Emory L.J. 1095, 1103 (1974) (\"<i>Bratton [v. United States,</i> 73 F.2d 795 (10th Cir.1934)] firmly established the necessity of a positive act of concealment for violation of the federal misprision statute.\"). The result is that it is fairly plain from the statute that the language \"conceals and\" requires an affirmative act:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language is \"conceals and does not as soon as may be disclose.\" [sic] Some meaning must be given to the words \"conceal and.\" If it should be held that a failure to disclose is in itself a concealment, then a conviction may be had for a failure to disclose without more, and the words \"conceal and\" are thus effectively excised from the statute. Following settled rules of construction, we must assume that Congress intended something by the use of the words \"conceal and.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bratton,</i> 73 F.2d at 797.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the majority cites <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Alomar,</i> 342 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2003), as providing support for the lack of an affirmative act requirement. I disagree with their reading. <i>V&#225;zquez-Alomar</i> simply stated that the defendant \"did not inform the authorities of these conversations, as federal law requires. [18 U.S.C.] &#167; 4.\" 342 F.3d at 2. <i>V&#225;zquez-Alomar</i> did not involve any challenge to or question regarding the defendant's conviction for misprision. This naked citation appears to have been provided merely as background to a case dealing with a defendant's appeal of the district court's application of unrelated sentencing guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. It is at a minimum difficult to conclude from this brief offhand comment in a sentencing case, unaccompanied by any further explanation, that this Circuit intended to split with over seventy years of pronouncements on the elements of misprision by the Supreme Court and ten other courts of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that <i>United States v. Ciambrone,</i> 750 F.2d 1416 (9th Cir.1984), is of little use to Caraballo. In fact, in <i>Ciambrone,</i> the Ninth Circuit found that partial but truthful disclosure of a crime to the police was <i>not</i> the required \"affirmative act\" for the purposes of the misprision statute. <i>Id.</i> at 1418. This conclusion is logical, given that a partial and truthful disclosure provides the authorities with, at worst, no information, and at best, some helpful information. Accordingly, such disclosures cannot be considered an \"affirmative act of concealment.\" The majority criticizes <i>Ciambrone</i> on two grounds. First, the majority notes that no other court has followed <i>Ciambrone.</i> But a number of courts have cited <i>Ciambrone</i> for the proposition that an affirmative act of concealment is required. <i>See, e.g., Cefalu,</i> 85 F.3d at 969; <i>United States v. V&#225;squez-Chan,</i> 978 F.2d 546, 555 (9th Cir. 1992); <i>Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d at 104-105; <i>United States v. Weekley,</i> 389 F.Supp.2d 1293, 1297 (D.Ala.2005). The majority also argues that <i>Ciambrone</i> departs from the common law position that no affirmative act is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> This is true, but the common law position on misprision is of limited relevance because Congress was free to depart from the common law in requiring an affirmative act for the misprision offense. There are no federal common law crimes. <i>Liparota v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 419, 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985). Given the unanimity of decisions stating that misprision does require an affirmative act, it is clear that <i>Ciambrone</i> does represent a proper interpretation of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority then departs even further from the misprision statute in suggesting that the affirmative act requirement may be excused because Caraballo was a police officer, and he had a duty to report crime under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102. As an initial matter, the majority's references to English common law are of questionable relevance to this analysis. It has long been understood that \"[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.\" <i>Liparota,</i> 471 U.S. at 424, 105 S.Ct. 2084; <i>see also United States v. Hudson &amp; Goodwin,</i> 7 Cranch 32, 11 U.S. 32, 33, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812) (deciding that federal courts could not \"exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases.\"). That misprision was thought to have been an appropriate charge for derelict officers in fifteenth century England is nothing more than an interesting historical footnote, unless the majority can show that Congress considered and adopted this history in drafting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Modern English law decisions are of even less relevance, as they fail to reflect the common law as it existed when Congress was drafting the misprision statute. Perhaps the majority emphasizes the history of the misprision crime in England because <i>in this country,</i> there is no support in the plain language of the statute or the case law for excusing the affirmative act requirement for police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Even the law review note cited by the majority agrees that current law provides no such support. Curenton, <i>supra,</i> 55 Ala. L.Rev. at 185 (\"[U]nlike its English counterpart, the phrasing `conceals and does not as soon as possible make known' has been uniformly construed [by American courts] to require both active concealment and a failure to disclose.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Government's second theory were plausible, it suffers from an additional serious defect. The class of people in this country with some sort of duty to report crime is quite numerous. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 547 (\"[E]ach United States attorney, within his district, shall&#8212;(1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States.\"); <i>Hagood v. Sonoma County Water Agency,</i> 81 F.3d 1465, 1480 (9th Cir.1996) (\"[A]ll federal employees labor under a duty to report fraud against the government.\"). Although many officers of the Government labor under such a duty to report wrongdoing, it is clear from Supreme Court precedent that these duties to report crime are not absolute. With respect to police officers, there is a \"deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, even in the presence of seemingly mandatory legislative commands.\" <i>Town of Castle Rock v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 545 U.S. 748, 760-61, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005). In fact, in <i>Town of Castle Rock,</i> the Court explicitly stated that duty-to-report statutes (such as P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102) \"clearly do not mean that a police officer may not lawfully decline to make an arrest.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 1-4.5, commentary, at 1-124 to 1-125 (2d ed.1980)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Given that Caraballo could have \"lawfully decline[d] to make an arrest\" in this case, I have some difficulty with the proposition expounded by the majority, based on irrelevant <i>English</i> common law, that under the facts of this case he incurred federal criminal liability under the misprision statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Accepting Caraballo's Plea Was Plain Error</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no support for either of the aforementioned theories, the majority then resorts to the plain error standard to sustain Caraballo's conviction. Having conceded that it might be error for the court to have overlooked the affirmative act requirement, the majority suggests that it was not plain error because no decision of this Circuit has ever rejected the extraordinary theory that a citizen may be convicted under federal law for merely failing to report a crime. But in accepting Caraballo's plea, it was incumbent on the district court to examine \"the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed.\" <i>McCarthy v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). Not only does the misprision statute make clear that an element of \"concealment\" is required, but two Supreme Court cases and unanimity in the case law should be sufficient to make the error in the majority's reasoning \"plain.\" <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Pacheco,</i> 475 F.3d 434 (1st Cir. 2007) (discussing the fact that the majority's reading of an ambiguous question of prior precedent \"agrees with that of every circuit that has addressed the question\"); <i>see also Colby v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 811 F.2d 1119, 1123 (7th Cir.1987) (\"Bearing in mind the interest in maintaining a reasonable uniformity of federal law and in sparing the Supreme Court the burden of taking cases merely to resolve conflicts between circuits, we give most respectful consideration to the decisions of the other courts of appeals and follow them whenever we can.\"). The decisions of the Supreme Court and our sister circuits are most certainly difficult to overlook. That our court has not spoken as to the issue should not foreclose a finding of \"plain error,\" especially given the \"archaic\" and \"uncommon\" nature of the crime. <i>Roberts,</i> 445 U.S. at 558, 100 S.Ct. 1358; <i>Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d at 109. Otherwise, under the majority's approach, any theory of conviction, regardless of its support in the law, could pass plain error review so long as we have not rejected it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that we may affirm Caraballo's conviction because the district court merely chose between two competing interpretations of the misprision statute. Although we have held that a court's choice of two competing interpretations of a statute will not be disturbed on a plain error standard, these competing interpretations have had some support in the case law. <i>See, e.g., Correa v. Hospital San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1995) (finding support for both plaintiff's and defendant's interpretations of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(d)(2) in decisions from other circuits). Here, as the majority concedes, any interpretation of the misprision statute that does not require an affirmative act is not truly \"competing\": no court anywhere has adopted either of the Government's proposed interpretations, and in fact, every court to have considered them has rejected them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that even if there was plain error, it was not prejudicial. This conclusion rests on the statement in <i>United States v. Dom&#237;nguez Ben&#237;tez</i> that to prove prejudice, a defendant must \"show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\" 542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). We have applied this standard before where a defendant has argued that there was no factual basis to support his guilty plea. <i>See United States v. Delgado-Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 420 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.2005). Likewise, the majority suggests that Caraballo's conviction did not \"adversely impact[] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d at 224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard for me to see how Caraballo would not be prejudiced, or the public reputation of judicial proceedings would not be adversely impacted if we affirm his conviction without any factual basis to support it. First, it is important to point out that in <i>Delgado-Hern&#225;ndez,</i> we decided that the Defendant was not prejudiced by his guilty plea because it was supported by an adequate factual basis. <i>Id.</i> at 32. We found, based on the evidence placed on the record before the district court, that if the Government had made a proper factual proffer, it could have established a factual basis for the defendant's plea. <i>Id.</i> at 29; <i>see also United States v. Sawyer,</i> 239 F.3d 31, 50 (1st Cir.2001) (\"To justify Sawyer's guilty plea, it was enough that the government pointed to evidence, or proffered facts, that would furnish a rational basis for the plea.\") (Boudin, J., concurring). The same cannot be said here, where accepting all of the Government's factual allegations as true, there is still no evidence to establish an affirmative act of concealment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the entire purpose of the Rule 11 requirement that a district court find a factual basis for a plea is to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\" <i>McCarthy,</i> 394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166 (quoting Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, advisory committee's note). To put it another way, we do not allow a defendant to plead guilty without making some sort of determination, however cursory, that the defendant's conduct is criminally punishable. As the record stands, even assuming the complete truth of the Government's allegations, Caraballo plainly did not commit the crime of misprision because he did not commit an affirmative act of concealment. Nevertheless, he was allowed to be convicted. Thus, there is before us the conviction of a man who is plainly not guilty of the crime for which he was charged. A miscarriage of justice more prejudicial would be difficult to find.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chief Judge's concurrence improves on the majority opinion by not giving much credence to either of the Government's proposed theories. But the concurrence still gets it wrong. When a defendant challenges a plea accepted by the district court, we grant the Government the extraordinary indulgence of not requiring that they provide any evidence to support the plea. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fountain,</i> 777 F.2d 351, 355 (7th Cir.1985) (\"A sufficient factual basis can be found even when the court engages in the most rudimentary questioning of the defendant if the indictment and statement of the prosecution's evidence are sufficiently specific to make clear to the defendant exactly what is being admitted to.\"). We will allow a plea to rest on the Government's allegations alone, so long as they were presented to the district court. <i>Sawyer,</i> 239 F.3d at 50 (Boudin, J., concurring). This supports the policy of discouraging defendants from seeking to withdraw their pleas by later claiming, \"I didn't do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the law does not allow us to affirm a plea simply because the Government states \"the defendant committed a crime.\" Rather, we must determine that the defendant's conduct, as alleged by the Government, constitutes a crime. <i>See United States v. Negr&#243;n-N&#225;rvaez,</i> 403 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (\"At its most abecedarian level, the requirement that a guilty plea must be supported by an adequate factual basis ensures that the conduct to which the defendant admits constitutes the crime with which he is charged.\"). Not \"maybe a crime,\" not \"possibly a crime,\" but a crime as codified in the United States Code. The misprision statute, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, requires \"concealment.\" Any reasonable reading of this statute suggests that an affirmative act is required, as has been confirmed by years of unanimous precedent. The majority and concurring opinions raise the question of whether we should decide that a defendant can be convicted because he might have committed a crime that we might define differently in the future. In a system of justice that requires that defendants be provided with notice of prohibited conduct, the answer is a clear \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I think it is important to address the majority opinion's concluding statements. The majority assuages its concerns about the result by stating that Caraballo \"participated in a major drug conspiracy,\" and that other officers in the conspiracy received lengthy terms of imprisonment. Thus, the majority contends, Caraballo benefited from his plea agreement and is now looking a gift-horse in the mouth. It has long been my understanding that defendants are entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Caraballo's indictment alone does not establish that he is guilty of the crimes charged. Perhaps he did, as the majority contends, plead guilty to avoid prison time on more serious charges. Perhaps the Government had an interest in offering Caraballo a plea, as the concurrence suggests, because the Government had concerns about its own ability to obtain a conviction in the conspiracy case. Perhaps Caraballo was erroneously told that misprision charge against him was airtight because it required no showing of an affirmative act. We may never know why Caraballo pled guilty to the misprision charge, but it is ultimately irrelevant. Our country is a nation of laws, and we do not countenance the conviction of a defendant for a crime he did not commit simply because we suspect that he was bad or may have committed other crimes. A defendant must engage in the proscribed charged conduct to be found guilty of a crime, whether by plea or by trial. Because Caraballo did not engage in the conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, I would reverse his conviction. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The district court eventually transmitted a record to this court which referred to the documents in the supplemental appendix, but this record only noted that the documents were part of the record in the conspiracy case, No. 01-613, rather than the misprision case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> It is worth noting that although I agree with the majority that a document need not be admissible in evidence to be part of the record on appeal, it would need to be admissible for a district judge to consider it, and we would rule it error for the district judge to have relied on inadmissible evidence in coming to its conclusion<i>See Orta-Castro</i> v. <i>Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Qu&#237;mica P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 105, 114 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In similar cases, where a defendant has challenged the factual basis of a plea and the Government has responded with additional evidence, other courts have suggested that a court might either vacate the plea entirely or simply remand the case to the district court for consideration of the new evidence<i>See, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d 101, 107 (6th Cir.1988) (\"The second alternative is to remand the case to permit the government to supplement the record on the issue of `active concealment' in an attempt to satisfy the district court of the existence of a factual basis for Goldberg's plea of guilty.\"). By deferring to a district court's expertise in factfinding, this would seem to be a more sensible resolution of Caraballo's objection to the supplemental appendix.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The majority's version of the facts relies heavily upon the supplemental appendix provided by the Government, which, as I have stated, cannot be considered on appeal because it was not presented to the district court. Thus, for example, we may not consider any of the evidence presented that Caraballo had actually committed the crime of conspiracy, a fact which has never been proven in any court. The prosecutor's fleeting reference to \"Caraballo and his co-conspirators\" does not establish Caraballo's guilt, especially when one considers that the full statement made during the plea colloquy was \"Specifically, when the agents asked him for information regarding the conspiracy that might identify the Defendant or his co-conspirators,<i>or the conspirators in the case,</i> he declined to furnish the specific information regarding the plot at that time.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, to the extent that the majority relies on the Government's supplemental appendix, I would add that not only did Caraballo-Rodr&#237;guez make a full report to the DEA regarding what happened during the cocaine escort, <i>but he also gave the DEA all of the money he had received,</i> a fact not mentioned by the majority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The only felony whose \"actual commission\" Caraballo is alleged to have known was a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The majority also alleges that Caraballo was a member of this conspiracy. Thus, in effect, the majority suggests that we are able to punish Caraballo for failing to report his own crime. Certainly, criminally punishing someone for failing to incriminate themselves implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination<i>See United States v. Kuh,</i> 541 F.2d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 1976) (\"If the duty to notify federal authorities [of criminal conduct] is precluded by constitutional privilege, it is difficult to understand how a conviction [for misprision] could be substantiated [when the defendant is also involved in the criminal conduct].\"). The majority suggests that by pleading guilty, defendants waive this privilege. However, it would be a very odd crime indeed which could only be prosecuted by guilty plea.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Although I assume this fact for the sake of argument, it is not entirely clear. First, in his initial call to the DEA, Caraballo did in fact make<i>the conspiracy</i> \"known,\" although he did not provide additional details. In addition, under the majority's version of the facts, which are tainted by reference to the supplemental appendix, Caraballo later called the Government and informed them in painstaking detail about the conspiracy. The Government makes no attempt to argue that this later report was not made \"as soon as possible.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> In fact, it is the lack of affirmative duties (including a duty to report crimes) that remains one of the hallmarks of the distinction between common law jurisdictions (such as the United States) and civil law jurisdictions (such as those in Europe)<i>Compare</i> Martin Vranken, <i>Duty to Rescue in Civil Law and Common Law: Les Extr&#234;mes Se Touchent?,</i> 47 Int'l &amp; Comp.

L.J. 605, 606 (2001) (discussing the common law maxim that \"positive legal duties threaten the common law's traditional deference to individual liberty\"). To the extent that our system of law has imposed duties to act, they have been imposed in order to prevent harm or peril to another. <i>See generally</i> Melody J. Stewart, <i>How Making the Failure to Assist Illegal Fails to Assist: An Observation of Expanding Criminal Omission Liability,</i> 25 Am. J.Crim. L. 385, 392-96 (1998) (discussing the role of traditionally recognized criminal-law duties). Furthermore, criminal liability for omissions has been imposed only when the defendant's omission can be said to have caused the harm or peril. <i>See</i> Arthur Leavens, <i>A Causation Approach To Criminal Omissions,</i> 76 Cal. L.Rev. 547, 562 (1988) (recognizing \"the critical underlying premise that criminal omissions can occur only in `cause-and-result' crimes, that is, crimes that proscribe the causation of a particular harm\"). The misprision statute addresses conduct <i>after</i> any harm has occurred because it punishes concealment only after the actual commission of a felony. Furthermore, misprision does not appear to incorporate any element of causation, thus further suggesting that any common law analysis of criminal omission liability is inapposite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> It is worth noting that this is the \"footnote omitted\" in the long quote from<i>Roberts</i> on page 72 of the majority opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> On page 74 and in footnote 10 of the majority opinion, the majority also suggests that \"even a truthful but partial disclosure could conceal by misleading.\" This is another example of the majority stretching the definition of the statute in favor of the Government. In addition, the Government made no allegation of fact in the district court that Caraballo's brief phone call to the DEA was misleading. That the partial disclosure might have been misleading in other circumstances seems utterly irrelevant considering that the Government in this case had full knowledge of the facts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Of course, to date, no reported decision in the history of jurisprudence in the<i>United States</i> has mentioned what would appear to be a fairly large \"exception\" to the affirmative act requirement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> That Caraballo was a<i>state</i> police officer who is being punished for failing to report a <i>federal</i> crime to <i>federal</i> authorities may raise federalism concerns. <i>See Printz v. United States,</i> 521 U.S. 898, 922, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914 (1997) (finding that requiring state officers to enforce a federal gun-control law violates the tenth Amendment).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> <i>Town of Castle Rock</i> found that a police officer's failure to perform his statutory duty to report and investigate crime could not even give rise to civil, let alone criminal, liability. <i>Id.</i> at 766, 125 S.Ct. 2796.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> Moreover, if Caraballo had taken the time to pore over all of the court decisions on this question, he would have found no indication whatsoever that his failure to report the conspiracy was criminally punishable. \"Obviously, citizens should not be subject to punishment without fair notice that their conduct is prohibited by law.\"<i>United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Co.,</i> 504 U.S. 505, 525, 112 S.Ct. 2102, 119 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992). There is no reason to think that this requirement is somehow less valid when a defendant pleads guilty to a crime. By dodging the question of whether failure to report a felony constitutes misprision, the majority creates substantial uncertainty as to whether such omissions may be punished in the future.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> Many courts have stated that the government's failure to prove each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt at trial is both prejudicial and a miscarriage of justice<i>See, e.g., United States v.

The plea was entered as part of a plea bargain under which much more serious drug conspiracy charges were dismissed. In order to withdraw his plea, Caraballo must, as he admits, meet the plain error standard of showing that, on the facts charged, no crime of misprision could be stated, that this error was plain at the time, that his substantial rights were affected (including that he would otherwise not have entered the plea agreement), <i>and</i> that the error implicated the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

He first partially tipped the DEA to the existence of the drug conspiracy. He then personally participated in the conspiracy. And he later met with the DEA to offer information and confess. Specifically, on May 24, the day before he assisted with the transfer of some ten kilograms of what was purported to be cocaine, he placed an anonymous call to the DEA. Caraballo indicated that he had information about police officers involved in drug trafficking, and stated that he had been approached by a female officer about participating in a drug smuggling operation. On questioning from DEA agents, he refused to give information that might identify himself or his co-conspirators, or to furnish specific information about the plot. He withheld information he knew about the drug transport that might have enabled the federal agents to interrupt the conspiracy. In truth, since this was a sting operation, the DEA had no desire to interrupt the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Close to two weeks after participating in the May 25 drug transport, on June 8, Caraballo contacted the DEA again, indicating that he wanted to provide information about police corruption and drug trafficking. Later that day, Caraballo met with two federal agents and described the transport of drugs that took place two weeks earlier. Caraballo provided names of co-conspirators, admitted his own participation in the drug transport, and stated that he received $4,000 for his efforts. Caraballo agreed to cooperate with the FBI. The record does not establish whether he made full disclosure. It is clear that his later disclosure to authorities was not made as soon as possible after he had knowledge of the crime. Despite his cooperation in June, Caraballo was still indicted in August.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After he was charged, Caraballo, represented by counsel, negotiated a plea agreement with the prosecution. He received a number of benefits. The government agreed to a new charge, brought under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, of misprision of felony, to which Caraballo agreed to waive indictment and plead guilty. This was a considerably less significant charge than the drug conspiracy, attempt, and firearms charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another benefit to Caraballo as well. For the limited purpose of the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that Caraballo would be held accountable for having knowledge of, and concealing, the underlying felony of conspiracy to distribute at least 400 grams but less than 500 grams of cocaine. Under the earlier drug conspiracy indictment, Caraballo had been charged with being accountable for more than five kilograms of cocaine, not a mere 400 to 500 grams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And there were other benefits to Caraballo. The parties also agreed that they would jointly recommend a sentence of imprisonment equivalent to the time Caraballo spent in pre-trial detention. Upon imposition of sentence, the United States agreed to move to dismiss the charges pending against defendant in Cr. No. 01-613. The agreement, signed on December 4, 2002 by Caraballo, who was represented by counsel, acknowledged that \"he is pleading guilty freely and voluntarily because he is in fact guilty [of the crime of misprision].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misprision information, filed in Cr. No. 02-463 on the same day that defendant signed the plea agreement, alleged that Caraballo had knowledge of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine but \"did conceal the same by withholding information and the identities of conspirators in communications with federal law enforcement agents, and did not as soon as possible make known the conspiracy to some . . . authority.\" On the misprision charge, Caraballo's maximum term of imprisonment was three years, his maximum fine was $250,000, and the maximum term of supervised release was one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement contained a signed stipulation of facts, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Although OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ spoke with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to the transport of the purported cocaine, he did so anonymously and withheld information that might have enabled the federal agents to interrupt the conspiracy. More specifically, when agents asked OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ for information regarding the conspiracy, OSVALDO CARABALLO-RODRIGUEZ at that time declined to identify the conspirators or to furnish specific information regarding their plot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

He also characterizes the district court as having affirmatively misstated an element of the offense at the plea colloquy in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Gandia-Maysonet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199077\"><a href=\"/opinion/199077/united-states-v-gandia-maysonet/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-5 (1st Cir.2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 11 requires a court to determine that there is a factual basis for a plea before entering judgment.

There was certainly a factual basis for the plea on the government's theory.

First, he had full knowledge, both before and after, of a crime. Second, he was a participant in that crime and not a mere witness. Third, although he did initially notify authorities, he did not provide authorities with his full knowledge of the drug conspiracy despite requests that he do so. Fourth, he was not a mere member of the public but was a police officer. Each of these roles factors into the analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the plain error test, we ask whether Caraballo's proposed construction&#8212;that a partial truthful disclosure cannot be an affirmative act and an affirmative act is required&#8212;is compelled by the language of the statute itself, construction of the statute in light of the common law, or <i>binding</i> judicial construction of the statute. We hold that Caraballo has not met his burden of showing there was an error which was plain, for several basic reasons. In doing so, we do not make any ruling on the merits of the issues discussed under the misprision statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, while this court and the Supreme Court may someday adopt the majority rule in the circuits that an affirmative act is required for a misprision offense, there is now no binding precedent to that effect. Caraballo does not argue otherwise. None of our misprision cases has adopted Caraballo's proposed rule. Further, in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Vazquez-Alomar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200607\"><a href=\"/opinion/200607/united-states-v-vazquez-alomar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2003), we suggested that a federal prisoner had violated 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 when he did not inform federal authorities that he had engaged in telephone conversations with others about crimes. Consequently, there can be no plain error. Thus, we need not resolve the greyer areas of what constitutes an affirmative act. Secondly, we cannot say there is plain error because the government articulates a new theory, not accepted, but not rejected by any court, based on Caraballo's obligations as a police officer. The theory has some support at English common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's argument that there was plain error is not proven by the language of the statute itself. Misprision of felony is defined at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying felony in this case was the drug conspiracy charged in Cr. No. 01-613. At issue is whether the facts alleged satisfy the statutory terms \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make known.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dictionary definitions of \"conceal\" and \"concealment\" do not prove Caraballo's claim. The Oxford English Dictionary refers to both a common usage of keeping secret of any information and a legal usage of intentional suppression of truth. 3 <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> 647 (2d ed.1989). Black's Law Dictionary defines the primary meaning of \"concealment\" as \"[t]he act of refraining from disclosure[, especially] an act by which one prevents or hinders the discovery of something.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 306 (8th ed.2004). Neither source compels only one reading of the term \"conceals\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the common law background of the statute compel Caraballo's reading. The statute at issue derives from a common law offense. Misprision of felony was a crime under English common law, dating back centuries. <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Dir. Pub. Prosecutions,</i> [1962] A.C. 528, 555 (H.L.) (U.K.) (stating that misprision of felony \"has been an offence for the last 700 years or more,\" though not always under that name); C.W.

There are some differences, however, between the English common law doctrine and how the federal statute has been interpreted in the United States. <i>See</i> C.M.

Accordingly, Staunford in 1557 defined misprision as follows: \"Misprision . . . is properly when anyone learns or knows that another has committed treason or felony, and he does not choose to denounce him to the King or to his Council, or to any magistrate, but conceals his offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 557. In light of this history, Lord Denning of the House of Lords pronounced that a person accused of misprision of felony \"need not have done anything active: but it is his duty by law to disclose to proper authority all material facts known to him relative to the offence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 563.

Putting constitutional concerns aside momentarily, the statutory text applies to \"whoever\" meets its criteria, and does not necessarily exclude participants in crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, in Caraballo's favor is the fact that neither the common law crime nor the statute was meant to punish in every instance every person who knows of a crime but does not report it. In 1822, Chief Justice Marshall noted, \"It may be the duty of a citizen to accuse every offender, and to proclaim every offense which comes to his knowledge; but the law which would punish him in every case for not performing this duty is too harsh for man.\" <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Brooks,</i> 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 556, 575-76, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span> (1822). Further, it is clear that misprision of felony cannot be read so broadly as to \"make a criminal of anyone who, as the victim of a crime or faced with a criminal threat, resisted a . . . suggestion that the police be called.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rakes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751604\"><a href=\"/opinion/751604/united-states-v-stephen-m-rakes/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1998). The scope of the obligations imposed by the statute is an important issue in today's society where police investigations are often hampered by codes of silence and fearful refusal by witnesses to cooperate. Those issues are beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Caraballo's argument turns on judicial construction of the statute; since we have not yet adopted the construction he urges, there is no plain error. However, we do not foreclose later adoption of such a construction. Caraballo particularly stresses the fact that many courts have interpreted the \"conceals and does not as soon as possible make known\" language as requiring an <i>affirmative</i> act of concealment. <i>See, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Goldberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514819\"><a href=\"/opinion/514819/united-states-v-marvin-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 104 (6th Cir.1988); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Davila,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413409\"><a href=\"/opinion/413409/united-states-v-jose-campos-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">698</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 717 (5th Cir.1983); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sampol,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384944\"><a href=\"/opinion/384944/united-states-v-guillermo-novo-sampol-united-states-of-america-v-alvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 653 (D.C.Cir.1980); <i>Daddano,</i> 432 F.2d at 1124; <i>Lancey</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270643\"><a href=\"/opinion/270643/david-edward-lancey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 410 (9th Cir.1966); <i>Neal</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1474649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1474649/neal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, 646 (8th Cir. 1939); <i>Bratton</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1547110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1547110/bratton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span>, 797-98 (10th Cir.1934) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Farrar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1546636\"><a href=\"/opinion/1546636/united-states-v-farrar/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 517 (D.Mass.), <i>aff'd on different grounds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101597\"><a href=\"/opinion/101597/united-states-v-farrar/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Mullis, <i>supra,</i> at 1104 (\"The possibility that such a requirement was originally intended by Congress is rather slim, since, by the date of the statute's first enactment [in 1790], such a requirement had never before been applied to the crime. It is much more reasonable to conclude that Congress intended `conceal and' to signify a conscious and intentional non-disclosure.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo argues that, in any of his capacities, he did not conceal the drug conspiracy. Rather, he disclosed it, and his refusal to provide the additional requested information cannot be punished as an act of concealment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Caraballo relies on a series of cases holding that mere silence does not qualify as an act of concealment. <i>See Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d at 105-06; <i>Johnson,</i> 546 F.2d at 1227; <i>Lancey,</i> 356 F.2d at 410; <i>Neal,</i> 102 F.2d at 650; <i>Bratton,</i> 73 F.2d at 798. But mere silence cases do not necessarily help him. Caraballo did not remain merely silent. He affirmatively sought out federal agents to make partial disclosure, but then declined to provide requested information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo places special emphasis on <i>Ciambrone,</i> a Ninth Circuit case. <i>Ciambrone</i> is not a mere silence case, but a partial disclosure case. The defendant in <i>Ciambrone</i> truthfully, but only partially, disclosed his knowledge about a counterfeiting operation to a Secret Service agent. 750 F.2d at 1417. The court held that partial disclosure could not constitute misprision because if some information were offered, there could be no greater concealment of the felony than if the defendant who had knowledge of the crime had said nothing. <i>Id.</i> at 1418. <i>Ciambrone</i> required an affirmative act and implicitly held that the act of coming forward to provide information, but refusing to answer other questions, does not qualify as an affirmative act of concealment. None of the other cases cited by Caraballo adopts <i>Ciambrone's</i> position with respect to partial disclosures. Indeed, no federal court has followed <i>Ciambrone</i> in holding that a truthful, but partial, disclosure is insufficient to support a misprision conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Ciambrone</i> logic, then, departs from the common law position that there is a general duty on citizens to disclose, and instead relies on a more limited rationale for the statute that misprision is concerned only with situations in which the government may be put in a worse situation or misled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo admits that courts have sustained the application of the misprision statute in cases where someone with knowledge of a felony provided <i>untruthful</i> information. <i>See Sampol,</i> 636 F.2d at 656; <i>cf. United States</i> v. <i>Salinas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577214\"><a href=\"/opinion/577214/united-states-v-leonel-salinas-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 81 (5th Cir.1992). He distinguishes these cases on the facts here, on the basis that it is not alleged that he provided false information to federal agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There may be instances in which even partial truthful disclosures can be misleading. <i>Ciambrone</i> assumes that the government may not be misled by receipt of truthful information, even if it is incomplete, 750 F.2d at 1418, but that is not necessarily so. For example, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sessions,</i> Nos. 00-1756, 00-1791, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1456903</span></span> (8th Cir. Oct.2, 2000) (unpublished decision), held that the misprision statute was satisfied where the defendant \"gave incomplete information to police regarding his knowledge of the [crime],\" at least where he \"gave the police partial information that was misleading.\" <i>Id.</i> at *1, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1456903</span></span>. If the statute is geared toward avoiding the misleading of police, <i>Ciambrone,</i> 750 F.2d at 1418, it is still possible, in concept and in fact, that even a truthful but partial disclosure could conceal by misleading the government through the withholding of key information.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot tell from the facts here whether the giving of partial information in this case in any way could have misled the DEA&#8212; information against Caraballo alleged only that he withheld information and the identities of co-conspirators, and did not as soon as possible make the conspiracy known to the appropriate authorities. On plain error review, even under a modified <i>Ciambrone</i> approach, it is defendant's burden to show that his truthful but partial disclosure was not misleading, and Caraballo has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, as a second theory,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> that even if there is a requirement for an affirmative misrepresentation from an ordinary citizen, Caraballo had higher duties as a police officer. This appears to present a novel interpretation of the statute. The prosecution's theory derives from the obligations on police officers to disclose information about crimes, irrespective of whether civilians would have had such a duty. Caraballo was, at the time, a police officer who had an affirmative duty to act on information about a crime under Puerto Rican law. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102 (duty of the \"Puerto Rico Police\" is to \"prevent, discover, investigate and persecute crime and, within the scope of its authority, enforce obedience of the laws\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution argues that government officials, particularly police, who are already under an affirmative duty to report crimes, inherently conceal when they do not meet their duty to disclose. We have found no misprision cases discussing this theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the argument, in light of the theory of law under the misprision statute to which Caraballo pled guilty, cannot be said to be plainly erroneous. <i>Roberts</i> itself referred to \"gross indifference to the duty to report\" and thought pertinent the development of this duty in Anglo-Saxon law. Indeed, there is some historical support in common law misprision doctrine for imposing special responsibilities on public officials. In 1628, Lord Coke in his Third Institute noted that \"the concealment of felonies in sheriffs, or bailiffs of liberties is more severely punished than in others.\" <i>Sykes,</i> [1962] A.C. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted). Professor Glazebrook, although arguing for a broader view of what constituted misprision under English common law, has recognized that the term \"misprision\" in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was thought \"to have been . . . especially appropriate to the misconduct of public officers.\" P.R. Glazebrook, <i>Misprision of Felony&#8212;Shadow or Phantom?,</i> 8 Am. J. Legal Hist. 189, 191, 194 (1964). As another commentator has noted, \"In fact, a strong case can be made that misprision should have particular applicability to public officers. Even at common law, commission of misprision appears to have been especially culpable for public officers, since they received a higher penalty for the crime than that received by ordinary citizens.\" Mullis, <i>supra,</i> at 1113 (citing W. Blackstone, 4 <i>Commentaries</i> 121). Because the theory is novel under the statute, it has neither been accepted nor rejected. The burden is on defendant to show that if there was any error, that error was plain. <i>Ramirez-Benitez,</i> 292 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This background buttresses our conclusion that if there was any error, it was not plain error. We stress that we do not, and need not, rule on the merits of issues pertaining to the judicial construction of the statute. The analysis could end here, but we comment briefly on the remaining prongs of the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Other Elements of Plain Error Test</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the third prong, we must ask, as Caraballo has framed the issue of the voluntariness of the plea,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged error, Caraballo would have decided not to plead guilty. <i>See Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 83, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>. We do so by looking at the entire record, and not just at what was directly before the district court during the plea hearing. <i>Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d at 28-32. In this case, the plea was entirely voluntary, and defendant was fairly apprised of both the law and the facts. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (holding defendant to guilty plea on plain error standard of review). Caraballo chose to plead guilty as part of an extremely favorable plea deal he and his counsel worked out with the government. He also chose to cooperate, and he admitted to participation in the drug conspiracy, for which he received a benefit. At his plea colloquy, Caraballo agreed with the prosecutor's statement that he was a \"conspirator,\" an obvious reference to the drug conspiracy. Caraballo's deal was thus specifically structured to find a significantly less serious offense to which he could plead, and one which would permit him to avoid any imprisonment beyond the time already served. As Caraballo's own counsel stated at sentencing: \"Initially [Caraballo] was tempted by the . . . economic gain that pervades the drug traffic, and he wavered. . . . But he took certain steps afterwards . . . and [the prosecutor] was wise enough and interested enough in justice that he reviewed that, and we came up with [this plea bargain].\" Thus, even if the district court had erred in its understanding of misprision law, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant would have been willing to risk trial on the conspiracy charges in the absence of the error. <i>See United States</i> v. <i>Matos-Qui&#241;ones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202332\"><a href=\"/opinion/202332/united-states-v-matos-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2006). Caraballo's substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the fourth prong, we ask whether the plea arrangement calls into question the integrity of the judicial process. This case does not present the sort of miscarriage of justice for which plain error is reserved. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Savinon-Acosta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199154\"><a href=\"/opinion/199154/united-states-v-savinon-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 269 (1st Cir.2000). Caraballo, who participated in a major drug conspiracy, had his cooperation generously rewarded. He was sentenced to <i>time served</i> of less than sixteen months. If convicted of the original drug conspiracy or attempt charge involving more than five kilograms of cocaine, he faced a minimum sentence of \"not . . . less than 10 years\" under 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A) and 846.

The notes contain admissions from Caraballo that he participated in the conspiracy. Since he already agreed with the prosecutor's recitation of facts at the plea colloquy, it is unclear what the motion to strike on appeal is intended to accomplish</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo wrongly argues that the papers are outside of the record because they appeared first in the record of the underlying drug case, Cr. No. 01-613. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(a)(1), the record consists of \"the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court.\" But the interview notes were also on file in this misprision case. The notes independently appear in the file for this case, stapled to Caraballo's plea agreement, and thus they appear to have been filed in Cr. No. 02-463 under docket number 3. Indeed, that docket entry is described by the district court as \"Plea Agreement with government's version of the facts attached.\" The record in this case as transmitted by the district court on appeal did in fact contain the documents, contrary to the dissent. Further, Caraballo himself submitted these same interview notes to this court in a pro se brief he filed in this case.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Even if the notes had not been filed in Cr. No. 02-463, the notes were clearly filed in the related proceeding, Cr. No. 01-613, and both cases proceeded before the same district judge. That means that the district judge who accepted Caraballo's guilty plea and sentenced him had these interview notes in the case files. The cases are so intertwined that the sentencing transcript in Cr. No. 02-463 contains the government's formal dismissal of all charges in Cr. No. 01-613. Accordingly, even if the interview notes had only been filed in Cr. No. 01-613, we would deem them as within the scope of Rule 10. <i>Cf. United States</i> v. <i>Canada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580702\"><a href=\"/opinion/580702/united-states-v-barney-canada-aka-byron-levon-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 267-68 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that sentencing court may rely on information derived from a co-defendant's trial before the same judge).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court has now supplemented the record and certified that the interview notes are part of the record on this appeal. The clerk of the district court certified that the transmitted documents \"constitute the supplemental record on appeal in the case,\" clearly referring to Cr. No. 02-463.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Caraballo's other ground for striking the appendix is that the interview notes are not admissible under the rules of evidence. But there is no requirement, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10, that a document must be admissible in evidence to be part of the record on appeal. Nor is a sentencing court bound by the rules of evidence. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201860\"><a href=\"/opinion/201860/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Counsel was required to consult with his client on whether Caraballo wished to pursue an appeal which, if successful, might lead to the government's reinstituting the conspiracy, attempt, firearms, and criminal forfeiture charges against Caraballo.

That same day, Caraballo contacted the DEA and told them about the conspiracy, but refused to give his name or those of the other participants in the conspiracy. Caraballo was then convicted, by guilty plea, of misprision of a felony, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4. Because partial but truthful disclosure of one's knowledge of a criminal activity is insufficient to sustain a conviction for misprision, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>The Supplemental Appendix</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before I reach the substance of Caraballo's appeal, I must first address the issue of the Government's \"supplemental appendix.\" This \"supplemental appendix\" contains information not from Caraballo's conviction, but from another case initially brought against Caraballo but later dismissed. The Government urges us to consider this information in deciding this case. Our rules of procedure are clear. Fed. R.App. P. 10 states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Composition of the Record on Appeal.

The reasons for this rule are not trivial. The district court is better suited for reviewing evidence and making findings of fact. <i>See Salve Regina College</i> v. <i>Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112564\"><a href=\"/opinion/112564/salve-regina-college-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 233, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112564\"><a href=\"/opinion/112564/salve-regina-college-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span> (1991) (noting that \"the respective institutional advantages of\" a trial court include \"the unchallenged superiority of the district court's factfinding ability\"). Because of these institutional advantages, we accord deference to trial court rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence, <i>see, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199997\"><a href=\"/opinion/199997/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 99 (1st Cir. 2002), and credibility, <i>see, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200712\"><a href=\"/opinion/200712/united-states-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 284 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, we require that all evidence first be placed before a district court because an appellate court's chief competence is not evidentiary review. This is especially true here, where Caraballo raises a number of challenges to the admissibility and credibility of the material the Government seeks to introduce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the fact that the judge was the same in both criminal cases, or that the dockets are \"intertwined\" has no effect on this conclusion; we generally do not allow parties in one case to sift through the dockets of other cases to come up with evidence to support their conclusions on appeal. The majority, in reaching its conclusion, cites two cases for the proposition that judges may reach across case lines and disregard evidentiary rules in the sentencing context: <i>United States</i> v. <i>Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201860\"><a href=\"/opinion/201860/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he district court may consider all the evidence, even if inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, provided that the information has `sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.'\") and <i>United States</i> v. <i>Canada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580702\"><a href=\"/opinion/580702/united-states-v-barney-canada-aka-byron-levon-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 267-68 (1st Cir.1992) (approving use of transcripts from codefendant's trial at sentencing hearing). These cases are unpersuasive for the simple fact that they address sentencing. Caraballo is not challenging his sentence; he is challenging his conviction, and we have not yet disregarded evidentiary rules when reviewing a conviction. In any case, regardless of whether the supplemental appendix is being used to sustain a conviction or a sentence, it was not presented to the district court in Caraballo's misprision case, and as such, we may not consider it. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Muriel-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201643\"><a href=\"/opinion/201643/united-states-v-muriel-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Absent extraordinary circumstances, not present here, we consult only the record extant at the time the district court rendered its decision.\"); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Onyejekwe,</i> No. 94-1772, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">397015</span></span>, at *1 n. 1 (1st Cir.

These latter documents, of course, cannot inform our decision [on the appellant's sentencing appeal].\" (citation omitted)). Simply put, the majority offers no compelling reason for us to disregard our consistently applied rule that we only consider evidence presented in the district court.

The majority acknowledges the absence of any act of concealment on Caraballo's part and instead relies on two theories without any support in the law, which constitutes an overextension of the plain error doctrine, to circumvent the affirmative act requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Thus, the majority attempts to write the word \"conceals\" out of the statute and suggests that Caraballo can be convicted solely on the basis of (1) knowledge of a felony and (2) inaction. In effect, the majority suggests that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 imposes an affirmative duty on every citizen to report any crime that is \"known\" to them.

I disagree with their reading. <i>V&#225;zquez-Alomar</i> simply stated that the defendant \"did not inform the authorities of these conversations, as federal law requires. [18 U.S.C.] &#167; 4.\" 342 F.3d at 2. <i>V&#225;zquez-Alomar</i> did not involve any challenge to or question regarding the defendant's conviction for misprision. This naked citation appears to have been provided merely as background to a case dealing with a defendant's appeal of the district court's application of unrelated sentencing guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 5-6. It is at a minimum difficult to conclude from this brief offhand comment in a sentencing case, unaccompanied by any further explanation, that this Circuit intended to split with over seventy years of pronouncements on the elements of misprision by the Supreme Court and ten other courts of appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that <i>United States v.

In fact, in <i>Ciambrone,</i> the Ninth Circuit found that partial but truthful disclosure of a crime to the police was <i>not</i> the required \"affirmative act\" for the purposes of the misprision statute. <i>Id.</i> at 1418. This conclusion is logical, given that a partial and truthful disclosure provides the authorities with, at worst, no information, and at best, some helpful information. Accordingly, such disclosures cannot be considered an \"affirmative act of concealment.\" The majority criticizes <i>Ciambrone</i> on two grounds. First, the majority notes that no other court has followed <i>Ciambrone.</i> But a number of courts have cited <i>Ciambrone</i> for the proposition that an affirmative act of concealment is required. <i>See, e.g., Cefalu,</i> 85 F.3d at 969; <i>United States v. V&#225;squez-Chan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593380\"><a href=\"/opinion/593380/united-states-v-sylvia-vasquez-chan-united-states-of-america-v-julia/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 555 (9th Cir. 1992); <i>Goldberg,</i> 862 F.2d at 104-105; <i>United States v.

The majority also argues that <i>Ciambrone</i> departs from the common law position that no affirmative act is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> This is true, but the common law position on misprision is of limited relevance because Congress was free to depart from the common law in requiring an affirmative act for the misprision offense. There are no federal common law crimes. <i>Liparota v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1985). Given the unanimity of decisions stating that misprision does require an affirmative act, it is clear that <i>Ciambrone</i> does represent a proper interpretation of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority then departs even further from the misprision statute in suggesting that the affirmative act requirement may be excused because Caraballo was a police officer, and he had a duty to report crime under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102. As an initial matter, the majority's references to English common law are of questionable relevance to this analysis. It has long been understood that \"[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.\" <i>Liparota,</i> 471 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111425\"><a href=\"/opinion/111425/liparota-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That misprision was thought to have been an appropriate charge for derelict officers in fifteenth century England is nothing more than an interesting historical footnote, unless the majority can show that Congress considered and adopted this history in drafting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Modern English law decisions are of even less relevance, as they fail to reflect the common law as it existed when Congress was drafting the misprision statute. Perhaps the majority emphasizes the history of the misprision crime in England because <i>in this country,</i> there is no support in the plain language of the statute or the case law for excusing the affirmative act requirement for police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Even the law review note cited by the majority agrees that current law provides no such support. Curenton, <i>supra,</i> 55 Ala. L.Rev. at 185 (\"[U]nlike its English counterpart, the phrasing `conceals and does not as soon as possible make known' has been uniformly construed [by American courts] to require both active concealment and a failure to disclose.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Government's second theory were plausible, it suffers from an additional serious defect. The class of people in this country with some sort of duty to report crime is quite numerous. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 547 (\"[E]ach United States attorney, within his district, shall&#8212;(1) prosecute for all offenses against the United States.\"); <i>Hagood v.

Although many officers of the Government labor under such a duty to report wrongdoing, it is clear from Supreme Court precedent that these duties to report crime are not absolute. With respect to police officers, there is a \"deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, even in the presence of seemingly mandatory legislative commands.\" <i>Town of Castle Rock v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799991\"><a href=\"/opinion/799991/castle-rock-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 760-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799991\"><a href=\"/opinion/799991/castle-rock-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ann. tit. 25, &#167; 3102) \"clearly do not mean that a police officer may not lawfully decline to make an arrest.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 1-4.5, commentary, at 1-124 to 1-125 (2d ed.1980)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Given that Caraballo could have \"lawfully decline[d] to make an arrest\" in this case, I have some difficulty with the proposition expounded by the majority, based on irrelevant <i>English</i> common law, that under the facts of this case he incurred federal criminal liability under the misprision statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Having conceded that it might be error for the court to have overlooked the affirmative act requirement, the majority suggests that it was not plain error because no decision of this Circuit has ever rejected the extraordinary theory that a citizen may be convicted under federal law for merely failing to report a crime. But in accepting Caraballo's plea, it was incumbent on the district court to examine \"the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed.\" <i>McCarthy v.

Not only does the misprision statute make clear that an element of \"concealment\" is required, but two Supreme Court cases and unanimity in the case law should be sufficient to make the error in the majority's reasoning \"plain.\" <i>See United States v.

The decisions of the Supreme Court and our sister circuits are most certainly difficult to overlook. That our court has not spoken as to the issue should not foreclose a finding of \"plain error,\" especially given the \"archaic\" and \"uncommon\" nature of the crime. <i>Roberts,</i> 445 U.S. at 558, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110234\"><a href=\"/opinion/110234/roberts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although we have held that a court's choice of two competing interpretations of a statute will not be disturbed on a plain error standard, these competing interpretations have had some support in the case law. <i>See, e.g., Correa v. Hospital San Francisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1995) (finding support for both plaintiff's and defendant's interpretations of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(d)(2) in decisions from other circuits). Here, as the majority concedes, any interpretation of the misprision statute that does not require an affirmative act is not truly \"competing\": no court anywhere has adopted either of the Government's proposed interpretations, and in fact, every court to have considered them has rejected them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that even if there was plain error, it was not prejudicial. This conclusion rests on the statement in <i>United States v. Dom&#237;nguez Ben&#237;tez</i> that to prove prejudice, a defendant must \"show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the [guilty] plea.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 83, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span> (2004). We have applied this standard before where a defendant has argued that there was no factual basis to support his guilty plea. <i>See United States v.

Likewise, the majority suggests that Caraballo's conviction did not \"adversely impact[] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d at 224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard for me to see how Caraballo would not be prejudiced, or the public reputation of judicial proceedings would not be adversely impacted if we affirm his conviction without any factual basis to support it. First, it is important to point out that in <i>Delgado-Hern&#225;ndez,</i> we decided that the Defendant was not prejudiced by his guilty plea because it was supported by an adequate factual basis. <i>Id.</i> at 32. We found, based on the evidence placed on the record before the district court, that if the Government had made a proper factual proffer, it could have established a factual basis for the defendant's plea. <i>Id.</i> at 29; <i>see also United States v. Sawyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199256\"><a href=\"/opinion/199256/sawyer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2001) (\"To justify Sawyer's guilty plea, it was enough that the government pointed to evidence, or proffered facts, that would furnish a rational basis for the plea.\") (Boudin, J., concurring). The same cannot be said here, where accepting all of the Government's factual allegations as true, there is still no evidence to establish an affirmative act of concealment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the entire purpose of the Rule 11 requirement that a district court find a factual basis for a plea is to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\" <i>McCarthy,</i> 394 U.S. at 467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107892\"><a href=\"/opinion/107892/mccarthy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span> (quoting Fed. R.Crim.P. 11, advisory committee's note). To put it another way, we do not allow a defendant to plead guilty without making some sort of determination, however cursory, that the defendant's conduct is criminally punishable. As the record stands, even assuming the complete truth of the Government's allegations, Caraballo plainly did not commit the crime of misprision because he did not commit an affirmative act of concealment. Nevertheless, he was allowed to be convicted. Thus, there is before us the conviction of a man who is plainly not guilty of the crime for which he was charged. A miscarriage of justice more prejudicial would be difficult to find.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chief Judge's concurrence improves on the majority opinion by not giving much credence to either of the Government's proposed theories. But the concurrence still gets it wrong. When a defendant challenges a plea accepted by the district court, we grant the Government the extraordinary indulgence of not requiring that they provide any evidence to support the plea. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fountain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461047\"><a href=\"/opinion/461047/united-states-v-scott-a-fountain-united-states-of-america-v-matthew-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 355 (7th Cir.1985) (\"A sufficient factual basis can be found even when the court engages in the most rudimentary questioning of the defendant if the indictment and statement of the prosecution's evidence are sufficiently specific to make clear to the defendant exactly what is being admitted to.\"). We will allow a plea to rest on the Government's allegations alone, so long as they were presented to the district court. <i>Sawyer,</i> 239 F.3d at 50 (Boudin, J., concurring). This supports the policy of discouraging defendants from seeking to withdraw their pleas by later claiming, \"I didn't do it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the law does not allow us to affirm a plea simply because the Government states \"the defendant committed a crime.\" Rather, we must determine that the defendant's conduct, as alleged by the Government, constitutes a crime. <i>See United States v. Negr&#243;n-N&#225;rvaez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201522\"><a href=\"/opinion/201522/united-states-v-negron-narvaez/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (\"At its most abecedarian level, the requirement that a guilty plea must be supported by an adequate factual basis ensures that the conduct to which the defendant admits constitutes the crime with which he is charged.\"). Not \"maybe a crime,\" not \"possibly a crime,\" but a crime as codified in the United States Code. The misprision statute, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, requires \"concealment.\" Any reasonable reading of this statute suggests that an affirmative act is required, as has been confirmed by years of unanimous precedent. The majority and concurring opinions raise the question of whether we should decide that a defendant can be convicted because he might have committed a crime that we might define differently in the future. In a system of justice that requires that defendants be provided with notice of prohibited conduct, the answer is a clear \"No.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I think it is important to address the majority opinion's concluding statements. The majority assuages its concerns about the result by stating that Caraballo \"participated in a major drug conspiracy,\" and that other officers in the conspiracy received lengthy terms of imprisonment. Thus, the majority contends, Caraballo benefited from his plea agreement and is now looking a gift-horse in the mouth. It has long been my understanding that defendants are entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Caraballo's indictment alone does not establish that he is guilty of the crimes charged. Perhaps he did, as the majority contends, plead guilty to avoid prison time on more serious charges. Perhaps the Government had an interest in offering Caraballo a plea, as the concurrence suggests, because the Government had concerns about its own ability to obtain a conviction in the conspiracy case. Perhaps Caraballo was erroneously told that misprision charge against him was airtight because it required no showing of an affirmative act. We may never know why Caraballo pled guilty to the misprision charge, but it is ultimately irrelevant. Our country is a nation of laws, and we do not countenance the conviction of a defendant for a crime he did not commit simply because we suspect that he was bad or may have committed other crimes. A defendant must engage in the proscribed charged conduct to be found guilty of a crime, whether by plea or by trial. Because Caraballo did not engage in the conduct proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4, I would reverse his conviction. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The district court eventually transmitted a record to this court which referred to the documents in the supplemental appendix, but this record only noted that the documents were part of the record in the conspiracy case, No. 01-613, rather than the misprision case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> It is worth noting that although I agree with the majority that a document need not be admissible in evidence to be part of the record on appeal, it would need to be admissible for a district judge to consider it, and we would rule it error for the district judge to have relied on inadmissible evidence in coming to its conclusion<i>See Orta-Castro</i> v. <i>Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Qu&#237;mica P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202204\"><a href=\"/opinion/202204/orta-castro-v-merck-sharp-dohme/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In similar cases, where a defendant has challenged the factual basis of a plea and the Government has responded with additional evidence, other courts have suggested that a court might either vacate the plea entirely or simply remand the case to the district court for consideration of the new evidence<i>See, e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Goldberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514819\"><a href=\"/opinion/514819/united-states-v-marvin-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 107 (6th Cir.1988) (\"The second alternative is to remand the case to permit the government to supplement the record on the issue of `active concealment' in an attempt to satisfy the district court of the existence of a factual basis for Goldberg's plea of guilty.\"). By deferring to a district court's expertise in factfinding, this would seem to be a more sensible resolution of Caraballo's objection to the supplemental appendix.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The majority's version of the facts relies heavily upon the supplemental appendix provided by the Government, which, as I have stated, cannot be considered on appeal because it was not presented to the district court. Thus, for example, we may not consider any of the evidence presented that Caraballo had actually committed the crime of conspiracy, a fact which has never been proven in any court. The prosecutor's fleeting reference to \"Caraballo and his co-conspirators\" does not establish Caraballo's guilt, especially when one considers that the full statement made during the plea colloquy was \"Specifically, when the agents asked him for information regarding the conspiracy that might identify the Defendant or his co-conspirators,<i>or the conspirators in the case,</i> he declined to furnish the specific information regarding the plot at that time.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">However, to the extent that the majority relies on the Government's supplemental appendix, I would add that not only did Caraballo-Rodr&#237;guez make a full report to the DEA regarding what happened during the cocaine escort, <i>but he also gave the DEA all of the money he had received,</i> a fact not mentioned by the majority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The only felony whose \"actual commission\" Caraballo is alleged to have known was a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The majority also alleges that Caraballo was a member of this conspiracy. Thus, in effect, the majority suggests that we are able to punish Caraballo for failing to report his own crime. Certainly, criminally punishing someone for failing to incriminate themselves implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination<i>See United States v. Kuh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339003\"><a href=\"/opinion/339003/united-states-v-james-kuh-and-howard-rea/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 677 (7th Cir. 1976) (\"If the duty to notify federal authorities [of criminal conduct] is precluded by constitutional privilege, it is difficult to understand how a conviction [for misprision] could be substantiated [when the defendant is also involved in the criminal conduct].\"). The majority suggests that by pleading guilty, defendants waive this privilege. However, it would be a very odd crime indeed which could only be prosecuted by guilty plea.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Although I assume this fact for the sake of argument, it is not entirely clear. First, in his initial call to the DEA, Caraballo did in fact make<i>the conspiracy</i> \"known,\" although he did not provide additional details. In addition, under the majority's version of the facts, which are tainted by reference to the supplemental appendix, Caraballo later called the Government and informed them in painstaking detail about the conspiracy. The Government makes no attempt to argue that this later report was not made \"as soon as possible.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> In fact, it is the lack of affirmative duties (including a duty to report crimes) that remains one of the hallmarks of the distinction between common law jurisdictions (such as the United States) and civil law jurisdictions (such as those in Europe)<i>Compare</i> Martin Vranken, <i>Duty to Rescue in Civil Law and Common Law: Les Extr&#234;mes Se Touchent?,</i> 47 Int'l &amp; Comp. L.Q. 934, 937 (1998) (noting that \"the French [civil] legal system can lay claim to [providing] `the greatest encouragement to the Good Samaritan'\"), <i>with</i> Liam Murphy, <i>Beneficence, Law, and Liberty: The Case of Required Rescue,</i> 89 Geo. L.J. 605, 606 (2001) (discussing the common law maxim that \"positive legal duties threaten the common law's traditional deference to individual liberty\"). To the extent that our system of law has imposed duties to act, they have been imposed in order to prevent harm or peril to another. <i>See generally</i> Melody J. Stewart, <i>How Making the Failure to Assist Illegal Fails to Assist: An Observation of Expanding Criminal Omission Liability,</i> 25 Am. J.Crim. L. 385, 392-96 (1998) (discussing the role of traditionally recognized criminal-law duties). Furthermore, criminal liability for omissions has been imposed only when the defendant's omission can be said to have caused the harm or peril. <i>See</i> Arthur Leavens, <i>A Causation Approach To Criminal Omissions,</i> 76 Cal. L.Rev. 547, 562 (1988) (recognizing \"the critical underlying premise that criminal omissions can occur only in `cause-and-result' crimes, that is, crimes that proscribe the causation of a particular harm\"). The misprision statute addresses conduct <i>after</i> any harm has occurred because it punishes concealment only after the actual commission of a felony. Furthermore, misprision does not appear to incorporate any element of causation, thus further suggesting that any common law analysis of criminal omission liability is inapposite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> It is worth noting that this is the \"footnote omitted\" in the long quote from<i>Roberts</i> on page 72 of the majority opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> On page 74 and in footnote 10 of the majority opinion, the majority also suggests that \"even a truthful but partial disclosure could conceal by misleading.\" This is another example of the majority stretching the definition of the statute in favor of the Government. In addition, the Government made no allegation of fact in the district court that Caraballo's brief phone call to the DEA was misleading. That the partial disclosure might have been misleading in other circumstances seems utterly irrelevant considering that the Government in this case had full knowledge of the facts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Of course, to date, no reported decision in the history of jurisprudence in the<i>United States</i> has mentioned what would appear to be a fairly large \"exception\" to the affirmative act requirement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> That Caraballo was a<i>state</i> police officer who is being punished for failing to report a <i>federal</i> crime to <i>federal</i> authorities may raise federalism concerns. <i>See Printz v.
