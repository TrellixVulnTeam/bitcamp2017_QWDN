Evans, Assistant Director, and Paul Fiorino, Trial\nAttorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil Division, United\nStates Department of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         August 18, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n  Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric J.\nHolder has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B.\nMukasey.\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge.       Mac Arthur Pakasi (Mac Arthur)1\n\nand his son, Hiskiah, hailing from Sulawesi Island in Indonesia,\n\nare ethnic Manadonese and Christians seeking review of a final\n\norder from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).         Because no\n\nrecord evidence compels a different result than that espoused by\n\nthe Immigration Court and upheld by the BIA, and because no\n\nprocedural violations or errors of law were made, the petition for\n\nreview is denied.\n\n                              I. History\n\n          Mac Arthur Pakasi entered the United States in March 1992\n\nas a non-immigrant visitor.    Hiskiah followed in July 1994, with\n\nthe same status and authorization to remain in the country until\n\nJanuary 1995.   After remaining in the United States years longer\n\nthan permitted, they both were charged with being subject to\n\nremoval pursuant to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(1)(B).         The petitioners\n\nconceded removability, but on December 19, 2003 -- eleven years\n\nafter Mac Arthur's arrival in the United States -- they sought\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).   Both petitioners testified in support of\n\ntheir applications before an Immigration Judge (IJ), as did Mac\n\nArthur's spouse and Hiskiah's mother Ethmy Pakasi.\n\n\n\n1\n   Petitioner Mac Arthur Pakisi's name appears variously as\n\"MacArthur\" and \"Mac Arthur.\" We adopt the spelling as it appears\nin the decisions of the Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration\nAppeals.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           Collectively, the petitioners and Ethmy Pakasi testified\n\nthat in 1990 Mac Arthur was beaten because of is involvement with\n\na Christian church building committee, and that Mac Arthur informed\n\nthe police of the beating.       A construction permit sought by the\n\nbuilding committee was denied, Mac Arthur believed, because the\n\ngovernment did not want to inflame the local Muslim community.\n\nAdditionally, the Pakasi family's home was stoned on several\n\noccasions. These experiences resulted in Mac Arthur abandoning the\n\nfamily home in favor of a different residence in Jakarta, and later\n\nfleeing to the United States.\n\n           On one occasion, Ethmy was accosted by two Muslims.         As\n\none brandished a knife, the other burned Ethmy on her hand with a\n\ncigarette, allegedly because she was wearing a cross.\n\n           For his part, Hiskiah was treated differently from other\n\nchildren   due   to   his   religion   and   appearance.    Hiskiah   also\n\ntestified that since his arrival in the United States, conditions\n\nwere getting worse in Indonesia and that \"he heard of church\n\nburnings and the killing of Christians.\"\n\n           Mac Arthur ultimately left Indonesia in 1992.        His wife\n\nand child remained at the family home in Indonesia for two years,\n\nattending weekly church services.\n\n           The IJ denied the applications, and the BIA subsequently\n\ndismissed the petitioners' timely appeal in an August 31, 2006\n\norder that affirmed and adopted the IJ's decision.         The BIA agreed\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwith the IJ that the petitioners' asylum claims were time-barred,\n\nhaving been filed many years beyond the one-year deadlines, and\n\nthat the petitioners had failed to establish changed circumstances\n\nsuch as would excuse the late filings.      The BIA also concluded that\n\nthe petitioners had \"failed to meet the burdens of proof\" relevant\n\nto their claims of persecution and torture.\n\n           In its order, the BIA noted that it declined to rely on\n\ndescriptions of recent violence included in six newspaper articles\n\nthat the petitioners had submitted, and also held that the newly\n\nsubmitted information did not warrant a remand for consideration by\n\nthe IJ.   See Matter of S-H, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n           The petitioners do not seek review of the determination\n\nthat their asylum claims are time-barred, nor do they make any\n\nargument under the CAT.     Those claims are thus abandoned.      As for\n\ntheir challenge to the denial of withholding of removal, the\n\npetitioners   advance   a   spate   of    arguments,   most   prominently\n\nemphasizing that the IJ and BIA failed adequately to take into\n\naccount country conditions as outlined in State Department reports\n\nand erroneously concluded that conditions were improving in 2000 -\n\n2002; that the IJ did not take into account evidence that the\n\nIndonesian government discourages the construction of Christian\n\nchurches; and that the IJ and BIA failed to consider the \"totality\"\n\nof the petitioners' circumstances in light of country conditions.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fAccording to the petitioners, these alleged derelictions resulted\n\nin the petitioners' cases not being evaluated under the correct\n\nlegal standards and require remand for further proceedings.\n\n            The petitioners' main arguments are related in that they\n\nassert that the IJ and BIA did not fairly assess the record and\n\nexplain the results.      In support, the petitioners invoke Gomes v.\n\nGonzales, 473 F.3d 746 (7th Cir. 2007).          This case, however, bears\n\nlittle resemblance to Gomes; the IJ here did not selectively read\n\nthe record, as the Seventh Circuit concluded had occurred in Gomes.\n\nRather, the IJ viewed the record as a whole - taking into account\n\nboth the State Department country conditions reports and other\n\nrecord evidence.       See Waweau v. Gonzales, 437 f.3d 199, 202, n.1\n\n(lst Cir. 2006) (the decision maker is to consider both country\n\nconditions    reports     and    record     evidence   contradicting   those\n\nreports).\n\n            The   IJ   adequately    addressed   the   country   conditions,\n\nnoting that conditions were \"tense\" with ongoing incidents of\n\n\"religious violence.\"           Further, the IJ indicated clearly that\n\ncountry conditions \"did, in fact deteriorate in approximately late\n\n1997 and 1998\" and \"that there were spikes in violence between 1998\n\nand 2000.\"    The IJ also noted, however, that Mac Arthur did not\n\nfile his application for protection from persecution during these\n\ntroubled times.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Additionally, the IJ considered the 2002 State Department\n\nreport on country conditions that, while acknowledging sectarian\n\nviolence, also states that in 2001 the Indonesian government sent\n\nthousands of elite soldiers and police officers to Sulawasi to stem\n\nthe violence. This direct action, according to the report, greatly\n\nreduced the violence that had been ongoing since 1998.\n\n           Petitioners emphasize the restrictions on construction\n\nand expansion of houses of worship, but these policies applied to\n\nall religious groups and they did not prevent either petitioner or\n\nmany   Christians   in   Indonesia   from   practicing   their   religion.\n\nMoreover, according to their own testimony, the petitioners were\n\nable to practice their religion regularly and freely.                Ethmy\n\ntestified that she attended church every Sunday even after her\n\nreported attacks.    No testimony was given that the government of\n\nIndonesia banned the petitioners' practices.\n\n           In Gomes, relied on by the petitioners, the court held\n\nthat the IJ had leaned too heavily on country conditions reports,\n\nto the exclusion of other evidence, including specific evidence of\n\npossible persecution against the petitioners in that case.            473\n\nF.3d at 756.    Here, the petitioners have not presented evidence\n\nthat would compel a finding of past persecution.         Although Hiskiah\n\ntestified that he was treated differently than others, he remained\n\nin Indonesia after his father's departure and attended Catholic\n\nschool.   No evidence came before the IJ indicating Hiskiah was\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbeaten, arrested, detained or suffered torture in any manner at any\n\ntime.   To establish past persecution, the petitioners must prove\n\nsomething more than \"harassment or annoyance,\"        Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 570 (lst Cir. 1999), and we have held that\n\n\"discrimination in Indonesia does not, without more, qualify a\n\nChristian Indonesian national for [relief].\"       Sombah v. Mukasey,\n\n529 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Ethmy's lone experience, involving a cigarette burn to\n\nher hand and a brandished knife, does not rise to the level of\n\npersecution.    \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience\n\nmust    rise   above   unpleasantness,   harassment   or   even   basic\n\nsuffering.\"    Nelson v. INS, 232 F. 3d 258, 263 (lst Cir. 2000).\n\n           Mac Arthur presents a history of episodic incidents.      He\n\nwas beaten, his house was stoned, and his church building permit\n\nwas denied.     But \"mistreatment must ordinarily entail more than\n\nsporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution.\"         Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           As the petitioners have not shown past persecution, they\n\ndo not benefit from a presumption that they are susceptible to\n\nfuture persecution, and thus they must demonstrate that it is\n\nnevertheless more likely than not that their lives or freedom will\n\nbe threatened if they return to Indonesia.       Sharari v. Gonzales,\n\n407 F.3d. 467, 474 (1st Cir. 2005).      On this score, in addition to\n\nthe country conditions reports relied on by the IJ, the record\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\freflects that Mac Arthur's wife and child remained in Indonesia for\n\ntwo years, without harm, after his departure.       Mac Arthur himself\n\nhad traveled to Singapore for a number of days and voluntarily\n\nreturned to Indonesia.      These facts undermine claims of a clear\n\nprobability of persecution or a fear of persecution.              Jean v.\n\nGonzales, 461 F.3d. 87, 91 (lst Cir. 2006); Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d\n\nat 573.    Moreover, although the petitioners assert that there is a\n\npattern or practice of persecuting Christians in Indonesia, we\n\n\"have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations...that there is\n\nno ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against...Christians\n\nin Indonesia,\"     Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 54 (lst Cir. 2007),\n\nand the IJ and BIA were not required to conclude differently on\n\nthis record.\n\n            The petitioners also urge us to reverse the BIA's ruling\n\nbecause the administrative tribunal declined to remand in light of\n\nnew country conditions evidence.       We review the BIA's decision on\n\na motion to remand for abuse of discretion.     Zhang v. Ashcroft, 348\n\nF.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Nascimento v. INS, 274 F.3d\n\n26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)).    Abuse of discretion exists only where the\n\ndenial was made โwithout a โrational explanation, inexplicably\n\ndeparted    from   the   established    policies,   or   rested    on   an\n\nimpermissible basis.โ\"     Id. (quoting Nascimento, 274 F.3d at 28).\n\n            The news articles submitted by the petitioners to the\n\nBIA, which post-date the last hearing before the IJ, do not\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdemonstrate that the BIA abused its discretion in declining to\n\nremand.       The BIA did consider the evidence and concluded that it\n\nfailed to establish a substantial likelihood of a different result\n\nupon remand.       The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding\n\nthat    the     news   articles   were     insufficiently     related    to   the\n\npetitioners' claims such that the outcome would be altered on\n\nremand.       See Bhanot v. Chertoff, 474 F.3d 71, 74 (2d Cir. 2007).\n\nSee also Hussain v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 153, 158 (4th Cir. 2007).\n\n              Finally, the petitioners argue that the IJ and BIA failed\n\nto take into account the totality of the record evidence and the\n\npetitioners' circumstances.         As evidenced by the above discussion,\n\nthe    record    belies   that    claim.       While   the   IJ   may   not   have\n\nspecifically discussed each piece of evidence, she clearly did\n\nconsider the country conditions reports and the testimony of each\n\nwitness.        There is no requirement that every single piece of\n\nevidence be discussed in an IJ's decision.               Morales v. INS, 208\n\nF.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

Moreover, although the petitioners assert that there is a pattern or practice of persecuting Christians in Indonesia, we \"have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations ... that there is no ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against ...

Because no record evidence compels a different result than that espoused by the Immigration Court and upheld <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> by the BIA, and because no procedural violations or errors of law were made, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. History</h2>\n<p>Mac Arthur Pakasi entered the United States in March 1992 as a non-immigrant visitor. Hiskiah followed in July 1994, with the same status and authorization to remain in the country until January 1995. After remaining in the United States years longer than permitted, they both were charged with being subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(1)(B). The petitioners conceded removability, but on December 19, 2003ยeleven years after Mac Arthur's arrival in the United Statesยthey sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Both petitioners testified in support of their applications before an Immigration Judge (IJ), as did Mac Arthur's spouse and Hiskiah's mother Ethmy Pakasi.</p>\n<p>Collectively, the petitioners and Ethmy Pakasi testified that in 1990 Mac Arthur was beaten because of his involvement with a Christian church building committee, and that Mac Arthur informed the police of the beating. A construction permit sought by the building committee was denied, Mac Arthur believed, because the government did not want to inflame the local Muslim community. Additionally, the Pakasi family's home was stoned on several occasions. These experiences resulted in Mac Arthur abandoning the family home in favor of a different residence in Jakarta, and later fleeing to the United States.</p>\n<p>On one occasion, Ethmy was accosted by two Muslims. As one brandished a knife, the other burned Ethmy on her hand with a cigarette, allegedly because she was wearing a cross.</p>\n<p>For his part, Hiskiah was treated differently from other children due to his religion and appearance. Hiskiah also testified that since his arrival in the United States, conditions were getting worse in Indonesia and that \"he heard of church burnings and the killing of Christians.\"</p>\n<p>Mac Arthur ultimately left Indonesia in 1992. His wife and child remained at the family home in Indonesia for two years, attending weekly church services.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied the applications, and the BIA subsequently dismissed the petitioners' timely appeal in an August 31, 2006 order that affirmed and adopted the IJ's decision. The BIA agreed with the IJ that the petitioners' asylum claims were time-barred, having been filed many years beyond the one-year deadlines, and that the petitioners had failed to establish changed circumstances such as would excuse the late filings. The BIA also concluded that the petitioners had \"failed to meet the burdens of proof\" relevant to their claims of persecution and torture.</p>\n<p>In its order, the BIA noted that it declined to rely on descriptions of recent violence included in six newspaper articles that the petitioners had submitted, and also held that the newly submitted information did not warrant a remand for consideration by the IJ. <i>See </i><i>Matter of S-H,</i> 23 I &amp; N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>The petitioners do not seek review of the determination that their asylum claims are time-barred, nor do they make any argument under the CAT. Those claims are thus abandoned. As for their challenge to the denial of withholding of removal, the petitioners advance a spate of arguments, most prominently emphasizing that the IJ and BIA failed adequately to take into account country conditions as outlined in State Department reports and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> erroneously concluded that conditions were improving in 2000-2002; that the IJ did not take into account evidence that the Indonesian government discourages the construction of Christian churches; and that the IJ and BIA failed to consider the \"totality\" of the petitioners' circumstances in light of country conditions. According to the petitioners, these alleged derelictions resulted in the petitioners' cases not being evaluated under the correct legal standards and require remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The petitioners' main arguments are related in that they assert that the IJ and BIA did not fairly assess the record and explain the results. In support, the petitioners invoke <i>Gomes v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796477\"><a href=\"/opinion/796477/john-gomes-jessie-gomes-jonathan-gomes-and-keira-gomes-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2007). This case, however, bears little resemblance to <i>Gomes</i>; the IJ here did not selectively read the record, as the Seventh Circuit concluded had occurred in <i>Gomes.</i> Rather, the IJ viewed the record as a wholeยtaking into account both the State Department country conditions reports and other record evidence. <i>See </i><i>Waweru v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202091\"><a href=\"/opinion/202091/waweru-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 202, n. 1 (1st Cir.2006) (the decision maker is to consider both country conditions reports and record evidence contradicting those reports).</p>\n<p>The IJ adequately addressed the country conditions, noting that conditions were \"tense\" with ongoing incidents of \"religious violence.\" Further, the IJ indicated clearly that country conditions \"did, in fact deteriorate in approximately late 1997 and 1998\" and \"that there were spikes in violence between 1998 and 2000.\" The IJ also noted, however, that Mac Arthur did not file his application for protection from persecution during these troubled times.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the IJ considered the 2002 State Department report on country conditions that, while acknowledging sectarian violence, also states that in 2001 the Indonesian government sent thousands of elite soldiers and police officers to Sulawasi to stem the violence. This direct action, according to the report, greatly reduced the violence that had been ongoing since 1998.</p>\n<p>Petitioners emphasize the restrictions on construction and expansion of houses of worship, but these policies applied to all religious groups and they did not prevent either petitioner or many Christians in Indonesia from practicing their religion. Moreover, according to their own testimony, the petitioners were able to practice their religion regularly and freely. Ethmy testified that she attended church every Sunday even after her reported attacks. No testimony was given that the government of Indonesia banned the petitioners' practices.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gomes,</i> relied on by the petitioners, the court held that the IJ had leaned too heavily on country conditions reports, to the exclusion of other evidence, including specific evidence of possible persecution against the petitioners in that case. 473 F.3d at 756. Here, the petitioners have not presented evidence that would compel a finding of past persecution. Although Hiskiah testified that he was treated differently than others, he remained in Indonesia after his father's departure and attended Catholic school. No evidence came before the IJ indicating Hiskiah was beaten, arrested, detained or suffered torture in any manner at any time. To establish past persecution, the petitioners must prove something more than \"harassment or annoyance,\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 570 (1st Cir.1999), and we have held that \"discrimination in Indonesia does not, without more, qualify a Christian Indonesian national for [relief].\" <i>Sombah v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203336\"><a href=\"/opinion/203336/sombah-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Ethmy's lone experience, involving a cigarette burn to her hand and a brandished <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> knife, does not rise to the level of persecution. \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment or even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Mac Arthur presents a history of episodic incidents. He was beaten, his house was stoned, and his church building permit was denied. But \"mistreatment must ordinarily entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution.\" <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>As the petitioners have not shown past persecution, they do not benefit from a presumption that they are susceptible to future persecution, and thus they must demonstrate that it is nevertheless more likely than not that their lives or freedom will be threatened if they return to Indonesia. <i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 474 (1st Cir.2005). On this score, in addition to the country conditions reports relied on by the IJ, the record reflects that Mac Arthur's wife and child remained in Indonesia for two years, without harm, after his departure. Mac Arthur himself had traveled to Singapore for a number of days and voluntarily returned to Indonesia. These facts undermine claims of a clear probability of persecution or a fear of persecution. <i>Jean v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202385\"><a href=\"/opinion/202385/jean-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573. Moreover, although the petitioners assert that there is a pattern or practice of persecuting Christians in Indonesia, we \"have repeatedly affirmed the BIA's determinations ... that there is no ongoing pattern or practice of persecution against ... Christians in Indonesia,\" <i>Kho v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202978\"><a href=\"/opinion/202978/kho-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2007), and the IJ and BIA were not required to conclude differently on this record.</p>\n<p>The petitioners also urge us to reverse the BIA's ruling because the administrative tribunal declined to remand in light of new country conditions evidence. We review the BIA's decision on a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <i>Zhang v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200720\"><a href=\"/opinion/200720/zhang-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 293 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>Nascimento v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199734\"><a href=\"/opinion/199734/nascimento-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2001)). Abuse of discretion exists only where the denial was made \"without a `rational explanation, inexplicably departed from the established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Nascimento,</i> 274 F.3d at 28).</p>\n<p>The news articles submitted by the petitioners to the BIA, which post-date the last hearing before the IJ, do not demonstrate that the BIA abused its discretion in declining to remand. The BIA did consider the evidence and concluded that it failed to establish a substantial likelihood of a different result upon remand.
