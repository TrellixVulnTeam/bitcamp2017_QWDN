Green for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nDavid V. Bernal, Assistant Director, and Anthony P. Nicastro,\nAttorney, United States Department of Justice, Civil Division,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                        February 21, 2006\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        This petition for review raises\n\nthe issue of whether action short of completing the naturalization\n\nprocess may render an alien a \"national\" of the United States.\n\n             Petitioner Joseph Nassib Abou-Haidar is a citizen of\n\nLebanon who entered the United States as a legal permanent resident\n\nin 1983.    In 2001, Abou-Haidar was convicted of armed robbery.             The\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")1 placed him in\n\nremoval proceedings, seeking to deport him as an aggravated felon.\n\nAbou-Haidar moved to terminate the proceedings on the ground that\n\nhe    was   not   an   \"alien\"2   because      he   had   acquired    derivative\n\ncitizenship and/or qualified as a \"national\"3 of the United States.\n\nThe   immigration      judge   denied   the    motion,    ordered    Abou-Haidar\n\nremoved, and subsequently denied a motion to reconsider. The Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed.\n\n             Abou-Haidar argues that the BIA erred in concluding that\n\nhe was not a \"national\" of the United States.             We review this legal\n\nquestion de novo.        See generally        Fierro v. Reno, 217 F.3d 1, 3\n\n\n\n1\n The relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement in March 2003.\n2\n See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3) (\"alien means any person who is not a\ncitizen or national of the United States\").\n3\n \"The term 'national of the United States' means (A) a citizen of\nthe United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the\nUnited States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\" 8\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(22).\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f(1st Cir. 2000).         Abou-Haidar bases his claim on the following\n\nfacts: (1) he has resided in the United States as a legal permanent\n\nresident since 1983; (2) he registered with the U.S. Selective\n\nService    System       in    1984;    (3)     he    filed     an    application    for\n\nnaturalization      in       1997;    and    (4)    at   his    1998      naturalization\n\ninterview, he swore allegiance to the United States and signed an\n\noath declaration form. Although his naturalization application was\n\ndenied    in    1999,    Abou-Haidar         asserts     that       his    circumstances\n\nestablish him as a person who \"owes permanent allegiance to the\n\nUnited States.\"\n\n               The overwhelming majority of circuit courts to consider\n\nthe question have concluded that one can become a \"national\" of the\n\nUnited States only by birth or by naturalization under the process\n\nset by Congress. See, e.g., Marquez-Almanzar v. INS, 418 F.3d 210,\n\n216-19 (2d Cir. 2005); Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 409 F.3d\n\n1280, 1285-87 (11th Cir. 2005); Salim v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 307,\n\n309-10 (3d Cir. 2003); Perdomo-Padilla v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 964,\n\n972 (9th Cir. 2003).            A long period of residence in the United\n\nStates, military service and/or registration with the Selective\n\nService, and completing a portion of the naturalization process\n\n(including an oath of allegiance) do not suffice.                            See Tovar-\n\nAlvarez v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 427 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir. 2005);\n\nAlwan v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir. 2004); Reyes-\n\nAlcaraz v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 937, 939-40 (9th Cir. 2004);                        United\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fStates v. Jimenez-Alcala, 353 F.3d 858, 860-62 (10th Cir. 2003).4\n\n          There are several justifications for this conclusion.\n\nFirst, absent a fully completed naturalization process, the term\n\n\"national\" has traditionally only been applied to certain persons\n\nborn in the outlying territories of the United States.         See\n\nJimenez-Alcala, 353 F.3d at 861 (stating that the concepts of\n\n\"citizenship\" and \"nationality\" are essentially synonymous, and\n\nthat the only noncitizen U.S. nationals are residents of American\n\nSamoa and Swains Island); see also Reyes-Alcaraz, 363 F.3d at 939.\n\nSecond, the relevant immigration statutes, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1401-1458,\n\nprovide that completion of naturalization is the only means by\n\nwhich an alien can become a national of the United States.     See\n\nMarquez-Almanzar, 418 F.3d at 216-19; Sebastian-Soler, 409 F.3d at\n\n1285-86; Perdomo-Padilla, 333 F.3d at 968-71.   Third, the contrary\n\nresult could potentially allow an alien to avoid deportation by\n\nsimply filing a futile naturalization application.    See Perdomo-\n\nPadilla, 333 F.3d at 970.     Fourth, we do not think that the\n\nsubmission of a naturalization application, which can be denied or\n\n\n4\n There is one circuit decision that may be to the contrary. In the\ncontext of a criminal appeal, the Fourth Circuit concluded, without\nelaboration, that the defendant's victim was a United States\n\"national\" because he had applied for citizenship, thereby showing\na \"permanent allegiance to the United States.\"    See United States\nv. Morin, 80 F.3d 124, 126 (4th Cir. 1996). We do not follow Morin\nbecause, as explained above, we find the contrary view more\npersuasive.    We note, moreover, that in a recent unpublished\nimmigration case, the Fourth Circuit distinguished Morin and\nfollowed the majority position. See Daly v. Gonzales, 129 Fed.\nAppx. 837, 840-43 (4th Cir. 2005).\n\n                               -4-\n\fwithdrawn at any time by the applicant, is very strong evidence of\n\na \"permanent\" allegiance to the United States.   See id. at 968-69;\n\nsee also Jimenez-Alcala, 353 F.3d at 861-62 (residing in the United\n\nStates for a long period or subjectively considering oneself a\n\nperson who owes permanent allegiance to the U.S. does not render\n\none a national).\n\n          Because Abou-Haidar was never naturalized, he is not a\n\n\"national\" of the United States. The petition is therefore denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",

First, absent a fully completed naturalization process, the term \"national\" has traditionally only been applied to certain persons born in the outlying territories of the United States. <i>See Jimenez-Alcala,</i> 353 F.3d at 861 (stating that the concepts of \"citizenship\" and \"nationality\" are essentially synonymous, and that the only noncitizen U.S. nationals are residents of American Samoa and Swains Island); <i>see also Reyes-Alcaraz,</i> 363 F.3d at 939. Second, the relevant immigration statutes, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1401-1458, provide that completion of naturalization is the only means by which an alien can become a national of the United States. <i>See Marquez-Almanzar,</i> 418 F.3d at 216-19; <i>Sebastian-Soler,</i> 409 F.3d at 1285-86; <i>Perdomo-Padilla,</i> 333 F.3d at 968-71. Third, the contrary result could potentially allow an alien to avoid deportation by simply filing a futile naturalization application. <i>See Perdomo-Padilla,</i> 333 F.3d at 970. Fourth, we do not think that the submission of a naturalization application, which can be denied or withdrawn at any time by the applicant, is very strong evidence of a \"permanent\" allegiance to the United States. <i>See id.</i> at 968-69; <i>see also Jimenez-Alcala,</i> 353 F.3d at 861-62 (residing in the United States for a long period or subjectively considering oneself a person who owes permanent allegiance to the U.S. does not render one a national).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Abou-Haidar was never naturalized, he is not a \"national\" of the United States. The petition is therefore <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March 2003</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(3) (\"alien means any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> \"The term `national of the United States' means (A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(22)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> There is one circuit decision that may be to the contrary. In the context of a criminal appeal, the Fourth Circuit concluded, without elaboration, that the defendant's victim was a United States \"national\" because he had applied for citizenship, thereby showing a \"permanent allegiance to the United States.\"<i>See United States v. Morin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715678\"><a href=\"/opinion/715678/united-states-v-andrew-scott-morin-aka-scott-morris-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 126 (4th Cir. 1996). We do not follow <i>Morin</i> because, as explained above, we find the contrary view more persuasive. We note, moreover, that in a recent unpublished immigration case, the Fourth Circuit distinguished <i>Morin</i> and followed the majority position. <i>See Daly v. Gonzales,</i> 129 Fed.Appx. 837, 840-43 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
