A grand jury indicted\n\nDefendant Jeffrey Paul Barnard on one count of being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).\n\nDefendant filed a motion to suppress statements allegedly obtained\n\nin violation of his Miranda rights prior to trial.         The district\n\ncourt denied the motion.    Defendant proceeded to trial and a jury\n\nconvicted him.    The district court denied Defendant’s subsequent\n\nmotion for a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 33, sentenced\n\nDefendant to 103 months’ imprisonment, and entered final judgment.\n\nDefendant appeals, arguing: (1) insufficient evidence exists to\n\nsupport his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g); (2) the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his motion to suppress statements obtained\n\nin violation of his Miranda rights;      and (3) the district court\n\nerred in denying his motion for a new trial on the basis of newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.1   We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The    evidence   presented   at   trial   was   as   follows:\n\nDefendant, a convicted felon, resided in Millinocket, Maine, with\n\n\n     1\n       Defendant raises a fourth issue, which we summarily reject.\nDefendant argues the district court’s jury instruction relating to\n“possession” under § 922(g) violated the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Blakely v. Washington, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (2004) and other\nsentencing cases. Defendant’s argument is misguided. Blakely and\nits progeny concern only the Sixth Amendment in the context of\ndeterminate sentencing schemes. Defendant, however, only appeals\nhis underlying conviction. He does not appeal his sentence. Such\ncases, therefore, are wholly irrelevant.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhis wife and stepson.         Defendant’s former friend, Walter Cote,\n\ntestified that he first met Defendant in 1999.           Cote was a frequent\n\nvisitor to Defendant’s home.          There, Cote observed a .22 bolt\n\naction rifle and a SKS semi-automatic rifle on numerous occasions.\n\nCote explained that the .22 rifle was “usually out in plain sight”\n\nand he had seen the SKS rifle in Defendant’s bedroom.               Cote also\n\ntestified that in the summer of 2000, he sold Defendant a 12-gauge\n\nshotgun and a gun cabinet.         After selling Defendant the cabinet,\n\nCote   visited     Defendant’s     home    and   observed    the   cabinet   in\n\nDefendant’s bedroom.         Defendant and Cote had a falling out in\n\nNovember 2000.        Thereafter, Cote notified law enforcement of\n\nDefendant’s gun possession.\n\n            Law enforcement officers checked Defendant’s criminal\n\nrecord and confirmed his status as a convicted felon.                 Officers\n\nexecuted a search warrant at Defendant’s residence on the morning\n\nof December 3, 2000.        Officers found Defendant in his bedroom and\n\nplaced him in custody.       Officers found a loaded .22 rifle leaning\n\nagainst the wall next to Defendant’s bed.            Officers also seized a\n\nSKS    rifle,    shotgun,    and   ammunition     from   a   gun   cabinet   in\n\nDefendant’s bedroom.\n\n            Officers transported Defendant to the police station.\n\nThere, Defendant complained of extreme back pain and numbness in\n\nhis legs.       Officers called an ambulance.        While waiting for the\n\nambulance, Officer Robert Johansen testified that Defendant asked\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhim “why we were doing this to him?”             Defendant then stated the\n\nguns were only at his house to protect his family.                   Johansen\n\ntestified that he never asked Defendant any questions, but told\n\nDefendant “now is not the time to discuss any matters with me.”\n\nNevertheless, once at the hospital, Defendant again told Johansen\n\nthat he only had the guns to protect his family.\n\n          Defendant’s    stepson,    Wayde       Batchelder,    testified   in\n\nDefendant’s   defense   and   claimed     that    he,   his   brother   Harold\n\nEdwards, and their friend, Jason Hartley, had placed the .22 rifle,\n\nSKS rifle, and shotgun in Defendant’s home.             The three witnesses\n\nclaimed they owned the guns and placed them in Defendant’s gun\n\ncabinet, with a lock, in late November 2000.                   Defendant also\n\ntestified and denied (1) purchasing a shotgun from Cote, and (2)\n\nthat Cote was a frequent visitor to his home.            The jury convicted\n\nDefendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                    A.\n\n          Defendant first argues that insufficient evidence exists\n\nto support his felon-in-possession conviction under § 922(g).               We\n\nreview sufficiency of the evidence claims de novo, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the Government. United States v.\n\nRivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir. 2001).               Under § 922(g),\n\nthe Government must prove: (1) the defendant had a previous felony\n\nconviction; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm; and\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f(3) the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.                          United\n\nStates v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir. 1992).                   Possession,\n\nunder the second element, may be actual or constructive.                         See id.\n\nThis circuit has consistently defined constructive possession as\n\nfollows:      “Constructive possession exists when a person knowingly\n\nhas the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion\n\nand control over an object either directly or through others.”\n\nUnited States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 510 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(internal     quotations     omitted).        “Constructive         possession         for\n\n§ 922(g) purposes does not require ownership of the gun.”                         United\n\nStates v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 2004).                   When reviewing\n\na sufficiency of the evidence challenge to a § 922(g) conviction,\n\nwe must uphold any verdict the record supports.                  Id.\n\n              In this case, sufficient evidence exists to support\n\nDefendant’s        felon-in-possession        conviction       under       §     922(g).\n\nDefendant stipulated at trial that he was a convicted felon and\n\nthat the firearms affected interstate commerce.                     The sole issue,\n\ntherefore, was whether Defendant “possessed the firearms.”                             The\n\nevidence    clearly     supports      the    jury’s    verdict      that       Defendant\n\npossessed the firearms. Cote testified he observed a .22 rifle and\n\na SKS rifle in Defendant’s home on numerous occasions.                          Further,\n\nlaw enforcement officers testified they searched Defendant’s house\n\nand   found    a    loaded   .22     rifle    leaning       against    the      wall    in\n\nDefendant’s        bedroom   where    Defendant       had    been     sleeping.          A\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\freasonable jury, based upon this and other evidence, could conclude\n\nDefendant, at a minimum, had constructive possession of the .22\n\nrifle because he exercised exclusive dominion and control over the\n\nbedroom in which the firearm was located.             See Liranzo, 385 F.3d at\n\n70.      Defendant’s    arguments     to    the    contrary    focus    mainly   on\n\ntestimony indicating he did not own the firearms.                   A conviction\n\nunder § 922(g), however, does not require proof of ownership of the\n\nfirearms in question.         See id. at 69.\n\n                                       B.\n\n            Defendant next argues the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to suppress statements obtained in violation of his\n\nMiranda rights.       We review the district court’s legal conclusions\n\non a motion to suppress de novo and its factual findings for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nIt is well established that “the prosecution may not use statements\n\n. . . stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless\n\nit demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to\n\nsecure the privilege against self-incrimination.”                       Miranda v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).                In order for a defendant to\n\nmake out a claim under Miranda, “his statements must have been the\n\nproduct of custodial interrogation.”              United States v. Lopez, 380\n\nF.3d 538, 545 (1st Cir. 2004).         The “custody” element is satisfied\n\nif the defendant is under arrest.             United States v. Ventura, 85\n\nF.3d     708,   710    (1st    Cir.   1996).          For     Miranda    purposes,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f“interrogation       is   ‘express     questioning     or      its   functional\n\nequivalent.’”    United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 310 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (quoting Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300-01 (1980)).\n\nInterrogation occurs only when police conduct is reasonably likely\n\nto elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.                 See id.   A\n\ndefendant’s voluntary statements, even if incriminating, generally\n\ndo not amount to a custodial interrogation.                 Lopez, 380 F.3d at\n\n546.\n\n            The district court did not err in denying Defendant’s\n\nmotion to suppress the incriminating statements he made to Officer\n\nJohansen regarding possession of the firearms. Defendant was under\n\narrest and therefore “in custody” when he made the challenged\n\nstatements. Defendant, however, was never interrogated and Miranda\n\nwarnings were not required.            The district court found Officer\n\nJohansen’s testimony at the suppression hearing credible.                 We are\n\nextremely    deferential      to     the    district   court’s       credibility\n\ndeterminations.       United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st\n\nCir.   1994).       Officer   Johansen     testified   he    never   questioned\n\nDefendant regarding his possession of the firearms.                    Further,\n\nOfficer Johansen testified that he informed Defendant not to make\n\nany statements to him when Defendant began voluntarily supplying\n\ninformation regarding his possession of the firearms. As a result,\n\nany    statements    Defendant     made    to   Johansen,    incriminating      or\n\notherwise, were not in response to direct questioning or the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffunctional equivalent of direct questioning.                       See Genao, 281 F.3d\n\nat 310-11.      Therefore, Miranda warnings were not required.\n\n                                           C.\n\n               Finally, Defendant argues the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered\n\nevidence.      We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for a\n\n“manifest abuse of discretion.”              United States v. Colon-Munoz, 318\n\nF.3d 348, 357 (1st Cir. 2003).                    We hold, after reviewing the\n\nrecord, that the district court did not manifestly abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Defendant’s motion for substantially the same\n\nreasons     set   forth     in    the   district       court’s        thorough    order.\n\nSee United States v. Barnard, 304 F.Supp. 2d 96 (D. Maine 2004).\n\n               As the district court aptly noted, Defendant’s “new\n\nevidence,” which apparently consisted of evidence showing Cote may\n\nnot have sold Defendant the shotgun introduced at trial, was known\n\nand   available       to   Defendant    at      the   time    of    trial.       Further,\n\nDefendant’s failure to develop the evidence was due to a lack of\n\ndiligence on his part.           See United States v. Mello, 469 F.2d 356,\n\n358 (1st Cir. 1972); see also United States v. Vigneau, 337 F.3d\n\n62, 69 (1st Cir. 2003).           At trial, defense counsel, without going\n\ninto specifics, informed the district court he had discovered some\n\nevidence that he might have to bring to the attention of the court.\n\nDefendant, however, later notified the court that he was not going\n\nto    pursue    the   issue      because     it   would      only    confuse   matters.\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fDefendant’s knowledge of the evidence at the time of trial and his\n\nfailure to develop the evidence precludes his motion for a new\n\ntrial.   See United States v. Falu-Gonzalez, 205 F.3d 436, 442 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (explaining that a motion for a new trial must be denied\n\nif the defendant fails to carry his burden as to any one of the\n\napplicable factors).\n\n                               III.\n\n            Based upon the foregoing, Defendant’s conviction is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

Officers\n\nexecuted a search warrant at Defendant’s residence on the morning\n\nof December 3, 2000.        Officers found Defendant in his bedroom and\n\nplaced him in custody.       Officers found a loaded .22 rifle leaning\n\nagainst the wall next to Defendant’s bed.            Officers also seized a\n\nSKS    rifle,    shotgun,    and   ammunition     from   a   gun   cabinet   in\n\nDefendant’s bedroom.\n\n            Officers transported Defendant to the police station.\n\nThere, Defendant complained of extreme back pain and numbness in\n\nhis legs.       Officers called an ambulance.        While waiting for the\n\nambulance, Officer Robert Johansen testified that Defendant asked\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhim “why we were doing this to him?”             Defendant then stated the\n\nguns were only at his house to protect his family.                   Johansen\n\ntestified that he never asked Defendant any questions, but told\n\nDefendant “now is not the time to discuss any matters with me.”\n\nNevertheless, once at the hospital, Defendant again told Johansen\n\nthat he only had the guns to protect his family.\n\n          Defendant’s    stepson,    Wayde       Batchelder,    testified   in\n\nDefendant’s   defense   and   claimed     that    he,   his   brother   Harold\n\nEdwards, and their friend, Jason Hartley, had placed the .22 rifle,\n\nSKS rifle, and shotgun in Defendant’s home.             The three witnesses\n\nclaimed they owned the guns and placed them in Defendant’s gun\n\ncabinet, with a lock, in late November 2000.                   Defendant also\n\ntestified and denied (1) purchasing a shotgun from Cote, and (2)\n\nthat Cote was a frequent visitor to his home.            The jury convicted\n\nDefendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                    A.\n\n          Defendant first argues that insufficient evidence exists\n\nto support his felon-in-possession conviction under § 922(g).               We\n\nreview sufficiency of the evidence claims de novo, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the Government.

When reviewing\n\na sufficiency of the evidence challenge to a § 922(g) conviction,\n\nwe must uphold any verdict the record supports.                  Id.\n\n              In this case, sufficient evidence exists to support\n\nDefendant’s        felon-in-possession        conviction       under       §     922(g).\n\nDefendant stipulated at trial that he was a convicted felon and\n\nthat the firearms affected interstate commerce.                     The sole issue,\n\ntherefore, was whether Defendant “possessed the firearms.”                             The\n\nevidence    clearly     supports      the    jury’s    verdict      that       Defendant\n\npossessed the firearms. Cote testified he observed a .22 rifle and\n\na SKS rifle in Defendant’s home on numerous occasions.                          Further,\n\nlaw enforcement officers testified they searched Defendant’s house\n\nand   found    a    loaded   .22     rifle    leaning       against    the      wall    in\n\nDefendant’s        bedroom   where    Defendant       had    been     sleeping.          A\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\freasonable jury, based upon this and other evidence, could conclude\n\nDefendant, at a minimum, had constructive possession of the .22\n\nrifle because he exercised exclusive dominion and control over the\n\nbedroom in which the firearm was located.             See Liranzo, 385 F.3d at\n\n70.      Defendant’s    arguments     to    the    contrary    focus    mainly   on\n\ntestimony indicating he did not own the firearms.                   A conviction\n\nunder § 922(g), however, does not require proof of ownership of the\n\nfirearms in question.         See id. at 69.\n\n                                       B.\n\n            Defendant next argues the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to suppress statements obtained in violation of his\n\nMiranda rights.       We review the district court’s legal conclusions\n\non a motion to suppress de novo and its factual findings for clear\n\nerror.    United States v.

Lopez, 380 F.3d at\n\n546.\n\n            The district court did not err in denying Defendant’s\n\nmotion to suppress the incriminating statements he made to Officer\n\nJohansen regarding possession of the firearms. Defendant was under\n\narrest and therefore “in custody” when he made the challenged\n\nstatements. Defendant, however, was never interrogated and Miranda\n\nwarnings were not required.            The district court found Officer\n\nJohansen’s testimony at the suppression hearing credible.                 We are\n\nextremely    deferential      to     the    district   court’s       credibility\n\ndeterminations.       United States v.

Officer   Johansen     testified   he    never   questioned\n\nDefendant regarding his possession of the firearms.                    Further,\n\nOfficer Johansen testified that he informed Defendant not to make\n\nany statements to him when Defendant began voluntarily supplying\n\ninformation regarding his possession of the firearms. As a result,\n\nany    statements    Defendant     made    to   Johansen,    incriminating      or\n\notherwise, were not in response to direct questioning or the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffunctional equivalent of direct questioning.

Therefore, Miranda warnings were not required.\n\n                                           C.\n\n               Finally, Defendant argues the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered\n\nevidence.
