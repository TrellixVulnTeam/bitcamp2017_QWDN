Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Fusté,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Carolyn A.

Cloherty, III, with whom Pierce, Davis & Perritano,\nLLP, was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              June 27, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        The Association of Community\n\nOrganizations for Reform Now (\"ACORN\") sued the Town of East\n\nGreenwich, Rhode Island (the \"Town\"), seeking an injunction to\n\nprohibit the Town from requiring parties who planned to engage in\n\ndoor-to-door solicitation of money to obtain a permit, and barring\n\nall solicitations of money from 7:00 P.M. until 9:00 P.M.1            After\n\na one-day evidentiary hearing, the district court denied ACORN's\n\nrequest for a preliminary injunction.\n\n            The only issue before us is whether the district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying ACORN's request for a preliminary\n\ninjunction, which is an interlocutory order. See Diálogo, LLC v.\n\nSantiago-Bauzá, 425 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2005).         A district court's\n\ndecision whether to grant a preliminary injunction is guided by the\n\nconsideration of four factors: \"(1) the likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm [to the movant]\n\nif   the   injunction   is   denied;   (3)    the   balance   of   relevant\n\nimpositions, i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as\n\ncontrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues;\n\nand (4) the effect (if any) of the court's ruling on the public\n\ninterest.\"    Esso Std. Oil Co. v. Monroig-Zayas, 445 F.3d 13, 18\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The Town's ordinance actually extends the prohibition on door-\nto-door soliciting until 9:00 A.M. However, ACORN challenged the\nordinance only inasmuch as it prohibited soliciting earlier than\n9:00 P.M.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f(1st Cir. 2006) (alteration in original) (quoting Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y\n\nv. City of Boston, 378 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n             We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the preliminary injunction.                     The factual\n\nrecord in this case is thin: the evidentiary hearing lasted only\n\none   day,   and    each   side   presented     the    testimony     of    only     two\n\nwitnesses.      While      we   recognize     that   the   quantum    of     evidence\n\nnecessary to prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction may\n\nvary, in this particular case, we conclude that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in determining that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to show that ACORN would likely succeed on the merits.\n\nSee Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y, 378 F.3d at 14 (\"[T]his is a close and\n\ndifficult case. The district court, however, dealt with matters at\n\nfirst hand and concluded that the appellant had not shown a\n\nlikelihood     of   success      on   the   merits.\").        In    reaching       this\n\nconclusion, we do not endorse the reasoning of the district court,\n\nwhich appeared to reject ACORN's First Amendment claims on the\n\nmerits.      Cf. Asociación de Educación Privada de P.R., Inc. v.\n\nEchevarría-Vargas, 385 F.3d 81, 86 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that\n\ndismissal    was    inappropriate      in   light     of   \"the    absence    of    any\n\nevidence about the nature and weight of the burdens imposed and the\n\nnature and strength of the government's justifications\").                           On\n\nremand, the court would be assisted by further development of the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffacts, both as to the justifications for the ordinance and the\n\nburdens it imposes.\n\n              The ordinance at issue in this case, by its own terms,\n\napplies only to door-to-door solicitation of funds; it does not\n\nappear   to    regulate    canvassers      who    simply     seek   to    advocate   a\n\nposition without seeking a donation.                 The Supreme Court's most\n\nrecent decision on this issue recognized the \"historical importance\n\nof door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering as vehicles for the\n\ndissemination of ideas,\" but also noted that a state may have some\n\ninterest      in   regulating      such   conduct,    \"particularly        when   the\n\nsolicitation of money is involved.\" Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y\n\nof N.Y., Inc. v. Vill. of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150, 162 (2002).                     The\n\nSupreme Court expressly declined to elucidate a standard of review\n\nto be applied to restrictions that apply to door-to-door canvassing\n\nor   solicitation,      id.   at    164,    but    subsequent       decisions     have\n\nsuggested     that   the   appropriate      test     might    be    one   resembling\n\nintermediate scrutiny.          See, e.g., Parks v. Finan, 385 F.3d 694,\n\n703 (6th Cir. 2004) (requiring that a scheme requiring permits to\n\nhand out pamphlets at the state capitol must be \"narrowly tailored\n\nto the government's interest\"); SEIU, Local 3 v. Municipality of\n\nMt. Lebanon, 446 F.3d 419, 425 (3d Cir. 2006) (\"[T]o the extent\n\nthat the ordinance 'is not tailored to the [municipality's] stated\n\ninterest,' there is a commensurate reduction in the municipality's\n\ninterest in its enforcement.\" (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fWatchtower, 536 U.S. at 168)).                 Of course, the application of\n\nintermediate     scrutiny   is    dependent       on     whether   the     challenged\n\nregulation is content-neutral, a fact that appears to be in dispute\n\nin this case.     If the ordinance at issue is content-based, strict\n\nscrutiny would likely apply.           See Turner Broad. Sys. v. FCC, 512\n\nU.S. 622, 642 (1994) (\"Our precedents . . . apply the most exacting\n\nscrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose\n\ndifferential burdens upon speech because of its content.\").\n\n           The Town argues that the challenged ordinance satisfies\n\nintermediate     scrutiny      because    it     helps    to   combat      fraudulent\n\nsolicitations, reduces overall crime rates, and protects residents'\n\nprivacy.        ACORN   argues    that     the     ordinance       fails    to     meet\n\nintermediate scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve these goals, and that in any case, it excessively burdens\n\nACORN's ability to convey its message and solicit donations.\n\nWhether the challenged ordinance advances the town's interests or\n\nexcessively burdens ACORN's ability to speak are questions that are\n\nheavily dependent on factual determinations, and are therefore\n\ndifficult to answer at this stage in the litigation.                 At a minimum,\n\nthe Town has offered sufficient evidence to call into question the\n\nplaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n           We    also   note    that     there    are     issues   that     were    not\n\nexpressly presented to the district court in the motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, but which may raise additional areas for\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\finquiry on remand.     First, there may be discrepancies between what\n\nthe ordinance says on its face and how it is applied.         For example,\n\nthere was testimony at the hearing that it ordinarily takes only\n\ntwo days to obtain a permit, which appears to be in conflict with\n\nthe ordinance's requirement that a permit be applied for five days\n\nin advance of solicitation.         Whilst the ordinance provides for a\n\npermit fee of $10 per day, testimony at the evidentiary hearing\n\nindicates that groups were charged a one-time fee of $10.            These\n\ndiscrepancies may bear on the ultimate question of whether the\n\nordinance is narrowly tailored to meet a legitimate state interest.\n\n          Second,    there    was   some   evidence   presented   that   the\n\npermitting scheme was enforced in a discriminatory manner based on\n\nthe identity of the speaker.2        There was testimony that religious\n\norganizations may not need a permit even if they solicit donations.\n\nFurthermore,   there    was    testimony    that   scouting   and   school\n\norganizations have never applied for a permit, although there was\n\nno testimony presented on whether such organizations had solicited\n\nwithout permits.     These were not the primary bases for relief\n\nsought at the preliminary injunction hearing, and we leave it to\n\n\n\n2\n   We express no opinion at this time as to the argument that\n\"solicitation speech,\" i.e., conveying a message that a donation is\nrequested, can be distinguished from the actual act of\nsolicitation, i.e., the conduct of receiving a monetary or in-kind\ndonation. Cf. ISKCON of Potomac, Inc. v. Kennedy, 61 F.3d 949, 954\n(D.C. Cir. 1995) (upholding a prohibition on solicitation in a park\nwhere the National Park Service interpreted solicitation \"to\ninclude only an in-person request for immediate payment.\").\n\n                                     -6-\n\fACORN to decide whether to press such issues on a motion for a\n\npermanent injunction.3\n\n             The issues in this case are difficult, and the Supreme\n\nCourt has not provided clear guidance. Moreover, what guidance the\n\nSupreme Court has provided suggests that this particular scenario,\n\nof   mixed   political   speech   and   solicitation   of   donations,    is\n\nprecisely the sort that may turn on factual issues.           Under those\n\ncircumstances,    further   facts   should   be   developed   before     the\n\nconstitutional issues can be resolved.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Cf. Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now,\n(\"ACORN\") v. Golden, 744 F.2d 739, 749 (10th Cir. 1984) (\"Golden's\nordinance, however, is not content neutral. The ordinance permits\nexemptions for organizations or individuals if the purpose of the\nsolicitation is for a charitable, religious, patriotic or\nphilanthropic purpose, or otherwise provides a service so necessary\nfor the resident's general welfare that it does not constitute a\nnuisance. This approach contemplates a distinction based on\ncontent.\").\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1994) (\"Our precedents . . . apply the most exacting\n\nscrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose\n\ndifferential burdens upon speech because of its content.\").\n\n           The Town argues that the challenged ordinance satisfies\n\nintermediate     scrutiny      because    it     helps    to   combat      fraudulent\n\nsolicitations, reduces overall crime rates, and protects residents'\n\nprivacy.        ACORN   argues    that     the     ordinance       fails    to     meet\n\nintermediate scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored to\n\nachieve these goals, and that in any case, it excessively burdens\n\nACORN's ability to convey its message and solicit donations.\n\nWhether the challenged ordinance advances the town's interests or\n\nexcessively burdens ACORN's ability to speak are questions that are\n\nheavily dependent on factual determinations, and are therefore\n\ndifficult to answer at this stage in the litigation.                 At a minimum,\n\nthe Town has offered sufficient evidence to call into question the\n\nplaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n           We    also   note    that     there    are     issues   that     were    not\n\nexpressly presented to the district court in the motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, but which may raise additional areas for\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\finquiry on remand.     First, there may be discrepancies between what\n\nthe ordinance says on its face and how it is applied.         For example,\n\nthere was testimony at the hearing that it ordinarily takes only\n\ntwo days to obtain a permit, which appears to be in conflict with\n\nthe ordinance's requirement that a permit be applied for five days\n\nin advance of solicitation.         Whilst the ordinance provides for a\n\npermit fee of $10 per day, testimony at the evidentiary hearing\n\nindicates that groups were charged a one-time fee of $10.            These\n\ndiscrepancies may bear on the ultimate question of whether the\n\nordinance is narrowly tailored to meet a legitimate state interest.\n\n          Second,    there    was   some   evidence   presented   that   the\n\npermitting scheme was enforced in a discriminatory manner based on\n\nthe identity of the speaker.2        There was testimony that religious\n\norganizations may not need a permit even if they solicit donations.\n\nFurthermore,   there    was    testimony    that   scouting   and   school\n\norganizations have never applied for a permit, although there was\n\nno testimony presented on whether such organizations had solicited\n\nwithout permits.     These were not the primary bases for relief\n\nsought at the preliminary injunction hearing, and we leave it to\n\n\n\n2\n   We express no opinion at this time as to the argument that\n\"solicitation speech,\" i.e., conveying a message that a donation is\nrequested, can be distinguished from the actual act of\nsolicitation, i.e., the conduct of receiving a monetary or in-kind\ndonation.
