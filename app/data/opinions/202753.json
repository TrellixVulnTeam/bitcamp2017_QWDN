Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Sanchez-Maceira, by appointment of the court, on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief,\nAppellate Division), Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States\nAttorney, and on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          May 23, 2007\n\f          SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.            In this criminal appeal,\n\nthe defendant challenges both her conviction (on the ground of\n\ninstructional   error)    and   her    sentence    (on    the   ground   of   a\n\nguidelines-related error).      After a thorough review of the record\n\nand the applicable law, we affirm the defendant's conviction but\n\nvacate her sentence.     The tale follows.\n\n          We begin with the denouement.              In April of 2005, a\n\nfederal grand jury charged defendant-appellant Altagracia Ramos-\n\nPaulino with attempted transport and concealment of illegal aliens,\n\nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1), and trafficking in false identification\n\ndocuments, see 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(2).       These charges stemmed from\n\nher involvement with Rafael Cintrón-Brea (Cintrón), a defrocked\n\npolice officer who became a government informant after pleading\n\nguilty to an alien-smuggling charge.\n\n          The pertinent facts are as follows.            The defendant first\n\nmet Cintrón in 2003.     While she piously protests that they did not\n\npool their efforts to transport illegal aliens until January of\n\n2005, Cintrón says that they collogued together from the start. We\n\nneed not resolve this conflict; for present purposes, it suffices\n\nthat, by all accounts, the joint enterprise was velivolant no later\n\nthan January of 2005.      An event that is crucial to this appeal\n\noccurred at that time: Cintrón reassured the defendant that,\n\nnotwithstanding his earlier arrest (of which she had recently\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fbecome aware), she would not be brought to book for the criminal\n\nactivities that the two of them were planning to undertake.\n\n            This brings us to the offense conduct.              Between January\n\nand April of 2005, Cintrón and the defendant arranged the transport\n\nof four illegal aliens.         The defendant was the principal contact\n\nfor the aliens.      With the assistance of a man named Domingo, she\n\ngathered information about them, collected payments from them, and\n\nobtained    false   identification     documents    for     them.      She   then\n\ntransferred the money, the papers, and the aliens to Cintrón with\n\ndirections about which airline tickets should be purchased.\n\n            According to the plan, Cintrón was to purchase the\n\ntickets     and    escort   the    aliens    through      San    Juan's      major\n\ninternational airport, bypassing the usual security checkpoints.\n\nCintrón, however, was cooperating with the authorities, and the\n\ndefendant's activities led only to her arrest.                   An indictment\n\nfollowed.\n\n            Pretrial proceedings were unremarkable.             Cintrón was the\n\ngovernment's star witness at the trial.                At the close of the\n\nevidence,    the    defendant     renewed   her   earlier    request      for   an\n\nentrapment instruction, claiming that Cintrón's assurances had\n\ninduced her to participate in the criminal venture.                 The district\n\ncourt refused to instruct on entrapment, and the jury found the\n\ndefendant guilty on all counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           The district court continued the case for sentencing and\n\nordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport).   The court convened the disposition hearing on April 25,\n\n2006.    In making its guideline computations, the court adopted a\n\nrecommendation put forth in the PSI Report and applied a two-level\n\nenhancement based on the defendant's role in the offenses of\n\nconviction.   See USSG §3B1.1(c).   The adjusted offense level, when\n\ncombined with the defendant's criminal history category, yielded a\n\nguideline sentencing range of 15-21 months. The court proceeded to\n\nimpose a sentence at the top of the range: 21 months.   This timely\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n           The defendant's claim of instructional error is easily\n\ndispatched. She argues that she was entitled to a jury instruction\n\non entrapment because that was her main theory of defense and the\n\nrecord contained adequate evidence to support it. We do not agree.\n\n           It is often said that a criminal defendant is entitled to\n\nhave the jury instructed on her theory of the case.        But that\n\naphorism is not a universal truth: to warrant a jury instruction on\n\na specific theory of defense, the evidence adduced at trial, taken\n\nin the light most flattering to the accused, must plausibly support\n\nthe theory.   See United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f            Where, as here, a criminal defendant seasonably requests\n\nan instruction on a particular theory of the case and the trial\n\ncourt flatly refuses to submit that theory to the jury, our review\n\nis plenary.   See United States v. Nishnianidze, 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 812.         This strain of appellate\n\nreview does not permit differential factfinding but, rather, turns\n\nupon an inquiry into the sufficiency of the evidence in the case.\n\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d at 812.     The burden is on the defendant, as the\n\nproponent of the theory, to identify evidence adduced during the\n\ntrial that suffices to satisfy this standard.          See id. at 814.\n\n            We have had occasion to apply this framework to efforts\n\nto deploy an entrapment defense.         When that defense is in issue,\n\nthe test of evidentiary sufficiency has two facets.               See United\n\nStates v. Capelton, 350 F.3d 231, 242 (1st Cir. 2003).            To warrant\n\nan instruction on entrapment, the evidence must be sufficient to\n\nsupport both a finding that the government wrongfully induced the\n\nunlawful   conduct   and   a   finding   that   the   defendant    lacked    a\n\npredisposition to engage in that conduct. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994); Rodriguez, 858 F.2d\n\nat 814.    The defendant cannot pass this binary test.\n\n            Here, the claim of inducement rests exclusively on the\n\nJanuary 2005 conversation between Cintrón and the defendant.                As\n\nthe defendant envisions it, Cintrón lured her into committing the\n\ncrime by assuring her that \"nothing could happen to her because he\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwas a Police Officer.\"         Appellant's Br. at 11.              In our view,\n\nhowever, this solitary piece of evidence leaves the defendant well\n\nshort of the finish line.\n\n            We repeatedly have held that the simple solicitation of\n\na criminal act or the mere provision of an opportunity to engage in\n\none does not meet the threshold requirement for a finding of\n\nwrongful    inducement.      See,    e.g.,   Capelton,      350    F.3d     at    243;\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d at 468.             Empty promises that a crime, once\n\ncommitted, will produce no adverse repercussions fall into the same\n\ncategory.      Telling a person that she will not be caught does not\n\nlead her to believe that the conduct is lawful or that she will be\n\nin jeopardy if she refuses to go along; it is, rather, simply a way\n\nof making the opportunity to commit the crime more attractive.\n\nSuch promises, therefore, are not the stuff of which inducement can\n\nbe fashioned. See United States v. Evans, 924 F.2d 714, 717 (7th\n\nCir.   1991)    (stating    that    inducement      will   lie    only     when    the\n\ngovernment offers the \"sorts of promises that would blind the\n\nordinary person to his legal duties\"); cf. United States v. Davis,\n\n15 F.3d 902, 909 (9th Cir. 1994) (explaining that law enforcement\n\nofficers \"are not precluded from utilizing artifice and stealth\" to\n\napprehend      criminals,     provided       that     \"they       merely     afford\n\nopportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense by\n\none predisposed or ready to commit it\").                   Inducement requires\n\nsomething more — something akin to excessive pressure, threats, or\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe exploitation of an unfair advantage.                See United States v.\n\nLuisi, 482 F.3d 43, 58 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Gendron,\n\n18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994) (Breyer, C.J.).\n\n            In   this   instance,     the    defendant's       version     of    her\n\nconversation with Cintrón is uncontradicted.                Taking what was said\n\nat face value, a finding of inducement simply will not lie.                      On\n\nthat basis alone, the district court's unwillingness to instruct on\n\nentrapment was entirely appropriate.1\n\n            We turn next to the defendant's claim of sentencing\n\nerror.   The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005), rendered the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines    advisory.      This   does     not    mean,    however,     that   the\n\nguidelines    are   irrelevant   in    the    post-Booker      world.       To   the\n\ncontrary,    they   remain    the     starting      point    for   most    federal\n\nsentencing determinations.          See United States v. Pelletier, 469\n\nF.3d 194, 203 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct.\n\n928 (2007).      When an error in the calculation of a defendant's\n\nguideline range affects or arguably affects the sentence imposed,\n\nthat error will require resentencing.              See United States v. Gobbi,\n\n\n     1\n      Because the absence of any significantly probative evidence\nof inducement is dispositive of the claim of instructional error,\nwe need not address the state of the record vis-à-vis\npredisposition.   See Capelton, 350 F.3d at 242-43 (\"Given the\ndisjunctive nature of the [entrapment] test, we can fulfill our\nappellate function by elaborating our disagreement on either\ninducement or predisposition.\").\n\n                                       -7-\n\f471   F.3d    302,    313       &    n.7    (1st      Cir.   2006);   United    States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 81 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             We review a sentencing court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror.     See United States v. Misla-Aldarondo, 478 F.3d 52, 70 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 200-01 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     We afford de novo review, however, to questions of law\n\ninvolved in sentencing determinations.                       See United States v. Pho,\n\n433 F.3d 53, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2006).                     A question about whether the\n\nevidence      is     sufficient            to   support      a   particular     guideline\n\ndetermination is a question of law and, therefore, engenders de\n\nnovo review.          See Dixon, 449 F.3d at 200; United States v.\n\nCarrasco-Mateo, 389 F.3d 239, 243 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             In the case at hand, the defendant makes a rifle-shot\n\nobjection to one part of the lower court's sentencing algorithm.\n\nThis objection takes dead aim at the court's embrace of a two-level\n\nupward adjustment for role in the offense recommended in the PSI\n\nReport.      The operative guideline provision applies to a defendant\n\nwho   is   shown     by     a       preponderance       of   the   evidence     to   be   an\n\n\"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" of between one and five\n\nother participants in the crime of conviction. USSG §3B1.1(c); see\n\nUnited States v. Tejada Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 110 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             The     defendant's           argument      centers   on   the    paucity    of\n\nevidence that she organized, led, managed, or supervised any other\n\nparticipant in the criminal enterprise. Because the district court\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fdid not base the enhancement on specific findings as to whom the\n\ndefendant may have organized, led, managed, or supervised, we have\n\nsearched the record (including the PSI Report) in an endeavor to\n\nidentify any such underlings.\n\n             We have come up dry. The district court indicated at one\n\npoint its belief that the defendant oversaw Cintrón.              Even if that\n\nwere true — and the record is murky on the point — such a finding\n\ncould    not   sustain     the     enhancement.      For   purposes      of   the\n\n\"participant\" requirement of section 3B1.1(c), Cintrón (who was\n\nacting undercover in 2005 as part of a government sting operation)\n\ndoes not count. Neither a government agent nor anyone acting under\n\nthe direction of a government agent qualifies as a \"participant\"\n\nfor purposes of a role-in-the-offense enhancement. See USSG §3B1.1\n\ncmt. n.1; see, e.g., United States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 679\n\n(7th Cir. 2000); United States v. King, 21 F.3d 1302, 1304-05 (3d\n\nCir. 1994).     By the same token, the aliens themselves cannot be\n\ndeemed   participants      for   this   purpose.     See   United   States    v.\n\nThiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2003); see also USSG § 2L1.1\n\ncmt. n.2.2\n\n             Beyond the defendant's relationship with Cintrón and her\n\ndealings     with   the   aliens    themselves,    there   is   little   if   any\n\n\n     2\n      It is conceivable, of course, that the aliens might qualify\nas participants for the purpose of a role-in-the-offense\nenhancement with respect to the \"false document\" count.        See\nThiongo, 344 F.3d at 62-63. Here, however, the district court made\nno findings to that effect.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fevidence indicating that she organized, led, managed, or supervised\n\nany other participant.         Although she worked hand in glove with the\n\nmysterious Domingo, there is nothing to show either that he was her\n\nsubordinate in the chain of command or that she oversaw his\n\nactivities.\n\n           The absence of any such evidence is puzzling, but the\n\nrecord contains a likely explanation. In fashioning the managerial\n\nrole enhancement, the district court seems to have gone in a\n\ndifferent direction.       For aught that appears, the court based the\n\nenhancement    primarily       on   the   defendant's    control       over   the\n\nactivities    of   the    criminal     enterprise   rather     than    over   any\n\nparticipants in it.\n\n           To justify this focus, the court pointed to language in\n\nthe guidelines discussing \"a defendant who did not organize, lead,\n\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless\n\nexercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or\n\nactivities of a criminal organization.\"             USSG §3B1.1 cmt. n.2.\n\nThat   description,      the   court   said,   \"fit[]   very    well    to    this\n\ndefendant's role.\"         Elaborating, the court observed that the\n\ndefendant was the principal contact for the smuggled aliens, that\n\nshe was apparently responsible for determining fees and accepting\n\npayments, that she procured the false identification documents, and\n\nthat she had some influence over the scheduling of the transports.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          We appreciate the district court's concern.   The problem\n\nwith this approach, however, is that the very application note\n\ncited by the court makes it pellucid that the management of\n\ncriminal activities (as opposed to the management of criminal\n\nactors) may ground an upward departure but not an upward role-in-\n\nthe-offense adjustment. See id. Although both may lead to similar\n\noutcomes, there is an important structural distinction between\n\nsentencing enhancements and sentencing departures.       See United\n\nStates v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 576-79 (1st Cir. 1996); see also USSG\n\n§1B1.1 cmt. n.1(E) (defining departures generally).     For present\n\npurposes, then, we are constrained by the unambiguous case law\n\nholding that management of criminal activities, standing alone,\n\ndoes not constitute a basis for a role-in-the-offense enhancement\n\nunder section 3B1.1. See, e.g., United States v. Harness, 180 F.3d\n\n1232, 1235 (11th Cir. 1999); Cali, 87 F.3d at 876-79; United States\n\nv. Greenfield, 44 F.3d 1141, 1146 (2d Cir. 1995).     Consequently,\n\nthe district court erred in upwardly adjusting the defendant's\n\noffense level on the basis of section 3B1.1(c).\n\n          Even under an advisory guidelines regime, the sentencing\n\ncourt is obliged to calculate the guideline range correctly.    See\n\nGobbi, 471 F.3d at 313 & n.7.   An accurate calculation of the range\n\nis particularly important where, as here, the district court\n\nsentences the defendant at the range's apex.   Accordingly, we have\n\nno principled choice but to vacate the defendant's sentence and\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fremand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.                 We leave\n\nopen the full gamut of possibilities — for example, the district\n\ncourt, if it can identify a participant or participants under the\n\ndefendant's sway, may reimpose the managerial role enhancement; or\n\nit   may   essay   an   upward    departure   for   management   of   criminal\n\nactivities; or it may simply eschew any further embellishments and\n\nimpose what it deems to be a reasonable sentence.           We take no view\n\neither as to the course to be followed or as to the duration of the\n\nsentence to be imposed.          In the first instance, these are matters\n\nfor the sentencing court.\n\n            We need go no further.

After a thorough review of the record and the applicable law, we affirm the defendant's conviction but vacate her sentence. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the denouement. In April of 2005, a federal grand jury charged defendant-appellant Altagracia Ramos-Paulino with attempted transport and concealment of illegal aliens, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1324(a)(1), and trafficking in false identification documents, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(2). These charges stemmed from her involvement with Rafael Cintr&#243;n-Brea (Cintr&#243;n), a defrocked police officer who became a government informant after pleading guilty to an alien-smuggling charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts are as follows. The defendant first met Cintr&#243;n in 2003. While she piously protests that they did not pool their efforts to transport illegal aliens until January of 2005, Cintr&#243;n says that they collogued together from the start. We need not resolve this conflict; for present purposes, it suffices that, by all accounts, the joint enterprise was velivolant no later than January of 2005. An event that is crucial to this appeal occurred at that time: Cintr&#243;n reassured the defendant that, notwithstanding his earlier arrest (of which she had recently become aware), she would not be brought to book for the criminal activities that the two of them were planning to undertake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the offense conduct. Between January and April of 2005, Cintr&#243;n and the defendant arranged the transport of four illegal aliens. The defendant was the principal contact for the aliens. With the assistance of a man named Domingo, she gathered information about them, collected payments from them, and obtained false identification documents for them. She then transferred the money, the papers, and the aliens to Cintr&#243;n with directions about which airline tickets should be purchased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the plan, Cintr&#243;n was to purchase the tickets and escort the aliens through San Juan's major international airport, bypassing the usual security checkpoints. Cintr&#243;n, however, was cooperating with the authorities, and the defendant's activities led only to her arrest. An indictment followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial proceedings were unremarkable. Cintr&#243;n was the government's star witness at the trial. At the close of the evidence, the defendant renewed her earlier request for an entrapment instruction, claiming that Cintr&#243;n's assurances had induced her to participate in the criminal venture. The district court refused to instruct on entrapment, and the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court continued the case for sentencing and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). The court convened the disposition hearing on April 25, 2006. In making its guideline computations, the court adopted a recommendation put forth in the PSI Report and applied a two-level enhancement based on the defendant's role in the offenses of conviction. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.1(c). The adjusted offense level, when combined with the defendant's criminal history category, yielded a guideline sentencing range of 15-21 months. The court proceeded to impose a sentence at the top of the range: 21 months. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's claim of instructional error is easily dispatched. She argues that she was entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment because that was her main theory of defense and the record contained adequate evidence to support it. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is often said that a criminal defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on her theory of the case. But that aphorism is not a universal truth: to warrant a jury instruction on a specific theory of defense, the evidence adduced at trial, taken in the light most flattering to the accused, must <i>plausibly</i> support the theory. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a criminal defendant seasonably requests an instruction on a particular theory of the case and the trial court flatly refuses to submit that theory to the jury, our review is plenary. <i>See United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 812. This strain of appellate review does not permit differential factfinding but, rather, turns upon an inquiry into the sufficiency of the evidence in the case. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 812. The burden is on the defendant, as the proponent of the theory, to identify evidence adduced during the trial that suffices to satisfy this standard. <i>See id.</i> at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have had occasion to apply this framework to efforts to deploy an entrapment defense. When that defense is in issue, the test of evidentiary sufficiency has two facets. <i>See United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 242 (1st Cir.2003). To warrant an instruction on entrapment, the evidence must be sufficient to support both a finding that the government wrongfully induced the unlawful conduct and a finding that the defendant lacked a predisposition to engage in that conduct. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 814. The defendant cannot pass this binary test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the claim of inducement rests exclusively on the January 2005 conversation between Cintr&#243;n and the defendant. As the defendant envisions it, Cintr&#243;n lured her into committing the crime by assuring her that \"nothing could happen to her because he was a Police Officer.\" Appellant's Br. at 11. In our view, however, this solitary piece of evidence leaves the defendant well short of the finish line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeatedly have held that the simple solicitation of a criminal act or the mere provision of an opportunity to engage in one does not meet the threshold requirement for a finding of wrongful inducement. <i>See, e.g., Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 243; <i>Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d at 468. Empty promises that a crime, once committed, will produce no adverse repercussions fall into the same category. Telling a person that she will not be caught does not lead her to believe that the conduct is lawful or that she will be in jeopardy if she refuses to go along; it is, rather, simply a way of making the opportunity to commit the crime more attractive. Such promises, therefore, are not the stuff of which inducement can be fashioned. <i>See United States v. Evans,</i> 924 F.2d 714, 717 (7th Cir.1991) (stating that inducement will lie only when the government offers the \"sorts of promises that would blind the ordinary person to his legal duties\"); <i>cf. United States v. Davis,</i> 15 F.3d 902, 909 (9th Cir.1994) (explaining that law enforcement officers \"are not precluded from utilizing artifice and stealth\" to apprehend criminals, provided that \"they merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense by one predisposed or ready to commit it\"). Inducement requires something more&#8212;something akin to excessive pressure, threats, or the exploitation of an unfair advantage. <i>See United States v. Luisi,</i> 482 F.3d 43, 58 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>United States v. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1994) (Breyer, C.J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the defendant's version of her conversation with Cintr&#243;n is uncontradicted. Taking what was said at face value, a finding of inducement simply will not lie. On that basis alone, the district court's unwillingness to instruct on entrapment was entirely appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the defendant's claim of sentencing error. The Supreme Court's landmark decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the federal sentencing guidelines advisory. This does not mean, however, that the guidelines are irrelevant in the post-<i>Booker</i> world. To the contrary, they remain the starting point for most federal sentencing determinations. <i>See United States v. Pelletier,</i> 469 F.3d 194, 203 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 928, 166 L.Ed.2d 715 (2007). When an error in the calculation of a defendant's guideline range affects or arguably affects the sentence imposed, that error will require resentencing. <i>See United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 313 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 81 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a sentencing court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>See United States v. Misla-Aldarondo,</i> 478 F.3d 52, 70 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 200-01 (1st Cir.2006). We afford de novo review, however, to questions of law involved in sentencing determinations. <i>See United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 60-61 (1st Cir.2006). A question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and, therefore, engenders de novo review. <i>See Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d at 200; <i>United States v. Carrasco-Mateo,</i> 389 F.3d 239, 243 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the defendant makes a rifle-shot objection to one part of the lower court's sentencing algorithm. This objection takes dead aim at the court's embrace of a two-level upward adjustment for role in the offense recommended in the PSI Report. The operative guideline provision applies to a defendant who is shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" of between one and five other participants in the crime of conviction. USSG &#167; 3B1.1(c); <i>see United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105, 110 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's argument centers on the paucity of evidence that she organized, led, managed, or supervised any other participant in the criminal enterprise. Because the district court did not base the enhancement on specific findings as to whom the defendant may have organized, led, managed, or supervised, we have searched the record (including the PSI Report) in an endeavor to identify any such underlings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come up dry. The district court indicated at one point its belief that the defendant oversaw Cintr&#243;n. Even if that were true &#8212; and the record is murky on the point &#8212; such a finding could not sustain the enhancement. For purposes of the \"participant\" requirement of section 3B1.1(c), Cintr&#243;n (who was acting undercover in 2005 as part of a government sting operation) does not count. Neither a government agent nor anyone acting under the direction of a government agent qualifies as a \"participant\" for purposes of a role-in-the-offense enhancement. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1; <i>see, e.g., United States v. Andreas,</i> 216 F.3d 645, 679 (7th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. King,</i> 21 F.3d 1302, 1304-05 (3d Cir.1994). By the same token, the aliens themselves cannot be deemed participants for this purpose. <i>See United States v. Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 2L1.1 cmt. n. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the defendant's relationship with Cintr&#243;n and her dealings with the aliens themselves, there is little if any evidence indicating that she organized, led, managed, or supervised any other participant. Although she worked hand in glove with the mysterious Domingo, there is nothing to show either that he was her subordinate in the chain of command or that she oversaw his activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of any such evidence is puzzling, but the record contains a likely explanation. In fashioning the managerial role enhancement, the district court seems to have gone in a different direction. For aught that appears, the court based the enhancement primarily on the defendant's control over the <i>activities</i> of the criminal enterprise rather than over any <i>participants</i> in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To justify this focus, the court pointed to language in the guidelines discussing \"a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.\" USSG &#167; 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2. That description, the court said, \"fit[ ] very well to this defendant's role.\" Elaborating, the court observed that the defendant was the principal contact for the smuggled aliens, that she was apparently responsible for determining fees and accepting payments, that she procured the false identification documents, and that she had some influence over the scheduling of the transports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appreciate the district court's concern. The problem with this approach, however, is that the very application note cited by the court makes it pellucid that the management of criminal activities (as opposed to the management of criminal actors) may ground an upward departure but not an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment. <i>See id.</i> Although both may lead to similar outcomes, there is an important structural distinction between sentencing enhancements and sentencing departures. <i>See United States v. Cali,</i> 87 F.3d 571, 576-79 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (defining departures generally). For present purposes, then, we are constrained by the unambiguous case law holding that management of criminal activities, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for a role-in-the-offense enhancement under section 3B1.1. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Harness,</i> 180 F.3d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.1999); <i>Cali,</i> 87 F.3d at 576-79; <i>United States v. Greenfield,</i> 44 F.3d 1141, 1146 (2d Cir. 1995). Consequently, the district court erred in upwardly adjusting the defendant's offense level on the basis of section 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even under an advisory guidelines regime, the sentencing court is obliged to calculate the guideline range correctly. <i>See Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d at 313 &amp; n. 7. An accurate calculation of the range is particularly important where, as here, the district court sentences the defendant at the range's apex. Accordingly, we have no principled choice but to vacate the defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We leave open the full gamut of possibilities &#8212; for example, the district court, if it can identify a participant or participants under the defendant's sway, may reimpose the managerial role enhancement; or it may essay an upward departure for management of criminal activities; or it may simply eschew any further embellishments and impose what it deems to be a reasonable sentence. We take no view either as to the course to be followed or as to the duration of the sentence to be imposed. In the first instance, these are matters for the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the defendant's conviction, vacate her sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded for resentencing.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the absence of any significantly probative evidence of inducement is dispositive of the claim of instructional error, we need not address the state of the record vis-&#224;-vis predisposition<i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 242-43 (\"Given the disjunctive nature of the [entrapment] test, we can fulfill our appellate function by elaborating our disagreement on either inducement or predisposition.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is conceivable, of course, that the aliens might qualify as participants for the purpose of a role-in-the-offense enhancement with respect to the \"false document\" count<i>See Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d at 62-63.

But that aphorism is not a universal truth: to warrant a jury instruction on a specific theory of defense, the evidence adduced at trial, taken in the light most flattering to the accused, must <i>plausibly</i> support the theory. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v.

Nishnianidze,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200612\"><a href=\"/opinion/200612/united-states-v-nishniandze/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 812. This strain of appellate review does not permit differential factfinding but, rather, turns upon an inquiry into the sufficiency of the evidence in the case. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 812. The burden is on the defendant, as the proponent of the theory, to identify evidence adduced during the trial that suffices to satisfy this standard. <i>See id.</i> at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have had occasion to apply this framework to efforts to deploy an entrapment defense. When that defense is in issue, the test of evidentiary sufficiency has two facets. <i>See United States v. Capelton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200745\"><a href=\"/opinion/200745/united-states-v-capelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 242 (1st Cir.2003). To warrant an instruction on entrapment, the evidence must be sufficient to support both a finding that the government wrongfully induced the unlawful conduct and a finding that the defendant lacked a predisposition to engage in that conduct. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gifford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 468 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d at 814.

As the defendant envisions it, Cintr&#243;n lured her into committing the crime by assuring her that \"nothing could happen to her because he was a Police Officer.\" Appellant's Br. at 11. In our view, however, this solitary piece of evidence leaves the defendant well short of the finish line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeatedly have held that the simple solicitation of a criminal act or the mere provision of an opportunity to engage in one does not meet the threshold requirement for a finding of wrongful inducement. <i>See, e.g., Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 243; <i>Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d at 468. Empty promises that a crime, once committed, will produce no adverse repercussions fall into the same category. Telling a person that she will not be caught does not lead her to believe that the conduct is lawful or that she will be in jeopardy if she refuses to go along; it is, rather, simply a way of making the opportunity to commit the crime more attractive. Such promises, therefore, are not the stuff of which inducement can be fashioned. <i>See United States v. Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555107\"><a href=\"/opinion/555107/united-states-v-dean-a-evans-and-eric-k-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 717 (7th Cir.1991) (stating that inducement will lie only when the government offers the \"sorts of promises that would blind the ordinary person to his legal duties\"); <i>cf. United States v.

Inducement requires something more&#8212;something akin to excessive pressure, threats, or the exploitation of an unfair advantage. <i>See United States v. Luisi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202719\"><a href=\"/opinion/202719/united-states-v-luisi/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>United States v.

Taking what was said at face value, a finding of inducement simply will not lie. On that basis alone, the district court's unwillingness to instruct on entrapment was entirely appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the defendant's claim of sentencing error. The Supreme Court's landmark decision in <i>United States v.

When an error in the calculation of a defendant's guideline range affects or arguably affects the sentence imposed, that error will require resentencing. <i>See United States v.

A question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and, therefore, engenders de novo review. <i>See Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d at 200; <i>United States v. Carrasco-Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201345\"><a href=\"/opinion/201345/united-states-v-carrasco-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the defendant makes a rifle-shot objection to one part of the lower court's sentencing algorithm. This objection takes dead aim at the court's embrace of a two-level upward adjustment for role in the offense recommended in the PSI Report. The operative guideline provision applies to a defendant who is shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be an \"organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" of between one and five other participants in the crime of conviction. USSG &#167; 3B1.1(c); <i>see United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's argument centers on the paucity of evidence that she organized, led, managed, or supervised any other participant in the criminal enterprise. Because the district court did not base the enhancement on specific findings as to whom the defendant may have organized, led, managed, or supervised, we have searched the record (including the PSI Report) in an endeavor to identify any such underlings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have come up dry. The district court indicated at one point its belief that the defendant oversaw Cintr&#243;n. Even if that were true &#8212; and the record is murky on the point &#8212; such a finding could not sustain the enhancement. For purposes of the \"participant\" requirement of section 3B1.1(c), Cintr&#243;n (who was acting undercover in 2005 as part of a government sting operation) does not count. Neither a government agent nor anyone acting under the direction of a government agent qualifies as a \"participant\" for purposes of a role-in-the-offense enhancement. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3B1.1 cmt. n. 1; <i>see, e.g., United States v. Andreas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769183\"><a href=\"/opinion/769183/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-michael-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 679 (7th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668225\"><a href=\"/opinion/668225/united-states-v-robert-l-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span>, 1304-05 (3d Cir.1994). By the same token, the aliens themselves cannot be deemed participants for this purpose. <i>See United States v. Thiongo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 2L1.1 cmt. n. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the defendant's relationship with Cintr&#243;n and her dealings with the aliens themselves, there is little if any evidence indicating that she organized, led, managed, or supervised any other participant. Although she worked hand in glove with the mysterious Domingo, there is nothing to show either that he was her subordinate in the chain of command or that she oversaw his activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of any such evidence is puzzling, but the record contains a likely explanation. In fashioning the managerial role enhancement, the district court seems to have gone in a different direction. For aught that appears, the court based the enhancement primarily on the defendant's control over the <i>activities</i> of the criminal enterprise rather than over any <i>participants</i> in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To justify this focus, the court pointed to language in the guidelines discussing \"a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.\" USSG &#167; 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2. That description, the court said, \"fit[ ] very well to this defendant's role.\" Elaborating, the court observed that the defendant was the principal contact for the smuggled aliens, that she was apparently responsible for determining fees and accepting payments, that she procured the false identification documents, and that she had some influence over the scheduling of the transports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appreciate the district court's concern. The problem with this approach, however, is that the very application note cited by the court makes it pellucid that the management of criminal activities (as opposed to the management of criminal actors) may ground an upward departure but not an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment. <i>See id.</i> Although both may lead to similar outcomes, there is an important structural distinction between sentencing enhancements and sentencing departures. <i>See United States v. Cali,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196836\"><a href=\"/opinion/196836/united-states-v-cali/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 576-79 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (defining departures generally). For present purposes, then, we are constrained by the unambiguous case law holding that management of criminal activities, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for a role-in-the-offense enhancement under section 3B1.1. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Harness,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></span>, 1235 (11th Cir.1999); <i>Cali,</i> 87 F.3d at 576-79; <i>United States v. Greenfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686729\"><a href=\"/opinion/686729/united-states-v-gerald-harvey-greenfield-also-known-as-david-f-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1146 (2d Cir. 1995). Consequently, the district court erred in upwardly adjusting the defendant's offense level on the basis of section 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even under an advisory guidelines regime, the sentencing court is obliged to calculate the guideline range correctly. <i>See Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d at 313 &amp; n. 7. An accurate calculation of the range is particularly important where, as here, the district court sentences the defendant at the range's apex. Accordingly, we have no principled choice but to vacate the defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion. We leave open the full gamut of possibilities &#8212; for example, the district court, if it can identify a participant or participants under the defendant's sway, may reimpose the managerial role enhancement; or it may essay an upward departure for management of criminal activities; or it may simply eschew any further embellishments and impose what it deems to be a reasonable sentence. We take no view either as to the course to be followed or as to the duration of the sentence to be imposed. In the first instance, these are matters for the sentencing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the defendant's conviction, vacate her sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded for resentencing.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the absence of any significantly probative evidence of inducement is dispositive of the claim of instructional error, we need not address the state of the record vis-&#224;-vis predisposition<i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 242-43 (\"Given the disjunctive nature of the [entrapment] test, we can fulfill our appellate function by elaborating our disagreement on either inducement or predisposition.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is conceivable, of course, that the aliens might qualify as participants for the purpose of a role-in-the-offense enhancement with respect to the \"false document\" count<i>See Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d at 62-63.
