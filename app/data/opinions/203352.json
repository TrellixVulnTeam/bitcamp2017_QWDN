Allen for petitioner.\n     Jesse M. Bless, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nUnited States Department of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, Civil Division, and David V. Bernal, Assistant\nDirector, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                            June 27, 2008\n\f            CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.             Petitioner Mohammad\n\nJamal, a native and citizen of Pakistan, seeks review of a March\n\n19, 2007 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\" or\n\n\"BIA\") affirming an immigration judge's denial of his application\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)\n\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158,\n\n1231(b)(3) and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\"),    1465   U.N.T.S.;     see    also   8   C.F.R.   §   208.18   (2006)\n\n(implementing the convention).          Jamal argues that his right to due\n\nprocess    was   violated   by   the    IJ's   conclusion   that   his   asylum\n\npetition was untimely filed, and he challenges the IJ's conclusion\n\nthat he was not subjected to past persecution and would not be\n\nlikely to suffer future persecution.           We deny the petition.\n\n                                       Facts\n\n            Jamal entered the United States on July 30, 2000.                On\n\nMarch 21, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") charged\n\nJamal with removability because he had stayed in the United States\n\nwithout authorization. Jamal conceded his removability but applied\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\nThe IJ denied his applications on August 9, 2005, and the Board\n\naffirmed that decision on March 19, 2007.\n\n            The following facts were developed at the IJ's hearing\n\nheld on August 9, 2005.      Jamal joined the Pakistani Muslim League-\n\nNawaz (\"PML-N\"), a political party which supported a movement\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\ftoward democracy, in 1973.        In 1998, according to Jamal, he was\n\nnamed secretary general of his village.           As secretary-general, he\n\nheld meetings, talked with party members, and recruited others to\n\njoin the PML-N.    For nine months of each year from 1973-2000, Jamal\n\nworked as a seaman.        When not at sea, he worked as a farmer and\n\nagriculturist. In October 1999, Pakistan's President Nawaz Sharif,\n\nwho was also the leader of the PML-N, removed the chief of the\n\narmy, General Pervez Musharraf.         Musharraf retaliated by fomenting\n\na successful military coup against Sharif and his cabinet.\n\n           On November 16, 1999, Jamal participated in a meeting\n\nadvocating     democracy   and   criticizing   Musharraf's     new   military\n\nregime.    During the meeting, the police beat Jamal and others\n\npresent.   Jamal testified that he sustained injuries to his hands,\n\nback and feet but said nothing about injury to his abdominal\n\norgans.    Jamal said he sought medical treatment, and a doctor's\n\nletter he submitted said he had sustained \"blunt injuries to his\n\nabdominal organs\" and described his condition as \"pretty serious.\"\n\nWhen   asked   during   the   hearing   whether    he   had   suffered   blunt\n\nabdominal injuries, as the letter said, Jamal responded, \"When you\n\nare beaten with, with sticks and rock, surely you're going to get\n\ninjuries inside your system.\"        The IJ observed that the doctor's\n\nletter was dated October 29, 1999, several days before the meeting\n\nwhen Jamal was supposed to have sustained the injuries.                  Jamal\n\ntestified that the date of the letter was an error.           The IJ further\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fobserved that \"the respondent does not appear to have suffered\n\nblunt injuries to his abdominal organs.\"\n\n            At the hearing, Jamal submitted a document, translated\n\nfrom Urdu into English, entitled \"First Investigation Report,\" that\n\nappeared to be a local police report dated November 16, 1999\n\naccusing Jamal and others of disturbing the peace and stating that\n\nJamal and the others were fighting hand to hand with police.\n\n            Jamal    asserted     that    after   November     16,    he   resumed\n\nparticipation in political activities and suffered other beatings\n\nby the police.      In all, he said that he suffered between five and\n\nten beatings between November 16, 1999 and November 30, 1999, when\n\nhe left the area.        He did not, however, claim to have sustained\n\ninjuries subsequent to the beating on November 16; he testified as\n\nto the latter incidents, \"No, no, not really injuries.\"                      After\n\nleaving the area on November 30 to go to Karachi, Jamal suffered no\n\nfurther harm.     In December of 1999, Jamal returned to his work as\n\na seaman and traveled out of Pakistan with government-issued\n\ndocumentation.       There was no evidence of his conviction of any\n\ncriminal offense, of the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, or\n\nof any specific threat by authorities to his safety should he\n\nreturn to Pakistan.\n\n            The   2001   State    Department      Country    Conditions    report\n\nsubmitted    by     Jamal's    counsel    to   the   IJ     stated   there   were\n\nsignificant   amounts     of     corruption    and   sectarian       violence   in\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fPakistan and that the government's human rights record was poor.\n\nThe 2001 report also observed that while the government permitted\n\nall existing political parties to function, including the PML-N,\n\nthe government had essentially prevented the PML-N from electing\n\nformer President Sharif.\n\n           The country conditions report stated that on April 6,\n\n2000, former President Sharif was convicted of hijacking and\n\nterrorism because he had in 1999 refused to permit a commercial\n\nflight on which Musharraf was a passenger to land in Karachi.           On\n\nDecember 10, 2000, Musharraf pardoned the former president, who\n\nflew to exile in Saudi Arabia and promised to stay out of politics\n\nfor two decades.     After the coup, the PML-N chose not to call for\n\nthe restoration of the Sharif government because it believed it\n\nwould be a mistake to challenge the military directly.\n\n           After taking over, Musharraf consolidated a number of\n\ngovernmental roles and assumed more power for himself. His actions\n\nincluded suspending the constitution, jailing several justices and\n\nlawyers   of   the   supreme   court,   and   shutting   down   independent\n\ntelevision stations.1\n\n\n     1\n      While we look solely to facts in the record in determining\nwhether to sustain the decision below, we take note that history\nhas not stood still since this matter was decided. Press reports\nindicate that former Prime Minister and leader of the opposition\nPakistan People's Party (\"PPP\") Benazir Bhutto was assassinated as\nshe campaigned in anticipation of January 2008 parliamentary\nelections. When elections were finally held, both the PPP and the\nPML-N won the majority of seats in the Parliament and formed an\nalliance. Musharraf, who remains the president of Pakistan but is\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            Jamal testified to the IJ that if he returned to the area\n\nof his home, he would be beaten by the local police.                   He also\n\nsubmitted    an    affidavit    asserting    that   \"the   leaders   of    these\n\nextremist organizations know me and would kill me if I returned to\n\nPakistan.\"       Since Jamal entered the United States, however, his\n\nwife and six children have continued to live without incident in\n\nPakistan.    There is no independent evidence of anyone looking for\n\nJamal or threatening to hurt him if he returns home, nor is there\n\nevidence of such conduct by the authorities relative to other PML-N\n\nadherents because of their opposition to the coup against Sharif.\n\n                      IJ's Decision and Board Appeal\n\n            In    denying    Jamal's   applications    for   asylum,      the   IJ\n\nconcluded that Jamal was statutorily ineligible for asylum because\n\nhe had neither filed his application for asylum within one year of\n\nhis arrival in the United States nor shown the existence of changed\n\nor extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify the lateness\n\nof his application.          The uncontested record evidence shows that\n\nJamal arrived in the United States on July 30, 2000 and sought\n\nasylum only on January 5, 2004, some three and a half years later.\n\nThe IJ rejected Jamal's contention that his illiteracy and asserted\n\nignorance    of     the     availability     of   asylum   were   exceptional\n\ncircumstances justifying the lateness of his application. She also\n\n\nno longer the chief of the military, has said he would work with\nthe new Parliament.   Sharif has returned to the country and is\nexpected to run for Parliament in June of this year.\n\n                                       -6-\n\frejected any contention that the country conditions had changed in\n\na way that materially affected his reasons to fear harm upon his\n\nreturn.\n\n               In evaluating Jamal's claims for withholding of removal\n\nand    protection     under   the     CAT,   the    IJ    concluded     that   Jamal's\n\ncontention that he was beaten by police for political reasons at\n\nand    after    the   meeting    on   November      16,    1999   was   insufficient\n\nevidence to establish past persecution. While the IJ found Jamal's\n\nnarrative of the November 16 beating was credible, and that the\n\nharm he then suffered was \"inflicted on account of his political\n\nopinion and his political activities,\" she observed that Jamal had\n\nbeen    physically     able     to    return   to    his    political     activities\n\nimmediately and had joined in other protests without additional\n\ninjuries. She further observed that the date of the doctor's note,\n\nsome days before the claimed beating, and the apparent lack of\n\nblunt abdominal injury suffered by Jamal, also raised a question as\n\nto the injuries inflicted.               The IJ noted that the purported\n\ntranslation of a document naming Jamal as fighting with police and\n\ndisturbing the peace on November 16, 1999 was unsigned by another\n\nexcept the notary and was unaccompanied by the original.                       The IJ\n\nfound that it did not result in a warrant for Jamal's arrest and\n\ndid not interfere with his ability to travel or to leave the\n\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          The IJ additionally concluded that despite the violence\n\nin Pakistan, Jamal had failed to establish that he would more\n\nlikely than not be persecuted on his return to the country because\n\nof his prior opposition to the coup against Sharif.   The IJ based\n\nthis decision on the facts that Jamal's wife and children were\n\nstill living unharmed in Pakistan, that Jamal did not claim that\n\nanyone had threatened him or looked for him since he left Pakistan,\n\nand that he did not show that any supporter of Sharif had been\n\nharmed since 2000.   She concluded there was no evidence that the\n\nuncertain conditions in Pakistan would affect Jamal any more than\n\nany other citizens of Pakistan. The IJ denied Jamal's applications\n\nfor withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.\n\n          The BIA dismissed Jamal's appeal of the IJ's decision on\n\nMarch 19, 2007, affirming both her conclusion that Jamal had filed\n\nan untimely application for asylum not subject to any of the\n\nexceptions and that he had not established past persecution or\n\nlikelihood of future persecution or of torture.\n\n                            Discussion\n\n          We turn to Jamal's arguments that the BIA violated his\n\nright to constitutional due process of law by upholding the IJ's\n\nconclusion that his asylum application was time-barred, and also to\n\nhis challenges to the IJ's conclusion that he failed to establish\n\npast persecution or threat of future persecution or torture.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fI.   Timeliness\n\n                Under INA § 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3),2 courts are\n\ndenied jurisdiction to review the Attorney General's determination\n\nthat       an   alien    has   filed   an    untimely   petition   and   has   not\n\nestablished changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the\n\nlate filing.            See Heng v. Gonzales, 493 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           The statute reads, in relevant part:\n\n       (a)  Authority to apply for asylum\n            (1) In general\n            Any alien who is physically present in the United\n       States or who arrives in the United States . . . may\n       apply for asylum in accordance with this section . . . .\n            (2) Exceptions\n            . . .\n                  (B) Time limit\n                  Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1)\n       shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates\n       by clear and convincing evidence that the application has\n       been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's\n       arrival in the United States.\n                  . . .\n                  (D) Changed circumstances\n                  An application for asylum of an alien may be\n       considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (c), if\n       the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the\n       Attorney General either the existence of changed\n       circumstances which materially affect the applicant's\n       eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\n       relating to the delay in filing an application within the\n       period specified in subparagraph (B).\n            . . .\n            (3) Limitation on judicial review\n            No court shall have jurisdiction to review any\n       determination of the Attorney General under paragraph\n       (2).\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f2007); Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding\n\nno jurisdiction to review a timeliness determination for asylum).\n\n          Jamal does not dispute that his petition was, in fact,\n\nuntimely filed but challenges on purported constitutional grounds\n\nthe IJ's factual finding that he did not demonstrate changed or\n\nextraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant an exception to\n\nthe one-year rule.   He argues in his brief that \"the failure of the\n\nIJ to make an individualized analysis in order to determine whether\n\nevidence exists in the record sufficient to qualify the Petitioner\n\nfor an exception from the (one) 1-year asylum ban on the basis of\n\nchanged circumstances or extraordinary circumstances . . . was a\n\nviolation of due process . . . .\"\n\n          On   the     record    before     us,     this   claim    of\n\nunconstitutionality is frivolous.      \"To trigger our jurisdiction,\n\nthe putative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a\n\ndisguised challenge to factual findings.\"         Pan, 489 F.3d at 84.\n\nThe IJ acted reasonably in giving little credence to Jamal's\n\ncontention that, having overstayed his visa, he had justifiably\n\nremained unaware for over three years from the time he arrived in\n\nthe United States of the one-year period within which to file for\n\nasylum. She noted the existence of various legal aid sources where\n\nadvice was available and found that, \"although not being able to\n\nread or write, [he] is [an] otherwise seemingly intelligent,\n\noriented, and sane individual.     Therefore, I find that the mere\n\n\n                                -10-\n\finability to read or write does not, under these circumstances,\n\ncause the Court to conclude that the respondent is suffering from\n\na disability.\"     Finally, she concluded that \"the Court does not\n\nbelieve that country conditions have changed since the respondent's\n\narrival in the United States so as to materially affect his reasons\n\nfor fearing harm.\"      Nothing about these findings suggests that\n\nJamal's right to constitutional due process was infringed.             We\n\naccordingly   lack    jurisdiction   to   review   the   BIA's   decision\n\naffirming the IJ's conclusion that Jamal's asylum petition was\n\nuntimely and that he has not demonstrated changed or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances excusing his delay.\n\nII.   Denial of Claim for Withholding of Removal and Protection\nUnder the CAT\n\n          An alien scheduled for deportation may avoid removal if\n\nthe Attorney General concludes that \"the alien's life or freedom\n\nwould be threatened in [the destination] country because of the\n\nalien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.\"      INA § 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3)(A).     Jamal challenges the IJ's findings of fact that\n\nhe established neither past persecution nor threat of future\n\npersecution should he be returned to Pakistan and also was not\n\neligible for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.\n\n          If the Attorney General concludes that the alien was a\n\nvictim of past persecution, there is a presumption of future\n\npersecution should the alien be returned to the country.         8 C.F.R.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f§ 1208.16(b)(1)(i).     But an alien who has not demonstrated past\n\npersecution must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that\n\nhe will be subject to future persecution upon returning to the\n\ncountry.     8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).   Under the CAT, an alien may\n\nnot be returned to his country if \"there are substantial grounds\n\nfor believing [he] would be in danger of being subjected to\n\ntorture.\"     Pub. L. No. 104-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822\n\n(1998).    The alien must show that he will more likely than not be\n\ntortured upon returning to his country.    Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d\n\n50, 55, 58 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            As the BIA affirmed the basis of the IJ's decision, we\n\nreview both the IJ and the BIA's decisions.     Butt v. Keisler, 506\n\nF.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 2007).    Their conclusions \"must be upheld if\n\nsupported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\"     INS v. Elias-Zacharias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992) (internal quotation omitted).          Our review is\n\ndeferential.     Their findings of fact are \"conclusive unless any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"     INA § 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).   Jamal\n\nmust demonstrate the evidence in the record not only supports a\n\ncontrary conclusion but compels it. Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d\n\n1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2005).    He has not done so here.3\n\n\n     3\n      The government argues that Jamal's argument regarding past\npersecution and likelihood of future persecution has been abandoned\nbecause they have been \"advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by\n\n                                 -12-\n\f            a.    Past Persecution\n\n            In rejecting Jamal's claim of past persecution, and its\n\naccompanying presumption of future persecution should he return to\n\nPakistan, the IJ concluded that the evidence of police beatings in\n\nNovember of 1999 following the military coup did not rise to the\n\nlevel of persecution.\n\n            The only claimed actual injury to Jamal related to his\n\nbeating   at     the   November   16,    1999   meeting.     He   walked   home\n\nafterwards, and engaged in further political activism throughout\n\nthe remainder of the month which, he said, resulted in further\n\npolice beatings, although without injury to himself.              He then went\n\nto Karachi without apparent problems and later resumed his work as\n\na seaman, during which time he traveled freely out of Pakistan\n\nusing government-issued documents.\n\n            The IJ credited Jamal's testimony as to the November 16,\n\n1999 police beating although, because of the earlier date of the\n\ndoctor's report, the discrepancy between Jamal's description of his\n\ninjuries and those in the report, and Jamal's ability to walk home\n\nand resume demonstrating thereafter, she found he exaggerated his\n\ninjuries.        And   while   Jamal    presented   what   appeared   to   be   a\n\ntranslation of a local police report verifying his encounter with\n\npolice on November 16, 1999, he presented no evidence he was\n\n\nsome developed argumentation.\" Pan, 489 F.3d at 87. Though there\nis force to this argument, we conclude, in any event, that Jamal's\ncontentions are without substance.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fconvicted for his part in the November 16 disturbances, nor that a\n\nwarrant for his arrest was issued.                Nor was there evidence that\n\nothers who had engaged in activism similar to Jamal's were detained\n\nor harmed thereafter by the police.                  His wife and children have\n\ncontinued to live in Pakistan without being disturbed by the\n\nauthorities. There was evidence that, in general, while the police\n\nat   this    time    used   force      against   demonstrators      and    sometimes\n\narrested     them,    the   government        usually    allowed   individuals     to\n\nassemble peacefully subject to some restrictions.\n\n              We cannot say that this record compelled the IJ to find\n\nthat Jamal was subjected to past persecution. The described events\n\noccurring in November of 1999 could reasonably be categorized as\n\nbeing more in the nature of isolated occurrences than the sort of\n\nsystematic threats to Jamal's life or freedom indicative of his\n\nhaving      been    persecuted    by    the   authorities.         See   Topalli   v.\n\nGonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (distinguishing between\n\n\"systematic        maltreatment        that   rose      to   the   level   of   past\n\npersecution\" as opposed to a series of \"isolated incidents,\" and\n\nsustaining a finding of no past persecution where petitioner was\n\nbeaten seven times by the police but did not need medical attention\n\nand was able to live in peace for three years following his last\n\narrest); Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"[M]istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in\n\norder to constitute persecution,\" and upholding a finding of no\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fpersecution after two widely-separated beatings); Nelson v. INS,\n\n232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000) (three episodes of solitary\n\nconfinement of less than 72 hours accompanied by physical abuse\n\nheld insufficient to require a finding of persecution).                       Given\n\nespecially the deferential standard governing this court's review\n\nof the IJ's and BIA's determinations of persecution, see, e.g.,\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (\"Persecution is a protean word of many\n\nmeanings,\"    definition    of    which    is   in   the   first    instance     the\n\nprerogative of the Attorney General), we are unable to say that a\n\ncontrary finding as to past persecution was required here.\n\n           b.    Likelihood of Future Persecution or Torture\n\n           The    IJ   concluded    that    Jamal    was   not     likely   to    be\n\nsubjected to future persecution or torture, noting that his wife\n\nand six children still live safely in Pakistan and that despite the\n\ncorruption and political turmoil in the country, \"there is just\n\nsimply   no     evidence   that    those    conditions      would    affect      the\n\nrespondent more than other citizens of Pakistan.\"                Jamal testified\n\nthat his wife and children \"don't have any problems.\"                   \"Without\n\nsome explanation, the fact that close relatives continue to live\n\npeacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that\n\npersecution awaits his return.\"            Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999). Though Jamal expressed concern that \"the\n\nleaders of these extremist organizations know me and would kill me\n\nif I returned to Pakistan,\" he did not provide evidence beyond his\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fpersonal expression of these concerns and fears to support this\n\nallegation. His family's ongoing safe residence in the country, as\n\nwell as his own earlier unobstructed passages when traveling to\n\nKarachi and as a seaman, as well as the absence of any outstanding\n\nrelevant threats, belie this claim.\n\n           This court has said that the prospect \"that a country's\n\npolitics   remain   volatile,   leaving   open   the     possibility     of\n\ndeterioration and including some measure of specific violence, does\n\nnot   necessarily   establish   an   alien's   well    founded    fear   of\n\npersecution should he be returned to that country.\"              Chreng v.\n\nGonzales, 471 F.3d 14, 23 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006).        Without evidence of\n\na specific threat or of an ongoing pattern of persecution against\n\nsimilarly situated members of his party, Jamal has not shown the\n\nrecord compels the conclusion that he is likely to be persecuted or\n\ntortured upon returning to Pakistan.\n\n           Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

Allen, for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Jesse M. Bless, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, United States Department of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and David V. Bernal, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, CAMPBELL and STAHL, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Mohammad Jamal, a native and citizen of Pakistan, seeks review of a March 19, 2007 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"Board\" or \"BIA\") affirming an immigration judge's denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3) and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), 1465 U.N.T.S.; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.18 (2006) (implementing the convention). Jamal argues that his right to due process was violated by the IJ's conclusion that his asylum petition was untimely filed, and he challenges the IJ's conclusion that he was not subjected to past persecution and would not be likely to suffer future persecution. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<p>Jamal entered the United States on July 30, 2000. On March 21, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") charged Jamal with removability because he had stayed in the United States without authorization. Jamal conceded his removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. The IJ denied his applications on August 9, 2005, and the Board affirmed that decision on March 19, 2007.</p>\n<p>The following facts were developed at the IJ's hearing held on August 9, 2005. Jamal joined the Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (\"PML-N\"), a political party which supported a movement toward democracy, in 1973. In 1998, according to Jamal, he was named secretary general of his village. As secretary-general, he held meetings, talked with party members, and recruited others to join the PML-N. For nine months of each year from 1973-2000, Jamal worked as a seaman. When not at sea, he worked as a farmer and agriculturist. In October 1999, Pakistan's President Nawaz Sharif, who was also the leader of the PML-N, removed the chief of the army, General Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf retaliated by fomenting a successful military coup against Sharif and his cabinet.</p>\n<p>On November 16, 1999, Jamal participated in a meeting advocating democracy and criticizing Musharraf's new military regime. During the meeting, the police beat Jamal and others present. Jamal testified that he sustained injuries to his hands, back and feet but said nothing about injury to his abdominal organs. Jamal said he sought medical treatment, and a doctor's letter he submitted said he had sustained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> \"blunt injuries to his abdominal organs\" and described his condition as \"pretty serious.\" When asked during the hearing whether he had suffered blunt abdominal injuries, as the letter said, Jamal responded, \"When you are beaten with, with sticks and rock, surely you're going to get injuries inside your system.\" The IJ observed that the doctor's letter was dated October 29, 1999, several days before the meeting when Jamal was supposed to have sustained the injuries. Jamal testified that the date of the letter was an error. The IJ further observed that \"the respondent does not appear to have suffered blunt injuries to his abdominal organs.\"</p>\n<p>At the hearing, Jamal submitted a document, translated from Urdu into English, entitled \"First Investigation Report,\" that appeared to be a local police report dated November 16, 1999 accusing Jamal and others of disturbing the peace and stating that Jamal and the others were fighting hand to hand with police.</p>\n<p>Jamal asserted that after November 16, he resumed participation in political activities and suffered other beatings by the police. In all, he said that he suffered between five and ten beatings between November 16, 1999 and November 30, 1999, when he left the area. He did not, however, claim to have sustained injuries subsequent to the beating on November 16; he testified as to the latter incidents, \"No, no, not really injuries.\" After leaving the area on November 30 to go to Karachi, Jamal suffered no further harm. In December of 1999, Jamal returned to his work as a seaman and traveled out of Pakistan with government-issued documentation. There was no evidence of his conviction of any criminal offense, of the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, or of any specific threat by authorities to his safety should he return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p>The 2001 State Department Country Conditions report submitted by Jamal's counsel to the IJ stated there were significant amounts of corruption and sectarian violence in Pakistan and that the government's human rights record was poor. The 2001 report also observed that while the government permitted all existing political parties to function, including the PML-N, the government had essentially prevented the PML-N from electing former President Sharif.</p>\n<p>The country conditions report stated that on April 6, 2000, former President Sharif was convicted of hijacking and terrorism because he had in 1999 refused to permit a commercial flight on which Musharraf was a passenger to land in Karachi. On December 10, 2000, Musharraf pardoned the former president, who flew to exile in Saudi Arabia and promised to stay out of politics for two decades. After the coup, the PML-N chose not to call for the restoration of the Sharif government because it believed it would be a mistake to challenge the military directly.</p>\n<p>After taking over, Musharraf consolidated a number of governmental roles and assumed more power for himself. His actions included suspending the constitution, jailing several justices and lawyers of the supreme court, and shutting down independent television stations.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> Jamal testified to the IJ that if he returned to the area of his home, he would be beaten by the local police. He also submitted an affidavit asserting that \"the leaders of these extremist organizations know me and would kill me if I returned to Pakistan.\" Since Jamal entered the United States, however, his wife and six children have continued to live without incident in Pakistan. There is no independent evidence of anyone looking for Jamal or threatening to hurt him if he returns home, nor is there evidence of such conduct by the authorities relative to other PML-N adherents because of their opposition to the coup against Sharif.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IJ's Decision and Board Appeal</h2>\n<p>In denying Jamal's applications for asylum, the IJ concluded that Jamal was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he had neither filed his application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States nor shown the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify the lateness of his application. The uncontested record evidence shows that Jamal arrived in the United States on July 30, 2000 and sought asylum only on January 5, 2004, some three and a half years later. The IJ rejected Jamal's contention that his illiteracy and asserted ignorance of the availability of asylum were exceptional circumstances justifying the lateness of his application. She also rejected any contention that the country conditions had changed in a way that materially affected his reasons to fear harm upon his return.</p>\n<p>In evaluating Jamal's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, the IJ concluded that Jamal's contention that he was beaten by police for political reasons at and after the meeting on November 16, 1999 was insufficient evidence to establish past persecution. While the IJ found Jamal's narrative of the November 16 beating was credible, and that the harm he then suffered was \"inflicted on account of his political opinion and his political activities,\" she observed that Jamal had been physically able to return to his political activities immediately and had joined in other protests without additional injuries. She further observed that the date of the doctor's note, some days before the claimed beating, and the apparent lack of blunt abdominal injury suffered by Jamal, also raised a question as to the injuries inflicted. The IJ noted that the purported translation of a document naming Jamal as fighting with police and disturbing the peace on November 16, 1999 was unsigned by another except the notary and was unaccompanied by the original. The IJ found that it did not result in a warrant for Jamal's arrest and did not interfere with his ability to travel or to leave the country.</p>\n<p>The IJ additionally concluded that despite the violence in Pakistan, Jamal had failed to establish that he would more likely than not be persecuted on his return to the country because of his prior opposition to the coup against Sharif. The IJ based this decision on the facts that Jamal's wife and children were still living unharmed in Pakistan, that Jamal did not claim that anyone had threatened him or looked for him since he left Pakistan, and that he did not show that any supporter of Sharif had been harmed since 2000. She concluded there was no evidence that the uncertain conditions in Pakistan would affect Jamal any more than any other citizens of Pakistan. The IJ denied Jamal's applications for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> The BIA dismissed Jamal's appeal of the IJ's decision on March 19, 2007, affirming both her conclusion that Jamal had filed an untimely application for asylum not subject to any of the exceptions and that he had not established past persecution or likelihood of future persecution or of torture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>We turn to Jamal's arguments that the BIA violated his right to constitutional due process of law by upholding the IJ's conclusion that his asylum application was time-barred, and also to his challenges to the IJ's conclusion that he failed to establish past persecution or threat of future persecution or torture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Timeliness</h2>\n<p>Under INA § 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3),<sup>[2]</sup> courts are denied jurisdiction to review the Attorney General's determination that an alien has filed an untimely petition and has not established changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the late filing. <i>See </i><i>Heng v. Gonzales,</i> 493 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 84-85 (1st Cir.2007) (holding no jurisdiction to review a timeliness determination for asylum).</p>\n<p>Jamal does not dispute that his petition was, in fact, untimely filed but challenges on purported constitutional grounds the IJ's factual finding that he did not demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant an exception to the one-year rule. He argues in his brief that \"the failure of the IJ to make an individualized analysis in order to determine whether evidence exists in the record sufficient to qualify the Petitioner for an exception from the (one) 1-year asylum ban on the basis of changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances ... was a violation of due process....\"</p>\n<p>On the record before us, this claim of unconstitutionality is frivolous. \"To trigger our jurisdiction, the putative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a disguised challenge to factual findings.\" <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 84. The IJ acted reasonably in giving little credence to Jamal's contention that, having overstayed his visa, he had justifiably remained unaware for over three years from the time he arrived in the United States of the one-year period within which to file for asylum. She noted the existence of various legal aid sources where advice was available and found that, \"although not being able to read or write, [he] is [an] otherwise seemingly intelligent, oriented, and sane individual. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Therefore, I find that the mere inability to read or write does not, under these circumstances, cause the Court to conclude that the respondent is suffering from a disability.\" Finally, she concluded that \"the Court does not believe that country conditions have changed since the respondent's arrival in the United States so as to materially affect his reasons for fearing harm.\" Nothing about these findings suggests that Jamal's right to constitutional due process was infringed. We accordingly lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's decision affirming the IJ's conclusion that Jamal's asylum petition was untimely and that he has not demonstrated changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his delay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Denial of Claim for Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT</h2>\n<p>An alien scheduled for deportation may avoid removal if the Attorney General concludes that \"the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination] country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" INA § 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). Jamal challenges the IJ's findings of fact that he established neither past persecution nor threat of future persecution should he be returned to Pakistan and also was not eligible for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>If the Attorney General concludes that the alien was a victim of past persecution, there is a presumption of future persecution should the alien be returned to the country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). But an alien who has not demonstrated past persecution must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to future persecution upon returning to the country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2). Under the CAT, an alien may not be returned to his country if \"there are substantial grounds for believing [he] would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\" Pub.L. No. 104-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998). The alien must show that he will more likely than not be tortured upon returning to his country. <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> 430 F.3d 50, 55, 58 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>As the BIA affirmed the basis of the IJ's decision, we review both the IJ and the BIA's decisions. <i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> 506 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir.2007). Their conclusions \"must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation omitted). Our review is deferential. Their findings of fact are \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" INA § 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Jamal must demonstrate the evidence in the record not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it. <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2005). He has not done so here.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>In rejecting Jamal's claim of past persecution, and its accompanying presumption of future persecution should he return to Pakistan, the IJ concluded that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> the evidence of police beatings in November of 1999 following the military coup did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p>The only claimed actual injury to Jamal related to his beating at the November 16, 1999 meeting. He walked home afterwards, and engaged in further political activism throughout the remainder of the month which, he said, resulted in further police beatings, although without injury to himself. He then went to Karachi without apparent problems and later resumed his work as a seaman, during which time he traveled freely out of Pakistan using government-issued documents.</p>\n<p>The IJ credited Jamal's testimony as to the November 16, 1999 police beating although, because of the earlier date of the doctor's report, the discrepancy between Jamal's description of his injuries and those in the report, and Jamal's ability to walk home and resume demonstrating thereafter, she found he exaggerated his injuries. And while Jamal presented what appeared to be a translation of a local police report verifying his encounter with police on November 16, 1999, he presented no evidence he was convicted for his part in the November 16 disturbances, nor that a warrant for his arrest was issued. Nor was there evidence that others who had engaged in activism similar to Jamal's were detained or harmed thereafter by the police. His wife and children have continued to live in Pakistan without being disturbed by the authorities. There was evidence that, in general, while the police at this time used force against demonstrators and sometimes arrested them, the government usually allowed individuals to assemble peacefully subject to some restrictions.</p>\n<p>We cannot say that this record compelled the IJ to find that Jamal was subjected to past persecution. The described events occurring in November of 1999 could reasonably be categorized as being more in the nature of isolated occurrences than the sort of systematic threats to Jamal's life or freedom indicative of his having been persecuted by the authorities. <i>See </i><i>Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir.2005) (distinguishing between \"systematic maltreatment that rose to the level of past persecution\" as opposed to a series of \"isolated incidents,\" and sustaining a finding of no past persecution where petitioner was beaten seven times by the police but did not need medical attention and was able to live in peace for three years following his last arrest); <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[M]istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution,\" and upholding a finding of no persecution after two widely-separated beatings); <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (three episodes of solitary confinement of less than 72 hours accompanied by physical abuse held insufficient to require a finding of persecution). Given especially the deferential standard governing this court's review of the IJ's and BIA's determinations of persecution, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263 (\"Persecution is a protean word of many meanings,\" definition of which is in the first instance the prerogative of the Attorney General), we are unable to say that a contrary finding as to past persecution was required here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Likelihood of Future Persecution or Torture</h2>\n<p>The IJ concluded that Jamal was not likely to be subjected to future persecution or torture, noting that his wife and six children still live safely in Pakistan and that despite the corruption and political turmoil in the country, \"there is just simply no evidence that those conditions would affect the respondent more than other citizens of Pakistan.\" Jamal testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> that his wife and children \"don't have any problems.\" \"Without some explanation, the fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir.1999). Though Jamal expressed concern that \"the leaders of these extremist organizations know me and would kill me if I returned to Pakistan,\" he did not provide evidence beyond his personal expression of these concerns and fears to support this allegation. His family's ongoing safe residence in the country, as well as his own earlier unobstructed passages when traveling to Karachi and as a seaman, as well as the absence of any outstanding relevant threats, belie this claim.</p>\n<p>This court has said that the prospect \"that a country's politics remain volatile, leaving open the possibility of deterioration and including some measure of specific violence, does not necessarily establish an alien's well founded fear of persecution should he be returned to that country.\" <i>Chreng v. Gonzales,</i> 471 F.3d 14, 23 n. 3 (1st Cir.2006). Without evidence of a specific threat or of an ongoing pattern of persecution against similarly situated members of his party, Jamal has not shown the record compels the conclusion that he is likely to be persecuted or tortured upon returning to Pakistan.</p>\n<p><i>Petition denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  While we look solely to facts in the record in determining whether to sustain the decision below, we take note that history has not stood still since this matter was decided. Press reports indicate that former Prime Minister and leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party (\"PPP\") Benazir Bhutto was assassinated as she campaigned in anticipation of January 2008 parliamentary elections. When elections were finally held, both the PPP and the PML-N won the majority of seats in the Parliament and formed an alliance. Musharraf, who remains the president of Pakistan but is no longer the chief of the military, has said he would work with the new Parliament. Sharif has returned to the country and is expected to run for Parliament in June of this year.</p>\n<p>[2]  The statute reads, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Authority to apply for asylum</p>\n<p>(1) In general</p>\n<p>Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States ... may apply for asylum in accordance with this section....</p>\n<p>(2) Exceptions</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(B) Time limit</p>\n<p>Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(D) Changed circumstances</p>\n<p>An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (c), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in subparagraph (B).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(3) Limitation on judicial review</p>\n<p>No court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).</p>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that Jamal's argument regarding past persecution and likelihood of future persecution has been abandoned because they have been \"advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation.\" <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 87. Though there is force to this argument, we conclude, in any event, that Jamal's contentions are without substance.</p>\n\n</div>",

Jamal argues that his right to due process was violated by the IJ's conclusion that his asylum petition was untimely filed, and he challenges the IJ's conclusion that he was not subjected to past persecution and would not be likely to suffer future persecution. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<p>Jamal entered the United States on July 30, 2000. On March 21, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") charged Jamal with removability because he had stayed in the United States without authorization. Jamal conceded his removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. The IJ denied his applications on August 9, 2005, and the Board affirmed that decision on March 19, 2007.</p>\n<p>The following facts were developed at the IJ's hearing held on August 9, 2005. Jamal joined the Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (\"PML-N\"), a political party which supported a movement toward democracy, in 1973. In 1998, according to Jamal, he was named secretary general of his village. As secretary-general, he held meetings, talked with party members, and recruited others to join the PML-N. For nine months of each year from 1973-2000, Jamal worked as a seaman. When not at sea, he worked as a farmer and agriculturist. In October 1999, Pakistan's President Nawaz Sharif, who was also the leader of the PML-N, removed the chief of the army, General Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf retaliated by fomenting a successful military coup against Sharif and his cabinet.</p>\n<p>On November 16, 1999, Jamal participated in a meeting advocating democracy and criticizing Musharraf's new military regime. During the meeting, the police beat Jamal and others present. Jamal testified that he sustained injuries to his hands, back and feet but said nothing about injury to his abdominal organs. Jamal said he sought medical treatment, and a doctor's letter he submitted said he had sustained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> \"blunt injuries to his abdominal organs\" and described his condition as \"pretty serious.\" When asked during the hearing whether he had suffered blunt abdominal injuries, as the letter said, Jamal responded, \"When you are beaten with, with sticks and rock, surely you're going to get injuries inside your system.\" The IJ observed that the doctor's letter was dated October 29, 1999, several days before the meeting when Jamal was supposed to have sustained the injuries. Jamal testified that the date of the letter was an error. The IJ further observed that \"the respondent does not appear to have suffered blunt injuries to his abdominal organs.\"</p>\n<p>At the hearing, Jamal submitted a document, translated from Urdu into English, entitled \"First Investigation Report,\" that appeared to be a local police report dated November 16, 1999 accusing Jamal and others of disturbing the peace and stating that Jamal and the others were fighting hand to hand with police.</p>\n<p>Jamal asserted that after November 16, he resumed participation in political activities and suffered other beatings by the police. In all, he said that he suffered between five and ten beatings between November 16, 1999 and November 30, 1999, when he left the area. He did not, however, claim to have sustained injuries subsequent to the beating on November 16; he testified as to the latter incidents, \"No, no, not really injuries.\" After leaving the area on November 30 to go to Karachi, Jamal suffered no further harm. In December of 1999, Jamal returned to his work as a seaman and traveled out of Pakistan with government-issued documentation. There was no evidence of his conviction of any criminal offense, of the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, or of any specific threat by authorities to his safety should he return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p>The 2001 State Department Country Conditions report submitted by Jamal's counsel to the IJ stated there were significant amounts of corruption and sectarian violence in Pakistan and that the government's human rights record was poor. The 2001 report also observed that while the government permitted all existing political parties to function, including the PML-N, the government had essentially prevented the PML-N from electing former President Sharif.</p>\n<p>The country conditions report stated that on April 6, 2000, former President Sharif was convicted of hijacking and terrorism because he had in 1999 refused to permit a commercial flight on which Musharraf was a passenger to land in Karachi. On December 10, 2000, Musharraf pardoned the former president, who flew to exile in Saudi Arabia and promised to stay out of politics for two decades. After the coup, the PML-N chose not to call for the restoration of the Sharif government because it believed it would be a mistake to challenge the military directly.</p>\n<p>After taking over, Musharraf consolidated a number of governmental roles and assumed more power for himself. His actions included suspending the constitution, jailing several justices and lawyers of the supreme court, and shutting down independent television stations.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> Jamal testified to the IJ that if he returned to the area of his home, he would be beaten by the local police. He also submitted an affidavit asserting that \"the leaders of these extremist organizations know me and would kill me if I returned to Pakistan.\" Since Jamal entered the United States, however, his wife and six children have continued to live without incident in Pakistan. There is no independent evidence of anyone looking for Jamal or threatening to hurt him if he returns home, nor is there evidence of such conduct by the authorities relative to other PML-N adherents because of their opposition to the coup against Sharif.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IJ's Decision and Board Appeal</h2>\n<p>In denying Jamal's applications for asylum, the IJ concluded that Jamal was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he had neither filed his application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States nor shown the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify the lateness of his application. The uncontested record evidence shows that Jamal arrived in the United States on July 30, 2000 and sought asylum only on January 5, 2004, some three and a half years later. The IJ rejected Jamal's contention that his illiteracy and asserted ignorance of the availability of asylum were exceptional circumstances justifying the lateness of his application. She also rejected any contention that the country conditions had changed in a way that materially affected his reasons to fear harm upon his return.</p>\n<p>In evaluating Jamal's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, the IJ concluded that Jamal's contention that he was beaten by police for political reasons at and after the meeting on November 16, 1999 was insufficient evidence to establish past persecution. While the IJ found Jamal's narrative of the November 16 beating was credible, and that the harm he then suffered was \"inflicted on account of his political opinion and his political activities,\" she observed that Jamal had been physically able to return to his political activities immediately and had joined in other protests without additional injuries. She further observed that the date of the doctor's note, some days before the claimed beating, and the apparent lack of blunt abdominal injury suffered by Jamal, also raised a question as to the injuries inflicted. The IJ noted that the purported translation of a document naming Jamal as fighting with police and disturbing the peace on November 16, 1999 was unsigned by another except the notary and was unaccompanied by the original. The IJ found that it did not result in a warrant for Jamal's arrest and did not interfere with his ability to travel or to leave the country.</p>\n<p>The IJ additionally concluded that despite the violence in Pakistan, Jamal had failed to establish that he would more likely than not be persecuted on his return to the country because of his prior opposition to the coup against Sharif. The IJ based this decision on the facts that Jamal's wife and children were still living unharmed in Pakistan, that Jamal did not claim that anyone had threatened him or looked for him since he left Pakistan, and that he did not show that any supporter of Sharif had been harmed since 2000. She concluded there was no evidence that the uncertain conditions in Pakistan would affect Jamal any more than any other citizens of Pakistan. The IJ denied Jamal's applications for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> The BIA dismissed Jamal's appeal of the IJ's decision on March 19, 2007, affirming both her conclusion that Jamal had filed an untimely application for asylum not subject to any of the exceptions and that he had not established past persecution or likelihood of future persecution or of torture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>We turn to Jamal's arguments that the BIA violated his right to constitutional due process of law by upholding the IJ's conclusion that his asylum application was time-barred, and also to his challenges to the IJ's conclusion that he failed to establish past persecution or threat of future persecution or torture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Timeliness</h2>\n<p>Under INA § 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3),<sup>[2]</sup> courts are denied jurisdiction to review the Attorney General's determination that an alien has filed an untimely petition and has not established changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the late filing. <i>See </i><i>Heng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202837\"><a href=\"/opinion/202837/heng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84-85 (1st Cir.2007) (holding no jurisdiction to review a timeliness determination for asylum).</p>\n<p>Jamal does not dispute that his petition was, in fact, untimely filed but challenges on purported constitutional grounds the IJ's factual finding that he did not demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant an exception to the one-year rule. He argues in his brief that \"the failure of the IJ to make an individualized analysis in order to determine whether evidence exists in the record sufficient to qualify the Petitioner for an exception from the (one) 1-year asylum ban on the basis of changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances ... was a violation of due process....\"</p>\n<p>On the record before us, this claim of unconstitutionality is frivolous. \"To trigger our jurisdiction, the putative constitutional or legal challenge must be more than a disguised challenge to factual findings.\" <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 84. The IJ acted reasonably in giving little credence to Jamal's contention that, having overstayed his visa, he had justifiably remained unaware for over three years from the time he arrived in the United States of the one-year period within which to file for asylum. She noted the existence of various legal aid sources where advice was available and found that, \"although not being able to read or write, [he] is [an] otherwise seemingly intelligent, oriented, and sane individual. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Therefore, I find that the mere inability to read or write does not, under these circumstances, cause the Court to conclude that the respondent is suffering from a disability.\" Finally, she concluded that \"the Court does not believe that country conditions have changed since the respondent's arrival in the United States so as to materially affect his reasons for fearing harm.\" Nothing about these findings suggests that Jamal's right to constitutional due process was infringed. We accordingly lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's decision affirming the IJ's conclusion that Jamal's asylum petition was untimely and that he has not demonstrated changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his delay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Denial of Claim for Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT</h2>\n<p>An alien scheduled for deportation may avoid removal if the Attorney General concludes that \"the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination] country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" INA § 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). Jamal challenges the IJ's findings of fact that he established neither past persecution nor threat of future persecution should he be returned to Pakistan and also was not eligible for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>If the Attorney General concludes that the alien was a victim of past persecution, there is a presumption of future persecution should the alien be returned to the country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i). But an alien who has not demonstrated past persecution must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to future persecution upon returning to the country. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2). Under the CAT, an alien may not be returned to his country if \"there are substantial grounds for believing [he] would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\" Pub.L. No. 104-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998). The alien must show that he will more likely than not be tortured upon returning to his country. <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55, 58 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>As the BIA affirmed the basis of the IJ's decision, we review both the IJ and the BIA's decisions. <i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203005\"><a href=\"/opinion/203005/butt-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2007). Their conclusions \"must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992) (internal quotation omitted). Our review is deferential. Their findings of fact are \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" INA § 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Jamal must demonstrate the evidence in the record not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it. <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.2005). He has not done so here.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Past Persecution</h2>\n<p>In rejecting Jamal's claim of past persecution, and its accompanying presumption of future persecution should he return to Pakistan, the IJ concluded that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> the evidence of police beatings in November of 1999 following the military coup did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p>The only claimed actual injury to Jamal related to his beating at the November 16, 1999 meeting. He walked home afterwards, and engaged in further political activism throughout the remainder of the month which, he said, resulted in further police beatings, although without injury to himself. He then went to Karachi without apparent problems and later resumed his work as a seaman, during which time he traveled freely out of Pakistan using government-issued documents.</p>\n<p>The IJ credited Jamal's testimony as to the November 16, 1999 police beating although, because of the earlier date of the doctor's report, the discrepancy between Jamal's description of his injuries and those in the report, and Jamal's ability to walk home and resume demonstrating thereafter, she found he exaggerated his injuries. And while Jamal presented what appeared to be a translation of a local police report verifying his encounter with police on November 16, 1999, he presented no evidence he was convicted for his part in the November 16 disturbances, nor that a warrant for his arrest was issued. Nor was there evidence that others who had engaged in activism similar to Jamal's were detained or harmed thereafter by the police. His wife and children have continued to live in Pakistan without being disturbed by the authorities. There was evidence that, in general, while the police at this time used force against demonstrators and sometimes arrested them, the government usually allowed individuals to assemble peacefully subject to some restrictions.</p>\n<p>We cannot say that this record compelled the IJ to find that Jamal was subjected to past persecution. The described events occurring in November of 1999 could reasonably be categorized as being more in the nature of isolated occurrences than the sort of systematic threats to Jamal's life or freedom indicative of his having been persecuted by the authorities. <i>See </i><i>Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201738\"><a href=\"/opinion/201738/topalli-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.2005) (distinguishing between \"systematic maltreatment that rose to the level of past persecution\" as opposed to a series of \"isolated incidents,\" and sustaining a finding of no past persecution where petitioner was beaten seven times by the police but did not need medical attention and was able to live in peace for three years following his last arrest); <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[M]istreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution,\" and upholding a finding of no persecution after two widely-separated beatings); <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (three episodes of solitary confinement of less than 72 hours accompanied by physical abuse held insufficient to require a finding of persecution). Given especially the deferential standard governing this court's review of the IJ's and BIA's determinations of persecution, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263 (\"Persecution is a protean word of many meanings,\" definition of which is in the first instance the prerogative of the Attorney General), we are unable to say that a contrary finding as to past persecution was required here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Likelihood of Future Persecution or Torture</h2>\n<p>The IJ concluded that Jamal was not likely to be subjected to future persecution or torture, noting that his wife and six children still live safely in Pakistan and that despite the corruption and political turmoil in the country, \"there is just simply no evidence that those conditions would affect the respondent more than other citizens of Pakistan.\" Jamal testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> that his wife and children \"don't have any problems.\" \"Without some explanation, the fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir.1999). Though Jamal expressed concern that \"the leaders of these extremist organizations know me and would kill me if I returned to Pakistan,\" he did not provide evidence beyond his personal expression of these concerns and fears to support this allegation. His family's ongoing safe residence in the country, as well as his own earlier unobstructed passages when traveling to Karachi and as a seaman, as well as the absence of any outstanding relevant threats, belie this claim.</p>\n<p>This court has said that the prospect \"that a country's politics remain volatile, leaving open the possibility of deterioration and including some measure of specific violence, does not necessarily establish an alien's well founded fear of persecution should he be returned to that country.\" <i>Chreng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202559\"><a href=\"/opinion/202559/chreng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 23 n. 3 (1st Cir.2006). Without evidence of a specific threat or of an ongoing pattern of persecution against similarly situated members of his party, Jamal has not shown the record compels the conclusion that he is likely to be persecuted or tortured upon returning to Pakistan.</p>\n<p><i>Petition denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  While we look solely to facts in the record in determining whether to sustain the decision below, we take note that history has not stood still since this matter was decided. Press reports indicate that former Prime Minister and leader of the opposition Pakistan People's Party (\"PPP\") Benazir Bhutto was assassinated as she campaigned in anticipation of January 2008 parliamentary elections. When elections were finally held, both the PPP and the PML-N won the majority of seats in the Parliament and formed an alliance. Musharraf, who remains the president of Pakistan but is no longer the chief of the military, has said he would work with the new Parliament. Sharif has returned to the country and is expected to run for Parliament in June of this year.</p>\n<p>[2]  The statute reads, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Authority to apply for asylum</p>\n<p>(1) In general</p>\n<p>Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States ... may apply for asylum in accordance with this section....</p>\n<p>(2) Exceptions</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(B) Time limit</p>\n<p>Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(D) Changed circumstances</p>\n<p>An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (c), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in subparagraph (B).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(3) Limitation on judicial review</p>\n<p>No court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).</p>\n<p>8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that Jamal's argument regarding past persecution and likelihood of future persecution has been abandoned because they have been \"advanced in skeletal form, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation.\" <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 87. Though there is force to this argument, we conclude, in any event, that Jamal's contentions are without substance.</p>\n\n</div>",
