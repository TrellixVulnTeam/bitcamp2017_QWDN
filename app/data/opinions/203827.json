Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Stahl, and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jorge M.

This action arises from a car\n\naccident that occurred after a Christmas party held by defendant-\n\nappellee ICN Pharmaceuticals (\"ICN\") for its employees.          The party\n\nwas held at Palmas del Mar resort complex (\"Blue Water Palmas\").\n\nJosé Serrano Torres (\"Serrano\"), an employee of ICN, allegedly left\n\nthe party legally drunk and crashed into plaintiff-appellant Ruth\n\nVernet's   vehicle   in   a   residential   area   in   Palmas   del   Mar.\n\nPlaintiff-appellants1 (\"plaintiffs\") claim that under Articles 1802\n\nand 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, ICN is liable for the\n\nphysical and economic injuries that she suffered as a result of the\n\ncar accident.2   ICN moved to dismiss the complaint and the district\n\n\n\n1\n    Plaintiff-Appellants include the victim, Ruth Vernet; her\nspouse, Frank Vernet; and her two sons, Alexander Vernet and David\nVernet.\n2\n   Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states that \"[a]\nperson who by an act or omission causes damage to another through\nfault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\"\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141.\n\n     Article 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states:\n\n     The obligation imposed by [Article 1802] is demandable,\n     not only for personal acts and omissions, but also for\n     those of the persons for whom they should be responsible.\n     . . .     Owners or directors of an establishment or\n     enterprise are likewise liable for any damages caused by\n     their employees in the service of the branches in which\n     the latter are employed or on account of their duties.\n     . . . The liability referred to in this section shall\n     cease when the liable persons mentioned therein prove\n     that they employed all the diligence of a good father of\n     a family to preclude the damage.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31 § 5142.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fcourt granted ICN's motion.            It relied on the Supreme Court of\n\nPuerto Rico's decision in López v. Porrata Doria to dismiss the\n\nplaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. See 2006 TSPR 149, 2006 WL 2873349\n\n(P.R. 2006) (certified translation provided by parties).                            The\n\ndistrict    court   dismissed        plaintiffs'    Article      1803       claim   by\n\nconcluding that Serrano was not acting within the scope of his\n\nemployment when the accident occurred.\n\n            After   careful     consideration       we   affirm       the    district\n\ncourt's ruling with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, but\n\nreverse    and   remand    to   the     district    court      with    respect      to\n\nplaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            In their second amended complaint, plaintiffs allege the\n\nfollowing facts relevant to the instant case.                 On the afternoon of\n\nDecember 17, 1999, ICN sponsored a Christmas party held at Blue\n\nWater Palmas in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs maintain that one\n\nof ICN's objectives in having the party was \"to develop and enhance\n\nICN's business relationship with clients and others.\"                   Plaintiffs\n\npoint out that although ICN decided that alcohol would be served at\n\nthe party, the company failed to \"circulate to its employees a\n\nwritten    memorandum     instructing     them     not   to    drink    alcohol      in\n\nexcess.\"    Further, plaintiffs claim that ICN \"did not create a\n\ncommittee among its employees to be on the lookout during the party\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffor its employees and other attendees that might be having too much\n\nto drink.\"\n\n            Serrano, an employee of ICN, drank liquor provided by ICN\n\nat the party.      He left the party that afternoon intoxicated and\n\nproceeded to drive his vehicle.          As a result of his condition,\n\nwhich was beyond the legal limit permissible to drive a vehicle,\n\nSerrano's automobile struck a car driven by Vernet, causing her\n\nmultiple physical and economic injuries. An officer present at the\n\nscene   after   the   accident   concluded   that    Serrano   caused   the\n\naccident.\n\n            Plaintiffs brought suit against ICN, as well as other\n\ndefendants,3 claiming that ICN was negligent in failing to control\n\nits employees' alcohol consumption at the company activity, and in\n\nnot   foreseeing   that   Serrano's   condition     could   endanger   third\n\nparties such as Vernet. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that from\n\n\n\n3\n   Other defendants included Serrano, his insurance company, Ford\nMotor Company, and Blue Water Palmas. On March 7, 2001, plaintiffs\nfiled a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal as to Ford Motor Company. On\nMarch 22, 2001 the district court entered judgment, dismissing the\ncomplaint without prejudice as to Ford Motor Company. On April 3,\n2002, plaintiffs, Serrano, and Serrano's insurance company filed a\nsettlement stipulation.    On April 25, 2002, the district court\nentered a partial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs'\nclaim against Serrano and his insurance company. On September 25,\n2006 Blue Water Palmas and plaintiffs filed a settlement agreement\nin the amount of $300,000 for their alleged liability in having\nserved Serrano excessive amounts of liquor during the course of the\nICN company party. On October 3, 2006 the district court entered\npartial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs' claim\nagainst Blue Water Palmas.      Consequently, the only remaining\nparties are the plaintiffs and ICN.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe facts alleged in the second amended complaint, ICN was liable\n\nunder Article 1802 for failing to implement reasonable measures to\n\ncontrol the amount of alcohol available to its employees during a\n\nwork-related activity and to control the behavior of its employees\n\nduring a work-related activity.      Also, plaintiffs claimed that ICN\n\nwas liable under Article 1803 due to the fact that Serrano, its\n\nemployee, became intoxicated at and during the course of his\n\nemployment with alcoholic beverages provided by and paid for by his\n\nemployer.\n\n            ICN responded to plaintiffs' claims by filing a second\n\nmotion to dismiss.      As to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, ICN\n\ncontended that in López, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court recognized\n\nlimited     dram-shop   liability   applicable   only   to   commercial\n\nestablishments in the business of selling alcoholic beverages.4\n\nFurthermore, ICN argued that even if López were applicable to\n\nbusiness hosts such as itself, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\nexplicitly ruled that its decision would only have prospective\n\neffects.     Thus, because López was issued after Serrano's car\n\naccident, ICN asserted that it should not face liability.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   We have previously described the theory of dram-shop liability\nas one where \"a bar or tavern may be liable for the wrongful or\ninjurious actions of a patron if it served alcohol to that patron\nafter it knew, or should have known, that the patron was already\nintoxicated.\" Phoung Luc v. Wyndham Mgmt. Corp., 496 F.3d 85, 88\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2007) (referring to dram-shop liability under\nMassachusetts law). Puerto Rico does not have a dram-shop statute.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f              Regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, ICN argued that\n\nplaintiffs'        settlement    with   Serrano   legally    extinguished      any\n\npossible vicarious liability on the part of ICN because any such\n\nliability was contingent upon the existence of Serrano's primary\n\nliability, which no longer existed by virtue of the settlement.\n\nICN further argued that plaintiffs' claim under Article 1803 would\n\nnevertheless fail on the merits because Serrano was not acting\n\nwithin the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.\n\n              The district court ruled in favor of ICN and dismissed\n\nthe complaint.        Plaintiffs appeal the district court's ruling.\n\n                                 II.    Discussion\n\n              A.    Standard of Review\n\n              We apply de novo review to a district court's grant of a\n\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6).      Díaz Ramos v. Hyundai Motor Co., 501 F.3d 12, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).        \"[W]e, like the district court, must assume the truth\n\nof all well-plead facts and give the plaintiff[s] the benefit of\n\nall reasonable inferences therefrom.\"             Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness\n\nHolding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007). In this respect, to\n\nsurvive   a    motion    to     dismiss,   a   complaint    must   establish    \"a\n\nplausible entitlement to relief.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. 544, 559 (2007).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          B.    Applicable Law\n\n          In diversity cases, such as the present one, state law\n\ncontrols the substantive outcome.           See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n\n304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938); Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v. Rapier\n\nInvs., Ltd., 197 F.3d 18, 19 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999).               In dismissing\n\nthe complaint against ICN, the district court correctly ruled that\n\nthe substantive law of Puerto Rico favors ICN with respect to\n\nplaintiffs' Article 1802 claim.           However, we disagree with the\n\ndistrict court's ruling regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.\n\n                     1.   Article 1802 and López\n\n          A brief review of López supports our conclusion that the\n\ndistrict court acted correctly in dismissing plaintiffs' Article\n\n1802 claim.    See generally López, Certified Translation.5             López\n\ninvolved an action against a commercial establishment pursuant to\n\nPuerto Rico's negligence statute, contained in Article 1802 of the\n\nCivil Code.    Id. at **1-2.    In López, Ricardo Calderón and Rafael\n\nLugo-Porrata   met    some   friends   at    a   local   bar.    Id.   at   *3.\n\nAllegedly, Lugo-Porrata, even though he was visibly intoxicated,\n\nwas served alcoholic beverages at a pub.          See id. at **3, 5.    Later\n\nthat evening, both Calderón and Lugo-Porrata left the bar and\n\ndecided to go drag racing, during which Lugo-Porrata, the driver,\n\nlost control of the vehicle and crashed.           Id. at *4.     As a result\n\n\n5\n   There does not appear to be an official translation. However,\nthe parties cite to an undisputed certified translation, which we\ncite to as well.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fof the crash, Lugo-Porrata was killed and Calderón was severely\n\ninjured.    Id.   Calderón and his parents sued the bar claiming that\n\nit was negligent in serving Lugo-Porrata alcohol when he was\n\nvisibly intoxicated and its employee knew or should have known that\n\nhe was going to drive a car.       Id. at **4-5.\n\n            The specific issue before the court was whether, pursuant\n\nto Article 1802, a commercial establishment could be held liable\n\n\"for supplying alcoholic beverages to a person that is visibly\n\nintoxicated and who afterward causes damages while driving an\n\nautomobile under the influence of alcohol.\"          Id. at **1-2.         The\n\ncourt   concluded   that    commercial    establishments   could    be   held\n\nliable, yet stressed that its ruling would only have \"prospective\n\neffects.\"   Id. at *2.     In its analysis, the López court stated that\n\ndespite public policy pronouncements acknowledging the dangers\n\nposed by intoxicated drivers, no specific legislation dealt with\n\nthe controversy in that case.        Thus, the court reasoned that it\n\nmust apply general Puerto Rico tort law principles under Article\n\n1802,   noting    that   the   provisions   of   Article   1802    \"must    be\n\ninterpreted expansively.\"       Id. at *7 (emphasis in original).\n\n            To \"enrich [its] analysis,\" id. at *16, the court turned\n\nto comparative law sources in common law jurisdictions in the\n\nUnited States which have faced similar situations.          In looking at\n\njurisdictions in the United States, the court remarked that several\n\ncourts were now \"imposing liability [on] those who sold alcoholic\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbeverages to intoxicated . . . persons who subsequently caused\n\ninjury.\"   Id. at *17 (emphasis in original deleted).            The court\n\nthen pointed to dram-shop legislation in the United States directed\n\nat   public    commercial    establishments,     especially      bars   and\n\nrestaurants.    Id. at **19 & n.8.       The court stated that many of\n\nthese laws were passed in part to incentivize commercial vendors of\n\nalcoholic beverages to behave responsibly.       Id. at *19.\n\n           In view of these decisions and its prior case law, the\n\ncourt   reasoned   that   those   who    irresponsibly    sell   alcoholic\n\nbeverages with knowledge of the risk it creates \"violate[] the\n\ngeneral duty of correctness and prudence\" and do so \"in clear\n\ndisregard of the safety of others.\"      Id. at *26.     The court further\n\nnoted that \"the granting of a license is a privilege, not a right\"\n\nand that \"[w]hoever profits from an activity that puts at risk the\n\nhealth and life of individuals has the obligation to act prudently\n\nand diligently.\"    Id.\n\n           The court thus concluded that under Article 1802 it was\n\n\"clearly appropriate\" to impose liability on commercial vendors who\n\nprovide alcoholic beverages to \"visibly intoxicated\" individuals\n\nwho then cause harm to third parties by driving a vehicle while\n\nintoxicated.   Id. at *27.    The court emphasized that \"this duty of\n\ndiligence when providing alcoholic beverages is only extended to\n\npublic commercial establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic\n\nbeverages.\"    Id. (emphasis in original).     The court reasoned that\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fcommercial establishments should be singled out because unlike\n\nsocial   hosts,     for   example,   commercial     vendors      \"economically\n\nprofit[]    from    furnishing    alcohol    and,   therefore,         ha[ve]   an\n\nincentive   to     encourage    excess    consumption.\"         Id.      Further,\n\ncommercial establishments can procure insurance \"against the risks\n\nassumed in getting [a business] up and running.\"                      Id. at *28.\n\nThese factors, the court concluded, support limiting the duty of\n\ndiligence to commercial sellers of alcoholic beverages.                  Id.\n\n                           a.    Whether López Controls\n\n            Plaintiffs    argue    that   López   does    not    determine      the\n\noutcome of this case.      They maintain that López limited its ruling\n\nto commercial establishments and that we are presented with a\n\ndifferent factual scenario here, emphasizing that there was an\n\nemployee-employer relationship between ICN and Serrano.6\n\n            We disagree and hold that López controls here.                 Simply\n\nput, López does not contemplate extending liability to business\n\nhosts like ICN.      Moreover, under López, plaintiffs' Article 1802\n\n\n6\n   Plaintiffs stress in their brief that \"[o]ne of the principal\npurposes of ICN in having the party during working hours, on a work\nday, and where employee-attendance was mandatory was to foment and\npreserve a good relationship between management and regular\nemployees, as well as between regular employees.\" Plaintiffs also\nclaim that during the planning phase of the party, ICN budgeted for\nand took as a business expense the cost of providing alcoholic\nbeverages. Further, plaintiffs allege that prior to the day of the\nparty, ICN neither circulated a memorandum among its employees\ninstructing them to refrain from drinking excessively so as to not\njeopardize the well being of third persons during or after the\nparty; nor did ICN create a committee to watch over employees so\nthat they would not drink excessively.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fclaims would not be cognizable because the court made clear that\n\nits decision was to be applied only prospectively.\n\n            With respect to López's controlling effect, López did\n\nmore than just comment on the liability surrounding social hosts\n\nand commercial vendors.     Rather, the López court, in reaching its\n\ndecision, reviewed both the principles underlying Article 1802 and\n\nthe various approaches courts throughout the United States have\n\ntaken    historically   towards    dram-shop        liability.        After   this\n\ncomprehensive review, which included a case involving a business\n\nhost, see McGee v. Alexander, 2001 OK 78 (2001), the López court\n\nconcluded that \"the duty of diligence when providing alcoholic\n\nbeverages is only extended to public commercial establishments\n\nengaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages.\"                López, Certified\n\nTranslation at *27 (emphasis in original).               Although plaintiffs\n\ncharacterize the court's holding as a narrow one, the court's\n\nanalysis   instead   suggests     that   it   was    opining     on   the   larger\n\nquestion of when liability extends to someone who has provided\n\nalcohol to an intoxicated person who then causes harm to a third\n\nparty.   It is clear from our reading of López that the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court did not contemplate that dram-shop liability would\n\nextend to business hosts like ICN.\n\n            Even if we were to conclude that ICN should be treated\n\nlike a commercial vendor under López, plaintiffs' claims would\n\nstill fail.   The López court explicitly stated that its ruling was\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fto apply prospectively from October 6, 2006, the date of its\n\ndecision. Plaintiffs' action would have arisen, had they otherwise\n\nqualified, seven years before the operative date.\n\n                  2.   Article 1803\n\n           As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether, under\n\nPuerto Rico law, plaintiffs' claims were extinguished by their\n\nsettlement with Serrano. \"[T]he default rule under Puerto Rico law\n\n. . . recognizes the settling parties' intent as controlling.\" Río\n\nMar Assocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc., 522 F.3d 159, 166 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (citing Szendrey v. Hospicare, Inc., 158 D.P.R. 648, 657-58,\n\n2003 WL 751582 (P.R. 2003)).      Plaintiffs' settlement agreement\n\nprovides as follows: \"Notwithstanding, plaintiffs expressly reserve\n\nthe right to continue prosecuting their causes of actions against\n\ncodefendants [ICN , Blue Water Palmas], their insurance companies\n\nand any other person or entity who might be liable to them, all in\n\naccordance with Merle v. West Bend, Co., 97 D.P.R. 403, [1969 WL\n\n21616 (P.R. 1969)].\"      From this language it is evident that\n\nplaintiffs did not intend for the settlement agreement with Serrano\n\nto extinguish their claims against ICN under either Articles 1802\n\nor 1803.   See Hopgood v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 839\n\nF. Supp. 98, 106 (D.P.R. 1993) (noting the Merle court's conclusion\n\nthat \"[t]he clear terms of the settlement agreement reflected the\n\nintention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fand controlled the outcome of the case\").7     We are not aware of,\n\nand ICN has not cited to, a case under Puerto Rico law that holds\n\nthat a plaintiff's settlement with an employee extinguishes a\n\nvicarious liability claim against the employer.8     Rather, Puerto\n\nRico law suggests that the intent of the settling parties is\n\ncontrolling.   See Merle, 97 D.P.R. at 409.   Thus, the language the\n\nparties used in the settlement agreement controls here.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    We have previously remarked upon \"the Puerto Rico courts'\n'general hostility to double recovery.'\" Río Mar, 522 F.3d at 166\n(quoting Villarini-García v. Hospital del Maestro, 112 F.3d 5, 8\n(1st Cir. 1997)). The instant case, however, does not present us\nwith an issue of double recovery because the settlement agreement\nhere does not represent plaintiffs' actual damages. Cf. Villarini-\nGarcía, 112 F.3d at 8 (favoring dollar-for-dollar setoff of an\nemployer's settlement in case concerning vicarious liability where\nthere existed a jury award against employee physician).\n8\n   Jurisdictions across the United States are split regarding this\nproposition of law.    The most recent Restatement sets out the\nmajority position as follows:\n\n     d. Vicariously liable parties. When multiple parties are\n     treated as a single entity for the purpose of assigning\n     responsibility . . .    a settlement with one of those\n     parties extinguishes the liability of the others.\n\nSee Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability § 16\ncmt. d (2000).\n\n     However, we note that several jurisdictions have declined to\nfollow this majority common law rule. See Ritter v. Technicolor\nCorp., 103 Cal. Rptr. 686 (Cal. Ct. App. 1972); Kellen v. Mathias,\n519 N.W.2d 218 (Minn. Ct. App. 1994); Van Cleave v.

State Farm Ins. Co.,\n299 N.W.2d 234 (Wis. 1980).\n\n                               -13-\n\f            Turning to merits of plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, in\n\nBorrego v. United States, we stated that we must consider the\n\nfollowing three elements in deciding whether to impose liability\n\nunder the doctrine of respondeat superior consistent with Puerto\n\nRico law: an employee's \"a) [d]esire to serve, benefit, or further\n\nhis employer's business or interest[;] b) [whether] the act is\n\nreasonably   related   to   the   scope   of   the   employment[;   and]   c)\n\n[whether] the agent has not been prompted by purely personal\n\nmotives.\"    790 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Among these elements, \"[t]he fundamental consideration\n\nfor determination of an employer's liability is whether or not the\n\nemployee's acts fall within the scope of his employment in the\n\nsense that they furthered a desire to serve and benefit the\n\nemployer's interest, resulting in an economic benefit to the\n\nemployer.\"    Id. (citing Martínez v. Comunidad Mateo Fajardo, 90\n\nD.P.R. 461, 1964 WL 14313 (P.R. 1964) & Lloréns v. Lozada, 73\n\nD.P.R. 271, 1952 WL 8040 (P.R. 1952)); see also Meléndez Colón v.\n\nUnited States Dep't of the Navy, 56 F. Supp. 2d 147, 151 (D.P.R.\n\n1999) (citing to rule in Borrego).\n\n            After noting that \"[t]he general rule in Puerto Rico is\n\nthat a trip made by an employee simply in order to get from his\n\nhome to his work is not one in the course of his employment,\"\n\nBorrego, 790 F.2d at 7, the Borrego court nevertheless concluded\n\nthat a supervisor working for the government was acting within the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fscope of his employment when he struck another car while driving an\n\nassigned vehicle from his home to the office.                  Id.     The court so\n\nheld    because    the    employee    used    the   assigned    vehicle      as   \"an\n\nessential part of his work and [] is obligated to take the car home\n\nso that he can perform his duties more effectively.\"                       Id.    The\n\ncourt    further    stated     that    the    employer    was        the   principal\n\nbeneficiary of the \"more efficient use of the employee's time.\"\n\nId.\n\n            The instant case turns on our determination of whether\n\nSerrano was acting within the scope of his employment when the\n\naccident occurred. However, gaps in the present complaint make our\n\ntask difficult.      Most notably, the complaint is unclear regarding\n\nthe extent to which ICN relied on Serrano's use of the car he was\n\ndriving at the time of the accident, an important factor in\n\nBorrego.     While plaintiffs allege that Serrano's vehicle was\n\ninsured by ICN's insurance policies -- an alleged fact suggesting\n\nthat ICN accepted a degree of responsibility for the vehicle and\n\nthat the vehicle may have been pertinent to Serrano's job -- the\n\ncomplaint does not provide any additional details regarding the\n\nnature of Serrano's relationship to his vehicle.                      Further, the\n\ncomplaint does not state whether Serrano was leaving the Christmas\n\nparty to go home.        If Serrano was traveling from a remote work site\n\nto home, under Borrego he may be covered.              See id. at 7-8.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f           Although this is a close case, we conclude that from the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the plaintiffs, it could reasonably be inferred that\n\nSerrano's use of the vehicle that evening was done with ICN's\n\neconomic interest in mind and that ICN benefitted from the \"more\n\nefficient use of the employee's time.\"         See Borrego, 790 F.2d at 7.\n\nWe are confident that pre-trial proceedings will help shed light on\n\nany factual disputes regarding Serrano's use of the vehicle, and\n\nwhether   ICN   benefitted   therefrom,       but    at   this   stage   of   the\n\nproceedings, it remains possible that plaintiffs have stated a\n\nclaim for recovery under Article 1803.9\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n           In sum, we hold that under Article 1802 and the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court's holding in López, ICN is not liable on\n\nplaintiffs'     claims   because    it   is    not    a    public   commercial\n\nestablishment engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages. However,\n\nwe hold that plaintiffs' vicarious liability claim under Article\n\n\n9\n    We note that in reaching its conclusion as to plaintiffs'\nArticle 1803 claim, the district court went outside the complaint\nand impermissibly relied on facts from Serrano's unsworn\ndeclaration.    These facts included that ICN, as part of a\ncompensation package, gave Serrano an automobile allowance of $9000\nper year; that Serrano owned the vehicle, not ICN; and that Serrano\npurchased the vehicle from his previous employer.       Even if we\nassume these facts to be true, other facts, including Serrano's\ndestination, are relevant to a proper scope-of-employment analysis.\nTherefore, mindful of the fact that at this stage we are required\nto draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, we believe remand\nto the district court for additional factfinding on this issue is\nthe prudent course to take.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f1803 survives because the facts as alleged in the complaint support\n\na reasonable inference that Serrano was acting within the scope of\n\nhis employment when the tragic accident occurred.\n\n          The decision of the district court is affirmed with\n\nrespect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim and reversed and remanded\n\nto the district court with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1803\n\nclaim.\n\n          Affirmed in part and Reversed and Remanded in part.

Martínez-Lloréns, with whom Luis Martínez Lloréns Law Offices, P.S.C., was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, STAHL, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This action arises from a car accident that occurred after a Christmas party held by defendant-appellee ICN Pharmaceuticals (\"ICN\") for its employees. The party was held at Palmas del Mar resort complex (\"Blue Water Palmas\"). José Serrano Torres (\"Serrano\"), an employee of ICN, allegedly left the party legally drunk and crashed into plaintiff-appellant Ruth Vernet's vehicle in a residential area in Palmas del Mar. Plaintiff-appellants<sup>[1]</sup> (\"plaintiffs\") claim that under Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, ICN is liable for the physical and economic injuries that she suffered as a result of the car accident.<sup>[2]</sup> ICN moved to dismiss the complaint and the district court granted ICN's motion. It relied on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in <i>López v. Porrata Doria</i> to dismiss the plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. <i>See</i> 2006 TSPR 149, 2006 WL 2873349 (P.R.2006) (certified translation provided by parties). The district court dismissed plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim by concluding that Serrano was not acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration we affirm the district court's ruling with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, but reverse and remand to the district court with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In their second amended complaint, plaintiffs allege the following facts relevant to the instant case. On the afternoon of December 17, 1999, ICN sponsored a Christmas party held at Blue Water Palmas in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs maintain that one of ICN's objectives in having the party was \"to develop and enhance ICN's business relationship with clients and others.\" Plaintiffs point out that although ICN decided that alcohol would be served at the party, the company failed to \"circulate to its employees a written <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> memorandum instructing them not to drink alcohol in excess.\" Further, plaintiffs claim that ICN \"did not create a committee among its employees to be on the lookout during the party for its employees and other attendees that might be having too much to drink.\"</p>\n<p>Serrano, an employee of ICN, drank liquor provided by ICN at the party. He left the party that afternoon intoxicated and proceeded to drive his vehicle. As a result of his condition, which was beyond the legal limit permissible to drive a vehicle, Serrano's automobile struck a car driven by Vernet, causing her multiple physical and economic injuries. An officer present at the scene after the accident concluded that Serrano caused the accident.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs brought suit against ICN, as well as other defendants,<sup>[3]</sup> claiming that ICN was negligent in failing to control its employees' alcohol consumption at the company activity, and in not foreseeing that Serrano's condition could endanger third parties such as Vernet. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that from the facts alleged in the second amended complaint, ICN was liable under Article 1802 for failing to implement reasonable measures to control the amount of alcohol available to its employees during a work-related activity and to control the behavior of its employees during a work-related activity. Also, plaintiffs claimed that ICN was liable under Article 1803 due to the fact that Serrano, its employee, became intoxicated at and during the course of his employment with alcoholic beverages provided by and paid for by his employer.</p>\n<p>ICN responded to plaintiffs' claims by filing a second motion to dismiss. As to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, ICN contended that in <i>López,</i> the Puerto Rico Supreme Court recognized limited dram-shop liability applicable only to commercial establishments in the business of selling alcoholic beverages.<sup>[4]</sup> Furthermore, ICN argued that even if <i>López</i> were applicable to business hosts such as itself, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court explicitly ruled that its decision would only have prospective effects. Thus, because <i>López</i> was issued after Serrano's car accident, ICN asserted that it should not face liability.</p>\n<p>Regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, ICN argued that plaintiffs' settlement with Serrano legally extinguished any possible vicarious liability on the part of ICN because any such liability was contingent upon the existence of Serrano's primary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> liability, which no longer existed by virtue of the settlement. ICN further argued that plaintiffs' claim under Article 1803 would nevertheless fail on the merits because Serrano was not acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled in favor of ICN and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appeal the district court's ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We apply <i>de novo</i> review to a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <i>Díaz-Ramos v. Hyundai Motor Co.,</i> 501 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2007). \"[W]e, like the district court, must assume the truth of all well-plead facts and give the plaintiff[s] the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom.\" <i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007). In this respect, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must establish \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 559, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Applicable Law</h2>\n<p>In diversity cases, such as the present one, state law controls the substantive outcome. <i>See </i><i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <i>Univ. Emergency Med. Found. v. Rapier Invs., Ltd.,</i> 197 F.3d 18, 19 n. 1 (1st Cir.1999). In dismissing the complaint against ICN, the district court correctly ruled that the substantive law of Puerto Rico favors ICN with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. However, we disagree with the district court's ruling regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Article 1802 and <i>López</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A brief review of <i>López</i> supports our conclusion that the district court acted correctly in dismissing plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. <i>See generally López,</i> Certified Translation.<sup>[5]</sup><i>López</i> involved an action against a commercial establishment pursuant to Puerto Rico's negligence statute, contained in Article 1802 of the Civil Code. <i>Id.</i> at **1-2. In <i>López,</i> Ricardo Calderón and Rafael Lugo-Porrata met some friends at a local bar. <i>Id.</i> at *3. Allegedly, Lugo-Porrata, even though he was visibly intoxicated, was served alcoholic beverages at a pub. <i>See id.</i> at **3, 5. Later that evening, both Calderón and Lugo-Porrata left the bar and decided to go drag racing, during which Lugo-Porrata, the driver, lost control of the vehicle and crashed. <i>Id.</i> at *4. As a result of the crash, Lugo-Porrata was killed and Calderón was severely injured. <i>Id.</i> Calderón and his parents sued the bar claiming that it was negligent in serving Lugo-Porrata alcohol when he was visibly intoxicated and its employee knew or should have known that he was going to drive a car. <i>Id.</i> at **4-5.</p>\n<p>The specific issue before the court was whether, pursuant to Article 1802, a commercial establishment could be held liable \"for supplying alcoholic beverages to a person that is visibly intoxicated and who afterward causes damages while driving an automobile under the influence of alcohol.\" <i>Id.</i> at * *1-2. The court concluded that commercial establishments could be held liable, yet stressed that its ruling would only have \"prospective effects.\" <i>Id.</i> at *2. In its analysis, the <i>López</i> court stated that despite public policy pronouncements acknowledging the dangers posed by intoxicated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> drivers, no specific legislation dealt with the controversy in that case. Thus, the court reasoned that it must apply general Puerto Rico tort law principles under Article 1802, noting that the provisions of Article 1802 \"<i>must be interpreted expansively.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at *7 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>To \"enrich [its] analysis,\" <i>id.</i> at *16, the court turned to comparative law sources in common law jurisdictions in the United States which have faced similar situations. In looking at jurisdictions in the United States, the court remarked that several courts were now \"imposing liability [on] those who sold alcoholic beverages to intoxicated... persons who subsequently caused injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at *17 (emphasis in original deleted). The court then pointed to dram-shop legislation in the United States directed at public commercial establishments, especially bars and restaurants. <i>Id.</i> at **19 &amp; n. 8. The court stated that many of these laws were passed in part to incentivize commercial vendors of alcoholic beverages to behave responsibly. <i>Id.</i> at *19.</p>\n<p>In view of these decisions and its prior case law, the court reasoned that those who irresponsibly sell alcoholic beverages with knowledge of the risk it creates \"violate[] the general duty of correctness and prudence\" and do so \"in clear disregard of the safety of others.\" <i>Id.</i> at *26. The court further noted that \"the granting of a license is a privilege, not a right\" and that \"[w]hoever profits from an activity that puts at risk the health and life of individuals has the obligation to act prudently and diligently.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court thus concluded that under Article 1802 it was \"clearly appropriate\" to impose liability on commercial vendors who provide alcoholic beverages to \"visibly intoxicated\" individuals who then cause harm to third parties by driving a vehicle while intoxicated. <i>Id.</i> at *27. The court emphasized that \"this duty of diligence when providing alcoholic beverages is <i>only</i> extended to public commercial establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). The court reasoned that commercial establishments should be singled out because unlike social hosts, for example, commercial vendors \"economically profit[] from furnishing alcohol and, therefore, ha[ve] an incentive to encourage excess consumption.\" <i>Id.</i> Further, commercial establishments can procure insurance \"against the risks assumed in getting [a business] up and running.\" <i>Id.</i> at *28. These factors, the court concluded, support limiting the duty of diligence to commercial sellers of alcoholic beverages. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Whether <i>López</i> Controls</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that <i>López</i> does not determine the outcome of this case. They maintain that <i>López</i> limited its ruling to commercial establishments and that we are presented with a different factual scenario here, emphasizing that there was an employee-employer relationship between ICN and Serrano.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> We disagree and hold that <i>López</i> controls here. Simply put, <i>López</i> does not contemplate extending liability to business hosts like ICN. Moreover, under <i>López,</i> plaintiffs' Article 1802 claims would not be cognizable because the court made clear that its decision was to be applied <i>only</i> prospectively.</p>\n<p>With respect to <i>López</i>'s controlling effect, <i>López</i> did more than just comment on the liability surrounding social hosts and commercial vendors. Rather, the <i>López</i> court, in reaching its decision, reviewed both the principles underlying Article 1802 and the various approaches courts throughout the United States have taken historically towards dram-shop liability. After this comprehensive review, which included a case involving a business host, <i>see </i><i>McGee v. Alexander,</i> 2001 OK 78, 37 P.3d 800 (2001), the <i>López</i> court concluded that \"the duty of diligence when providing alcoholic beverages is <i>only</i> extended to public commercial establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages.\" <i>López,</i> Certified Translation at *27 (emphasis in original). Although plaintiffs characterize the court's holding as a narrow one, the court's analysis instead suggests that it was opining on the larger question of when liability extends to someone who has provided alcohol to an intoxicated person who then causes harm to a third party. It is clear from our reading of <i>López</i> that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not contemplate that dram-shop liability would extend to business hosts like ICN.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to conclude that ICN should be treated like a commercial vendor under <i>López,</i> plaintiffs' claims would still fail. The <i>López</i> court explicitly stated that its ruling was to apply prospectively from October 6, 2006, the date of its decision. Plaintiffs' action would have arisen, had they otherwise qualified, seven years before the operative date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Article 1803</h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether, under Puerto Rico law, plaintiffs' claims were extinguished by their settlement with Serrano. \"[T]he default rule under Puerto Rico law... recognizes the settling parties' intent as controlling.\" <i>Río Mar Assocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc.,</i> 522 F.3d 159, 166 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Szendrey v. Hospicare, Inc.,</i> 158 D.P.R. 648, 657-58, 2003 WL 751582 (2003)). Plaintiffs' settlement agreement provides as follows: \"Notwithstanding, plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to continue prosecuting their causes of actions against codefendants [ICN, Blue Water Palmas], their insurance companies and any other person or entity who might be liable to them, all in accordance with <i>Merle v. West Bend, Co.,</i> 97 D.P.R. 403, [1969 WL 21616 (P.R.1969)].\" From this language it is evident that plaintiffs did not intend for the settlement agreement with Serrano to extinguish their claims against ICN under either Articles 1802 or 1803. <i>See </i><i>Hopgood v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith,</i> 839 F.Supp. 98, 106 (D.P.R.1993) (noting the <i>Merle</i> court's conclusion that \"[t]he clear terms of the settlement agreement reflected the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract and controlled the outcome of the case\").<sup>[7]</sup> We are not aware of, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> ICN has not cited to, a case under Puerto Rico law that holds that a plaintiff's settlement with an employee extinguishes a vicarious liability claim against the employer.<sup>[8]</sup> Rather, Puerto Rico law suggests that the intent of the settling parties is controlling. <i>See </i><i>Merle,</i> 97 D.P.R. at 409. Thus, the language the parties used in the settlement agreement controls here.</p>\n<p>Turning to merits of plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, in <i>Borrego v. United States,</i> we stated that we must consider the following three elements in deciding whether to impose liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior consistent with Puerto Rico law: an employee's \"a) [d]esire to serve, benefit, or further his employer's business or interest[;] b) [whether] the act is reasonably related to the scope of the employment[; and] c) [whether] the agent has not been prompted by purely personal motives.\" 790 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). Among these elements, \"[t]he fundamental consideration for determination of an employer's liability is whether or not the employee's acts fall within the scope of his employment in the sense that they furthered a desire to serve and benefit the employer's interest, resulting in an economic benefit to the employer.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Martínez v. Comunidad Mateo Fajardo,</i> 90 D.P.R. 461, 1964 WL 14313 (1964) &amp; <i>Lloréns v. Lozada,</i> 73 D.P.R. 271, 1952 WL 8040 (1952)); <i>see also </i><i>Meléndez-Colón v. United States Dep't of the Navy,</i> 56 F.Supp.2d 147, 151 (D.P.R. 1999) (citing to rule in <i>Borrego</i>).</p>\n<p>After noting that \"[t]he general rule in Puerto Rico is that a trip made by an employee simply in order to get from his home to his work is not one in the course of his employment,\" <i>Borrego,</i> 790 F.2d at 7, the <i>Borrego</i> court nevertheless concluded that a supervisor working for the government was acting within the scope of his employment when he struck another car while driving an assigned vehicle from his home to the office. <i>Id.</i> The court so held because the employee used the assigned vehicle as \"an essential part of his work and [ ] is obligated to take the car home so that he can perform his duties more effectively.\" <i>Id.</i> The court further stated that the employer was the principal beneficiary of the \"more efficient use of the employee's time.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The instant case turns on our determination of whether Serrano was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred. However, gaps in the present complaint make our task difficult. Most notably, the complaint is unclear regarding the extent to which ICN relied on Serrano's use of the car he was driving at the time of the accident, an important factor in <i>Borrego.</i> While plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> allege that Serrano's vehicle was insured by ICN's insurance policiesan alleged fact suggesting that ICN accepted a degree of responsibility for the vehicle and that the vehicle may have been pertinent to Serrano's jobthe complaint does not provide any additional details regarding the nature of Serrano's relationship to his vehicle. Further, the complaint does not state whether Serrano was leaving the Christmas party to go home. If Serrano was traveling from a remote work site to home, under <i>Borrego</i> he may be covered. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8.</p>\n<p>Although this is a close case, we conclude that from the facts alleged in the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, it could reasonably be inferred that Serrano's use of the vehicle that evening was done with ICN's economic interest in mind and that ICN benefited from the \"more efficient use of the employee's time.\" <i>See Borrego,</i> 790 F.2d at 7. We are confident that pre-trial proceedings will help shed light on any factual disputes regarding Serrano's use of the vehicle, and whether ICN benefited therefrom, but at this stage of the proceedings, it remains possible that plaintiffs have stated a claim for recovery under Article 1803.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In sum, we hold that under Article 1802 and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's holding in <i>López,</i> ICN is not liable on plaintiffs' claims because it is not a public commercial establishment engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages. However, we hold that plaintiffs' vicarious liability claim under Article 1803 survives because the facts as alleged in the complaint support a reasonable inference that Serrano was acting within the scope of his employment when the tragic accident occurred.</p>\n<p>The decision of the district court is affirmed with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim and reversed and remanded to the district court with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part and Reversed and Remanded in part.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Plaintiff-Appellants include the victim, Ruth Vernet; her spouse, Frank Vernet; and her two sons, Alexander Vernet and David Vernet.</p>\n<p>[2]  Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" P.R.

On March 22, 2001 the district court entered judgment, dismissing the complaint without prejudice as to Ford Motor Company. On April 3, 2002, plaintiffs, Serrano, and Serrano's insurance company filed a settlement stipulation. On April 25, 2002, the district court entered a partial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs' claim against Serrano and his insurance company. On September 25, 2006 Blue Water Palmas and plaintiffs filed a settlement agreement in the amount of $300,000 for their alleged liability in having served Serrano excessive amounts of liquor during the course of the ICN company party. On October 3, 2006 the district court entered partial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs' claim against Blue Water Palmas. Consequently, the only remaining parties are the plaintiffs and ICN.</p>\n<p>[4]  We have previously described the theory of dram-shop liability as one where \"a bar or tavern may be liable for the wrongful or injurious actions of a patron if it served alcohol to that patron after it knew, or should have known, that the patron was already intoxicated.\" <i>Phoung Luc v. Wyndham Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 85, 88 n. 2 (1st Cir.2007) (referring to dram-shop liability under Massachusetts law). Puerto Rico does not have a dram-shop statute.</p>\n<p>[5]  There does not appear to be an official translation. However, the parties cite to an undisputed certified translation, which we cite to as well.</p>\n<p>[6]  Plaintiffs stress in their brief that \"[o]ne of the principal purposes of ICN in having the party during working hours, on a work day, and where employee-attendance was mandatory was to foment and preserve a good relationship between management and regular employees, as well as between regular employees.\" Plaintiffs also claim that during the planning phase of the party, ICN budgeted for and took as a business expense the cost of providing alcoholic beverages. Further, plaintiffs allege that prior to the day of the party, ICN neither circulated a memorandum among its employees instructing them to refrain from drinking excessively so as to not jeopardize the well being of third persons during or after the party; nor did ICN create a committee to watch over employees so that they would not drink excessively.</p>\n<p>[7]  We have previously remarked upon \"the Puerto Rico courts' `general hostility to double recovery.'\" <i>Río Mar,</i> 522 F.3d at 166 (quoting <i>Villarini-García v. Hospital Del Maestro,</i> 112 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1997)). The instant case, however, does not present us with an issue of double recovery because the settlement agreement here does not represent plaintiffs' actual damages. <i>Cf. </i><i>Villarini-García,</i> 112 F.3d at 8 (favoring dollar-for-dollar setoff of an employer's settlement in case concerning vicarious liability where there existed a jury award against employee physician).</p>\n<p>[8]  Jurisdictions across the United States are split regarding this proposition of law. The most recent Restatement sets out the majority position as follows:\n</p>\n<p><i>d. Vicariously liable parties.</i> When multiple parties are treated as a single entity for the purpose of assigning responsibility ... a settlement with one of those parties extinguishes the liability of the others.</p>\n<p><i>See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability</i> § 16 cmt. d (2000).</p>\n<p>However, we note that several jurisdictions have declined to follow this majority common law rule. <i>See </i><i>Ritter v. Technicolor Corp.,</i> 27 Cal.App.3d 152, 103 Cal.Rptr. 686 (1972); <i>Kellen v. Mathias,</i> 519 N.W.2d 218 (Minn.Ct. App. 1994); <i>Van Cleave v. Gamboni Constr. Co.,</i> 101 Nev. 524, 706 P.2d 845 (1985); <i>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey,</i> 81 N.J. 548, 410 A.2d 674 (1980); <i>Vanderpool v. Grange Ins. Ass'n,</i> 110 Wash.2d 483, 756 P.2d 111 (1988); <i>Swanigan v. State Farm Ins. Co.,</i> 99 Wis.2d 179, 299 N.W.2d 234 (1980).</p>\n<p>[9]  We note that in reaching its conclusion as to plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, the district court went outside the complaint and impermissibly relied on facts from Serrano's unsworn declaration. These facts included that ICN, as part of a compensation package, gave Serrano an automobile allowance of $9000 per year; that Serrano owned the vehicle, not ICN; and that Serrano purchased the vehicle from his previous employer. Even if we assume these facts to be true, other facts, including Serrano's destination, are relevant to a proper scope-of-employment analysis. Therefore, mindful of the fact that at this stage we are required to draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, we believe remand to the district court for additional factfinding on this issue is the prudent course to take.</p>\n\n</div>",

Martínez-Lloréns, with whom Luis Martínez Lloréns Law Offices, P.S.C., was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, STAHL, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This action arises from a car accident that occurred after a Christmas party held by defendant-appellee ICN Pharmaceuticals (\"ICN\") for its employees. The party was held at Palmas del Mar resort complex (\"Blue Water Palmas\"). José Serrano Torres (\"Serrano\"), an employee of ICN, allegedly left the party legally drunk and crashed into plaintiff-appellant Ruth Vernet's vehicle in a residential area in Palmas del Mar. Plaintiff-appellants<sup>[1]</sup> (\"plaintiffs\") claim that under Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, ICN is liable for the physical and economic injuries that she suffered as a result of the car accident.<sup>[2]</sup> ICN moved to dismiss the complaint and the district court granted ICN's motion. It relied on the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in <i>López v. Porrata Doria</i> to dismiss the plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. <i>See</i> 2006 TSPR 149, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2873349</span></span> (P.R.2006) (certified translation provided by parties). The district court dismissed plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim by concluding that Serrano was not acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p>After careful consideration we affirm the district court's ruling with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, but reverse and remand to the district court with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In their second amended complaint, plaintiffs allege the following facts relevant to the instant case. On the afternoon of December 17, 1999, ICN sponsored a Christmas party held at Blue Water Palmas in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs maintain that one of ICN's objectives in having the party was \"to develop and enhance ICN's business relationship with clients and others.\" Plaintiffs point out that although ICN decided that alcohol would be served at the party, the company failed to \"circulate to its employees a written <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> memorandum instructing them not to drink alcohol in excess.\" Further, plaintiffs claim that ICN \"did not create a committee among its employees to be on the lookout during the party for its employees and other attendees that might be having too much to drink.\"</p>\n<p>Serrano, an employee of ICN, drank liquor provided by ICN at the party. He left the party that afternoon intoxicated and proceeded to drive his vehicle. As a result of his condition, which was beyond the legal limit permissible to drive a vehicle, Serrano's automobile struck a car driven by Vernet, causing her multiple physical and economic injuries. An officer present at the scene after the accident concluded that Serrano caused the accident.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs brought suit against ICN, as well as other defendants,<sup>[3]</sup> claiming that ICN was negligent in failing to control its employees' alcohol consumption at the company activity, and in not foreseeing that Serrano's condition could endanger third parties such as Vernet. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that from the facts alleged in the second amended complaint, ICN was liable under Article 1802 for failing to implement reasonable measures to control the amount of alcohol available to its employees during a work-related activity and to control the behavior of its employees during a work-related activity. Also, plaintiffs claimed that ICN was liable under Article 1803 due to the fact that Serrano, its employee, became intoxicated at and during the course of his employment with alcoholic beverages provided by and paid for by his employer.</p>\n<p>ICN responded to plaintiffs' claims by filing a second motion to dismiss. As to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim, ICN contended that in <i>López,</i> the Puerto Rico Supreme Court recognized limited dram-shop liability applicable only to commercial establishments in the business of selling alcoholic beverages.<sup>[4]</sup> Furthermore, ICN argued that even if <i>López</i> were applicable to business hosts such as itself, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court explicitly ruled that its decision would only have prospective effects. Thus, because <i>López</i> was issued after Serrano's car accident, ICN asserted that it should not face liability.</p>\n<p>Regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, ICN argued that plaintiffs' settlement with Serrano legally extinguished any possible vicarious liability on the part of ICN because any such liability was contingent upon the existence of Serrano's primary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> liability, which no longer existed by virtue of the settlement. ICN further argued that plaintiffs' claim under Article 1803 would nevertheless fail on the merits because Serrano was not acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled in favor of ICN and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appeal the district court's ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

In dismissing the complaint against ICN, the district court correctly ruled that the substantive law of Puerto Rico favors ICN with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. However, we disagree with the district court's ruling regarding plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Article 1802 and <i>López</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A brief review of <i>López</i> supports our conclusion that the district court acted correctly in dismissing plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim. <i>See generally López,</i> Certified Translation.<sup>[5]</sup><i>López</i> involved an action against a commercial establishment pursuant to Puerto Rico's negligence statute, contained in Article 1802 of the Civil Code. <i>Id.</i> at **1-2. In <i>López,</i> Ricardo Calderón and Rafael Lugo-Porrata met some friends at a local bar. <i>Id.</i> at *3. Allegedly, Lugo-Porrata, even though he was visibly intoxicated, was served alcoholic beverages at a pub. <i>See id.</i> at **3, 5. Later that evening, both Calderón and Lugo-Porrata left the bar and decided to go drag racing, during which Lugo-Porrata, the driver, lost control of the vehicle and crashed. <i>Id.</i> at *4. As a result of the crash, Lugo-Porrata was killed and Calderón was severely injured. <i>Id.</i> Calderón and his parents sued the bar claiming that it was negligent in serving Lugo-Porrata alcohol when he was visibly intoxicated and its employee knew or should have known that he was going to drive a car. <i>Id.</i> at **4-5.</p>\n<p>The specific issue before the court was whether, pursuant to Article 1802, a commercial establishment could be held liable \"for supplying alcoholic beverages to a person that is visibly intoxicated and who afterward causes damages while driving an automobile under the influence of alcohol.\" <i>Id.</i> at * *1-2. The court concluded that commercial establishments could be held liable, yet stressed that its ruling would only have \"prospective effects.\" <i>Id.</i> at *2. In its analysis, the <i>López</i> court stated that despite public policy pronouncements acknowledging the dangers posed by intoxicated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> drivers, no specific legislation dealt with the controversy in that case. Thus, the court reasoned that it must apply general Puerto Rico tort law principles under Article 1802, noting that the provisions of Article 1802 \"<i>must be interpreted expansively.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at *7 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>To \"enrich [its] analysis,\" <i>id.</i> at *16, the court turned to comparative law sources in common law jurisdictions in the United States which have faced similar situations. In looking at jurisdictions in the United States, the court remarked that several courts were now \"imposing liability [on] those who sold alcoholic beverages to intoxicated... persons who subsequently caused injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at *17 (emphasis in original deleted). The court then pointed to dram-shop legislation in the United States directed at public commercial establishments, especially bars and restaurants. <i>Id.</i> at **19 &amp; n. 8. The court stated that many of these laws were passed in part to incentivize commercial vendors of alcoholic beverages to behave responsibly. <i>Id.</i> at *19.</p>\n<p>In view of these decisions and its prior case law, the court reasoned that those who irresponsibly sell alcoholic beverages with knowledge of the risk it creates \"violate[] the general duty of correctness and prudence\" and do so \"in clear disregard of the safety of others.\" <i>Id.</i> at *26. The court further noted that \"the granting of a license is a privilege, not a right\" and that \"[w]hoever profits from an activity that puts at risk the health and life of individuals has the obligation to act prudently and diligently.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court thus concluded that under Article 1802 it was \"clearly appropriate\" to impose liability on commercial vendors who provide alcoholic beverages to \"visibly intoxicated\" individuals who then cause harm to third parties by driving a vehicle while intoxicated. <i>Id.</i> at *27. The court emphasized that \"this duty of diligence when providing alcoholic beverages is <i>only</i> extended to public commercial establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). The court reasoned that commercial establishments should be singled out because unlike social hosts, for example, commercial vendors \"economically profit[] from furnishing alcohol and, therefore, ha[ve] an incentive to encourage excess consumption.\" <i>Id.</i> Further, commercial establishments can procure insurance \"against the risks assumed in getting [a business] up and running.\" <i>Id.</i> at *28. These factors, the court concluded, support limiting the duty of diligence to commercial sellers of alcoholic beverages. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Whether <i>López</i> Controls</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that <i>López</i> does not determine the outcome of this case. They maintain that <i>López</i> limited its ruling to commercial establishments and that we are presented with a different factual scenario here, emphasizing that there was an employee-employer relationship between ICN and Serrano.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> We disagree and hold that <i>López</i> controls here. Simply put, <i>López</i> does not contemplate extending liability to business hosts like ICN. Moreover, under <i>López,</i> plaintiffs' Article 1802 claims would not be cognizable because the court made clear that its decision was to be applied <i>only</i> prospectively.</p>\n<p>With respect to <i>López</i>'s controlling effect, <i>López</i> did more than just comment on the liability surrounding social hosts and commercial vendors. Rather, the <i>López</i> court, in reaching its decision, reviewed both the principles underlying Article 1802 and the various approaches courts throughout the United States have taken historically towards dram-shop liability. After this comprehensive review, which included a case involving a business host, <i>see </i><i>McGee v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2602317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2602317/mcgee-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2602317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2602317/mcgee-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span> (2001), the <i>López</i> court concluded that \"the duty of diligence when providing alcoholic beverages is <i>only</i> extended to public commercial establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages.\" <i>López,</i> Certified Translation at *27 (emphasis in original). Although plaintiffs characterize the court's holding as a narrow one, the court's analysis instead suggests that it was opining on the larger question of when liability extends to someone who has provided alcohol to an intoxicated person who then causes harm to a third party. It is clear from our reading of <i>López</i> that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not contemplate that dram-shop liability would extend to business hosts like ICN.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to conclude that ICN should be treated like a commercial vendor under <i>López,</i> plaintiffs' claims would still fail. The <i>López</i> court explicitly stated that its ruling was to apply prospectively from October 6, 2006, the date of its decision. Plaintiffs' action would have arisen, had they otherwise qualified, seven years before the operative date.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Article 1803</h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether, under Puerto Rico law, plaintiffs' claims were extinguished by their settlement with Serrano. \"[T]he default rule under Puerto Rico law... recognizes the settling parties' intent as controlling.\" <i>Río Mar Assocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span>, 166 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>Szendrey v. Hospicare, Inc.,</i> 158 D.P.R. 648, 657-58, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">751582</span></span> (2003)). Plaintiffs' settlement agreement provides as follows: \"Notwithstanding, plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to continue prosecuting their causes of actions against codefendants [ICN, Blue Water Palmas], their insurance companies and any other person or entity who might be liable to them, all in accordance with <i>Merle v. West Bend, Co.,</i> 97 D.P.R. 403, [1969 WL 21616 (P.R.1969)].\" From this language it is evident that plaintiffs did not intend for the settlement agreement with Serrano to extinguish their claims against ICN under either Articles 1802 or 1803. <i>See </i><i>Hopgood v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444178\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444178/hopgood-v-merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 106 (D.P.R.1993) (noting the <i>Merle</i> court's conclusion that \"[t]he clear terms of the settlement agreement reflected the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract and controlled the outcome of the case\").<sup>[7]</sup> We are not aware of, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> ICN has not cited to, a case under Puerto Rico law that holds that a plaintiff's settlement with an employee extinguishes a vicarious liability claim against the employer.<sup>[8]</sup> Rather, Puerto Rico law suggests that the intent of the settling parties is controlling. <i>See </i><i>Merle,</i> 97 D.P.R. at 409. Thus, the language the parties used in the settlement agreement controls here.</p>\n<p>Turning to merits of plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim, in <i>Borrego v. United States,</i> we stated that we must consider the following three elements in deciding whether to impose liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior consistent with Puerto Rico law: an employee's \"a) [d]esire to serve, benefit, or further his employer's business or interest[;] b) [whether] the act is reasonably related to the scope of the employment[; and] c) [whether] the agent has not been prompted by purely personal motives.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469473\"><a href=\"/opinion/469473/denise-devore-borrego-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). Among these elements, \"[t]he fundamental consideration for determination of an employer's liability is whether or not the employee's acts fall within the scope of his employment in the sense that they furthered a desire to serve and benefit the employer's interest, resulting in an economic benefit to the employer.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Martínez v. Comunidad Mateo Fajardo,</i> 90 D.P.R. 461, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">14313</span></span> (1964) &amp; <i>Lloréns v. Lozada,</i> 73 D.P.R. 271, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">8040</span></span> (1952)); <i>see also </i><i>Meléndez-Colón v. United States Dep't of the Navy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449179\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449179/melendez-colon-v-us-dept-of-the-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 151 (D.P.R. 1999) (citing to rule in <i>Borrego</i>).</p>\n<p>After noting that \"[t]he general rule in Puerto Rico is that a trip made by an employee simply in order to get from his home to his work is not one in the course of his employment,\" <i>Borrego,</i> 790 F.2d at 7, the <i>Borrego</i> court nevertheless concluded that a supervisor working for the government was acting within the scope of his employment when he struck another car while driving an assigned vehicle from his home to the office. <i>Id.</i> The court so held because the employee used the assigned vehicle as \"an essential part of his work and [ ] is obligated to take the car home so that he can perform his duties more effectively.\" <i>Id.</i> The court further stated that the employer was the principal beneficiary of the \"more efficient use of the employee's time.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The instant case turns on our determination of whether Serrano was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred. However, gaps in the present complaint make our task difficult. Most notably, the complaint is unclear regarding the extent to which ICN relied on Serrano's use of the car he was driving at the time of the accident, an important factor in <i>Borrego.</i> While plaintiffs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> allege that Serrano's vehicle was insured by ICN's insurance policiesan alleged fact suggesting that ICN accepted a degree of responsibility for the vehicle and that the vehicle may have been pertinent to Serrano's jobthe complaint does not provide any additional details regarding the nature of Serrano's relationship to his vehicle. Further, the complaint does not state whether Serrano was leaving the Christmas party to go home. If Serrano was traveling from a remote work site to home, under <i>Borrego</i> he may be covered. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8.</p>\n<p>Although this is a close case, we conclude that from the facts alleged in the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, it could reasonably be inferred that Serrano's use of the vehicle that evening was done with ICN's economic interest in mind and that ICN benefited from the \"more efficient use of the employee's time.\" <i>See Borrego,</i> 790 F.2d at 7. We are confident that pre-trial proceedings will help shed light on any factual disputes regarding Serrano's use of the vehicle, and whether ICN benefited therefrom, but at this stage of the proceedings, it remains possible that plaintiffs have stated a claim for recovery under Article 1803.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In sum, we hold that under Article 1802 and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's holding in <i>López,</i> ICN is not liable on plaintiffs' claims because it is not a public commercial establishment engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages. However, we hold that plaintiffs' vicarious liability claim under Article 1803 survives because the facts as alleged in the complaint support a reasonable inference that Serrano was acting within the scope of his employment when the tragic accident occurred.</p>\n<p>The decision of the district court is affirmed with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1802 claim and reversed and remanded to the district court with respect to plaintiffs' Article 1803 claim.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part and Reversed and Remanded in part.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Plaintiff-Appellants include the victim, Ruth Vernet; her spouse, Frank Vernet; and her two sons, Alexander Vernet and David Vernet.</p>\n<p>[2]  Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141.\n</p>\n<p>Article 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code states:</p>\n<p>The obligation imposed by [Article 1802] is demandable, not only for personal acts and omissions, but also for those of the persons for whom they should be responsible....

On March 22, 2001 the district court entered judgment, dismissing the complaint without prejudice as to Ford Motor Company. On April 3, 2002, plaintiffs, Serrano, and Serrano's insurance company filed a settlement stipulation. On April 25, 2002, the district court entered a partial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs' claim against Serrano and his insurance company. On September 25, 2006 Blue Water Palmas and plaintiffs filed a settlement agreement in the amount of $300,000 for their alleged liability in having served Serrano excessive amounts of liquor during the course of the ICN company party. On October 3, 2006 the district court entered partial judgment, dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs' claim against Blue Water Palmas. Consequently, the only remaining parties are the plaintiffs and ICN.</p>\n<p>[4]  We have previously described the theory of dram-shop liability as one where \"a bar or tavern may be liable for the wrongful or injurious actions of a patron if it served alcohol to that patron after it knew, or should have known, that the patron was already intoxicated.\" <i>Phoung Luc v. Wyndham Mgmt. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 88 n. 2 (1st Cir.2007) (referring to dram-shop liability under Massachusetts law). Puerto Rico does not have a dram-shop statute.</p>\n<p>[5]  There does not appear to be an official translation. However, the parties cite to an undisputed certified translation, which we cite to as well.</p>\n<p>[6]  Plaintiffs stress in their brief that \"[o]ne of the principal purposes of ICN in having the party during working hours, on a work day, and where employee-attendance was mandatory was to foment and preserve a good relationship between management and regular employees, as well as between regular employees.\" Plaintiffs also claim that during the planning phase of the party, ICN budgeted for and took as a business expense the cost of providing alcoholic beverages. Further, plaintiffs allege that prior to the day of the party, ICN neither circulated a memorandum among its employees instructing them to refrain from drinking excessively so as to not jeopardize the well being of third persons during or after the party; nor did ICN create a committee to watch over employees so that they would not drink excessively.</p>\n<p>[7]  We have previously remarked upon \"the Puerto Rico courts' `general hostility to double recovery.'\" <i>Río Mar,</i> 522 F.3d at 166 (quoting <i>Villarini-García v. Hospital Del Maestro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197320\"><a href=\"/opinion/197320/villarini-garcia-v-tomasini/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1997)). The instant case, however, does not present us with an issue of double recovery because the settlement agreement here does not represent plaintiffs' actual damages. <i>Cf. </i><i>Villarini-García,</i> 112 F.3d at 8 (favoring dollar-for-dollar setoff of an employer's settlement in case concerning vicarious liability where there existed a jury award against employee physician).</p>\n<p>[8]  Jurisdictions across the United States are split regarding this proposition of law. The most recent Restatement sets out the majority position as follows:\n</p>\n<p><i>d. Vicariously liable parties.</i> When multiple parties are treated as a single entity for the purpose of assigning responsibility ... a settlement with one of those parties extinguishes the liability of the others.</p>\n<p><i>See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability</i> § 16 cmt. d (2000).</p>\n<p>However, we note that several jurisdictions have declined to follow this majority common law rule. <i>See </i><i>Ritter v.

These facts included that ICN, as part of a compensation package, gave Serrano an automobile allowance of $9000 per year; that Serrano owned the vehicle, not ICN; and that Serrano purchased the vehicle from his previous employer. Even if we assume these facts to be true, other facts, including Serrano's destination, are relevant to a proper scope-of-employment analysis. Therefore, mindful of the fact that at this stage we are required to draw all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, we believe remand to the district court for additional factfinding on this issue is the prudent course to take.</p>\n\n</div>",
