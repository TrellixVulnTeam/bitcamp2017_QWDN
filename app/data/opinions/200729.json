R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 02-2347\n\n                       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n                               Appellee,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                            HARRY J. BURDICK,\n                          Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n      [Hon. Ronald R. Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Warren M. Yanoff, with whom Yanoff & Valletta was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Gerard B.\nSullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n                            November 13, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam.    On December 18, 2000, a federal grand jury\n\nin the District of Rhode Island returned an indictment charging,\n\ninter alios, defendant-appellant Harry J. Burdick with conspiracy\n\nto commit carjacking and carjacking with death resulting.            See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 371, 2119, 2119(3).         In due course, Burdick pled guilty\n\nto both counts pursuant to a plea agreement that pretermitted the\n\npossibility of a death sentence.\n\n           The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nOctober 8, 2002.   The court set Burdick's base offense level at 43.\n\nWith a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, USSG\n\n§3E1.1, the offense level dipped to 40.            Given his 14 criminal\n\nhistory points, the court placed him in criminal history category\n\nVI.   These determinations yielded a guideline sentencing range of\n\n360 months to life imprisonment.        Burdick neither contested these\n\ncalculations nor sought a downward departure.             The government,\n\nhowever,   asked   the   court   to    depart   upward   (the   presentence\n\ninvestigation report noted five possible bases for an upward\n\ndeparture).\n\n           During his allocution, Burdick stated:          \"I want to say\n\nthat I feel that I deserve life imprisonment.            I don't belong on\n\nthe streets.\"   He then told the court that:       \"I deserve the maximum\n\nsentence which is life in prison.\"          Burdick's counsel adopted the\n\nsame stance, recommending the imposition of a life sentence.            The\n\ncourt denied the government's motion for an upward departure but\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fnonetheless granted Burdick's request for a life sentence (the\n\nhighest sentence available within the applicable guideline range).\n\nThe court concluded:     \"If I had the power to impose the death\n\nsentence, I would.\"\n\n            We need not tarry.   On appeal, Burdick is represented by\n\na new attorney.   He does not challenge any of the district court's\n\nguideline   computations;   instead,    he   claims    that   he   received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.              According to\n\nBurdick, this substandard performance consisted of (i) his original\n\nlawyer's failure to develop evidence concerning his mental status,\n\nand (ii) her willingness to recommend life imprisonment (the\n\nsentence that Burdick himself implored the court to impose).\n\n            This fact-specific claim has never been presented to the\n\nlower court.    Consequently, it is premature.        In United States v.\n\nMala, 7 F.3d 1058 (1st Cir. 1993), we wrote:\n\n            We have held with a regularity bordering on\n            the monotonous that fact-specific claims of\n            ineffective assistance cannot make their debut\n            on direct review of criminal convictions, but,\n            rather, must originally be presented to, and\n            acted upon by, the trial court.\n\nId. at 1063.    We explained the reason for the rule:\n\n            Since claims of ineffective assistance involve\n            a binary analysis — the defendant must show,\n            first,   that    counsel's   performance   was\n            constitutionally deficient and, second, that\n            the deficient performance prejudiced the\n            defense — such claims typically require the\n            resolution of factual issues that cannot\n            efficaciously be addressed in the first\n            instance by an appellate tribunal.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fId. (citations omitted).        We then described the usual praxis for\n\nlitigating such claims:\n\n              When   faced   with  similar   situations   in\n              comparable cases, we have routinely dismissed\n              the relevant portion of the appeal without\n              prejudice to the defendant's right to litigate\n              his ineffective assistance claim through the\n              medium of an application for post-conviction\n              relief.\n\nId.\n\n              Although we have made an occasional exception in cases in\n\nwhich   the    record   is   fully   developed   on   all   aspects   of   the\n\nineffective assistance claim, see, e.g., United States v. Natanel,\n\n938 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991), the Mala rule has for the most\n\npart been followed assiduously.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir. 2003); United States\n\nv. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct.\n\n216 (2002); United States v. Hoyle, 237 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 122 S. Ct. 343 (2001); United States v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d\n\n58, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).       Indeed, the Supreme Court recently placed\n\nits imprimatur on this approach. See Massaro v. United States, 123\n\nS. Ct. 1690, 1692-96 (2003).\n\n              We follow the Mala rule here. The narrow exception to it\n\nis plainly inapposite because there has been no development of a\n\nnumber of material facts.       On the present record, it is impossible\n\nto gauge what investigation defense counsel undertook, what further\n\ninvestigation (if any) might have been appropriate, what benefit\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsuch further investigation might have yielded, or what interactions\n\nbetween   Burdick   and   his   attorney   might   have   influenced   the\n\nsentencing recommendation.\n\n           We need go no further.        We affirm the judgment below,\n\nwithout prejudice, however, to appellant's right to raise his claim\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in a post-conviction relief\n\nproceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.          We intimate no\n\nview as to the outcome of any such proceeding.\n\n\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
