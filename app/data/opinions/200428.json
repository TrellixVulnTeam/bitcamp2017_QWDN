Plaintiffs-appellants Latin\n\nAmerican Music Company (\"LAMCO\") and Asociacion de Compositores y\n\nEditores de Musica Latino Americana (\"ACEMLA\") appeal the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellees on all of\n\nplaintiffs'     copyright      claims     and   its    subsequent   denial     of\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.               Finding no error in the\n\ncourt's rulings, we affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n     The facts are largely undisputed. Plaintiffs are corporations\n\nthat claim rights in several songs performed as part of a play\n\nabout composer Hector Lavoe's life (\"Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe?\"),\n\nproduced in New York City in 1999 and San Juan, Puerto Rico, in\n\n2000.    The songs were written by Hector Lavoe (the stage name for\n\nHector Perez), by Lavoe with Wilfredo Colon, or by Catalino \"Tite\"\n\nCuret Alonso.1\n\n        Plaintiffs   alleged    that     defendants,    who   created   or   were\n\ninvolved in the production of the play, violated their rights by\n\nperforming     the   songs     without    obtaining     licenses    from     them.\n\nDefendants responded that they had obtained valid licenses from the\n\nrightful copyright transferee, Fania Publishing Company, through\n\nSonido, Inc.\n\n\n     1\n      We note that the district court found that one of the songs\nin which plaintiffs claimed rights, \"Todo Tiene Su Final,\" was\ncomposed by Colon alone. Because the plaintiffs acknowledge having\nno claims to any songs written by Colon alone, we do not consider\nthis song.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f     Fania, the original copyright transferee, had entered into\n\nStandard Songwriters Agreements (\"SSAs\") with Lavoe and Alonso in\n\nthe 1970s and 1980s that assigned Fania copyright interests in five\n\nof the six songs at issue (\"Paraiso de Dulzura,\" \"Periodico de\n\nAyer,\" \"Pirana,\" \"El Todopoderoso,\" and \"La Fama\").         Defendants\n\nproduced a Certificate of Registration from the U.S. Copyright\n\nOffice, filed by Fania as the \"Copyright Claimant,\" for the final\n\nsong, \"La Murga.\"\n\n     For each composition, the SSAs encompassed:\n\n     all musical and non-musical rights therein, the title,\n     words and music thereof, (and all literary characters\n     contained therein), the worldwide copyright thereof and\n     the right to secure copyright therein throughout the\n     entire world and to have and to hold the said copyright\n     together with all of their right, title and interest,\n     both legal and equitable therein, including but not\n     limited to the sole and exclusive worldwide publication,\n     mechanical reproducing, and motion picture and television\n     synchronization   rights   and   the  right   of   public\n     performance by any means, and all other rights now known\n     or hereafter to come into existence, subject to the terms\n     of this agreement.\n\nEach SSA was binding on \"the respective parties hereto, their\n\nrespective   successors   in   interest,   legal   representatives   and\n\nassigns and . . . cannot be terminated, or amended except by a\n\nwriting signed by all of the parties hereto.\"2\n\n\n     2\n      The one SSA executed in the 1980s, by Lavoe, contained\nslightly altered language. It pertained to the composition \"La\nFama\" and assigned \"the title words and music, and all copyrights\nthereof . . . and all rights, claims and demands in any way\nrelating thereto, and the exclusive right to secure copyright\ntherein throughout the entire world.\" It applied to successors in\ninterest, but did not require termination by mutual agreement in\n\n                                  -4-\n\f     Sonido had obtained copyright licenses for the songs from\n\nValsyn, which owned Fania Publishing, and subsequently leased them\n\nto defendants.     As evidence of this transfer of rights, defendants\n\nprovided a series of licensing agreements: an October 1, 1986,\n\nlicensing agreement between Valsyn and Sonido, wherein Valsyn\n\nconveyed to Sonido a license to use the songs at issue while\n\nretaining ownership of the copyrights; a renewal of the agreement\n\nbetween Valsyn and Sonido extending its expiration from December\n\n31, 1999, to December 31, 2004; and an agreement between defendant\n\nCFDM Theatrical Productions and Sonido dated July 5, 1999, in which\n\nCFDM licensed the songs to be used in the play's production.3\n\n     Plaintiffs suggested that Alonso had sought to terminate the\n\nSSAs,    producing   a   1983   letter    from   Alonso     to   Fania,   which\n\napparently indicated his desire to end the agreements. With regard\n\nto   Lavoe's    compositions,    plaintiffs      produced    assignments    of\n\ncopyrights they received from Lavoe's son, Jose Perez, after Lavoe\n\ndied in 1993.        Perez registered the copyrights with the U.S.\n\nCopyright Office in 1999 and subsequently assigned the copyrights\n\nto LAMCO.      Lavoe's other two heirs, his daughter and his widow,\n\n\n\nwriting.   Nevertheless, the district court made no distinction\nbetween the agreements and plaintiffs have not raised this as an\nissue on appeal.\n     3\n      CFDM was a partnership between Cardenas Fernandez &\nAssociates and David Maldonado Presents, created specifically for\nthe purpose of producing \"Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe?\" in New York\nCity and Puerto Rico.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwere not parties to that assignment.               Plaintiffs did not produce\n\nany evidence tending to show that any of the SSAs were actually\n\nterminated by the requisite mutually signed writing.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to defendants,\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs' rights were not infringed upon by the\n\nproduction of the play because defendants had proven they held\n\nvalid licenses to use the songs.               Subsequently, plaintiffs sought\n\nreconsideration      by    the    district      court.      Although      defendants\n\nneglected to defend the motion for reconsideration, Sonido was\n\ngranted leave to intervene and contest plaintiffs' motion, which\n\nthe district court denied.              Defendants have not responded to\n\nplaintiffs' appeal from the district court judgment, and this court\n\nhas also granted Sonido the status of intervenor-appellee.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's decisions to stay\n\ndiscovery,       grant    summary     judgment     to    defendants,      and   deny\n\nplaintiffs' motion to reconsider.\n\nA.     Stay of Discovery\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that the district court prejudiced their\n\ncase by staying discovery proceedings while the motion for summary\n\njudgment was under advisement.           Plaintiffs suggest that they would\n\nhave    sought    evidence       to   refute    the     legitimacy   of    Sonido's\n\ncopyrights and their subsequent licensing to defendants.                        They\n\nfurther contend that they had claims against defendant Centro de\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fBellas Artes Corporation, operator of the theater in Puerto Rico\n\nwhere the play was shown, that they \"had not yet begun to litigate\"\n\ndue to the court's stay of discovery.4        Plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndistrict court was in violation of this court's February 2001 order\n\nvacating the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction\n\nand requiring the court to conduct \"further proceedings.\"\n\n     Our review of the record reveals that plaintiffs failed to\n\noppose defendants' motion to stay discovery.          Nor did plaintiffs\n\nfile a request to compel discovery, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37,\n\nor a motion for further discovery, authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f), prior to the court's decision on summary judgment.           Had the\n\nplaintiffs   protested   the   stay   or   informed   the   court   of   what\n\ninformation they sought to obtain while the court considered the\n\nmotions at issue, the situation would be vastly different. By\n\nchoosing to forgo Rule 37 relief, plaintiffs waived any claim of\n\nerror on appeal.     See, e.g., U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Baker\n\nMaterial Handling Corp., 62 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding\n\nthat plaintiffs \"plainly waived\" claim of unfair trial by foregoing\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Plaintiffs make a companion argument that their claims\nagainst Centro de Bellas Artes were not resolved by the district\ncourt's orders and thus the judgment before us is not final.\nAlthough Centro de Bellas Artes did not join in the motion for\nsummary judgment filed by other defendants, the court granted\nsummary judgment to all defendants. Thus, there has been a final\njudgment with regard to all of plaintiffs' claims in this case,\nincluding those against Centro de Bellas Artes.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fRule 37 relief in favor of airing \"cover-up\" claims in front of\n\njury).\n\nB. Summary Judgment\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal the court's grant of summary judgment to\n\ndefendants on several grounds.      Most of plaintiffs' arguments were\n\nnot made until the motion for reconsideration, and as such were\n\nforfeited, as explained in the next section.            The only preserved\n\nclaim that plaintiffs make with regard to the court's summary\n\njudgment ruling is that the court erred in concluding that under\n\nPuerto Rico law Lavoe's son could not unilaterally transfer rights\n\nto them.\n\n       In their summary judgment motion, defendants argued primarily\n\nthat   they   held   valid,   unrevoked   assignments    from   the     songs'\n\ncomposers dating back to the 1970s and 1980s and therefore any\n\nassignments     to   plaintiffs,   occurring    later     in    time,     were\n\nnecessarily invalid. Plaintiffs, in their three paragraph argument\n\nin response, made two particular points.        First, they noted that\n\nthe original agreement between Valsyn and Sonido ended in December\n\n1999 and thus was not in existence at the time the play was\n\nproduced, making the licenses granted to defendants from Sonido\n\ninvalid.      Plaintiffs identified this as the \"one simple, yet\n\ncompelling fact, that defeats any possibility of success for Co-\n\ndefendants'    motion   for   summary   judgment.\"   (With     their    reply,\n\ndefendants proved this argument meritless by producing the renewal\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fof the Valsyn-Sonido agreement, which extended its expiration to\n\nDecember 2004.)      Second, plaintiffs suggested that the composers\n\nhad   in   fact   cancelled   their   original    agreements   with   Fania,\n\nsubmitting Alonso's 1983 letter in support.\n\n      The district court held that defendants had proven a valid\n\nchain of transfers of the copyrights from the original transferee\n\nto defendants for use in the play.              The court concluded that\n\nplaintiffs had not produced evidence to show that the original\n\nassignments had been properly terminated, and thus they had no\n\nenforceable rights of their own.            Even if they had, the district\n\ncourt further ruled, relying on Colon Gutierrez v. Registrador de\n\nPropiedad, 114 D.P.R. 850 (1983), that Lavoe's son, acting alone,\n\ndid not have the right to convey copyrights to LAMCO.\n\n      As the court intimated in its denial of reconsideration, this\n\nissue is ultimately inconsequential to the disposition of the case\n\nbecause Lavoe's estate did not include the copyrights. Pursuant to\n\ntheir terms, the SSAs between Lavoe and Fania did not expire upon\n\nLavoe's death, and having not been terminated via mutual written\n\nagreement by Lavoe or his heirs, the copyrights continued to reside\n\nwith Fania and its successors.        We therefore need not, and do not,\n\nconsider the merits of plaintiffs' argument that Lavoe's son had a\n\nright to unilaterally transfer copyrights.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fC. Motion to Reconsider\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs appeal the district court's conclusion in\n\nits denial of reconsideration that they waived two arguments that\n\nthey profess should have precluded summary judgment.        They suggest\n\nthat the court erred because it failed to recognize disputed issues\n\nof material fact and, alternatively, it neglected to consider a\n\nlegal issue that was dispositive in their favor.        Neither of these\n\narguments was made prior to the motion to reconsider.             We may\n\nreverse the district court's decision only if it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See Tiller v. Baghdady, 294 F.3d 277, 284 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n     (1) Factual Issues\n\n     Plaintiffs   assert   that   genuine   issues    of   material   fact\n\nremained concerning defendants' documentary evidence.         First, they\n\nargue that, because the agreements between Valsyn and Sonido were\n\nnot produced in original form, their authenticity was questionable.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs claim that the Valsyn-Sonido agreement was also\n\nsuspect because it did not reference any particular composition or\n\nspecific authors, but instead applied to all master recordings that\n\nhad been released on the \"Fania\" label.              Finally, plaintiffs\n\ncomplain that the original SSAs were not produced and thus the\n\nsignatures of the composers have not been verified.         Because these\n\narguments were not made in plaintiffs' opposition to summary\n\njudgment, the district court ruled that they were forfeited.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f       It is customary to append copies of documents to a summary\n\njudgment motion and produce originals only if authenticity is\n\nchallenged.          Although plaintiffs suggest that they sought to view\n\nthe original SSAs, no Rule 37 motion to compel was made.               In short,\n\nthe    court    did     not   abuse   its   discretion     in   concluding   that\n\nplaintiffs' contentions about the agreements produced by defendants\n\nwere untimely. See Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,\n\n212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"It is well-settled . . . that\n\nnew legal arguments or evidence may not be presented via Rule\n\n59(e).\").5\n\n       (2) Section 205 of the Copyright Act\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs allude to an allegedly unresolved issue of\n\nlaw that they claim is dispositive of the case.                 Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat       because    defendants'     assignments   were    not   registered   or\n\nrecorded with the Copyright Office, and otherwise failed to meet\n\nCopyright Act requirements, plaintiffs' recorded copyrights are\n\nsuperior.       They specifically contend that the provision of the\n\n\n\n       5\n      Plaintiffs also assert a genuine issue of material fact in\nthe alleged bad faith of one of the defendants, David Maldonado, in\nentering into an agreement with Sonido after plaintiffs informed\nhim of their copyright claims.      We assume that plaintiffs are\nreferencing the Sonido-CFDM agreement since David Maldonado had no\ncontract with Sonido, but David Maldonado Presents was part of\nCFDM, which was party to the agreement with Sonido.         Because\nplaintiffs did not raise this argument in either the motion for\nsummary judgment or the motion for reconsideration, it was\nforfeited.   Reviewing for plain error, see Chestnut v. City of\nLowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam), we\nfind none.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCopyright Act governing conflicting transfers, 17 U.S.C. § 205,\n\napplies and dictates an outcome in their favor.\n\n     Again, plaintiffs did not make this argument until the motion\n\nfor reconsideration. They contend that they preserved it, however,\n\nby presenting it to the court during previous colloquies that\n\nconcerned both the instant case and related cases and by raising it\n\nbefore this court in a previous appeal.6\n\n     We agree with the district court, however, that plaintiffs\n\nforfeited this issue.   In our review of the record, we find that\n\nalthough plaintiffs made recurrent references to the Copyright Act\n\nin general, it was not until their motion for reconsideration that\n\nthey specified a reliance on section 205.   Thus, when deciding the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court was justified in\n\nbelieving that plaintiffs had decided to place all of their eggs in\n\none basket, disputing the validity of the defendants' original\n\nassignments.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      In our previous order, we directed the district court to\nconsider the merits of plaintiffs' claims in ruling on a request\nfor injunctive relief. Latin Am. Music Co. v. Cardenas Fernandez\n& Assocs., No. 00-1443, 2 Fed. Appx. 40 (1st Cir. Feb. 23, 2001)\n(\"The copyright claims in this case are complicated, and nothing we\nsay is intended to suggest a view that plaintiff is likely to\nprevail, although this is likely to be the key issue as to\ninjunctive relief.\"). Plaintiffs suggest that our order required\nthe district court to specifically consider the section 205\nargument. Nothing in that opinion, however, relieved plaintiffs\nfrom their burden of informing the district court of the bases on\nwhich they opposed summary judgment.\n\n                               -12-\n\f       Plaintiffs' claims that they made the section 205 argument in\n\nrelated proceedings, in particular at a status conference held on\n\nJuly 26, 2001, in which multiple cases were discussed, are not\n\nverifiable in the record before us.                 Only one status conference\n\nappears in the record; it was held on July 6, 2001, and reflects\n\ndiscussion of this case only.               The conference notes report that\n\ncounsel for one of the defendants was \"closely following the four\n\nmain cases involving Latin American Music Co., Inc. (96-2312, 97-\n\n2356, 97-2875, 98-1597) and waiting to see who owns what, and who\n\nwill transfer what, in order to determine how they will proceed.\n\nIn all probability the Court will appoint a special master for all\n\nof    these   cases.\"        No   indication       that    substantive        arguments\n\nregarding section 205 were made is revealed.\n\n       In the alternative, plaintiffs contend that this case was \"de\n\nfacto\" consolidated with other cases.               As the district court noted\n\nin its denial of reconsideration, the record makes plain that\n\nplaintiffs labored under this faulty assumption, even though no\n\nmotion     for    consolidation       was   made    prior        to   the    motion    to\n\nreconsider.7      Even if plaintiffs made their section 205 argument to\n\nthe   court      in   the   related   litigation,         they    were      required   to\n\nreiterate, or at the very least reference, the argument in their\n\n\n       7\n      In their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs argued that\nthere were indispensable parties, namely the composers themselves\nand Sonido, who should be joined.      In the alternative, they\nsuggested that the court should consolidate the case with related\npending litigation.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fopposition to summary judgment.       Finally, even if plaintiffs made\n\nthe section 205 argument in their initial appeal, we did not\n\nreflect such argument in our opinion, much less direct the district\n\ncourt to consider it in this different phase of the case.             The\n\ndistrict court cannot, therefore, be faulted for not considering\n\nthe argument, never raised directly before it.      Thus, the district\n\ncourt's   refusal   to   consider   plaintiffs'   belated   section   205\n\nargument was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants Latin\n\nAmerican Music Company (\"LAMCO\") and Asociacion de Compositores y\n\nEditores de Musica Latino Americana (\"ACEMLA\") appeal the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellees on all of\n\nplaintiffs'     copyright      claims     and   its    subsequent   denial     of\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.               Finding no error in the\n\ncourt's rulings, we affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n     The facts are largely undisputed. Plaintiffs are corporations\n\nthat claim rights in several songs performed as part of a play\n\nabout composer Hector Lavoe's life (\"Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe?\"),\n\nproduced in New York City in 1999 and San Juan, Puerto Rico, in\n\n2000.    The songs were written by Hector Lavoe (the stage name for\n\nHector Perez), by Lavoe with Wilfredo Colon, or by Catalino \"Tite\"\n\nCuret Alonso.1\n\n        Plaintiffs   alleged    that     defendants,    who   created   or   were\n\ninvolved in the production of the play, violated their rights by\n\nperforming     the   songs     without    obtaining     licenses    from     them.\n\nDefendants responded that they had obtained valid licenses from the\n\nrightful copyright transferee, Fania Publishing Company, through\n\nSonido, Inc.\n\n\n     1\n      We note that the district court found that one of the songs\nin which plaintiffs claimed rights, \"Todo Tiene Su Final,\" was\ncomposed by Colon alone. Because the plaintiffs acknowledge having\nno claims to any songs written by Colon alone, we do not consider\nthis song.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f     Fania, the original copyright transferee, had entered into\n\nStandard Songwriters Agreements (\"SSAs\") with Lavoe and Alonso in\n\nthe 1970s and 1980s that assigned Fania copyright interests in five\n\nof the six songs at issue (\"Paraiso de Dulzura,\" \"Periodico de\n\nAyer,\" \"Pirana,\" \"El Todopoderoso,\" and \"La Fama\").         Defendants\n\nproduced a Certificate of Registration from the U.S. Copyright\n\nOffice, filed by Fania as the \"Copyright Claimant,\" for the final\n\nsong, \"La Murga.\"\n\n     For each composition, the SSAs encompassed:\n\n     all musical and non-musical rights therein, the title,\n     words and music thereof, (and all literary characters\n     contained therein), the worldwide copyright thereof and\n     the right to secure copyright therein throughout the\n     entire world and to have and to hold the said copyright\n     together with all of their right, title and interest,\n     both legal and equitable therein, including but not\n     limited to the sole and exclusive worldwide publication,\n     mechanical reproducing, and motion picture and television\n     synchronization   rights   and   the  right   of   public\n     performance by any means, and all other rights now known\n     or hereafter to come into existence, subject to the terms\n     of this agreement.\n\nEach SSA was binding on \"the respective parties hereto, their\n\nrespective   successors   in   interest,   legal   representatives   and\n\nassigns and . . . cannot be terminated, or amended except by a\n\nwriting signed by all of the parties hereto.\"2\n\n\n     2\n      The one SSA executed in the 1980s, by Lavoe, contained\nslightly altered language. It pertained to the composition \"La\nFama\" and assigned \"the title words and music, and all copyrights\nthereof . . . and all rights, claims and demands in any way\nrelating thereto, and the exclusive right to secure copyright\ntherein throughout the entire world.\" It applied to successors in\ninterest, but did not require termination by mutual agreement in\n\n                                  -4-\n\f     Sonido had obtained copyright licenses for the songs from\n\nValsyn, which owned Fania Publishing, and subsequently leased them\n\nto defendants.     As evidence of this transfer of rights, defendants\n\nprovided a series of licensing agreements: an October 1, 1986,\n\nlicensing agreement between Valsyn and Sonido, wherein Valsyn\n\nconveyed to Sonido a license to use the songs at issue while\n\nretaining ownership of the copyrights; a renewal of the agreement\n\nbetween Valsyn and Sonido extending its expiration from December\n\n31, 1999, to December 31, 2004; and an agreement between defendant\n\nCFDM Theatrical Productions and Sonido dated July 5, 1999, in which\n\nCFDM licensed the songs to be used in the play's production.3\n\n     Plaintiffs suggested that Alonso had sought to terminate the\n\nSSAs,    producing   a   1983   letter    from   Alonso     to   Fania,   which\n\napparently indicated his desire to end the agreements. With regard\n\nto   Lavoe's    compositions,    plaintiffs      produced    assignments    of\n\ncopyrights they received from Lavoe's son, Jose Perez, after Lavoe\n\ndied in 1993.        Perez registered the copyrights with the U.S.\n\nCopyright Office in 1999 and subsequently assigned the copyrights\n\nto LAMCO.      Lavoe's other two heirs, his daughter and his widow,\n\n\n\nwriting.   Nevertheless, the district court made no distinction\nbetween the agreements and plaintiffs have not raised this as an\nissue on appeal.\n     3\n      CFDM was a partnership between Cardenas Fernandez &\nAssociates and David Maldonado Presents, created specifically for\nthe purpose of producing \"Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe?\" in New York\nCity and Puerto Rico.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwere not parties to that assignment.               Plaintiffs did not produce\n\nany evidence tending to show that any of the SSAs were actually\n\nterminated by the requisite mutually signed writing.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to defendants,\n\nconcluding that plaintiffs' rights were not infringed upon by the\n\nproduction of the play because defendants had proven they held\n\nvalid licenses to use the songs.               Subsequently, plaintiffs sought\n\nreconsideration      by    the    district      court.      Although      defendants\n\nneglected to defend the motion for reconsideration, Sonido was\n\ngranted leave to intervene and contest plaintiffs' motion, which\n\nthe district court denied.              Defendants have not responded to\n\nplaintiffs' appeal from the district court judgment, and this court\n\nhas also granted Sonido the status of intervenor-appellee.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's decisions to stay\n\ndiscovery,       grant    summary     judgment     to    defendants,      and   deny\n\nplaintiffs' motion to reconsider.\n\nA.     Stay of Discovery\n\n       Plaintiffs complain that the district court prejudiced their\n\ncase by staying discovery proceedings while the motion for summary\n\njudgment was under advisement.           Plaintiffs suggest that they would\n\nhave    sought    evidence       to   refute    the     legitimacy   of    Sonido's\n\ncopyrights and their subsequent licensing to defendants.                        They\n\nfurther contend that they had claims against defendant Centro de\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fBellas Artes Corporation, operator of the theater in Puerto Rico\n\nwhere the play was shown, that they \"had not yet begun to litigate\"\n\ndue to the court's stay of discovery.4        Plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndistrict court was in violation of this court's February 2001 order\n\nvacating the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction\n\nand requiring the court to conduct \"further proceedings.\"\n\n     Our review of the record reveals that plaintiffs failed to\n\noppose defendants' motion to stay discovery.          Nor did plaintiffs\n\nfile a request to compel discovery, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37,\n\nor a motion for further discovery, authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f), prior to the court's decision on summary judgment.           Had the\n\nplaintiffs   protested   the   stay   or   informed   the   court   of   what\n\ninformation they sought to obtain while the court considered the\n\nmotions at issue, the situation would be vastly different. By\n\nchoosing to forgo Rule 37 relief, plaintiffs waived any claim of\n\nerror on appeal.     See, e.g., U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Baker\n\nMaterial Handling Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701305\"><a href=\"/opinion/701305/42-fed-r-evid-serv-1278-prodliabrep-cch-p-14298-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding\n\nthat plaintiffs \"plainly waived\" claim of unfair trial by foregoing\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Plaintiffs make a companion argument that their claims\nagainst Centro de Bellas Artes were not resolved by the district\ncourt's orders and thus the judgment before us is not final.\nAlthough Centro de Bellas Artes did not join in the motion for\nsummary judgment filed by other defendants, the court granted\nsummary judgment to all defendants. Thus, there has been a final\njudgment with regard to all of plaintiffs' claims in this case,\nincluding those against Centro de Bellas Artes.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fRule 37 relief in favor of airing \"cover-up\" claims in front of\n\njury).\n\nB. Summary Judgment\n\n       Plaintiffs appeal the court's grant of summary judgment to\n\ndefendants on several grounds.      Most of plaintiffs' arguments were\n\nnot made until the motion for reconsideration, and as such were\n\nforfeited, as explained in the next section.            The only preserved\n\nclaim that plaintiffs make with regard to the court's summary\n\njudgment ruling is that the court erred in concluding that under\n\nPuerto Rico law Lavoe's son could not unilaterally transfer rights\n\nto them.\n\n       In their summary judgment motion, defendants argued primarily\n\nthat   they   held   valid,   unrevoked   assignments    from   the     songs'\n\ncomposers dating back to the 1970s and 1980s and therefore any\n\nassignments     to   plaintiffs,   occurring    later     in    time,     were\n\nnecessarily invalid. Plaintiffs, in their three paragraph argument\n\nin response, made two particular points.        First, they noted that\n\nthe original agreement between Valsyn and Sonido ended in December\n\n1999 and thus was not in existence at the time the play was\n\nproduced, making the licenses granted to defendants from Sonido\n\ninvalid.      Plaintiffs identified this as the \"one simple, yet\n\ncompelling fact, that defeats any possibility of success for Co-\n\ndefendants'    motion   for   summary   judgment.\"   (With     their    reply,\n\ndefendants proved this argument meritless by producing the renewal\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fof the Valsyn-Sonido agreement, which extended its expiration to\n\nDecember 2004.)      Second, plaintiffs suggested that the composers\n\nhad   in   fact   cancelled   their   original    agreements   with   Fania,\n\nsubmitting Alonso's 1983 letter in support.\n\n      The district court held that defendants had proven a valid\n\nchain of transfers of the copyrights from the original transferee\n\nto defendants for use in the play.              The court concluded that\n\nplaintiffs had not produced evidence to show that the original\n\nassignments had been properly terminated, and thus they had no\n\nenforceable rights of their own.            Even if they had, the district\n\ncourt further ruled, relying on Colon Gutierrez v. Registrador de\n\nPropiedad, 114 D.P.R. 850 (1983), that Lavoe's son, acting alone,\n\ndid not have the right to convey copyrights to LAMCO.\n\n      As the court intimated in its denial of reconsideration, this\n\nissue is ultimately inconsequential to the disposition of the case\n\nbecause Lavoe's estate did not include the copyrights. Pursuant to\n\ntheir terms, the SSAs between Lavoe and Fania did not expire upon\n\nLavoe's death, and having not been terminated via mutual written\n\nagreement by Lavoe or his heirs, the copyrights continued to reside\n\nwith Fania and its successors.        We therefore need not, and do not,\n\nconsider the merits of plaintiffs' argument that Lavoe's son had a\n\nright to unilaterally transfer copyrights.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fC. Motion to Reconsider\n\n     Finally, plaintiffs appeal the district court's conclusion in\n\nits denial of reconsideration that they waived two arguments that\n\nthey profess should have precluded summary judgment.        They suggest\n\nthat the court erred because it failed to recognize disputed issues\n\nof material fact and, alternatively, it neglected to consider a\n\nlegal issue that was dispositive in their favor.        Neither of these\n\narguments was made prior to the motion to reconsider.             We may\n\nreverse the district court's decision only if it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See Tiller v. Baghdady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200016\"><a href=\"/opinion/200016/tiller-v-baghdady/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n     (1) Factual Issues\n\n     Plaintiffs   assert   that   genuine   issues    of   material   fact\n\nremained concerning defendants' documentary evidence.         First, they\n\nargue that, because the agreements between Valsyn and Sonido were\n\nnot produced in original form, their authenticity was questionable.\n\nSecond, plaintiffs claim that the Valsyn-Sonido agreement was also\n\nsuspect because it did not reference any particular composition or\n\nspecific authors, but instead applied to all master recordings that\n\nhad been released on the \"Fania\" label.              Finally, plaintiffs\n\ncomplain that the original SSAs were not produced and thus the\n\nsignatures of the composers have not been verified.         Because these\n\narguments were not made in plaintiffs' opposition to summary\n\njudgment, the district court ruled that they were forfeited.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f       It is customary to append copies of documents to a summary\n\njudgment motion and produce originals only if authenticity is\n\nchallenged.          Although plaintiffs suggest that they sought to view\n\nthe original SSAs, no Rule 37 motion to compel was made.               In short,\n\nthe    court    did     not   abuse   its   discretion     in   concluding   that\n\nplaintiffs' contentions about the agreements produced by defendants\n\nwere untimely. See Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"It is well-settled . . . that\n\nnew legal arguments or evidence may not be presented via Rule\n\n59(e).\").5\n\n       (2) Section 205 of the Copyright Act\n\n       Finally, plaintiffs allude to an allegedly unresolved issue of\n\nlaw that they claim is dispositive of the case.                 Plaintiffs argue\n\nthat       because    defendants'     assignments   were    not   registered   or\n\nrecorded with the Copyright Office, and otherwise failed to meet\n\nCopyright Act requirements, plaintiffs' recorded copyrights are\n\nsuperior.       They specifically contend that the provision of the\n\n\n\n       5\n      Plaintiffs also assert a genuine issue of material fact in\nthe alleged bad faith of one of the defendants, David Maldonado, in\nentering into an agreement with Sonido after plaintiffs informed\nhim of their copyright claims.      We assume that plaintiffs are\nreferencing the Sonido-CFDM agreement since David Maldonado had no\ncontract with Sonido, but David Maldonado Presents was part of\nCFDM, which was party to the agreement with Sonido.         Because\nplaintiffs did not raise this argument in either the motion for\nsummary judgment or the motion for reconsideration, it was\nforfeited.   Reviewing for plain error, see Chestnut v. City of\nLowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779262\"><a href=\"/opinion/779262/craig-chestnut-v-city-of-lowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (per curiam), we\nfind none.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fCopyright Act governing conflicting transfers, 17 U.S.C. § 205,\n\napplies and dictates an outcome in their favor.\n\n     Again, plaintiffs did not make this argument until the motion\n\nfor reconsideration. They contend that they preserved it, however,\n\nby presenting it to the court during previous colloquies that\n\nconcerned both the instant case and related cases and by raising it\n\nbefore this court in a previous appeal.6\n\n     We agree with the district court, however, that plaintiffs\n\nforfeited this issue.   In our review of the record, we find that\n\nalthough plaintiffs made recurrent references to the Copyright Act\n\nin general, it was not until their motion for reconsideration that\n\nthey specified a reliance on section 205.   Thus, when deciding the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court was justified in\n\nbelieving that plaintiffs had decided to place all of their eggs in\n\none basket, disputing the validity of the defendants' original\n\nassignments.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      In our previous order, we directed the district court to\nconsider the merits of plaintiffs' claims in ruling on a request\nfor injunctive relief. Latin Am. Music Co. v. Cardenas Fernandez\n& Assocs., No. 00-1443, 2 Fed. Appx. 40 (1st Cir. Feb. 23, 2001)\n(\"The copyright claims in this case are complicated, and nothing we\nsay is intended to suggest a view that plaintiff is likely to\nprevail, although this is likely to be the key issue as to\ninjunctive relief.\"). Plaintiffs suggest that our order required\nthe district court to specifically consider the section 205\nargument. Nothing in that opinion, however, relieved plaintiffs\nfrom their burden of informing the district court of the bases on\nwhich they opposed summary judgment.\n\n                               -12-\n\f       Plaintiffs' claims that they made the section 205 argument in\n\nrelated proceedings, in particular at a status conference held on\n\nJuly 26, 2001, in which multiple cases were discussed, are not\n\nverifiable in the record before us.                 Only one status conference\n\nappears in the record; it was held on July 6, 2001, and reflects\n\ndiscussion of this case only.               The conference notes report that\n\ncounsel for one of the defendants was \"closely following the four\n\nmain cases involving Latin American Music Co., Inc. (96-2312, 97-\n\n2356, 97-2875, 98-1597) and waiting to see who owns what, and who\n\nwill transfer what, in order to determine how they will proceed.\n\nIn all probability the Court will appoint a special master for all\n\nof    these   cases.\"        No   indication       that    substantive        arguments\n\nregarding section 205 were made is revealed.\n\n       In the alternative, plaintiffs contend that this case was \"de\n\nfacto\" consolidated with other cases.               As the district court noted\n\nin its denial of reconsideration, the record makes plain that\n\nplaintiffs labored under this faulty assumption, even though no\n\nmotion     for    consolidation       was   made    prior        to   the    motion    to\n\nreconsider.7      Even if plaintiffs made their section 205 argument to\n\nthe   court      in   the   related   litigation,         they    were      required   to\n\nreiterate, or at the very least reference, the argument in their\n\n\n       7\n      In their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs argued that\nthere were indispensable parties, namely the composers themselves\nand Sonido, who should be joined.      In the alternative, they\nsuggested that the court should consolidate the case with related\npending litigation.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fopposition to summary judgment.       Finally, even if plaintiffs made\n\nthe section 205 argument in their initial appeal, we did not\n\nreflect such argument in our opinion, much less direct the district\n\ncourt to consider it in this different phase of the case.             The\n\ndistrict court cannot, therefore, be faulted for not considering\n\nthe argument, never raised directly before it.      Thus, the district\n\ncourt's   refusal   to   consider   plaintiffs'   belated   section   205\n\nargument was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f</pre>",
