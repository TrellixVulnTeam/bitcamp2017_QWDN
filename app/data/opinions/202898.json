Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n              Torruella, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n                            ORDER OF COURT\n                       Entered: August 17, 2007\n\n     Appellee Kenneth Jones filed a petition for rehearing en banc\nin this case, which, under our Internal Operating Procedure X,\nencompasses a petition for panel rehearing. The petition for\nrehearing is granted.    Accordingly, the panel's March 7, 2007,\nopinion is withdrawn and the judgment of even date vacated.\n\n     The panel majority now issues a new opinion, which eliminates\nthe portion of the original panel opinion concluding that the\ndefendant had abandoned his motions for a new trial and a\nremittitur. Instead, the new opinion orders a remand so that the\ndistrict court may address these motions. However, the portion of\nthe decision concluding that the district court erred in vacating\nthe jury verdict on the basis of qualified immunity remains intact.\nHence, we once again order reinstatement of the jury verdict.\n\f     In conjunction with the issuance of the majority opinion this\nday, Judge Lynch files her dissent to the majority's decision\nvacating the judgment of the district court.\n\n                         By the Court:\n                         Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk.\n\n\n                         _____/s/_________________________\n                         By: Margaret Carter, Chief Deputy Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified copies to Hon. Ernest C. Torres and Mr. David DiMarzio,\nClerk, United States District Court for the District of      Rhode\nIsland. Copies to Mr. Bradley and Ms. Partington.]\n\f",
