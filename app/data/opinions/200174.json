Waldemar   Burgos-Chaparro,   the\n\ndefendant-appellant in this case, was indicted along with 27 others\n\non September 22, 1999, for his role in a major drug conspiracy\n\ninvolving cocaine and marijuana.       Burgos was charged in one count\n\nwith conspiracy to distribute both drugs and in a second count with\n\nconspiracy to import them.      The defendants were allocated to four\n\ndifferent cases before different judges--seven defendants to a\n\ncase.    The cases were numbered 99-305 through 99-308, Burgos being\n\nincluded in No. 99-307.\n\n            On January 31, 2000, at the insistence of the government,\n\na Foster hearing1 was held to explore a possible conflict because\n\nBurgos' then-counsel--Ernesto Hernandez-Milan--was representing a\n\nco-defendant, Roberto Lopez-Morales, in No. 99-308.         After having\n\nthe risk of conflict explained to him by the judge, Burgos said he\n\npreferred to continue being represented by Hernandez; but during\n\nthe same hearing Hernandez was replaced as counsel for Lopez by\n\nanother lawyer (Luis Rivera) at Lopez's request.         It appears that\n\nHernandez continued as counsel for Lopez in another unrelated\n\ncriminal case.\n\n            After discovery, a trial date for Burgos was set for\n\nFebruary 27, 2001.       Two days before trial, Burgos reached an\n\n\n     1\n      Under United States v. Foster, 469 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1972), a\nfederal court is obligated to conduct a hearing to inquire into the\nadequacy of a defendant's representation whenever co-defendants are\nrepresented by the same counsel.     Id. at 4-5; see also Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 44(c).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fagreement with the government and pled guilty to one of the two\n\ncounts, the other being dismissed.             On April 6, 2001, a new\n\ncounsel, Lydia Lizarribar-Masini, replaced Hernandez as counsel for\n\nBurgos    and   represented   Burgos    in   his   sentencing    proceedings.\n\nLizarribar also represented Lopez in No. 99-308, having apparently\n\ntaken over from Rivera in December 2000.              On August 30, 2001,\n\nBurgos--represented by Lizarribar--was sentenced to 168 months in\n\nprison.\n\n            Now represented by new counsel (his third), Burgos has\n\nappealed, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel has\n\nbeen   violated   by   conflicts   of   interest    on   the    part   of   both\n\nHernandez and Lizarribar.      The record is poorly developed, as one\n\nmight expect, because none of the present claims of conflict was\n\npresented to the district court by Burgos; indeed, even in this\n\ncourt his Sixth Amendment claims are not easy to disentangle.                But\n\nnothing presented to us suggests that Burgos has been adversely\n\naffected by the potential conflicts of which he complains.\n\n            It might well be asked at the outset why Burgos should be\n\nentitled to present what are at best marginal claims--certainly no\n\nplain error is apparent--when he did not raise any of them in the\n\ndistrict court.        The short answer is that where a defendant's\n\ncounsel in a criminal case labors under a supposed conflict, it is\n\nunreasonable to expect that counsel to accuse himself (or the\n\nalready-represented defendant to represent himself on that issue).\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fSee generally 3 LaFave, Israel, & King, Criminal Procedure §\n\n11.7(e) at 629 & n.53 (2d ed. 1999).   Whatever qualifications may\n\nexist on the right to raise such issues for the first time on\n\nappeal, the government in this case makes no objection.\n\n           We turn then to the merits.     In general, a criminal\n\ndefendant is entitled to conflict-free representation, although the\n\nright may often be waived after appropriate warnings. See Wheat v.\n\nUnited States, 486 U.S. 153, 159-63 (1988).   In this case Burgos is\n\nnot complaining about the conflict issue aired in the Foster\n\nhearing.   Not only did Burgos after warnings agree to having\n\nHernandez represent him and co-defendant Lopez in their related\n\ncases, but the potential conflict was negated on the spot by\n\nLopez's decision to have Rivera supplant Hernandez as Lopez's\n\ncounsel in No. 99-308.\n\n           Instead, the focus of Burgos' appeal is on two other\n\nalleged conflicts.     In brief, Burgos says that Hernandez also\n\nrepresented a different co-defendant--Luis A. Feliciano-Valentin--\n\nin one of the related cases (No. 99-308) without any examination of\n\nthe conflict by the district court or waiver by Burgos; and Burgos\n\nsays that Lizarribar's representation of him at sentencing is\n\nsimilarly flawed because after Rivera took over the representation\n\nof co-defendant Lopez, Lizarribar in turn succeeded Rivera and\n\nrepresented Burgos and Lopez at the same time without judicial\n\nscrutiny or consent.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f           In general, ineffective assistance of counsel--as opposed\n\nto the complete absence of counsel at a critical stage--is tested\n\nunder the familiar Strickland test; this requires the defendant to\n\nshow    that   counsel's    performance       is    so   impaired   as   to   be\n\nconstitutionally inadequate and that this likely affected the\n\noutcome of the case.       See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n694 (1984).     However,     a lesser showing of prejudice is enough\n\nwhere ineffectiveness is traced to a             conflict of interest--rather\n\nthan some other impairment of the right to counsel--that was not\n\nidentified and properly waived.        See Mickens v. Taylor, 122 S. Ct\n\n1237, 1240-41 (2002).        Why Supreme Court precedent so qualifies\n\nStrickland need not concern us here.\n\n           It is a commonplace that divided loyalties may undermine\n\nthe ability     of   a   single   lawyer    to     represent   effectively    two\n\ndefendants charged in the same case.                  This \"potential,\" said\n\nMickens, ripens into an \"actual\" conflict where such \"a division of\n\nloyalties\" is shown to have \"affected counsel's performance.\"\n\nMickens, 122 S.Ct. at 1243.           Where such an effect is shown,\n\nreversal is required without any further showing that the defect in\n\nperformance altered the outcome.           This lessening of the Strickland\n\nburden occurs, according to Mickens, whether or not the court has\n\nitself failed in its duty to inquire into the conflict.                  Id. at\n\n1244.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            We    start    with   Burgos'      claim     that   Hernandez's    dual\n\nrepresentation (of Burgos and Feliciano) amounted to such an actual\n\nconflict.    The district court files in No. 99-308 show that on\n\nNovember 12, 1999, attorney David Roman entered an appearance\n\nreciting that he had been retained in this case by Feliciano and\n\nthat Hernandez agreed to \"this substitution.\"                   Thus, even before\n\nthe Foster hearing afforded Burgos and well before his guilty plea,\n\nit appears that Hernandez was no longer conflicted on account of\n\nhis earlier representation of Feliciano in the related case.\n\nBurgos'   brief    is     based   on   the    premise,    which   appears     to   be\n\nmistaken, that Hernandez continued to represent both Feliciano and\n\nBurgos during the latter's plea negotiations.\n\n            In any event, even if Hernandez had represented both\n\nBurgos and Feliciano at some time that mattered, Burgos would have\n\nto identify some way in which his representation by Hernandez was\n\ncompromised by the latter's representation of Feliciano.                       This\n\ncould be because of some action taken by Hernandez or by some\n\nopportunity foregone, see Guaraldi v. Cunningham, 819 F.2d 15, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.); but some adverse action or inaction\n\nis required that can be traced to the conflict in loyalty.                  Merely\n\nto speculate that the divided loyalty could have caused such a step\n\nis not enough.      See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Lebron, 23\n\nF.3d 600, 606-07 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              All Burgos offers is speculation. Thus, Burgos says that\n\nwhere counsel represents two plea bargaining defendants, each\n\ndefendant may have an interest in implicating the other in order to\n\nsecure a better deal.        Burgos certainly did bargain for a plea.\n\nBut now represented by conflict-free counsel, he points to nothing\n\nto    suggest   that   the   government   needed   Burgos'   help   against\n\nFeliciano, nor that Hernandez failed to get the best deal he could\n\nfor Burgos because he was trying to protect Feliciano's interest.\n\n              Our case law, admittedly pre-Mickens, says that it may be\n\nenough to point to an alternative strategy or approach, beneficial\n\nto the complaining defendant, that counsel might have taken but was\n\nforegone because of conflicting loyalties.          See United States v.\n\nMichaud, 925 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1991).            Burgos says that he\n\nmight have chosen to plead innocent and insisted on trial.           But, of\n\ncourse, Michaud assumes a showing that such a course would have\n\nbeen undertaken but for counsel's dual loyalty; and Burgos makes no\n\nshowing on this point.       Nor, given the evidence against Burgos, is\n\nthere any reason to think that this course held out any promise.\n\nThe    plea   colloquy   reveals   that   the   government   had    multiple\n\nwitnesses ready to testify against Burgos and, apparently, had a\n\nvideotape of Burgos' illegal activities.\n\n              Finally, Burgos says that his plea agreement designated\n\nhim as a leader of the conspiracy, an admission that would normally\n\nadversely affect the guideline range.           This is a concession that\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcould be influenced by dual representation; but again Burgos offers\n\nnothing to show that it was so affected.         The concession may have\n\nbeen compelled by the evidence or been made a requirement of the\n\nplea bargain by the government.         Nor did Burgos' concession mean\n\nthat Feliciano could not also be designated as a leader: \"There\n\ncan, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader\n\n. . . of a criminal . . . conspiracy.\"          U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 app. n.4\n\n(2001).\n\n            Burgos'    alternative    claim--that    Lizarribar    provided\n\nineffective assistance--is even more quickly answered.            It is true\n\nthat while representing Burgos at sentencing, Lizarribar also\n\nrepresented co-defendant Roberto Lopez-Morales.           By the time she\n\nbegan to represent the latter, Lopez had already determined to\n\nplead guilty.     Burgos provides no reason to think that this dual\n\nrepresentation adversely affected Burgos.           At most, he speculates\n\nthat he could have sought to withdraw his own guilty plea but\n\noffers no reason to think that this was either a plausible course\n\nor   that   it   was    adversely    affected   because   Lizarribar   also\n\nrepresented Lopez.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

The plea colloquy reveals that the government had multiple witnesses ready to testify against Burgos and, apparently, had a videotape of Burgos' illegal activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burgos says that his plea agreement designated him as a leader of the conspiracy, an admission that would normally adversely affect the guideline range. This is a concession that could be influenced by dual representation; but again Burgos offers nothing to show that it was so affected. The concession may have been compelled by the evidence or been made a requirement of the plea bargain by the government. Nor did Burgos' concession mean that Feliciano could not also be designated as a leader: \"There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader ... of a criminal ... conspiracy.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 app. n.4 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos' alternative claim &#8212; that Lizarribar provided ineffective assistance &#8212; is even more quickly answered. It is true that while representing Burgos at sentencing, Lizarribar also represented co-defendant Roberto Lopez-Morales. By the time she began to represent the latter, Lopez had already determined to plead guilty. Burgos provides no reason to think that this dual representation adversely affected Burgos. At most, he speculates that he could have sought to withdraw his own guilty plea but offers no reason to think that this was either a plausible course or that it was adversely affected because Lizarribar also represented Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under<i>United States v.

Burgos was charged in one count with conspiracy to distribute both drugs and in a second count with conspiracy to import them. The defendants were allocated to four different cases before different judges &#8212; seven defendants to a case. The cases were numbered 99-305 through 99-308, Burgos being included in No. 99-307.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 2000, at the insistence of the government, a <i>Foster</i> hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was held to explore a possible conflict because Burgos' then-counsel &#8212; Ernesto Hernandez-Milan &#8212; was representing a co-defendant, Roberto Lopez-Morales, in No. 99-308. After having the risk of conflict explained to him by the judge, Burgos said he preferred to continue being represented by Hernandez; but during the same hearing Hernandez was replaced as counsel for Lopez by another lawyer (Luis Rivera) at Lopez's request. It appears that Hernandez continued as counsel for Lopez in another unrelated criminal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, a trial date for Burgos was set for February 27, 2001. Two days before trial, Burgos reached an agreement with the government and pled guilty to one of the two counts, the other being dismissed. On April 6, 2001, a new counsel, Lydia Lizarribar-Masini, replaced Hernandez as counsel for Burgos and represented Burgos in his sentencing proceedings. Lizarribar also represented Lopez in No. 99-308, having apparently taken over from Rivera in December 2000. On August 30, 2001, Burgos &#8212; represented by Lizarribar &#8212; was sentenced to 168 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now represented by new counsel (his third), Burgos has appealed, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been violated by conflicts of interest on the part of both Hernandez and Lizarribar. The record is poorly developed, as one might expect, because none of the present claims of conflict was presented to the district court by Burgos; indeed, even in this court his Sixth Amendment claims are not easy to disentangle. But nothing presented to us suggests that Burgos has been adversely affected by the potential conflicts of which he complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might well be asked at the outset why Burgos should be entitled to present what are at best marginal claims &#8212; certainly no plain error is apparent &#8212; when he did not raise any of them in the district court. The short answer is that where a defendant's counsel in a criminal case labors under a supposed conflict, it is unreasonable to expect that counsel to accuse himself (or the already-represented defendant to represent himself on that issue). <i>See generally</i> 3 LaFave, Israel, &amp; King, <i>Criminal Procedure</i> &#167; 11.7(e) at 629 &amp; n.53 (2d ed. 1999). Whatever qualifications may exist on the right to raise such issues for the first time on appeal, the government in this case makes no objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to the merits. In general, a criminal defendant is entitled to conflict-free representation, although the right may often be waived after appropriate warnings. <i>See Wheat v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 159-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1692</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span> (1988). In this case Burgos is not complaining about the conflict issue aired in the <i>Foster</i> hearing. Not only did Burgos after warnings agree to having Hernandez represent him and co-defendant Lopez in their related cases, but the potential conflict was negated on the spot by Lopez's decision to have Rivera supplant Hernandez as Lopez's counsel in No. 99-308.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the focus of Burgos' appeal is on two other alleged conflicts. In brief, Burgos says that Hernandez also represented a different co-defendant &#8212; Luis A. Feliciano-Valentin &#8212; in one of the related cases (No. 99-308) without any examination of the conflict by the district court or waiver by Burgos; and Burgos says that Lizarribar's representation of him at sentencing is similarly flawed because after Rivera took over the representation of co-defendant Lopez, Lizarribar in turn succeeded Rivera and represented Burgos and Lopez at the same time without judicial scrutiny or consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, ineffective assistance of counsel &#8212; as opposed to the complete absence of counsel at a critical stage &#8212; is tested under the familiar <i>Strickland</i> test; this requires the defendant to show that counsel's performance is so impaired as to be constitutionally inadequate and that this likely affected the outcome of the case. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). However, a lesser showing of prejudice is enough where ineffectiveness is traced to a conflict of interest &#8212; rather than some other impairment of the right to counsel &#8212; that was not identified and properly waived. <i>See Mickens v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, 1240-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span> (2002). Why Supreme Court precedent so qualifies <i>Strickland</i> need not concern us here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a commonplace that divided loyalties may undermine the ability of a single lawyer to represent effectively two defendants charged in the same case. This \"potential,\" said <i>Mickens,</i> ripens into an \"actual\" conflict where such \"a division of loyalties\" is shown to have \"affected counsel's performance.\" <i>Mickens,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 1243. Where such an effect is shown, reversal is required without any further showing that the defect in performance altered the outcome. This lessening of the <i>Strickland</i> burden occurs, according to <i>Mickens,</i> whether or not the court has itself failed in its duty to inquire into the conflict. <i>Id.</i> at 1244.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Burgos' claim that Hernandez's dual representation (of Burgos and Feliciano) amounted to such an actual conflict. The district court files in No. 99-308 show that on November 12, 1999, attorney David Roman entered an appearance reciting that he had been retained in this case by Feliciano and that Hernandez agreed to \"this substitution.\" Thus, even before the <i>Foster</i> hearing afforded Burgos and well before his guilty plea, it appears that Hernandez was no longer conflicted on account of his earlier representation of Feliciano in the related case. Burgos' brief is based on the premise, which appears to be mistaken, that Hernandez continued to represent both Feliciano and Burgos during the latter's plea negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, even if Hernandez had represented both Burgos and Feliciano at some time that mattered, Burgos would have to identify some way in which his representation by Hernandez was compromised by the latter's representation of Feliciano. This could be because of some action taken by Hernandez or by some opportunity foregone, <i>see Guaraldi v. Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488584\"><a href=\"/opinion/488584/david-a-guaraldi-v-michael-cunningham-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1987) (Breyer, J.); but some adverse action or inaction is required that can be traced to the conflict in loyalty. Merely to speculate that the divided loyalty could have caused such a step is not enough. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Lebron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195375\"><a href=\"/opinion/195375/united-states-v-hernandez-lebron/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 606-07 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Burgos offers is speculation. Thus, Burgos says that where counsel represents two plea bargaining defendants, each defendant may have an interest in implicating the other in order to secure a better deal. Burgos certainly did bargain for a plea. But now represented by conflict-free counsel, he points to nothing to suggest that the government needed Burgos' help against Feliciano, nor that Hernandez failed to get the best deal he could for Burgos because he was trying to protect Feliciano's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law, admittedly pre-<i>Mickens,</i> says that it may be enough to point to an alternative strategy or approach, beneficial to the complaining defendant, that counsel might have taken but was foregone because of conflicting loyalties. <i>See United States v. Michaud,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555478\"><a href=\"/opinion/555478/united-states-v-hubert-michaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1991). Burgos says that he might have chosen to plead innocent and insisted on trial. But, of course, <i>Michaud</i> assumes a showing that such a course would have been undertaken but for counsel's dual loyalty; and Burgos makes no showing on this point. Nor, given the evidence against Burgos, is there any reason to think that this course held out any promise. The plea colloquy reveals that the government had multiple witnesses ready to testify against Burgos and, apparently, had a videotape of Burgos' illegal activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burgos says that his plea agreement designated him as a leader of the conspiracy, an admission that would normally adversely affect the guideline range. This is a concession that could be influenced by dual representation; but again Burgos offers nothing to show that it was so affected. The concession may have been compelled by the evidence or been made a requirement of the plea bargain by the government. Nor did Burgos' concession mean that Feliciano could not also be designated as a leader: \"There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader ... of a criminal ... conspiracy.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 app. n.4 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burgos' alternative claim &#8212; that Lizarribar provided ineffective assistance &#8212; is even more quickly answered. It is true that while representing Burgos at sentencing, Lizarribar also represented co-defendant Roberto Lopez-Morales. By the time she began to represent the latter, Lopez had already determined to plead guilty. Burgos provides no reason to think that this dual representation adversely affected Burgos.
