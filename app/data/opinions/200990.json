For   more   than    a   decade,\n\nappellant Lionel Lugo Rodríguez has been pursuing an endorsement\n\nfrom the Puerto Rico Institute of Culture (\"PRIC\") for his shopping\n\nmall project in an historic district of San Germán, Puerto Rico.\n\nSuch an endorsement is a prerequisite for the project to be\n\nclassified   as    tax-exempt,    and    Commonwealth    administrative      and\n\njudicial proceedings concluded with denial of the endorsement.\n\nAppellant argues here that the process leading to that result was\n\ntainted by fraud, and he seeks a remedy under federal RICO and\n\ncivil rights law, as well as under Puerto Rico tort provisions.               We\n\nagree with the district court that appellant already has had his\n\nday in court on this matter and that further deliberation on the\n\nparticulars is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.               We decline\n\nto add another lengthy chapter to the saga and therefore provide\n\nbackground only as necessary to explain our conclusion.\n\n     The merits of appellant's claim that PRIC wrongfully denied\n\nhim its endorsement were thoroughly considered by the Puerto Rico\n\nCircuit   Court     of   Appeals,       which   reviewed     the    voluminous\n\ncorrespondence and other documentary evidence generated between\n\n1988 and 1998, as well as the administrative transcript, and\n\nconcluded that appellant \"did not fulfill his obligation to show\n\nany irregularity in the proceedings.\" Rather, the court determined\n\nthat the PRIC endorsement was denied because appellant failed to\n\nsatisfy   the     architectural    requirements       that   the    agency   had\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fspecified.           Appellant claims that newly discovered evidence of\n\nfraud entitles him to revisit this judgment.                           Appellees respond\n\nwith multiple bases for dismissing the federal claims, including\n\nappellant's alleged failure to adequately plead a RICO cause of\n\naction,     Eleventh        Amendment         immunity,        and    the       Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine.       With an exception we address below, see infra at note 2,\n\nwe    believe     that      the    most       direct    path    –    and    thus     the   most\n\nappropriate – is via preclusion principles.\n\n       Res judicata under Puerto Rico law precludes \"only claims that\n\nwere or could have been raised in a previous suit,\" Boateng v.\n\nInteramerican Univ., Inc., 210 F.3d 56, 62 (lst Cir. 2000), and\n\nthere must be \"'the most perfect identity between the things,\n\ncauses, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such,'\"\n\nid.   at   61    (quoting         P.R.    Laws    Ann.    tit.       31,    §    3343).      The\n\nresemblance between the cases need not literally be \"perfect,\"\n\nhowever. Id. \"For res judicata purposes, '[t]he thing corresponds\n\nbasically       to    the   object       or    matter    over       which   the     action    is\n\nexercised.'\" Id. (quoting Lausell Marxuach v. Díaz de Yáñez, 3 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 742, 745 (1975)).                   The \"cause\" refers to \"the main\n\nground or origin of the action.\"                       Id.; see also Worldwide Food\n\nDistributors, Inc. v. Alberic Colón Bermúdez, 133 D.P.R. 827, 33\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. ___, slip op. at 7 (1993) (\"'the cause is\n\nequivalent to a ground or reason for asking'\") (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fPreclusive effect is given only to judgments that are \"final and\n\nunappealable.\"    Boateng, 210 F.3d at 63.\n\n      We conclude that the prerequisites for application of res\n\njudicata are met here.         Unquestionably, the underlying issue – the\n\nlegitimacy of PRIC's refusal to grant appellant an endorsement for\n\na   tax   exemption   –   is    identical,     matching   both    \"thing\"   (the\n\nendorsement)    and   \"cause\"     (the    validity   of   its    denial).   The\n\ncommonwealth circuit court decision on which we rely became final\n\nwhen the Puerto Rico Supreme Court denied certiorari in March\n\n1999.1    The parties, in pertinent respects, are the same.2\n\n\n      1\n       Shortly before he filed this federal action, appellant filed\na second commonwealth lawsuit against PRIC raising claims stemming\nfrom the denial of the tax exemption. The Puerto Rico Court of\nFirst Instance dismissed that complaint with prejudice, and his\npetition for review remains pending in the Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt. It is appellant's earlier commonwealth action, however,\nthat provides the basis for our res judicata holding. It appears\nthat appellant also filed a separate commonwealth action against\nthe Municipal Revenue Collection Center (CRIM), another defendant\nin this case, and that the CRIM action remains pending as well.\n      2\n       We note that the original commonwealth action involved only\nappellant and PRIC. Although the federal lawsuit named additional\nplaintiffs and defendants, the district court supportably\ndetermined that most of the new parties (appellant's business\nentities, individual PRIC officials and PRIC's insurer) held the\nsame interests as the original parties, so res judicata applies as\nwell to the claims against them. See Perez-Guzman v. Gracia, 346\nF.3d 229, 233-38 (lst Cir. 2003); Paniagua v. Corporacion de\nFomento Recreativo, 986 F. Supp. 694, 697 (D.P.R. 1997) (citing\nAcevedo Santiago v. Western Digital Caribe, Inc., 140 D.P.R. 452,\n40 P.R. Off. Trans. ____(1996)).\n     The one possible exception is CRIM (along with several CRIM\nemployees), but the claims against CRIM were properly dismissed for\nother reasons.    Appellant acknowledges that the Butler Act, 48\nU.S.C. § 872, prohibits a federal court from barring CRIM's\ncollection of the disputed taxes on his project.       He makes an\n\n                                         -4-\n\f     Appellant nonetheless maintains that the commonwealth judgment\n\nmay not be given res judicata effect because it was infected by\n\nfraud, and the presence of fraud triggers an exception to the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata.   See, e.g., Medina v. Chase Manhattan\n\nBank, N.A., 737 F.2d 140, 144 (lst Cir. 1984).3       Moreover, he\n\ncontends that the new allegations of fraud that underlie his RICO\n\nand civil rights claims distinguish this case from the earlier\n\nlitigation and could not have been raised earlier – making res\n\njudicata by definition inapplicable.\n\n     As best we can tell, the centerpiece of appellant's fraud\n\nclaim is the draft of a letter, dated July 7, 1997, prepared by\n\narchitect Jorge Ortiz Colón for signature by PRIC's director at the\n\ntime, Dr. Luis E. Díaz Hernández.      It is undisputed that the\n\n\n\nadditional due process claim, undeveloped in his brief, based on\nthe revocation of a fifteen-year tax exemption apparently granted\nto the property before he owned it. We decline to delve below the\nmurky surface of this allegation, but note that the challenged\nreassessment occurred no later than 1998; any resulting\nconstitutional claim would have been subject to a one-year statute\nof limitations. See Ruiz-Sulsona v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 334 F.3d\n157, 159 (lst Cir. 2003). His assertion that he did not discover\nthe reassessment until 2001 is belied by his statement that he\nlearned of the alleged retroactive debt in 1998 when he went to the\nPuerto Rico Tourism Company to apply for an extension of the tax\nexemption. See, e.g., Reply to Order to Show Cause and Motion for\nReconsideration; Affirmation in Support to Supplemental Opposition\nto Motion to Dismiss.\n     3\n       At oral argument, appellant's counsel made passing reference\nas well to the public policy exception to res judicata, see Medina,\n737 F.2d at 144.    The point was not developed, however, and in\nthese circumstances, we fail to see how it would provide an\nindependent basis for avoiding the doctrine.\n\n                               -5-\n\fletter, communicating denial of the Institute's endorsement of a\n\ntax exemption, was never sent, and that appellant was actually\n\nnotified of the denial in September 1997 by another PRIC official.4\n\nIt is also undisputed that Díaz Hernández had no contemporaneous\n\nknowledge of the draft letter. Appellant claims, however, that the\n\nletter was relied upon in a report written by PRIC architect\n\nMildred González Valentín and that González Valentín testified at\n\nthe PRIC administrative hearing that she had a signed copy of the\n\nletter.   Appellant suggests that use of the letter, without its\n\npurported author's knowledge, was fraudulent and that the letter\n\ntilted the proceedings against him.\n\n     We are unable to discern the fraud in these allegations.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that anyone deliberately\n\nmisrepresented the draft letter as the actual decision of Díaz\n\nHernández. Although it is alleged that González Valentín relied on\n\nthe letter in her report (which apparently is not part of the\n\nrecord on appeal), this assertion is of limited significance for\n\ntwo reasons.   First, the letter simply summarizes the results of\n\nPRIC's internal evaluation of the exemption request, matters that\n\nwere directly considered at the administrative hearing and by the\n\ncourt on review.   Nothing in the record indicates that the result\n\nat either stage was affected by the \"opinion\" on those matters of\n\n\n     4\n       The record indicates the notification letter was sent by\nHéctor F. Santiago Cazull, then Assistant Director of the\nInstitute's Patrimony Conservation area.\n\n                               -6-\n\fDíaz Hernández – who was no longer PRIC's director at the time the\n\nendorsement was denied. Second, the record indicates that González\n\nValentín concluded in her report that, despite the problems she\n\nidentified through an examination of the building and relevant\n\ndocuments, a five-year tax exemption would be appropriate if the\n\nconstruction blueprints for the project had previously received\n\nofficial approval, which would indicate compliance with PRIC's\n\nrequirements for preserving the building's historical value.                          In\n\nother words, despite the presence of the draft letter in her\n\nreport,      González     Valentín     recommended      an    exemption     if    PRIC's\n\nevaluation showed that the project met historical standards.\n\n       Thus, rather than reflecting fraud because it included the\n\ndraft letter, the architect's report suggests that the exemption\n\nwas denied because the project did not fulfill the specified\n\nrequirements      –   which      was   the    conclusion     reached   in     both    the\n\nadministrative and judicial proceedings.5                    We thus find no basis\n\nfor assigning the letter any significance in PRIC's decision to\n\ndeny       endorsement,    and    certainly        no   indication     that      it   was\n\nfraudulently used to induce an unjustified result.\n\n\n       5\n       Although appellant asserts that González Valentín testified\nthat she had a signed copy of the Díaz Hernández letter, there is\nsome ambiguity in the record about the certainty of that statement.\nThe lack of clarity is of no consequence, however, because the\nrecord contains no other evidence that any copy of the letter,\nwhich unquestionably was a draft, was signed. The only reasonable\ninference to be drawn, therefore, is that González Valentín's\ntestimony, if accurately described, reflected an error on her part\nand is not evidence of fraud.\n\n                                             -7-\n\f     In support of his claims, appellant submitted sworn statements\n\nfrom Díaz Hernández, the PRIC director who was the nominal author\n\nof the July 7 letter, and three others.           Although several of the\n\nstatements   make     conclusory    reference   to    fraudulent   activity,\n\nincluding    forged    documents,    fraudulent      documents   and   \"other\n\nimproprieties,\" the only specific assertions of wrongdoing appear\n\nto refer to the Ortiz Colón draft letter or the González Valentín\n\nreport, which, as we have discussed, cannot support a fraud claim.\n\nAs the following descriptions reveal, the offered sworn statements\n\nfail to assist appellant in meeting his obligation under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 9(b) to allege his claim of fraud \"with particularity.\"\n\nSee United States v. Karvelas, 360 F.3d 220, 226 (lst Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"Rule 9(b) requires that a plaintiff's averments of fraud specify\n\nthe time, place, and content of the alleged false or fraudulent\n\nrepresentations.\").\n\n     In his statement, Díaz Hernández, who left his position before\n\nthe endorsement was denied, confirms that he did not write the July\n\n7 letter, criticizes its inclusion in the architect's report and\n\nrefers to \"apparent inconsistencies effectuated by officials at the\n\nCulture Institute.\"      He states that he would have granted a ten-\n\nyear tax exemption because the project had complied with all of\n\nPRIC's requirements, but his general declaration of compliance\n\ncontradicts the agency's and court's formal findings that the\n\nrequirements were not fulfilled.           None of his assertions casts\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdoubt on the integrity of the review process conducted by the\n\nPuerto Rico circuit court or provides a basis for devaluing the\n\nfinality of its judgment.\n\n     Each of the other three affiants, all of whom worked for PRIC,\n\nalso offered only conclusory assertions of wrongdoing.                   Luis A.\n\nRuiz Quirindongo, an advisor to another PRIC director, Dr. José\n\nRamón de la Torre Martínez, stated that the file on appellant's\n\nproject    showed   that    \"documents      had    been    concealed,   and   that\n\npossible crimes committed therein, which induced errors within the\n\nexaminer's official report, as well as the courts and officials of\n\nthe Culture Institute.\" Ruiz stated that documentation was forged,\n\nbut did not specify the documents.            He further stated that PRIC's\n\nauditor concluded that there had been \"an agreement . . . to commit\n\nand to cover up crimes\" related to appellant's project.                   Such a\n\nbald claim of fraud, left unsubstantiated with any particular\n\nmisconduct, is insufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b) or to justify re-\n\nopening the administrative process.\n\n     The    remaining      two   affidavits       were    similarly   lacking   in\n\nparticularity.      De la Torre, who had left his position at PRIC by\n\nthe time of his statement, reported that he \"became aware of\n\ncertain questionable details executed during the process of denial\n\nof [appellant's] tax exemption application.\"                  He asserted that\n\narchitect Ortiz Colón \"apparently induced the Institute and the\n\nCourts to err, by creating the false impression\" that Ortiz Colón's\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwritten endorsement was for a limited portion of the project, the\n\ntunnel protection plan.         The Puerto Rico court, however, directly\n\nreviewed the file materials and concluded otherwise.6\n\n       The final affidavit was from Edgar Correa Salgado, PRIC's\n\nPress and Communication Director under de la Torre.            Correa refers\n\nto \"the existence of certain fraudulent documents prepared by\n\nArchitect Jorge Ortíz Colón\" and his – Correa's – recommendation\n\nthat       an   internal   investigation   be   conducted   into   appellant's\n\nallegations of improprieties in the endorsement process.                Again,\n\nthere is no identification of particular \"fraudulent documents,\"\n\nother than, apparently, the draft letter.             According to Correa,\n\nwhen he confronted de la Torre with information regarding \"other\n\nimproprieties and internal security problems\" affecting PRIC, de la\n\nTorre informed him that he was proceeding with his immediate\n\nresignation and \"that he would not carry out any action in relation\n\nto [appellant's] case.\"\n\n       None of these statements contain factual allegations adequate\n\nto undergird appellant's conclusory fraud claim. Even with respect\n\nto the July 7 draft letter and the González Valentín report, the\n\nstatements aver no fraudulent link to the administrative and\n\n\n       6\n       The court's opinion stated that \"it is clearly evident from\nthe file – in particular from the documentary evidence provided by\nthe petitioner himself – that said endorsement was given for the\nblueprints that submitted 'the corrective[] measures taken in order\nto separate (sic) the affected parts of the tunnel', . . . and that\nthe same did not amount to or constitute an endorsement for the\nproject to be carried out in the building.\"\n\n                                      -10-\n\fjudicial evaluation process.   If such generalities were enough to\n\njustify renewed inquiry into PRIC's denial of the endorsement, the\n\nfinality of judgments would be seriously compromised.      Lacking a\n\nviable fraud claim, appellant may not escape the preclusive effects\n\nof the prior proceedings.   Moreover, his inability to adequately\n\nallege fraud defeats any RICO claim, which depends upon a showing\n\nof at least two predicate acts of \"racketeering activity,\" conduct\n\nthat in this case was alleged to be mail and wire fraud.   See North\n\nBridge Assocs., Inc. v. Boldt, 274 F.3d 38, 42 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\nFinally, to the extent appellant asserts a section 1983 claim based\n\non conduct unrelated to the revocation of the tax exemption, see\n\nnote 2 supra, it is insufficiently elaborated in his brief to\n\npermit meaningful review and is therefore waived.   We thus affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment of dismissal.7\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n        We have considered appellant's challenges to CRIM's\nsubmission of exhibits without translations and to the court's\nallowance of extra filings by defendants, but find no error\nwarranting reversal of the district court's judgment.\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

We decline\n\nto add another lengthy chapter to the saga and therefore provide\n\nbackground only as necessary to explain our conclusion.\n\n     The merits of appellant's claim that PRIC wrongfully denied\n\nhim its endorsement were thoroughly considered by the Puerto Rico\n\nCircuit   Court     of   Appeals,       which   reviewed     the    voluminous\n\ncorrespondence and other documentary evidence generated between\n\n1988 and 1998, as well as the administrative transcript, and\n\nconcluded that appellant \"did not fulfill his obligation to show\n\nany irregularity in the proceedings.\" Rather, the court determined\n\nthat the PRIC endorsement was denied because appellant failed to\n\nsatisfy   the     architectural    requirements       that   the    agency   had\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fspecified.           Appellant claims that newly discovered evidence of\n\nfraud entitles him to revisit this judgment.                           Appellees respond\n\nwith multiple bases for dismissing the federal claims, including\n\nappellant's alleged failure to adequately plead a RICO cause of\n\naction,     Eleventh        Amendment         immunity,        and    the       Rooker-Feldman\n\ndoctrine.       With an exception we address below, see infra at note 2,\n\nwe    believe     that      the    most       direct    path    –    and    thus     the   most\n\nappropriate – is via preclusion principles.\n\n       Res judicata under Puerto Rico law precludes \"only claims that\n\nwere or could have been raised in a previous suit,\" Boateng v.\n\nInteramerican Univ., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198887\"><a href=\"/opinion/198887/boateng-v-interamerican-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (lst Cir. 2000), and\n\nthere must be \"'the most perfect identity between the things,\n\ncauses, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such,'\"\n\nid.   at   61    (quoting         P.R.

Unquestionably, the underlying issue – the\n\nlegitimacy of PRIC's refusal to grant appellant an endorsement for\n\na   tax   exemption   –   is    identical,     matching   both    \"thing\"   (the\n\nendorsement)    and   \"cause\"     (the    validity   of   its    denial).   The\n\ncommonwealth circuit court decision on which we rely became final\n\nwhen the Puerto Rico Supreme Court denied certiorari in March\n\n1999.1    The parties, in pertinent respects, are the same.2\n\n\n      1\n       Shortly before he filed this federal action, appellant filed\na second commonwealth lawsuit against PRIC raising claims stemming\nfrom the denial of the tax exemption. The Puerto Rico Court of\nFirst Instance dismissed that complaint with prejudice, and his\npetition for review remains pending in the Puerto Rico Supreme\nCourt. It is appellant's earlier commonwealth action, however,\nthat provides the basis for our res judicata holding. It appears\nthat appellant also filed a separate commonwealth action against\nthe Municipal Revenue Collection Center (CRIM), another defendant\nin this case, and that the CRIM action remains pending as well.\n      2\n       We note that the original commonwealth action involved only\nappellant and PRIC. Although the federal lawsuit named additional\nplaintiffs and defendants, the district court supportably\ndetermined that most of the new parties (appellant's business\nentities, individual PRIC officials and PRIC's insurer) held the\nsame interests as the original parties, so res judicata applies as\nwell to the claims against them.

See, e.g., Medina v. Chase Manhattan\n\nBank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437458\"><a href=\"/opinion/437458/angel-l-medina-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 144 (lst Cir. 1984).3       Moreover, he\n\ncontends that the new allegations of fraud that underlie his RICO\n\nand civil rights claims distinguish this case from the earlier\n\nlitigation and could not have been raised earlier – making res\n\njudicata by definition inapplicable.\n\n     As best we can tell, the centerpiece of appellant's fraud\n\nclaim is the draft of a letter, dated July 7, 1997, prepared by\n\narchitect Jorge Ortiz Colón for signature by PRIC's director at the\n\ntime, Dr. Luis E. Díaz Hernández.      It is undisputed that the\n\n\n\nadditional due process claim, undeveloped in his brief, based on\nthe revocation of a fifteen-year tax exemption apparently granted\nto the property before he owned it. We decline to delve below the\nmurky surface of this allegation, but note that the challenged\nreassessment occurred no later than 1998; any resulting\nconstitutional claim would have been subject to a one-year statute\nof limitations. See Ruiz-Sulsona v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200531\"><a href=\"/opinion/200531/ruiz-sulsona-v-university-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (lst Cir. 2003). His assertion that he did not discover\nthe reassessment until 2001 is belied by his statement that he\nlearned of the alleged retroactive debt in 1998 when he went to the\nPuerto Rico Tourism Company to apply for an extension of the tax\nexemption. See, e.g., Reply to Order to Show Cause and Motion for\nReconsideration; Affirmation in Support to Supplemental Opposition\nto Motion to Dismiss.\n     3\n       At oral argument, appellant's counsel made passing reference\nas well to the public policy exception to res judicata, see Medina,\n737 F.2d at 144.    The point was not developed, however, and in\nthese circumstances, we fail to see how it would provide an\nindependent basis for avoiding the doctrine.\n\n                               -5-\n\fletter, communicating denial of the Institute's endorsement of a\n\ntax exemption, was never sent, and that appellant was actually\n\nnotified of the denial in September 1997 by another PRIC official.4\n\nIt is also undisputed that Díaz Hernández had no contemporaneous\n\nknowledge of the draft letter. Appellant claims, however, that the\n\nletter was relied upon in a report written by PRIC architect\n\nMildred González Valentín and that González Valentín testified at\n\nthe PRIC administrative hearing that she had a signed copy of the\n\nletter.   Appellant suggests that use of the letter, without its\n\npurported author's knowledge, was fraudulent and that the letter\n\ntilted the proceedings against him.\n\n     We are unable to discern the fraud in these allegations.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that anyone deliberately\n\nmisrepresented the draft letter as the actual decision of Díaz\n\nHernández. Although it is alleged that González Valentín relied on\n\nthe letter in her report (which apparently is not part of the\n\nrecord on appeal), this assertion is of limited significance for\n\ntwo reasons.   First, the letter simply summarizes the results of\n\nPRIC's internal evaluation of the exemption request, matters that\n\nwere directly considered at the administrative hearing and by the\n\ncourt on review.   Nothing in the record indicates that the result\n\nat either stage was affected by the \"opinion\" on those matters of\n\n\n     4\n       The record indicates the notification letter was sent by\nHéctor F. Santiago Cazull, then Assistant Director of the\nInstitute's Patrimony Conservation area.\n\n                               -6-\n\fDíaz Hernández – who was no longer PRIC's director at the time the\n\nendorsement was denied. Second, the record indicates that González\n\nValentín concluded in her report that, despite the problems she\n\nidentified through an examination of the building and relevant\n\ndocuments, a five-year tax exemption would be appropriate if the\n\nconstruction blueprints for the project had previously received\n\nofficial approval, which would indicate compliance with PRIC's\n\nrequirements for preserving the building's historical value.                          In\n\nother words, despite the presence of the draft letter in her\n\nreport,      González     Valentín     recommended      an    exemption     if    PRIC's\n\nevaluation showed that the project met historical standards.\n\n       Thus, rather than reflecting fraud because it included the\n\ndraft letter, the architect's report suggests that the exemption\n\nwas denied because the project did not fulfill the specified\n\nrequirements      –   which      was   the    conclusion     reached   in     both    the\n\nadministrative and judicial proceedings.5                    We thus find no basis\n\nfor assigning the letter any significance in PRIC's decision to\n\ndeny       endorsement,    and    certainly        no   indication     that      it   was\n\nfraudulently used to induce an unjustified result.\n\n\n       5\n       Although appellant asserts that González Valentín testified\nthat she had a signed copy of the Díaz Hernández letter, there is\nsome ambiguity in the record about the certainty of that statement.\nThe lack of clarity is of no consequence, however, because the\nrecord contains no other evidence that any copy of the letter,\nwhich unquestionably was a draft, was signed. The only reasonable\ninference to be drawn, therefore, is that González Valentín's\ntestimony, if accurately described, reflected an error on her part\nand is not evidence of fraud.\n\n                                             -7-\n\f     In support of his claims, appellant submitted sworn statements\n\nfrom Díaz Hernández, the PRIC director who was the nominal author\n\nof the July 7 letter, and three others.           Although several of the\n\nstatements   make     conclusory    reference   to    fraudulent   activity,\n\nincluding    forged    documents,    fraudulent      documents   and   \"other\n\nimproprieties,\" the only specific assertions of wrongdoing appear\n\nto refer to the Ortiz Colón draft letter or the González Valentín\n\nreport, which, as we have discussed, cannot support a fraud claim.\n\nAs the following descriptions reveal, the offered sworn statements\n\nfail to assist appellant in meeting his obligation under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 9(b) to allege his claim of fraud \"with particularity.\"\n\nSee United States v. Karvelas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200868\"><a href=\"/opinion/200868/us-ex-rel-karvelas-v-melrose-wakefield/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (lst Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"Rule 9(b) requires that a plaintiff's averments of fraud specify\n\nthe time, place, and content of the alleged false or fraudulent\n\nrepresentations.\").\n\n     In his statement, Díaz Hernández, who left his position before\n\nthe endorsement was denied, confirms that he did not write the July\n\n7 letter, criticizes its inclusion in the architect's report and\n\nrefers to \"apparent inconsistencies effectuated by officials at the\n\nCulture Institute.\"      He states that he would have granted a ten-\n\nyear tax exemption because the project had complied with all of\n\nPRIC's requirements, but his general declaration of compliance\n\ncontradicts the agency's and court's formal findings that the\n\nrequirements were not fulfilled.           None of his assertions casts\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdoubt on the integrity of the review process conducted by the\n\nPuerto Rico circuit court or provides a basis for devaluing the\n\nfinality of its judgment.\n\n     Each of the other three affiants, all of whom worked for PRIC,\n\nalso offered only conclusory assertions of wrongdoing.                   Luis A.\n\nRuiz Quirindongo, an advisor to another PRIC director, Dr. José\n\nRamón de la Torre Martínez, stated that the file on appellant's\n\nproject    showed   that    \"documents      had    been    concealed,   and   that\n\npossible crimes committed therein, which induced errors within the\n\nexaminer's official report, as well as the courts and officials of\n\nthe Culture Institute.\" Ruiz stated that documentation was forged,\n\nbut did not specify the documents.            He further stated that PRIC's\n\nauditor concluded that there had been \"an agreement . . . to commit\n\nand to cover up crimes\" related to appellant's project.                   Such a\n\nbald claim of fraud, left unsubstantiated with any particular\n\nmisconduct, is insufficient to satisfy Rule 9(b) or to justify re-\n\nopening the administrative process.\n\n     The    remaining      two   affidavits       were    similarly   lacking   in\n\nparticularity.      De la Torre, who had left his position at PRIC by\n\nthe time of his statement, reported that he \"became aware of\n\ncertain questionable details executed during the process of denial\n\nof [appellant's] tax exemption application.\"                  He asserted that\n\narchitect Ortiz Colón \"apparently induced the Institute and the\n\nCourts to err, by creating the false impression\" that Ortiz Colón's\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwritten endorsement was for a limited portion of the project, the\n\ntunnel protection plan.         The Puerto Rico court, however, directly\n\nreviewed the file materials and concluded otherwise.6\n\n       The final affidavit was from Edgar Correa Salgado, PRIC's\n\nPress and Communication Director under de la Torre.            Correa refers\n\nto \"the existence of certain fraudulent documents prepared by\n\nArchitect Jorge Ortíz Colón\" and his – Correa's – recommendation\n\nthat       an   internal   investigation   be   conducted   into   appellant's\n\nallegations of improprieties in the endorsement process.                Again,\n\nthere is no identification of particular \"fraudulent documents,\"\n\nother than, apparently, the draft letter.             According to Correa,\n\nwhen he confronted de la Torre with information regarding \"other\n\nimproprieties and internal security problems\" affecting PRIC, de la\n\nTorre informed him that he was proceeding with his immediate\n\nresignation and \"that he would not carry out any action in relation\n\nto [appellant's] case.\"\n\n       None of these statements contain factual allegations adequate\n\nto undergird appellant's conclusory fraud claim. Even with respect\n\nto the July 7 draft letter and the González Valentín report, the\n\nstatements aver no fraudulent link to the administrative and\n\n\n       6\n       The court's opinion stated that \"it is clearly evident from\nthe file – in particular from the documentary evidence provided by\nthe petitioner himself – that said endorsement was given for the\nblueprints that submitted 'the corrective[] measures taken in order\nto separate (sic) the affected parts of the tunnel', . . . and that\nthe same did not amount to or constitute an endorsement for the\nproject to be carried out in the building.\"\n\n                                      -10-\n\fjudicial evaluation process.   If such generalities were enough to\n\njustify renewed inquiry into PRIC's denial of the endorsement, the\n\nfinality of judgments would be seriously compromised.      Lacking a\n\nviable fraud claim, appellant may not escape the preclusive effects\n\nof the prior proceedings.   Moreover, his inability to adequately\n\nallege fraud defeats any RICO claim, which depends upon a showing\n\nof at least two predicate acts of \"racketeering activity,\" conduct\n\nthat in this case was alleged to be mail and wire fraud.

We thus affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment of dismissal.7\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n        We have considered appellant's challenges to CRIM's\nsubmission of exhibits without translations and to the court's\nallowance of extra filings by defendants, but find no error\nwarranting reversal of the district court's judgment.\n\n                               -11-\n\f</pre>",
