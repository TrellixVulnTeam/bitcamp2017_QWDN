Christopher Bullock appeals the judgment and\n\n160-month sentence imposed following his jury trial conviction for\n\nconspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine and cocaine base (\"crack\"), in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\nยง 846.   He contends the district court erred in (1) denying his\n\nmotion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence; (2) admitting\n\ncoconspirator statements which were inadmissible hearsay; and (3)\n\ndetermining the drug quantity for sentencing purposes.           We affirm\n\nthe conviction and sentence.\n\n          At Bullock's jury trial, two coconspirators, Dana Towsley\n\nand Carlos \"Blacks\" Richards, and multiple investigating police\n\nofficers, including undercover Detective Brian Phelps, testified\n\nfor the government against Bullock.          Towsley, who had already\n\npleaded guilty to crack distribution charges in this matter,\n\ntestified that during the spring and summer of 2001, he lived in\n\nBullock's apartment and worked for him by \"running crack.\" Towsley\n\nexplained that Bullock permitted him to live in his apartment\n\nwithout paying rent and, in exchange, Towsley would deliver crack\n\nto Bullock's customers.    Towsley further testified that he made\n\nfive or six trips to New York City to obtain crack for Bullock.\n\nWhile Towsley   admitted   that   he    sometimes   sold   his   own   crack\n\nindependently, he also testified that Bullock supplied him with\n\ncrack on occasion and that on April 30, 2001, the crack Towsley\n\nsold to undercover Detective Phelps belonged to Bullock.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                Richards, who had also already pleaded guilty to crack\n\ndistribution charges in this matter, testified that he assisted\n\nBullock in selling crack by helping him package and deliver it.\n\nRichards also admitted to selling and packaging his own crack\n\nindependently and that the crack he sold to Detective Phelps on\n\nAugust     8,    2001,    was   his   own,    but   that   Bullock   provided   the\n\ntransportation, namely his vehicle, for that delivery.\n\n                Investigating police officers testified that on April 19,\n\n2001, after Towsley told Detective Phelps he could obtain crack\n\nlater that day by walking to get it, they observed Towsley and\n\nRichards walk into Bullock's apartment shortly before returning to\n\nPhelps with crack for sale.               Detective Phelps further testified\n\nthat on April 24, 2001, Bullock's apartment telephone was utilized\n\nby Richards and Towsley for a crack sale.                  Phelps also testified\n\nthat Bullock was actually present at two crack sales which took\n\nplace on April 30 and August 8, 2001.\n\n                Bullock first contends that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto convict him of violating 21 U.S.C. ยง 846, and that the trial\n\ncourt should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. We\n\nreview this claim de novo, see United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d\n\n30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998), unitarily applying the familiar sufficiency\n\nof the evidence standard, see United States v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d\n\n58,   64   n.4     (1st    Cir.   2000)      (noting   that   challenges   to   the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fsufficiency of the evidence and to the denial of a motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal raise a single issue).\n\n           Under this standard, the court reviews all the evidence,\n\ndirect and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the\n\nverdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether\n\na rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.    See United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35\n\n(1st   Cir.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1030 (2001).       It is immaterial\n\nthat a possible rendition of the record could support a not guilty\n\nverdict; it is enough that a rational trier of fact could have\n\nconstrued the evidence to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee id.\n\n           Bullock argues that the evidence presented at trial\n\nmerely establishes independent and joint venture sales of crack by\n\ncoconspirators Towsley and Richards, sales which \"neither involved\n\nnor were dependent[] on Mr. Bullock.\"         According to Bullock, the\n\nevidence failed to establish that he intended to agree and to\n\ncommit the conspiracy with Towsley and Richards for which he was\n\nconvicted.\n\n           To prove a drug conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. ยง 846, the\n\ngovernment   must   show   that   a    conspiracy   existed   and   that   a\n\nparticular defendant agreed to participate in it, with the intent\n\nto commit the underlying substantive offense. See Baltas, 236 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fat 35.      It is necessary to show both intent to agree and intent to\n\ncommit the substantive offense.            See id. at 35-36.           However, the\n\ngovernment need not show that a given defendant took part in all\n\naspects     of   the    conspiracy.      See   id.     at   36.      One   can   be   a\n\nconspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some of the acts leading\n\nto the substantive offense. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S.\n\n52, 65 (1997).\n\n              The record reflects that evidence established not only\n\nthe existence of a drug conspiracy, but one in which Bullock\n\nclearly agreed to participate with the intent to distribute crack.\n\nProof of Bullock's direct participation in every drug sale made by\n\nhis    coconspirators      is    not   required   to    convict      him   for   drug\n\nconspiracy. See id.; United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768,\n\n773 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Bullock     next    contends     that     certain       coconspirator\n\nstatements should not have been admitted at trial.                         Under an\n\nexception to the hearsay rule, an out-of-court statement made \"by\n\na coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy,\" may be offered into evidence against that party.\n\nFed.   R.    Evid.     801(d)(2)(E).      To   invoke       this    exception,    the\n\ngovernment \"bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and\n\nthe defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement\n\nduring and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"                      United States v.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fBradshaw,   281     F.3d    278,    283    (1st    Cir.   2002)   (internal    marks\n\nomitted).         Because    coconspirator         statements     are   not   deemed\n\nself-elucidating, the government must introduce extrinsic evidence\n\nsufficient to delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the roles of\n\nthe declarant and the defendant.                 See United States v. Sepulveda,\n\n15 F.3d 1161, 1181-82 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Here, the government introduced sufficient extrinsic\n\nevidence to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, the\n\nexistence of a conspiracy, and the respective roles of Towsley,\n\nRichards, and Bullock.             See id. at 1180.        Detective Phelps and\n\nother police officers corroborated Towsley and Richards' testimony\n\nby linking four separate crack sales to Bullock, Bullock's vehicle,\n\nor   Bullock's     apartment.        We    reject     Bullock's   claim   that    the\n\ngovernment failed to satisfy its foundational requirement for\n\nadmitting the hearsay statements of Bullock's coconspirators.\n\n            Bullock contends that at sentencing the district court\n\ninappropriately included all the drug sales Towsley and Richards\n\nmade to Detective Phelps, despite evidence that Bullock was not\n\ninvolved in most of them.           We review a sentencing court's findings\n\nof fact concerning drug quantity for clear error. See United States\n\nv. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The     district       court   calculated      the    applicable     drug\n\nquantity to be between twenty and thirty-five grams of crack,\n\nyielding a base offense level of twenty-eight. The court based its\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f\"very conservative figure\" on four undercover sales to Phelps\n\nlinked to Bullock (the April 19, April 24, April 30, and August 8,\n\n2001 transactions), and the crack Towsley obtained for Bullock on\n\nmultiple trips to New York City.   Bullock was present at two of the\n\nsales and provided use of his apartment and telephone for two other\n\nsales, for a total sale to Detective Phelps of 13.77 grams of\n\ncrack.   Also, Towsley obtained approximately half an ounce, or 14\n\ngrams, of crack for Bullock on each of his five or six trips to New\n\nYork City.   The district court did not err in making its sentencing\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Because    coconspirator         statements     are   not   deemed\n\nself-elucidating, the government must introduce extrinsic evidence\n\nsufficient to delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the roles of\n\nthe declarant and the defendant.

See id. at 1180.        Detective Phelps and\n\nother police officers corroborated Towsley and Richards' testimony\n\nby linking four separate crack sales to Bullock, Bullock's vehicle,\n\nor   Bullock's     apartment.        We    reject     Bullock's   claim   that    the\n\ngovernment failed to satisfy its foundational requirement for\n\nadmitting the hearsay statements of Bullock's coconspirators.\n\n            Bullock contends that at sentencing the district court\n\ninappropriately included all the drug sales Towsley and Richards\n\nmade to Detective Phelps, despite evidence that Bullock was not\n\ninvolved in most of them.           We review a sentencing court's findings\n\nof fact concerning drug quantity for clear error. See United States\n\nv.

The court based its\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f\"very conservative figure\" on four undercover sales to Phelps\n\nlinked to Bullock (the April 19, April 24, April 30, and August 8,\n\n2001 transactions), and the crack Towsley obtained for Bullock on\n\nmultiple trips to New York City.   Bullock was present at two of the\n\nsales and provided use of his apartment and telephone for two other\n\nsales, for a total sale to Detective Phelps of 13.77 grams of\n\ncrack.   Also, Towsley obtained approximately half an ounce, or 14\n\ngrams, of crack for Bullock on each of his five or six trips to New\n\nYork City.   The district court did not err in making its sentencing\n\ncalculations.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
