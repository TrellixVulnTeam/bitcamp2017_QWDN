After a thorough review of the record and of the\n\nparties'   lengthy   submissions,    we   affirm   the   district   court's\n\ndismissal of the federal claims in these cases pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).    The just compensation claim was not ripe at the\n\ntime it was dismissed. See Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n\n\nv. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985). Appellants suggest that the\n\nstate procedures for obtaining just compensation are inadequate\n\nbecause they do not provide for recovery of attorney's fees; but\n\nthere is no authority for this suggestion.          The American Rule is\n\nwell-established, and it provides that attorney's fees \"are not\n\nordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute or enforceable\n\ncontract providing therefor.\"        Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v.\n\nMaier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 717 (1967).\n\n       The district court also was correct to dismiss the procedural\n\nand substantive due process claims.         Appellants seem to concede\n\nthat they were afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard by\n\nthe Environmental Quality Board that developed the Environmental\n\nImpact Statement in question.       But, where a plaintiff claims his\n\nprocedural due process rights were violated, the federal court's\n\nonly    concern   should   be   whether   the   procedure   afforded    was\n\nconstitutionally adequate; and the local procedures here suffice.\n\nThe appellants' claim that government officials acted arbitrarily\n\nand/or in violation of state law and procedures is a substantive\n\ndue process claim.     See Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113 (1990).\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fNot every incorrect decision by a state administrative body rises\n\nto the level of a due process violation.

Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Even where state\n\nofficials have allegedly violated state law or administrative\n\nprocedures, such violations do not ordinarily rise to the level of\n\na constitutional deprivation.\") (citation omitted).             \"Our cases\n\nmake    clear   that   a   regulatory    board     does   not   transgress\n\nconstitutional due process requirements merely by making decisions\n\n'for erroneous reasons' or by making 'demands which arguably exceed\n\nits authority under the relevant state statutes.'\"              Amsden v.\n\nMoran, 904 F.2d 748, 757 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Creative Env'ts,\n\nInc. v.
