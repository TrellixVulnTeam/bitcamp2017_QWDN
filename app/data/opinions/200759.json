Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Bownes,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n                          ORDER OF COURT\n\n\n\n                         December 5, 2003\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Senior Judge Hugh H. Bownes participated in the original\nhearing and disposition of the this case but retired on September\n1, 2003, prior to the filing of the petition for rehearing, and\npassed away on November 5, 2003.    The remaining members of the\npanel comprise a quorum for the issuance of this order. See 28\nU.S.C. ยง 46(d).\n\f       On September 9, 2003 the defendant-appellants filed a Petition\n\nfor    Rehearing in their individual capacity and a Petition for\n\nRehearing and/or Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc in their official\n\ncapacity.       As is explained herein, we grant the petition for a\n\npanel rehearing, which moots the suggestion for rehearing en banc.\n\n       In our opinion of August 21, we stated that our review of the\n\nlegal issues in the case was handicapped by the defendants' failure\n\nto    produce   transcripts       of    the    defense      portion    of       the   trial.\n\nSpecifically,      we    were    unable       to   review     fully    the      challenged\n\nevidentiary rulings, claims of inappropriate participation of the\n\ntrial court, and the sufficiency of the evidence challenge.\n\n       In their petition for rehearing, defendants explained that\n\nthey ordered the transcripts from the court reporter, paid for the\n\ntranscripts,      and    later    received         a   full   set     of    transcripts.\n\nFurthermore, both parties referred to the full set of transcripts\n\nin their briefs.         Upon further investigation, we determined that\n\nthe   transcripts       were    never    properly      filed    with       us    through   a\n\ncombination of miscues by the defendants, the court reporter, and\n\nthe circuit court clerk's office. Without assigning responsibility\n\nto any one party for the absence of the transcripts, we decided\n\nthat we would review the now available transcripts in deciding the\n\nissues to which they relate.\n\n       Having done so, we find nothing in the full record that\n\nrequires us to alter the ruling in our opinion filed on August 21.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fBy this order, we grant the petition for rehearing, withdraw our\n\nopinion filed August 21, and file a revised opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              By the Court,\n\n\n                              ______________________________\n                              Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified Copies to Hon.
