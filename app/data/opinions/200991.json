Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bruce Green for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J.

Following an eight-day trial, a\n\njury convicted defendant Dana Dray McCann (a/k/a Danny Combs and D.\n\nDacques Sonner) of mail fraud, wire fraud, and engaging in monetary\n\ntransactions in criminally derived funds (\"money laundering\"). See\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, & 1957.           This appeal requires us to decide\n\n(1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the mail-fraud\n\nconviction, (2) whether the district court abused its discretion in\n\nmaking two evidentiary rulings, (3) whether it was plain error for\n\na   federal    agent     to     testify    that,        during   a     non-custodial\n\ninterrogation, McCann had refused to provide his true name when\n\nasked, and (4) whether the court erred in sentencing.                           After\n\ncareful review, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the verdicts, see United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 676\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), omitting details extraneous to the issues raised\n\non appeal.\n\n          In     the    late    1990's,        McCann    moved   to     Springfield,\n\nMassachusetts, where he developed business and personal connections\n\nwithin the Springfield law firm of Winniman & Winniman.                       It was\n\nthrough these connections –- particularly, a relationship with Sara\n\nRossman (a paralegal at the firm) –- that McCann was able to obtain\n\naccess   to    the     firm's    accounts,       stationery,         notary   stamps,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsignatures, and other items that assisted him in the two fraudulent\n\nschemes at issue in this case.\n\n           A.    Scheme #1: The Purchase of the Horse Farm\n\n           On April 6, 2000, McCann provided Rossman at Winniman &\n\nWinniman a counterfeit $2 million check (purportedly drawn on an\n\nItalian bank) and asked her to deposit the check into the firm's\n\ntrust account.    McCann advised Rossman that he planned to use this\n\nmoney to pay for, inter alia, his purchase of a horse farm in\n\nWindsor, Connecticut.       Based on these representations, Rossman\n\nprepared a deposit ticket and immediately issued to McCann several\n\nchecks drawn on the trust account, including a $1 million check for\n\nthe purchase of the horse farm.        Rossman and McCann then traveled\n\ntogether to the firm's bank to deposit the check, but Rossman left\n\nto run errands before they reached the teller.             McCann left the\n\nbank without depositing the $2 million check.\n\n           Later that day, McCann (posing as D. Dacques Sonner, the\n\nChairman of International Land & Livestock) finalized an earlier-\n\nagreed-upon     purchase   of   the   horse   farm   by   providing   Dennis\n\nMcCormack (an attorney for the seller's trust) with the $1 million\n\ncheck drawn on the Winniman & Winniman trust account.            McCormack\n\nadvised McCann that the deed would be delivered once the check had\n\ncleared.   The following day, McCormack mailed Winniman & Winniman\n\na letter stating that he was depositing the check into the seller's\n\ntrust account and that he would disburse funds from that account on\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fApril 12th unless he heard otherwise.         Hearing nothing, McCormack\n\nthereafter wrote checks on the seller's trust account.             When these\n\nchecks bounced (because the $1 million check never cleared),\n\nMcCormack     immediately   phoned    McCann,     who    then    promised    to\n\nstraighten out what he alleged was a mix-up at the bank.\n\n             Meanwhile, McCann (posing as attorney Danny Combs with\n\nWinniman & Winniman) had been in simultaneous loan negotiations\n\nwith West Coast businessman William Abraczinskas.                 McCann was\n\nseeking from Abraczinskas a quick infusion of approximately $2\n\nmillion in \"show money\" –- money needed merely to show the sellers\n\nthat \"Combs's\" \"client\" (i.e., McCann) had the wherewithal to\n\npurchase the farm –- that would immediately be repaid, together\n\nwith $1 million interest.       Abraczinskas was told that the \"show\n\nmoney\" would not be released without his permission and that it\n\nwould simply remain in the Winniman & Winniman trust account until\n\nrepaid.1\n\n             Abraczinskas eventually agreed and, on April 13, 2000,\n\nwired $1.56 million to the trust account.           The account now being\n\nfunded (albeit with \"show money\"), McCann met with McCormack on\n\nApril 14th and provided him with a $1 million certified check\n\n(which     McCormack   deposited).     It   was   only   after    McCann    had\n\nwithdrawn the \"show money\" and received a deed to the horse farm\n\n\n\n     1\n      McCann advised Abraczinskas that the \"client\" was wiring the\npurchase money from abroad but that the money had not yet arrived.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat a concerned Abraczinskas, in an effort to protect himself,\n\nentered into a purchase-repurchase agreement with McCann.     This\n\nagreement provided, inter alia, that Abraczinskas was to take title\n\nto the farm (and five horses) until McCann repaid the loan.   Once\n\npayment was received, Abraczinskas would release title back to\n\nMcCann.   Expecting McCann to tender payment and seeking to avoid\n\nany tax consequences, Abraczinskas –- who did not want the farm in\n\nany event –- did not immediately record the deed and instead\n\naccepted McCann's various explanations for the delay.\n\n          A few months later, in July 2000, McCann (posing as D.\n\nDacques Sonner) telephoned McCormack and asked for a $200,000 loan\n\nto purchase an Arabian horse.   Despite having already transferred\n\nto Abraczinskas the deed to the horse farm, McCann offered the farm\n\nas collateral for the loan.      After a subsequent title search\n\nrevealed that McCann had clear title (recall that Abraczinskas had\n\nnot yet recorded), McCormack agreed to the loan and promptly\n\nrecorded the mortgage.\n\n          Abraczinskas recorded his deed on August 31, 2000, having\n\nnever received payment from McCann on the original loan.\n\n          B.   Scheme #2: The Double Assignment of the Mortgage\n\n          On or about April 14, 2000 -- using funds from the $1.56\n\nmillion wire -- McCann loaned $250,000 to Robert and Edward Allen\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\ffor their purchase of a building in Springfield.2        The Allens, in\n\nturn, provided McCann with a note secured by a mortgage on the\n\nbuilding and agreed to tender monthly payments to Winniman &\n\nWinniman.\n\n            McCann   thereafter   proceeded    to   assign   the   Allens'\n\nmortgage to two different buyers.        First, on May 18, 2000, he\n\nassigned the mortgage to Brian David for $175,000, with Winniman &\n\nWinniman handling the details.       Under the agreement, the Allens\n\nwould simply continue forwarding payments to Winniman & Winniman,\n\nwhich would then issue checks to David.       For some reason, David did\n\nnot immediately record the assignment; according to David, there\n\nwas a possibility that McCann would buy back the mortgage in a\n\nshort period of time.\n\n            Approximately one month after this assignment, aided by\n\nDavid's failure to record, McCann assigned the same mortgage to\n\nPaul Picknelly for $165,000.       Picknelly (through his attorney)\n\nimmediately recorded the assignment and, on June 21, 2000, mailed\n\nto the Allens a letter (the \"June 21st letter\") notifying them of\n\nthe change and directing them to make payments directly to him\n\nrather than through Winniman & Winniman.         Having received in the\n\ninterim some payments from the Allens (and perhaps unaware of the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The $250,000 check was drawn on the Winniman & Winniman trust\naccount.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fnew assignment), Rossman thereafter began making payments to David\n\n–- by personal check.3\n\n            Sometime around July 20, 2000, David (unaware, of course,\n\nof McCann's subsequent dealings) received from McCann an undated\n\nletter stating that the corporation for which McCann worked had\n\nvoted to repurchase the mortgage and would accordingly send payment\n\nby August 3rd.       In early August 2000, a partner at Winniman &\n\nWinniman discovered David's unrecorded assignment; after contacting\n\nDavid, the partner immediately recorded the assignment only to\n\nlearn that the Allens' mortgage had also been assigned to –- and\n\npromptly recorded by -- Picknelly.\n\n            C.    Procedural History\n\n            McCann subsequently was tried before a jury on seven\n\ncounts of a superseding indictment: two counts of mail fraud (see\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1341), two counts of wire fraud (see 18 U.S.C. § 1343),\n\nand three counts of money laundering (see 18 U.S.C. § 1957).\n\nFollowing   the    government's   presentation   of   its   case-in-chief,\n\nMcCann moved for a judgment of acquittal on each count.           See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 29.4     The district court granted this motion as to one\n\n\n     3\n      Although McCann's transaction with David closed in mid-May,\nRossman's first check to David was dated July 7, 2000.      David\ntestified that, in total, he received two or three payments, with\nthe last payment occurring sometime after his vacation during the\nlast two weeks of August. (This information is relevant to the\ndiscussion in Part II. A, below.)\n     4\n      In order to preserve McCann's rights on appeal, the court\ndeemed the motion filed at the close of the evidence as well.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fof the mail-fraud counts (a bank's mailing of an insufficient-funds\n\nnotice to McCormack after he had attempted to draw on the seller's\n\ntrust account) but denied it with respect to the remaining six\n\ncounts.\n\n          The jury thereafter returned guilty verdicts on five of\n\nthese six counts: the remaining mail-fraud count (Picknelly's June\n\n21st letter informing the Allens of the assignment); one of the\n\nwire-fraud counts (the $1.56 million wire from Abraczinskas to the\n\nWinniman & Winniman trust account); and all three money-laundering\n\ncounts (Abraczinskas's $1.56 million wire transfer, McCormack's\n\ndelivery of the $1 million certified check for deposit, and the\n\ndelivery of the $250,000 check to the Allens).       A verdict of not\n\nguilty was returned on the other wire-fraud count (a call from\n\nMcCann to Picknelly discussing the terms of the assignment).\n\n          On January 9, 2003, McCann was sentenced to 105 months'\n\nimprisonment (consisting of concurrent sentences of 60 months for\n\nthe fraud convictions and 105 months for the money-laundering\n\nconvictions),   a   three-year   term   of   supervised   release,   and\n\n$1,895,610.84 in restitution.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          As noted above, we are presented with four issues on\n\nappeal: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the\n\nmail-fraud conviction; (2) whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in making two evidentiary rulings; (3) whether it was\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fplain error for a federal agent to testify that, during a non-\n\ncustodial interrogation, McCann had refused to provide his true\n\nname when asked; and (4) whether the court erred in sentencing.\n\n             Given these separate issues, four standards of review\n\napply.   First, in deciding sufficiency challenges, \"we review all\n\nthe   evidence,   direct   and    circumstantial,      in     the   light    most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences\n\nconsistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to\n\ndetermine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"             United States v. Baltas, 236\n\nF.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see also United\n\nStates v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that\n\nsufficiency challenges are reviewed de novo).              Second, where there\n\nhas been a proper objection below, we review a district court's\n\ndecision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.                 See United\n\nStates v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Udemba\n\nv. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[A] trial court enjoys\n\nconsiderable    discretion   in    connection       with    the   admission    or\n\nexclusion of evidence. . . .\").              Third, where there has been no\n\nproper objection below, we review an evidentiary issue for plain\n\nerror.    See Casas, 356 F.3d at 113.                Finally, in reviewing\n\nsentencing    determinations     not    involving    departures,      we    first\n\ndetermine the applicability and interpretation of the relevant\n\nguideline de novo and then review the court's factual findings for\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fclear error.     See United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51, 70-72 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            Mindful of the various standards of review, we turn now\n\nto a sequential discussion of the four issues.\n\n            A.   The Mail-Fraud Conviction\n\n            \"The key elements of the crime of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1341, are: (1) the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or\n\nartifice to defraud; (2) the knowing and willing participation in\n\nthe scheme with the specific intent to defraud; and (3) the use of\n\nthe mails in furtherance of the scheme.\"5             United States v.\n\nMontminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).\n\nGiven the arguments raised on appeal, our focus is on the third\n\nelement.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The   mail-fraud    statute   provides,   in   relevant   part,   as\nfollows:\n\n     Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme\n     or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or\n     property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,\n     representations, or promises . . . for the purpose of\n     executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to\n     do . . . knowingly causes to be delivered by mail . . .\n     any . . . matter or thing, shall be fined under this\n     title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. If\n     the violation affects a financial institution, such\n     person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or\n     imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1341.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            The Supreme Court has explained that, while \"the mailing\n\nmust be for the purpose of executing the scheme, . . . it is not\n\nnecessary that the scheme contemplate the use of the mails as an\n\nessential element.\"         United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 400\n\n(1974)    (citations     and   quotation    marks   omitted).        Nor    is   it\n\nnecessary that the mailing itself be fraudulent; an \"innocent\"\n\nmailing –- i.e., one that contains no false information –- will\n\nsatisfy    the     in-furtherance-of     requirement    so    long   as     it   is\n\n\"incident to an essential part of the scheme\" or \"a step in the\n\nplot.\"    Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 710-11, 715 (1989)\n\n(citations omitted). Moreover, the defendant need not himself mail\n\nthe letter; \"[a] mailing need only be closely related to the scheme\n\nand reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's actions.\"\n\nUnited    States    v.   Serino,   835   F.2d   924,   928   (1st    Cir.   1987)\n\n(citation omitted).       The relevant question is \"whether the mailing\n\nis part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the\n\nperpetrator at the time, regardless of whether the mailing later,\n\nthrough hindsight, may prove to have been counterproductive and\n\nreturn to haunt the perpetrator of the fraud.\"               Schmuck, 489 U.S.\n\nat 715.\n\n            McCann argues that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion for a judgment of acquittal on the mail-fraud count\n\nbecause, \"even when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, [Picknelly's June 21st letter to the Allens] was\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f[mailed]    after       the    scheme     had   reached     fruition    and    .   .   .\n\ntherefore    .     .    .     was   not   in    furtherance    of     the     scheme.\"6\n\nSpecifically, McCann contends that, because he had already received\n\nthe proceeds from his double assignment of the mortgage, the\n\nevidence was insufficient to establish that the letter served any\n\npurpose but to increase the risk of detection.                  We disagree.\n\n            When       entertaining       the   Rule   29   motion,    Judge    Ponsor\n\nsummarized the government's argument (echoed on appeal) regarding\n\nthe mailing's purpose:\n\n            I think [the government's] argument is that\n            the whole David/Picknelly scam, which we'll\n            call it since we're going to have to take the\n            facts at the moment in the light most\n            favorable to the government, was like a house\n            of cards. And the letter to the Allens [from\n            Picknelly's attorney] instructing them to\n            begin making their payments to Mr. Picknelly\n            kept that house of cards from collapsing.\n\n            It meant that Mr. McCann at this point has got\n            in excess of $300,000, and . . . at a cost of\n            [just] over $20,000 a year, he can keep paying\n            [David].   He can keep paying his cat's-paw,\n            Sara Rossman, the money every month and she\n            can keep sending it to [David] and he can\n            stall for a year on that arrangement and,\n            meanwhile, [the Allens would continue to pay\n            Mr. Picknelly] and the house of cards would\n            not collapse unless Mr. Allen ever ran into\n            Mr. David on the street or Mr. David ever had\n            any conversation with Mr. Picknelly about\n            this.\n\n            But it would keep the house of cards from\n            collapsing if the Allens sent their checks to\n\n\n     6\n      McCann does not contest that he \"caused\" the letter to be\nmailed within the meaning of the statute.\n\n                                           -12-\n\f          Picknelly and it would allow [McCann] . . . to\n          buy time in which he could maybe raise enough\n          money to purport to buy the mortgage back from\n          [David] and essentially erase that aspect of\n          the deal through some other, who knows what,\n          source of funds.\n\n          That's I think [the government's] argument.\n          That it lulls, it conceals, it maintains. It\n          props up the house of cards for a little while\n          longer and that that's an important part of\n          what he was doing.\n\nIn a nutshell, then, the government's argument is that Picknelly's\n\nJune 21st letter served the important purpose of decreasing the\n\nrisk of detection by causing the Allens' payments to be routed in\n\nsuch a way as to keep the scheme running until such time as McCann\n\ncould devise a way to fix the David problem and perhaps even avoid\n\ndetection altogether.\n\n          Where the evidence supports a finding of such a purpose,\n\nthe mailing would be within the ambit of the statute.   See Schmuck,\n\n489 U.S. at 712 (\"[A] mailing that is incident to an essential part\n\nof the scheme satisfies the mailing element of the mail fraud\n\noffense.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); United\n\nStates v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 451-52 (1986) (\"Mailings occurring\n\nafter receipt of the goods obtained by fraud are within the [mail-\n\nfraud] statute if they 'were designed to lull the victims into a\n\nfalse sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the\n\nauthorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendant[]\n\nless likely than if no mailings had taken place.'\" (quoting Maze,\n\n414 U.S. at 403)); United States v. Pacheco-Ortiz, 889 F.2d 301,\n\n                               -13-\n\f305 (1st Cir. 1989) (post-Schmuck) (\"[F]or the mailings to be\n\nconsidered in furtherance of the scheme, the scheme's completion or\n\nthe prevention of its detection must have depended in some way on\n\nthe mailings.\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          Here, having viewed the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude\n\nthat there was sufficient evidentiary support for a finding that\n\nPicknelly's mailing served the proffered purpose and thus was\n\n\"incident to an essential part of the scheme.\"   Schmuck, 489 U.S.\n\nat 711.\n\n          The evidence established that McCann was a clever con\n\nartist who ultimately got most of what he wanted by thinking ahead,\n\nestablishing important relationships, and devising complex and\n\nskillful schemes without going overboard.   McCann almost certainly\n\nknew that, after paying $165,000 for the note, Picknelly (an astute\n\nbusinessman) would be expecting payments from the Allens and would\n\nnot need a law firm as a go-between.        From this evidence, a\n\nrational jury could have inferred that McCann intended to take full\n\nadvantage of the Picknelly situation in order to keep the scheme\n\ngoing strong.    Ultimate success meant avoiding detection and\n\nPicknelly's reasonably foreseeable letter was a crucial step along\n\nthat path.   By diverting the Allens' payments from Winniman &\n\nWinniman to Picknelly, the letter protected McCann from a much-\n\nmore-risky alternative whereby, month after month, Winniman &\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fWinniman would receive two separate claims for a single Allens'\n\ncheck.    While the evidence suggests that Rossman might not have\n\nbeen perplexed by this alternative situation, it also supports a\n\nfinding that others at the firm might have taken note.7         In any\n\nevent, with the Allens-Picknelly dealings completely removed from\n\nWinniman & Winniman oversight, the only remaining problem would be\n\nDavid –- and that problem easily could be satisfied by small\n\nmonthly payments from Rossman to David (through McCann's recently\n\npadded trust account) until the McCann-to-David assignment could be\n\nerased altogether.     Indeed, the evidence points to two documents\n\nsent to David after the Picknelly assignment –- the July 7th check\n\nfrom Rossman and the undated letter from McCann received in mid-\n\nJuly -- that validate this theory and, together with the other\n\nevidence,    provide   a   supportable   basis   for   concluding   that\n\nPicknelly's June 21st letter was an integral part of the ongoing\n\nscheme.\n\n            B.   The Evidentiary Rulings\n\n            McCann next argues that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it admitted two pieces of \"bad character evidence\"\n\n-- (1) testimony regarding McCann's pledging the horse farm (to\n\n\n\n     7\n      It is immaterial to our analysis that, ultimately, an\nattorney at Winniman & Winniman discovered David's unrecorded note\nand thereafter recorded it only to find that the same note had\nalready been recorded by Picknelly. Certainly, such a discovery\nwould have only been accelerated if Winniman & Winniman were\nmailing monthly checks to two assignees of the same mortgage.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwhich he no longer held title) as collateral for his $200,000 loan\n\nfrom McCormack; and (2) three different bank checks with the same\n\nrouting number –- in violation of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) and 403.\n\nMcCann objected only to the Bank of Belize check; accordingly, the\n\nadmission of the other two checks is reviewed not for abuse of\n\ndiscretion but only for plain error.          See Casas, 356 F.3d at 113.\n\nIn any event, the court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n           Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides that \"[e]vidence of other\n\ncrimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of\n\nthe person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Here,\n\nhowever, for reasons explained below, evidence of the loan from\n\nMcCormack and the three bank checks was admissible as direct proof\n\nof one of two elements of the charged mail-fraud offense, namely\n\n(1) the existence of a scheme to defraud, or (2) McCann's knowing\n\nand willing participation in that scheme with the specific intent\n\nto defraud.   Accordingly, Rule 404(b) is not called into play.            See\n\nUnited States v. Santagata, 924 F.2d 391, 394 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"The\n\ndocuments at issue would tend to make the existence of the scheme\n\nto defraud –- a necessary element of the crime charged –- more\n\nlikely than it would be without the documents. . . . Because the\n\ndocuments were admissible as direct proof of the scheme charged,\n\napplication of Rule 404(b) was unnecessary.\" (citations omitted));\n\nUnited   States   v.   DeLuna,   763   F.2d   897,   913   (1st   Cir.   1985)\n\n(\"Evidence which is probative of the crime charged, and not solely\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\funcharged crimes, is not 'other crimes' evidence.           Further, where\n\nthe evidence of an act and the evidence of the crime charged are\n\ninextricably intertwined, the act is not extrinsic and Rule 404(b)\n\nis not implicated.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           Evidence of the $200,000 loan from McCormack (which\n\nMcCann \"secured\" by the deed to the horse farm he no longer owned)\n\nwas introduced for the limited, relevant, and specific purpose of\n\nrefuting McCann's good-faith defense theory -- that, even though\n\nAbraczinskas's money was not returned, there was never any real\n\nintention to defraud because McCann believed in good faith that the\n\nfunds for the horse farm would arrive from overseas, and, when they\n\ndid not, he provided Abraczinskas with the deed to the farm.\n\nBecause specific intent to defraud was an element of the charged\n\ncrime and because other evidence suggested that McCann knew that\n\nAbraczinskas might not record his deed (due to the potential tax\n\nconsequences    coupled    with      McCann's    asserted       interest   in\n\nrepurchasing and accompanying explanations for the delay), the\n\ndistrict court supportably determined that the loan evidence was\n\nadmissible to refute McCann's theory.\n\n           Similarly, the district court acted within its discretion\n\nin   determining   that   evidence    of   the   three   bank    checks    was\n\nadmissible.    The relevant checks are: (1) an as-of-yet unmentioned\n\n\"International Land & Livestock\" check for $890,000 purportedly\n\ndrawn on the Bank of Belize, a copy of which McCann faxed to\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fMcCormack in response to McCormack's request for the horse-farm\n\npayment but which (of course) was never deposited into the Winniman\n\n& Winniman trust account; (2) the previously discussed $2 million\n\ncheck purportedly drawn on an Italian bank; and (3) a check\n\npurportedly drawn on a credit union (found in McCann's home during\n\na lawful search) that shared the same routing number as the other\n\ntwo    checks         but   which   was    itself   never      used   in   the   scheme.\n\nObviously, the first two checks were not only relevant to –- but\n\nalso       a   part    of   –-   the    charged    horse-farm     scheme.        Evidence\n\nregarding the third check, though perhaps less probative, still\n\nwent to two important elements of the government's case (also shown\n\nby the other two checks): (1) that there was indeed a scheme to\n\ndefraud; and (2) that McCann knowingly and willingly participated\n\nin it with the specific intent to defraud.8                    See 18 U.S.C. § 1343.\n\n                  We next turn to the question whether, despite its\n\nprobative value, the contested evidence nonetheless should have\n\nbeen excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403.                      That rule permits the\n\nexclusion        of     relevant       evidence    \"if   its    probative    value    is\n\n\n       8\n      Even if this evidence had not been independently admissible\nas \"part and parcel\" of the charged offense, see United States v.\nNivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1119 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\nTaylor, 284 F.3d 95, 103 (1st Cir. 2002), it nonetheless would have\nbeen admissible under Rule 404(b).     The contested evidence was\nbeing introduced not for the prohibited purpose of showing\npropensity to commit the charged crimes but rather for permissible\n-– and specially relevant -- purposes. See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)\n(noting that examples of such permissible purposes include \"proof\nof motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident\").\n\n                                            -18-\n\fsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\"\n\n(emphasis added).    McCann uses but one paragraph to advance his\n\nargument:\n\n            Both of these issues tended to cast a bad\n            light upon the defendant. They both made him\n            appear to be less than honest to the jury.\n            Without this evidence, a reasonable jury could\n            have believed that the Defendant was a\n            business man attempting to make good on a\n            transaction. . . . The extraneous evidence was\n            far more prejudicial to the Defendant's\n            character than it was probative of anything\n            and it was an abuse of discretion to admit it.\n\n            In considering the Rule 403 balance, \"we will interpose\n\nour judgment only if a complaining party can demonstrate that the\n\ndistrict court's ruling did not fall within the ambit of reasonable\n\ndebate.\" United States v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(citations omitted).    In our view, the district court supportably\n\nconcluded that the danger of unfair prejudice, if any,9 that\n\nresulted from the admission of the loan evidence and three bank\n\nchecks was substantially outweighed by their probative value (which\n\nwe have already described).   In any event, viewing the record as a\n\nwhole, we have trouble seeing how these evidentiary rulings might\n\nhave been outcome determinative.       See United States v. Tom, 330\n\nF.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[E]ven supposing error in admitting\n\n\n\n     9\n      Indeed, Judge Ponsor twice instructed the jury that McCann\nwas not being charged in connection with the McCormack loan and\nthat the evidence should be considered only to the extent that it\nwas relevant to the charged scheme surrounding the purchase of the\nhorse farm.\n\n                                -19-\n\fthe testimony, it would have been harmless.                   The essential inquiry\n\nin   harmless     error       review   is    whether    the    improperly         admitted\n\nevidence likely affected the outcome of trial.\" (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)).             The admission of this evidence is not\n\ngrounds for upsetting McCann's convictions.\n\n             C.   The FBI Agent's Testimony\n\n             At trial, Special Agent Dominic Barbara of the FBI\n\ntestified –- without relevant objection –- as follows: (1) that, on\n\nAugust 9, 2000, he and an agent from the Internal Revenue Service\n\nwent to the horse farm to speak with McCann and serve him with a\n\ngrand-jury subpoena; (2) that the meeting occurred outside, in a\n\ngazebo     area   on    the    100-acre     farm;    and     (3)    that,   during    the\n\ninterview, McCann answered several questions (including questions\n\nabout the $2 million check) but refused to provide the agents with\n\nhis true name when asked.10\n\n             McCann now contends that \"it was plain error affecting\n\nsubstantial rights for [Special Agent Barbara] to testify that\n\n[McCann] refused to answer their questions.\"                   Specifically, McCann\n\nargues (with very little elaboration) that (1) his refusal to\n\nanswer the agent's what-is-your-real-name question was a valid\n\nexercise of       his   Fifth     Amendment        rights,    and    (2)    the    agent's\n\ntestimony to this effect was plain error affecting substantial\n\n\n\n      10\n      The IRS agent knew, from McCann's own admission in a prior\nconversation, that Danny Combs was not McCann's real name.\n\n                                            -20-\n\frights because \"it involved the presentation to the jury of the\n\ndefendant's claim of Fifth Amendment rights\" and served no other\n\npurpose but to tarnish his image by \"imply[ing] that [he] ha[d]\n\nsomething   to    hide.\"   To   prevail     on    this   claim,    McCann   must\n\ndemonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\nobvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"         See United States v. Duarte,\n\n246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 52(b).\n\n            Here, whether an error occurred -- let alone a \"clear or\n\nobvious\" one –- is far from certain.         In Jenkins v. Anderson, 447\n\nU.S. 231, 238 (1980), the Supreme Court held that \"the Fifth\n\nAmendment is not violated by the use of pre-arrest silence to\n\nimpeach a criminal defendant's credibility.\"             In so holding, the\n\nCourt   expressly    refused    to   consider      \"whether   or   under    what\n\ncircumstances pre-arrest silence may be protected by the Fifth\n\nAmendment.\"      Id. at 236 n.2.     We have stated that \"application of\n\nthe privilege is not limited to persons in custody or charged with\n\na crime; it may also be asserted by a suspect who is questioned\n\nduring the investigation of a crime.\"            Coppola v. Powell, 878 F.2d\n\n1562, 1565 (1st Cir. 1989).           But we never have addressed the\n\nprecise question presented in this case: whether the privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination is implicated when, in the context of a\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fnon-custodial         interrogation,     a     suspect    selectively      refuses      to\n\nanswer a what-is-your-real-name question despite having volunteered\n\nanswers to other questions that he perhaps believes are less likely\n\nto induce an incriminating response.11                 Moreover, the other courts\n\nof   appeal      are    split     on    the    question     whether,     under     some\n\ncircumstances,         the      Fifth-Amendment        privilege    against        self-\n\nincrimination prevents the government from using a suspect's pre-\n\narrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt.                   Compare Combs v.\n\nCoyle,    205    F.3d    269,     283   (6th    Cir.     2000)   (\"[T]he    use    of    a\n\ndefendant's pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt\n\nviolates        the     Fifth     Amendment's       privilege       against       self-\n\nincrimination.\"), United States ex rel. Savory v. Lane, 832 F.2d\n\n1011, 1017 (7th Cir. 1987) (\"The right to remain silent, unlike the\n\nright     to   counsel,      attaches    before    the     institution     of     formal\n\nadversary proceedings.\"),12 and United States v. Burson, 952 F.2d\n\n1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 1991) (holding that, under the circumstances,\n\n\n     11\n      Coppola involved a suspect's pre-arrest refusal to answer all\nquestions as expressed by something more than a simple I-don't-\nwant-to-answer response: \"Let me tell you something. I'm not one\nof your country bumpkins. I grew up on the streets of Providence,\nRhode Island. And if you think I'm going to confess to you, you're\ncrazy.\" 878 F.2d at 1563. We concluded that the admission of this\nparticular statement was in violation of the defendant's Fifth-\nAmendment rights and was not \"harmless error beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\" Id. at 1571.\n     12\n      The Seventh Circuit subsequently held that comment is\npermitted when, as here, the defendant selectively responds to an\ninvestigator's questions and thus \"start[s] down the self-\nexculpation road.\"   United States v. Davenport, 929 F.2d 1169,\n1174-75 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthe court erred in admitting an IRS agent's testimony regarding\n\ndefendant's refusal to answer any questions during a non-custodial\n\ninterrogation), with United States v.

Rivera, 944 F.2d 1563,\n\n1568 (11th Cir. 1991) (\"The government may comment on a defendant's\n\nsilence if it occurred prior to the time he was arrested and given\n\nhis Miranda warnings.\").13\n\n          In any event, McCann's claim must fail for a more obvious\n\nreason: any error did not affect his \"substantial rights.\"                 See\n\nUnited States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(defining an error that \"affects substantial rights\" as, in most\n\ncases, one that \"affect[s] the outcome of the district court\n\nproceedings\") (citation omitted).         Here, as discussed above, there\n\nwas a wealth of evidence regarding McCann's skillful participation\n\n\n\n     13\n       The Supreme Court may soon provide some (indirect) guidance\non the identification-question issue: certiorari was granted in\nHiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct. of Nevada, 124 S.Ct. 430 (2003),\napparently to determine whether a state statute requiring the\nsubject of an investigative detention to identify himself infringes\nthe Fifth-Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.\n\n                                   -23-\n\fin various schemes to defraud. This evidence included, inter alia,\n\n(1) in-court identification testimony from several witnesses who\n\ntestified that, over the course of the charged activities, they had\n\nknown the defendant not as McCann but rather as Danny Combs or D.\n\nDacques Sonner, and (2) documents central to the schemes bearing\n\nthe signatures of either Danny Combs or D. Dacques Sonner coupled\n\nwith testimony that the man now identified as McCann had signed\n\nthose documents.      In short, the evidence connecting McCann to the\n\ncrimes overwhelmingly suggested that McCann \"ha[d] something to\n\nhide,\" and it would be unreasonable to conclude that Special Agent\n\nBarbara's        testimony      provided       anything      save        additional\n\ncorroboration.\n\n            D.    The Sentence\n\n            We turn finally to two proffered grounds for vacating the\n\nsentence: (1) \"the defendant was [improperly] sentenced with the\n\n[2002]    version    of   the   guidelines     in   effect   at     the    time   of\n\nsentencing instead of the [1999] version in effect at the time of\n\nthe commission      of    the   crime   [thereby]    resulting      in    a   longer\n\nsentence;\" and (2) \"the defendant was improperly assessed two\n\npoints on his criminal history category for being on probation\n\n[even though] he subjectively believed that his probation had\n\nended.\"    We need only address the second claim of error, as McCann\n\nwithdrew the other at oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f                McCann's argument fails because there is nothing in the\n\ntext of the criminal history provisions that suggests that a\n\ndefendant's subjective knowledge concerning the sentence he is\n\nserving is at all relevant to the determination of his criminal\n\nhistory.14       The relevant guideline provides that, in determining\n\ncriminal history points, the sentencing court should \"[a]dd 2\n\npoints if the defendant committed the instant offense while under\n\nany criminal justice sentence, including probation.\"                   U.S.S.G.\n\n§4A1.1(d)       (2002).    Because     the   district   court   had   before   it\n\nevidence that McCann had committed the federal offenses while on\n\nprobation from a state conviction in Texas, the district court\n\nadded     two    points   to   his   criminal   history   score.      Given    the\n\nunambiguous and unqualified text of §4A1.1(d), that ends the\n\nmatter.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n      Neither do the purposes underlying these provisions, as\nexpressed in the Introductory Comments to the criminal history\nsection, support such an assertion.  According to the relevant\ncommentary,\n\n     [a] defendant with a record of prior criminal behavior is\n     more culpable than a first offender and thus deserving of\n     greater punishment. General deterrence of criminal\n     conduct dictates that a clear message be sent to society\n     that repeated criminal behavior will aggravate the need\n     for punishment with each recurrence.      To protect the\n     public from further crimes of the particular defendant,\n     the likelihood of recidivism and future criminal behavior\n     must be considered.\n\nU.S.S.G.

This appeal requires us to decide (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the mail-fraud conviction, (2) whether the district court abused its discretion in making two evidentiary rulings, (3) whether it was plain error for a federal agent to testify that, during a non-custodial interrogation, McCann had refused to provide his true name when asked, and (4) whether the court erred in sentencing. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the verdicts, <i>see United States v. Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 676 (1st Cir.1993), omitting details extraneous to the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1990's, McCann moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he developed business and personal connections within the Springfield law firm of Winniman &amp; Winniman. It was through these connections &#8212; particularly, a relationship with Sara Rossman (a paralegal at the firm) &#8212; that McCann was able to obtain access to the firm's accounts, stationery, notary stamps, signatures, and other items that assisted him in the two fraudulent schemes at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Scheme # 1: The Purchase of the Horse Farm</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2000, McCann provided Rossman at Winniman &amp; Winniman a counterfeit $2 million check (purportedly drawn on an Italian bank) and asked her to deposit the check into the firm's trust account. McCann advised Rossman that he planned to use this money to pay for, <i>inter alia,</i> his purchase of a horse farm in Windsor, Connecticut. Based on these representations, Rossman prepared a deposit ticket and immediately issued to McCann several checks drawn on the trust account, including a $1 million check for the purchase of the horse farm. Rossman and McCann then traveled together to the firm's bank to deposit the check, but Rossman left to run errands before they reached the teller. McCann left the bank without depositing the $2 million check.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, McCann (posing as D. Dacques Sonner, the Chairman of International Land &amp; Livestock) finalized an earlier-agreed-upon purchase of the horse farm by providing Dennis McCormack (an attorney for the seller's trust) with the $1 million check drawn on the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account. McCormack advised McCann that the deed would be delivered once the check had cleared. The following day, McCormack mailed Winniman &amp; Winniman a letter stating that he was depositing the check into the seller's trust account and that he would disburse funds from that account on April 12th unless he heard otherwise. Hearing nothing, McCormack thereafter wrote checks on the seller's trust account. When these checks bounced (because the $1 million check never cleared), McCormack immediately phoned McCann, who then promised to straighten out what he alleged was a mix-up at the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, McCann (posing as attorney Danny Combs with Winniman &amp; Winniman) had been in simultaneous loan negotiations with West Coast businessman William Abraczinskas. McCann was seeking from Abraczinskas a quick infusion of approximately $2 million in \"show money\" &#8212; money needed merely to show the sellers that \"Combs's\" \"client\" (<i>i.e.,</i> McCann) had the wherewithal to purchase the farm &#8212; that would immediately be repaid, together with $1 million interest. Abraczinskas was told that the \"show money\" would not be released without his permission and that it would simply remain in the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account until repaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abraczinskas eventually agreed and, on April 13, 2000, wired $1.56 million to the trust account. The account now being funded (albeit with \"show money\"), McCann met with McCormack on April 14th and provided him with a $1 million certified check (which McCormack deposited). It was only after McCann had withdrawn the \"show money\" and received a deed to the horse farm that a concerned Abraczinskas, in an effort to protect himself, entered into a purchase-repurchase agreement with McCann. This agreement provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that Abraczinskas was to take title to the farm (and five horses) until McCann repaid the loan. Once payment was received, Abraczinskas would release title back to McCann. Expecting McCann to tender payment and seeking to avoid any tax consequences, Abraczinskas &#8212; who did not want the farm in any event &#8212; did not immediately record the deed and instead accepted McCann's various explanations for the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few months later, in July 2000, McCann (posing as D. Dacques Sonner) telephoned McCormack and asked for a $200,000 loan to purchase an Arabian horse. Despite having already transferred to Abraczinskas the deed to the horse farm, McCann offered the farm as collateral for the loan. After a subsequent title search revealed that McCann had clear title (recall that Abraczinskas had not yet recorded), McCormack agreed to the loan and promptly recorded the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abraczinskas recorded his deed on August 31, 2000, having never received payment from McCann on the original loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Scheme # 2: The Double Assignment of the Mortgage</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 14, 2000 &#8212; using funds from the $1.56 million wire &#8212; McCann loaned $250,000 to Robert and Edward Allen for their purchase of a building in Springfield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Allens, in turn, provided McCann with a note secured by a mortgage on the building and agreed to tender monthly payments to Winniman &amp; Winniman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann thereafter proceeded to assign the Allens' mortgage to two different buyers. First, on May 18, 2000, he assigned the mortgage to Brian David for $175,000, with Winniman &amp; Winniman handling the details. Under the agreement, the Allens would simply continue forwarding payments to Winniman &amp; Winniman, which would then issue checks to David. For some reason, David did not immediately record the assignment; according to David, there was a possibility that McCann would buy back the mortgage in a short period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one month after this assignment, aided by David's failure to record, McCann assigned the same mortgage to Paul Picknelly for $165,000. Picknelly (through his attorney) immediately recorded the assignment and, on June 21, 2000, mailed to the Allens a letter (the \"June 21st letter\") notifying them of the change and directing them to make payments directly to him rather than through Winniman &amp; Winniman. Having received in the interim some payments from the Allens (and perhaps unaware of the new assignment), Rossman thereafter began making payments to David &#8212; by personal check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime around July 20, 2000, David (unaware, of course, of McCann's subsequent dealings) received from McCann an undated letter stating that the corporation for which McCann worked had voted to repurchase the mortgage and would accordingly send payment by August 3rd. In early August 2000, a partner at Winniman &amp; Winniman discovered David's unrecorded assignment; after contacting David, the partner immediately recorded the assignment only to learn that the Allens' mortgage had also been assigned to &#8212; and promptly recorded by &#8212; Picknelly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann subsequently was tried before a jury on seven counts of a superseding indictment: two counts of mail fraud (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341), two counts of wire fraud (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343), and three counts of money laundering (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957). Following the government's presentation of its case-in-chief, McCann moved for a judgment of acquittal on each count. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court granted this motion as to one of the mail-fraud counts (a bank's mailing of an insufficient-funds notice to McCormack after he had attempted to draw on the seller's trust account) but denied it with respect to the remaining six counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury thereafter returned guilty verdicts on five of these six counts: the remaining mail-fraud count (Picknelly's June 21st letter informing the Allens of the assignment); one of the wire-fraud counts (the $1.56 million wire from Abraczinskas to the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account); and all three money-laundering counts (Abraczinskas's $1.56 million wire transfer, McCormack's delivery of the $1 million certified check for deposit, and the delivery of the $250,000 check to the Allens). A verdict of not guilty was returned on the other wire-fraud count (a call from McCann to Picknelly discussing the terms of the assignment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 2003, McCann was sentenced to 105 months' imprisonment (consisting of concurrent sentences of 60 months for the fraud convictions and 105 months for the money-laundering convictions), a three-year term of supervised release, and $1,895,610.84 in restitution. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, we are presented with four issues on appeal: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the mail-fraud conviction; (2) whether the district court abused its discretion in making two evidentiary rulings; (3) whether it was plain error for a federal agent to testify that, during a non-custodial interrogation, McCann had refused to provide his true name when asked; and (4) whether the court erred in sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these separate issues, four standards of review apply. First, in deciding sufficiency challenges, \"we review all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Baltas,</i> 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted); <i>see also United States v. Ruiz,</i> 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that sufficiency challenges are reviewed <i>de novo</i>). Second, where there has been a proper objection below, we review a district court's decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Udemba v. Nicoli,</i> 237 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[A] trial court enjoys considerable discretion in connection with the admission or exclusion of evidence....\"). Third, where there has been no proper objection below, we review an evidentiary issue for plain error. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 113. Finally, in reviewing sentencing determinations not involving departures, we first determine the applicability and interpretation of the relevant guideline <i>de novo</i> and then review the court's factual findings for clear error. <i>See United States v. Mateo,</i> 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Thurston,</i> 358 F.3d 51, 70-72 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of the various standards of review, we turn now to a sequential discussion of the four issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Mail-Fraud Conviction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The key elements of the crime of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, are: (1) the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud; and (3) the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>United States v. Montminy,</i> 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st Cir.1991) (citation omitted). Given the arguments raised on appeal, our focus is on the third element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that, while \"the mailing must be for the purpose of executing the scheme, ... it is not necessary that the scheme contemplate the use of the mails as an essential element.\" <i>United States v. Maze,</i> 414 U.S. 395, 400, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Nor is it necessary that the mailing itself be fraudulent; an \"innocent\" mailing &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> one that contains no false information &#8212; will satisfy the in-furtherance-of requirement so long as it is \"incident to an essential part of the scheme\" or \"a step in the plot.\" <i>Schmuck v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 705, 710-11, 715, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (citations omitted). Moreover, the defendant need not himself mail the letter; \"[a] mailing need only be closely related to the scheme and reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's actions.\" <i>United States v. Serino,</i> 835 F.2d 924, 928 (1st Cir.1987) (citation omitted). The relevant question is \"whether the mailing is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time, regardless of whether the mailing later, through hindsight, may prove to have been counterproductive and return to haunt the perpetrator of the fraud.\" <i>Schmuck,</i> 489 U.S. at 715, 109 S.Ct. 1443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the mail-fraud count because, \"even when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, [Picknelly's June 21st letter to the Allens] was [mailed] after the scheme had reached fruition and ... therefore ... was not in furtherance of the scheme.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Specifically, McCann contends that, because he had already received the proceeds from his double assignment of the mortgage, the evidence was insufficient to establish that the letter served any purpose but to <i>increase</i> the risk of detection. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When entertaining the Rule 29 motion, Judge Ponsor summarized the government's argument (echoed on appeal) regarding the mailing's purpose:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think [the government's] argument is that the whole David/Picknelly scam, which we'll call it since we're going to have to take the facts at the moment in the light most favorable to the government, was like a house of cards. And the letter to the Allens [from Picknelly's attorney] instructing them to begin making their payments to Mr. Picknelly kept that house of cards from collapsing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It meant that Mr. McCann at this point has got in excess of $300,000, and ... at a cost of [just] over $20,000 a year, he can keep paying [David]. He can keep paying his cat's-paw, Sara Rossman, the money every month and she can keep sending it to [David] and he can stall for a year on that arrangement and, meanwhile, [the Allens would continue to pay Mr. Picknelly] and the house of cards would not collapse unless Mr. Allen ever ran into Mr. David on the street or Mr. David ever had any conversation with Mr. Picknelly about this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it would keep the house of cards from collapsing if the Allens sent their checks to Picknelly and it would allow [McCann]... to buy time in which he could maybe raise enough money to purport to buy the mortgage back from [David] and essentially erase that aspect of the deal through some other, who knows what, source of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That's I think [the government's] argument. That it lulls, it conceals, it maintains. It props up the house of cards for a little while longer and that that's an important part of what he was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, then, the government's argument is that Picknelly's June 21st letter served the important purpose of <i>decreasing</i> the risk of detection by causing the Allens' payments to be routed in such a way as to keep the scheme running until such time as McCann could devise a way to fix the David problem and perhaps even avoid detection altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the evidence supports a finding of such a purpose, the mailing would be within the ambit of the statute. <i>See Schmuck,</i> 489 U.S. at 712, 109 S.Ct. 1443 (\"[A] mailing that is incident to an essential part of the scheme satisfies the mailing element of the mail fraud offense.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States v. Lane,</i> 474 U.S. 438, 451-52, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (\"Mailings occurring after receipt of the goods obtained by fraud are within the [mail-fraud] statute if they `were designed to lull the victims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendant[] less likely than if no mailings had taken place.'\" (quoting <i>Maze,</i> 414 U.S. at 403, 94 S.Ct. 645)); <i>United States v. Pacheco-Ortiz,</i> 889 F.2d 301, 305 (1st Cir.1989) (post-<i>Schmuck</i>) (\"[F]or the mailings to be considered in furtherance of the scheme, the scheme's completion or the prevention of its detection must have depended in some way on the mailings.\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, having viewed the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidentiary support for a finding that Picknelly's mailing served the proffered purpose and thus was \"incident to an essential part of the scheme.\" <i>Schmuck,</i> 489 U.S. at 711, 109 S.Ct. 1443.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that McCann was a clever con artist who ultimately got most of what he wanted by thinking ahead, establishing important relationships, and devising complex and skillful schemes without going overboard. McCann almost certainly knew that, after paying $165,000 for the note, Picknelly (an astute businessman) would be expecting payments from the Allens and would not need a law firm as a go-between. From this evidence, a rational jury could have inferred that McCann intended to take full advantage of the Picknelly situation in order to keep the scheme going strong. Ultimate success meant avoiding detection and Picknelly's reasonably foreseeable letter was a crucial step along that path. By diverting the Allens' payments from Winniman &amp; Winniman to Picknelly, the letter protected McCann from a much-more-risky alternative whereby, month after month, Winniman &amp; Winniman would receive two separate claims for a single Allens' check. While the evidence suggests that Rossman might not have been perplexed by this alternative situation, it also supports a finding that others at the firm might have taken note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In any event, with the Allens-Picknelly dealings completely removed from Winniman &amp; Winniman oversight, the only remaining problem would be David &#8212; and that problem easily could be satisfied by small monthly payments from Rossman to David (through McCann's recently padded trust account) until the McCann-to-David assignment could be erased altogether. Indeed, the evidence points to two documents sent to David after the Picknelly assignment &#8212; the July 7th check from Rossman and the undated letter from McCann received in mid-July &#8212; that validate this theory and, together with the other evidence, provide a supportable basis for concluding that Picknelly's June 21st letter was an integral part of the ongoing scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Evidentiary Rulings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann next argues that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted two pieces of \"bad character evidence\" &#8212; (1) testimony regarding McCann's pledging the horse farm (to which he no longer held title) as collateral for his $200,000 loan from McCormack; and (2) three different bank checks with the same routing number &#8212; in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) and 403. McCann objected only to the Bank of Belize check; accordingly, the admission of the other two checks is reviewed not for abuse of discretion but only for plain error. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 113. In any event, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) provides that \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of the person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Here, however, for reasons explained below, evidence of the loan from McCormack and the three bank checks was admissible as direct proof of one of two elements of the charged mail-fraud offense, namely (1) the existence of a scheme to defraud, or (2) McCann's knowing and willing participation in that scheme with the specific intent to defraud. Accordingly, Rule 404(b) is not called into play. <i>See United States v. Santagata,</i> 924 F.2d 391, 394 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The documents at issue would tend to make the existence of the scheme to defraud &#8212; a necessary element of the crime charged &#8212; more likely than it would be without the documents.... Because the documents were admissible as direct proof of the scheme charged, application of Rule 404(b) was unnecessary.\" (citations omitted)); <i>United States v. DeLuna,</i> 763 F.2d 897, 913 (8th Cir.1985) (\"Evidence which is probative of the crime charged, and not solely uncharged crimes, is not `other crimes' evidence. Further, where the evidence of an act and the evidence of the crime charged are inextricably intertwined, the act is not extrinsic and Rule 404(b) is not implicated.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of the $200,000 loan from McCormack (which McCann \"secured\" by the deed to the horse farm he no longer owned) was introduced for the limited, relevant, and specific purpose of refuting McCann's good-faith defense theory &#8212; that, even though Abraczinskas's money was not returned, there was never any real intention to defraud because McCann believed in good faith that the funds for the horse farm would arrive from overseas, and, when they did not, he provided Abraczinskas with the deed to the farm. Because specific intent to defraud was an element of the charged crime and because other evidence suggested that McCann knew that Abraczinskas might not record his deed (due to the potential tax consequences coupled with McCann's asserted interest in repurchasing and accompanying explanations for the delay), the district court supportably determined that the loan evidence was admissible to refute McCann's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the district court acted within its discretion in determining that evidence of the three bank checks was admissible. The relevant checks are: (1) an as-of-yet unmentioned \"International Land &amp; Livestock\" check for $890,000 purportedly drawn on the Bank of Belize, a copy of which McCann faxed to McCormack in response to McCormack's request for the horse-farm payment but which (of course) was never deposited into the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account; (2) the previously discussed $2 million check purportedly drawn on an Italian bank; and (3) a check purportedly drawn on a credit union (found in McCann's home during a lawful search) that shared the same routing number as the other two checks but which was itself never used in the scheme. Obviously, the first two checks were not only relevant to &#8212; but also a part of &#8212; the charged horse-farm scheme. Evidence regarding the third check, though perhaps less probative, still went to two important elements of the government's case (also shown by the other two checks): (1) that there was indeed a scheme to defraud; and (2) that McCann knowingly and willingly participated in it with the specific intent to defraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the question whether, despite its probative value, the contested evidence nonetheless should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403. That rule permits the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of <i>unfair</i> prejudice....\" (emphasis added). McCann uses but one paragraph to advance his argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of these issues tended to cast a bad light upon the defendant. They both made him appear to be less than honest to the jury. Without this evidence, a reasonable jury could have believed that the Defendant was a business man attempting to make good on a transaction.... The extraneous evidence was far more prejudicial to the Defendant's character than it was probative of anything and it was an abuse of discretion to admit it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the Rule 403 balance, \"we will interpose our judgment only if a complaining party can demonstrate that the district court's ruling did not fall within the ambit of reasonable debate.\" <i>United States v. Currier,</i> 821 F.2d 52, 55 (1st Cir.1987) (citations omitted). In our view, the district court supportably concluded that the danger of unfair prejudice, if any,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> that resulted from the admission of the loan evidence and three bank checks was substantially outweighed by their probative value (which we have already described). In any event, viewing the record as a whole, we have trouble seeing how these evidentiary rulings might have been outcome determinative. <i>See United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[E]ven supposing error in admitting the testimony, it would have been harmless. The essential inquiry in harmless error review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely affected the outcome of trial.\" (citations and quotation marks omitted)). The admission of this evidence is not grounds for upsetting McCann's convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The FBI Agent's Testimony</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Special Agent Dominic Barbara of the FBI testified &#8212; without relevant objection &#8212; as follows: (1) that, on August 9, 2000, he and an agent from the Internal Revenue Service went to the horse farm to speak with McCann and serve him with a grand-jury subpoena; (2) that the meeting occurred outside, in a gazebo area on the 100-acre farm; and (3) that, during the interview, McCann answered several questions (including questions about the $2 million check) but refused to provide the agents with his true name when asked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann now contends that \"it was plain error affecting substantial rights for [Special Agent Barbara] to testify that [McCann] refused to answer their questions.\" Specifically, McCann argues (with very little elaboration) that (1) his refusal to answer the agent's what-is-your-real-name question was a valid exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights, and (2) the agent's testimony to this effect was plain error affecting substantial rights because \"it involved the presentation to the jury of the defendant's claim of Fifth Amendment rights\" and served no other purpose but to tarnish his image by \"imply[ing] that [he] ha[d] something to hide.\" To prevail on this claim, McCann must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>See United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, whether an error occurred &#8212; let alone a \"clear or obvious\" one &#8212; is far from certain. In <i>Jenkins v. Anderson,</i> 447 U.S. 231, 238, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980), the Supreme Court held that \"the Fifth Amendment is not violated by the use of pre-arrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant's credibility.\" In so holding, the Court expressly refused to consider \"whether or under what circumstances pre-arrest silence may be protected by the Fifth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 236 n. 2, 100 S.Ct. 2124. We have stated that \"application of the privilege is not limited to persons in custody or charged with a crime; it may also be asserted by a suspect who is questioned during the investigation of a crime.\" <i>Coppola v. Powell,</i> 878 F.2d 1562, 1565 (1st Cir.1989). But we never have addressed the precise question presented in this case: whether the privilege against self-incrimination is implicated when, in the context of a non-custodial interrogation, a suspect selectively refuses to answer a what-is-your-real-name question despite having volunteered answers to other questions that he perhaps believes are less likely to induce an incriminating response.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Moreover, the other courts of appeal are split on the question whether, under some circumstances, the Fifth-Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prevents the government from using a suspect's pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt. <i>Compare Combs v. Coyle,</i> 205 F.3d 269, 283 (6th Cir.2000) (\"[T]he use of a defendant's pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.\"), <i>United States ex rel.

Here, as discussed above, there was a wealth of evidence regarding McCann's skillful participation in various schemes to defraud. This evidence included, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) in-court identification testimony from several witnesses who testified that, over the course of the charged activities, they had known the defendant not as McCann but rather as Danny Combs or D. Dacques Sonner, and (2) documents central to the schemes bearing the signatures of either Danny Combs or D. Dacques Sonner coupled with testimony that the man now identified as McCann had signed those documents. In short, the evidence connecting McCann to the crimes overwhelmingly suggested that McCann \"ha[d] something to hide,\" and it would be unreasonable to conclude that Special Agent Barbara's testimony provided anything save additional corroboration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to two proffered grounds for vacating the sentence: (1) \"the defendant was [improperly] sentenced with the [2002] version of the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing instead of the [1999] version in effect at the time of the commission of the crime [thereby] resulting in a longer sentence;\" and (2) \"the defendant was improperly assessed two points on his criminal history category for being on probation [even though] he subjectively believed that his probation had ended.\" We need only address the second claim of error, as McCann withdrew the other at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann's argument fails because there is nothing in the text of the criminal history provisions that suggests that a defendant's subjective knowledge concerning the sentence he is serving is at all relevant to the determination of his criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The relevant guideline provides that, in determining criminal history points, the sentencing court should \"[a]dd 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d) (2002). Because the district court had before it evidence that McCann had committed the federal offenses while on probation from a state conviction in Texas, the district court added two points to his criminal history score.

Dacques Sonner, the Chairman of International Land &amp; Livestock) finalized an earlier-agreed-upon purchase of the horse farm by providing Dennis McCormack (an attorney for the seller's trust) with the $1 million check drawn on the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account. McCormack advised McCann that the deed would be delivered once the check had cleared. The following day, McCormack mailed Winniman &amp; Winniman a letter stating that he was depositing the check into the seller's trust account and that he would disburse funds from that account on April 12th unless he heard otherwise. Hearing nothing, McCormack thereafter wrote checks on the seller's trust account. When these checks bounced (because the $1 million check never cleared), McCormack immediately phoned McCann, who then promised to straighten out what he alleged was a mix-up at the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, McCann (posing as attorney Danny Combs with Winniman &amp; Winniman) had been in simultaneous loan negotiations with West Coast businessman William Abraczinskas. McCann was seeking from Abraczinskas a quick infusion of approximately $2 million in \"show money\" &#8212; money needed merely to show the sellers that \"Combs's\" \"client\" (<i>i.e.,</i> McCann) had the wherewithal to purchase the farm &#8212; that would immediately be repaid, together with $1 million interest. Abraczinskas was told that the \"show money\" would not be released without his permission and that it would simply remain in the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account until repaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abraczinskas eventually agreed and, on April 13, 2000, wired $1.56 million to the trust account. The account now being funded (albeit with \"show money\"), McCann met with McCormack on April 14th and provided him with a $1 million certified check (which McCormack deposited). It was only after McCann had withdrawn the \"show money\" and received a deed to the horse farm that a concerned Abraczinskas, in an effort to protect himself, entered into a purchase-repurchase agreement with McCann. This agreement provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that Abraczinskas was to take title to the farm (and five horses) until McCann repaid the loan. Once payment was received, Abraczinskas would release title back to McCann. Expecting McCann to tender payment and seeking to avoid any tax consequences, Abraczinskas &#8212; who did not want the farm in any event &#8212; did not immediately record the deed and instead accepted McCann's various explanations for the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few months later, in July 2000, McCann (posing as D. Dacques Sonner) telephoned McCormack and asked for a $200,000 loan to purchase an Arabian horse. Despite having already transferred to Abraczinskas the deed to the horse farm, McCann offered the farm as collateral for the loan. After a subsequent title search revealed that McCann had clear title (recall that Abraczinskas had not yet recorded), McCormack agreed to the loan and promptly recorded the mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Abraczinskas recorded his deed on August 31, 2000, having never received payment from McCann on the original loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Scheme # 2: The Double Assignment of the Mortgage</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about April 14, 2000 &#8212; using funds from the $1.56 million wire &#8212; McCann loaned $250,000 to Robert and Edward Allen for their purchase of a building in Springfield.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Allens, in turn, provided McCann with a note secured by a mortgage on the building and agreed to tender monthly payments to Winniman &amp; Winniman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann thereafter proceeded to assign the Allens' mortgage to two different buyers. First, on May 18, 2000, he assigned the mortgage to Brian David for $175,000, with Winniman &amp; Winniman handling the details. Under the agreement, the Allens would simply continue forwarding payments to Winniman &amp; Winniman, which would then issue checks to David. For some reason, David did not immediately record the assignment; according to David, there was a possibility that McCann would buy back the mortgage in a short period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one month after this assignment, aided by David's failure to record, McCann assigned the same mortgage to Paul Picknelly for $165,000. Picknelly (through his attorney) immediately recorded the assignment and, on June 21, 2000, mailed to the Allens a letter (the \"June 21st letter\") notifying them of the change and directing them to make payments directly to him rather than through Winniman &amp; Winniman. Having received in the interim some payments from the Allens (and perhaps unaware of the new assignment), Rossman thereafter began making payments to David &#8212; by personal check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime around July 20, 2000, David (unaware, of course, of McCann's subsequent dealings) received from McCann an undated letter stating that the corporation for which McCann worked had voted to repurchase the mortgage and would accordingly send payment by August 3rd. In early August 2000, a partner at Winniman &amp; Winniman discovered David's unrecorded assignment; after contacting David, the partner immediately recorded the assignment only to learn that the Allens' mortgage had also been assigned to &#8212; and promptly recorded by &#8212; Picknelly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann subsequently was tried before a jury on seven counts of a superseding indictment: two counts of mail fraud (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341), two counts of wire fraud (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343), and three counts of money laundering (<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957). Following the government's presentation of its case-in-chief, McCann moved for a judgment of acquittal on each count. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court granted this motion as to one of the mail-fraud counts (a bank's mailing of an insufficient-funds notice to McCormack after he had attempted to draw on the seller's trust account) but denied it with respect to the remaining six counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury thereafter returned guilty verdicts on five of these six counts: the remaining mail-fraud count (Picknelly's June 21st letter informing the Allens of the assignment); one of the wire-fraud counts (the $1.56 million wire from Abraczinskas to the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account); and all three money-laundering counts (Abraczinskas's $1.56 million wire transfer, McCormack's delivery of the $1 million certified check for deposit, and the delivery of the $250,000 check to the Allens). A verdict of not guilty was returned on the other wire-fraud count (a call from McCann to Picknelly discussing the terms of the assignment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 9, 2003, McCann was sentenced to 105 months' imprisonment (consisting of concurrent sentences of 60 months for the fraud convictions and 105 months for the money-laundering convictions), a three-year term of supervised release, and $1,895,610.84 in restitution.

And the letter to the Allens [from Picknelly's attorney] instructing them to begin making their payments to Mr. Picknelly kept that house of cards from collapsing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It meant that Mr. McCann at this point has got in excess of $300,000, and ... at a cost of [just] over $20,000 a year, he can keep paying [David]. He can keep paying his cat's-paw, Sara Rossman, the money every month and she can keep sending it to [David] and he can stall for a year on that arrangement and, meanwhile, [the Allens would continue to pay Mr. Picknelly] and the house of cards would not collapse unless Mr. Allen ever ran into Mr. David on the street or Mr. David ever had any conversation with Mr. Picknelly about this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it would keep the house of cards from collapsing if the Allens sent their checks to Picknelly and it would allow [McCann]... to buy time in which he could maybe raise enough money to purport to buy the mortgage back from [David] and essentially erase that aspect of the deal through some other, who knows what, source of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That's I think [the government's] argument.

McCann almost certainly knew that, after paying $165,000 for the note, Picknelly (an astute businessman) would be expecting payments from the Allens and would not need a law firm as a go-between. From this evidence, a rational jury could have inferred that McCann intended to take full advantage of the Picknelly situation in order to keep the scheme going strong. Ultimate success meant avoiding detection and Picknelly's reasonably foreseeable letter was a crucial step along that path. By diverting the Allens' payments from Winniman &amp; Winniman to Picknelly, the letter protected McCann from a much-more-risky alternative whereby, month after month, Winniman &amp; Winniman would receive two separate claims for a single Allens' check. While the evidence suggests that Rossman might not have been perplexed by this alternative situation, it also supports a finding that others at the firm might have taken note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In any event, with the Allens-Picknelly dealings completely removed from Winniman &amp; Winniman oversight, the only remaining problem would be David &#8212; and that problem easily could be satisfied by small monthly payments from Rossman to David (through McCann's recently padded trust account) until the McCann-to-David assignment could be erased altogether. Indeed, the evidence points to two documents sent to David after the Picknelly assignment &#8212; the July 7th check from Rossman and the undated letter from McCann received in mid-July &#8212; that validate this theory and, together with the other evidence, provide a supportable basis for concluding that Picknelly's June 21st letter was an integral part of the ongoing scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Evidentiary Rulings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCann next argues that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted two pieces of \"bad character evidence\" &#8212; (1) testimony regarding McCann's pledging the horse farm (to which he no longer held title) as collateral for his $200,000 loan from McCormack; and (2) three different bank checks with the same routing number &#8212; in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) and 403. McCann objected only to the Bank of Belize check; accordingly, the admission of the other two checks is reviewed not for abuse of discretion but only for plain error. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 113.

Because specific intent to defraud was an element of the charged crime and because other evidence suggested that McCann knew that Abraczinskas might not record his deed (due to the potential tax consequences coupled with McCann's asserted interest in repurchasing and accompanying explanations for the delay), the district court supportably determined that the loan evidence was admissible to refute McCann's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the district court acted within its discretion in determining that evidence of the three bank checks was admissible. The relevant checks are: (1) an as-of-yet unmentioned \"International Land &amp; Livestock\" check for $890,000 purportedly drawn on the Bank of Belize, a copy of which McCann faxed to McCormack in response to McCormack's request for the horse-farm payment but which (of course) was never deposited into the Winniman &amp; Winniman trust account; (2) the previously discussed $2 million check purportedly drawn on an Italian bank; and (3) a check purportedly drawn on a credit union (found in McCann's home during a lawful search) that shared the same routing number as the other two checks but which was itself never used in the scheme. Obviously, the first two checks were not only relevant to &#8212; but also a part of &#8212; the charged horse-farm scheme. Evidence regarding the third check, though perhaps less probative, still went to two important elements of the government's case (also shown by the other two checks): (1) that there was indeed a scheme to defraud; and (2) that McCann knowingly and willingly participated in it with the specific intent to defraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the question whether, despite its probative value, the contested evidence nonetheless should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403.
