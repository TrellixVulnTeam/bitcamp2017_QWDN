D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n             [Hon. David M.

Sean Croto conditionally pleaded\n\nguilty to possessing firearms after having been convicted of a\n\nfelony in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He now\n\nappeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained\n\npursuant to a search warrant – specifically, the guns that formed\n\nthe basis for his conviction – asserting that the warrant was not\n\nsupported by probable cause.     We affirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            On February 24, 2007, Michael Berube and Todd Sargent\n\ncontacted   the   Biddeford,   Maine,    Police   Department   to   make   a\n\ncomplaint about Sean Croto.      Two Biddeford police officers were\n\ndispatched to a residence to take the complaint.               Sargent and\n\nBerube told the officers that they were acquaintances of Sean\n\nCroto, identified his address as 81 Foss Street, second floor, and\n\ngave the officers his birth date.          They told the officers that\n\nCroto had been telling them for a few months about his \"anarchy\n\nplans\" to blow up the Biddeford Police Department with Molotov\n\ncocktails and to kidnap the city's mayor.         Sargent explained that\n\nCroto had outlined the plans again at Croto's apartment earlier\n\nthat day and had asked Sargent to join in the action, but Sargent\n\ntold Croto he wanted nothing to do with it.         Croto had also shown\n\nSargent a .22 pistol and a rifle.        Sargent told the officers that\n\nCroto kept the loaded .22 pistol with a clip in his hunting vest\n\nand that he kept his guns next to his desk in the living room.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fSargent also told the officers that he had seen guns in Croto's\n\nbedroom.   Berube told the officers that he had visited Croto at his\n\nprior residence located at 42 Sullivan Street where he saw all\n\nkinds of guns and drugs.\n\n           Detective   Richard    Gagne   conducted    separate   recorded\n\ninterviews with Berube and Sargent, and he asked each of them why\n\nthey had waited so long to report Croto's anarchy plans.           Sargent\n\nresponded that he did not believe Croto would carry out his plans,\n\nbut he was fed up with him selling drugs to young people.           Berube\n\nresponded that he was fed up with Croto selling marijuana to his\n\nfriends and that he was concerned that Croto would carry out his\n\nplans to blow up the police station.\n\n           Detective Gagne investigated Croto's criminal history,\n\nverifying that his birth date matched the date provided by Berube\n\nand Sargent.     He discovered that Croto had been convicted of\n\naggravated   trafficking   of    scheduled   drugs    and   of   aggravated\n\nassault, both of which were state felony convictions.             Detective\n\nGagne sought a search warrant on February 25, 2007, authorizing the\n\nsearch of a particularly described apartment on the second floor of\n\n81 Foss Street.    Justice Thomas Humphrey of the Maine Superior\n\nCourt issued the search warrant on February 26, 2007, and Biddeford\n\npolice officers executed it the same day.             The officers seized\n\nammunition and three firearms – a .22 caliber pistol, a 12-gauge\n\nshotgun, and a Winchester 30-30 lever action rifle.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             Croto was charged with being a felon in possession of\n\nthree firearms, and he filed a motion to suppress the firearms\n\nseized     during   the   February    26,   2007   warranted    search.1     The\n\nmagistrate judge denied Croto's request for a Franks2 hearing and\n\nrecommended that the district court deny the motion to suppress.\n\nThe magistrate judge concluded that Detective Gagne's affidavit\n\nprovided probable cause to support the warrant, and even if it did\n\nnot, that the Leon3 good faith exception applied.               The district\n\ncourt adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation, and thereafter\n\nCroto entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges, reserving\n\nthe right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             \"In    reviewing   the    district    court's     denial   of    a\n\ndefendant's motion to suppress, we review the district court's\n\nfinding of fact for clear error and its legal determinations,\n\nincluding whether a particular set of facts constitutes probable\n\ncause, de novo.”      United States v. Rodrigue, 560 F.3d 29, 32 (1st\n\n\n     1\n      Croto was also charged with, and he pleaded guilty to,\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute and distributing\nmarijuana, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(D), and 846, and\nusing and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug\ntrafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Croto's motion to\nsuppress and his briefs in this court address themselves only to\nthe guns seized during the search and the related conviction for\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm. The other convictions\nare not at issue in this appeal.\n     2\n         Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).\n     3\n         United States v.

Croto is entitled to relief\n\nonly if \"no reasonable view of the evidence supports\" the district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion.      United States v. Belton, 520 F.3d\n\n80, 82 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 286 (2008).         We give\n\n\"great deference\" to the issuance of a search warrant.            United\n\nStates v. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984, 986 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal marks\n\nomitted).   Our inquiry is limited to verifying that a substantial\n\nbasis   existed   to   support   the   issuing   judge's   \"common-sense\n\ndetermination that, given all the circumstances set forth in the\n\naffidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons\n\nsupplying hearsay information, there was a fair probability that\n\ncontraband or evidence of a crime would be found in a particular\n\nplace.\" Id. (internal marks and emphasis omitted).\n\n            Croto takes issue with the veracity of the individuals\n\nproviding the information contained in Detective Gagne's affidavit\n\nbut does not dispute that those facts, if credible, supply the\n\nnecessary quantum of probable cause to support the issuance of a\n\nsearch warrant.    Croto is correct to point out that most of the\n\ninformation in Detective Gagne's affidavit was supplied by Berube\n\nand Sargent rather than firsthand information obtained by law\n\nenforcement personnel.     Detective Gagne's affidavit repeated the\n\ninformation provided by Berube and Sargent to the police officers\n\nwho took their original statements, including information about\n\nCroto's anarchy plans and Sargent's statements that Croto had\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdiscussed the plans that same day and had shown Sargent two\n\nfirearms at his apartment.          The two citizen informants were named\n\nin the affidavit.         The affidavit also described Detective Gagne's\n\nown investigation as verifying Croto's date of birth, address, and\n\nhis convictions for felony crimes.\n\n              There is nothing wrong with a police officer relying on\n\ninformation provided by others to support the warrant application\n\nhe   makes,    as   long    as   the   affidavit       provided    to    the   court\n\nestablishes     a   sufficient      basis   for   crediting     the     informant's\n\nreliability and his basis for knowledge of the facts supplied. See\n\nUnited States v. McFarlane, 491 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir. 2007) (face-\n\nto-face encounter with informant enhances officer's ability to\n\njudge   previously        unknown    informant's       veracity    and     provided\n\nsufficient basis to credit the informant's statement).                         Croto\n\nrelies almost exclusively on case law dealing with information\n\nprovided by confidential informants who are not identified in the\n\naffidavit provided to the issuing judge and who often provide\n\ninformation to police officers in exchange for leniency related to\n\ntheir own criminal conduct.            Here, Berube and Sargent identified\n\nthemselves     to   the    officers,    which     in   itself     bolsters     their\n\ncredibility because it opens them up for charges related to making\n\na false report.      See United States v. Brown, 500 F.3d 48, 54 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (\"Since he was known to the police, he could have been\n\nheld accountable if his information proved inaccurate or false.\").\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fFurther, Berube and Sargent willingly provided the information and\n\nreceived nothing in return; they were concerned citizens reporting\n\npotential criminal activity, whose stories may be more easily\n\naccepted than those of confidential informants whose motivations\n\nmake their stories more suspect.       See Scalia, 993 F.2d at 987 (\"In\n\nthe absence of a prior record of reliability, we have recognized\n\nthat, where the informant was 'not a professional but a private\n\ncitizen with no known criminal record or other criminal contacts,\n\nwho came forward on his own, the informant's story may be more\n\neasily accepted ....'\") (quoting United States v. Campbell, 732\n\nF.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1984) (some internal marks omitted)).\n\n            The details of the information, as well as the timeliness\n\nof it, also lend to the credibility of the information provided by\n\nBerube and Sargent.    See United States v. Strother, 318 F.3d 64, 68\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (noting that confidential informant's reliability\n\nwas bolstered by the level of detail he provided about the suspect\n\nsufficient to overcome the informant's lack of a track record of\n\nproviding   accurate   information).      Detective   Gagne's   affidavit\n\nrelayed that Sargent gave explicit details about the guns that\n\nCroto showed him, describing the rifle as an \"old fashion[ed] kind\"\n\nwith a lever and a large brass bullet, as well as their location\n\ninside Croto's apartment, stating that the .22 pistol was kept\n\nloaded with a clip in Croto's hunting vest and the guns were kept\n\nnext to a desk in the living room.      The affidavit also informed the\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fissuing judge that Sargent had seen the guns in Croto's apartment\n\non the same day Sargent reported it to the officers and Detective\n\nGagne completed the affidavit.       Finally, Berube's statements that\n\nCroto told him about his plan to blow up the police station and\n\nkidnap the mayor and that Berube had seen numerous firearms in\n\nCroto's   former    residence   corroborate   Sargent's     more   detailed\n\nrecitation.    See United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 566 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"[C]onsistency between the reports of two independent\n\ninformants helps to validate both accounts.\").             Considering the\n\ntotality of the circumstances bearing on the named informants'\n\n\"veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge,\" United States v.\n\nRomain, 393 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 545 U.S.\n\n1122 (2005), we conclude that the affidavit provided sufficient\n\nprobable cause to support issuance of the search warrant.\n\n           Croto argues that the affidavit was misleading to the\n\nextent that it omitted Berube's and Sargent's statements revealing\n\ntheir bias against Croto.         Croto argues that had the statements\n\nbeen included in the affidavit, they would have sufficiently\n\nundermined    the   informants'    credibility   so   as   to   render   the\n\naffidavit inadequate to support a finding of probable cause.\n\nAlthough Croto sought a Franks hearing in the district court, he\n\ndoes not challenge the denial of a hearing on appeal.           He addresses\n\nthe omitted information on appeal only as it bears on the probable\n\ncause determination.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f              We agree with the district court that even if Detective\n\nGagne   had    included      Berube's    and    Sargent's   statements    in   his\n\naffidavit      about   why    they   delayed      in   contacting   the   police\n\nconcerning Croto's anarchy plan, the issuing judge still would have\n\nfound probable cause to issue the warrant. The district court\n\nconcluded that the omitted information did not minimize or alter\n\nthe detailed facts set out in the affidavit that provided probable\n\ncause to believe that Croto was a convicted felon in possession of\n\nfirearms.      Regardless of how long the two informants had known\n\nabout Croto's alleged anarchy plan, Sargent contacted the police on\n\nthe very day he saw firearms in Croto's apartment, establishing\n\nprobable cause that police officers would find evidence of a crime\n\nat the place to be searched.            The district court further concluded\n\nthat the omitted facts provided a plausible explanation for why\n\nBerube and Sargent, as concerned citizens, waited to contact the\n\npolice – namely, that they had had enough of observing Croto deal\n\ndrugs to young people and of listening to his anarchy plans that\n\nthey decided to do something about it.             We agree with the district\n\ncourt that the omitted information would not have changed the\n\nissuing judge's probable cause determination.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              The district court's denial of Croto's suppression motion\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On February 24, 2007, Michael Berube and Todd Sargent contacted the Biddeford, Maine, Police Department to make a complaint about Sean Croto. Two Biddeford police officers were dispatched to a residence to take the complaint. Sargent and Berube told the officers that they were acquaintances of Sean Croto, identified his address as 81 Foss Street, second floor, and gave the officers his birth date. They told the officers that Croto had been telling them for a few months about his \"anarchy plans\" to blow up the Biddeford Police Department with Molotov cocktails and to kidnap the city's mayor. Sargent explained that Croto had outlined the plans again at Croto's apartment earlier that day and had asked Sargent to join in the action, but Sargent told Croto he wanted nothing to do with it. Croto had also shown Sargent a .22 pistol and a rifle. Sargent told the officers that Croto kept the loaded .22 pistol with a clip in his hunting vest and that he kept his guns next to his desk in the living room. Sargent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> also told the officers that he had seen guns in Croto's bedroom.

Sargent responded that he did not believe Croto would carry out his plans, but he was fed up with him selling drugs to young people. Berube responded that he was fed up with Croto selling marijuana to his friends and that he was concerned that Croto would carry out his plans to blow up the police station.</p>\n<p>Detective Gagne investigated Croto's criminal history, verifying that his birth date matched the date provided by Berube and Sargent. He discovered that Croto had been convicted of aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs and of aggravated assault, both of which were state felony convictions. Detective Gagne sought a search warrant on February 25, 2007, authorizing the search of a particularly described apartment on the second floor of 81 Foss Street. Justice Thomas Humphrey of the Maine Superior Court issued the search warrant on February 26, 2007, and Biddeford police officers executed it the same day. The officers seized ammunition and three firearms  a .22 caliber pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a Winchester 30-30 lever action rifle.</p>\n<p>Croto was charged with being a felon in possession of three firearms, and he filed a motion to suppress the firearms seized during the February 26, 2007 warranted search.<sup>[1]</sup> The magistrate judge denied Croto's request for a <i>Franks</i><sup>[2]</sup> hearing and recommended that the district court deny the motion to suppress.

He now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant  specifically, the guns that formed the basis for his conviction  asserting that the warrant was not supported by probable cause. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On February 24, 2007, Michael Berube and Todd Sargent contacted the Biddeford, Maine, Police Department to make a complaint about Sean Croto. Two Biddeford police officers were dispatched to a residence to take the complaint. Sargent and Berube told the officers that they were acquaintances of Sean Croto, identified his address as 81 Foss Street, second floor, and gave the officers his birth date. They told the officers that Croto had been telling them for a few months about his \"anarchy plans\" to blow up the Biddeford Police Department with Molotov cocktails and to kidnap the city's mayor. Sargent explained that Croto had outlined the plans again at Croto's apartment earlier that day and had asked Sargent to join in the action, but Sargent told Croto he wanted nothing to do with it. Croto had also shown Sargent a .22 pistol and a rifle. Sargent told the officers that Croto kept the loaded .22 pistol with a clip in his hunting vest and that he kept his guns next to his desk in the living room. Sargent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> also told the officers that he had seen guns in Croto's bedroom. Berube told the officers that he had visited Croto at his prior residence located at 42 Sullivan Street where he saw all kinds of guns and drugs.</p>\n<p>Detective Richard Gagne conducted separate recorded interviews with Berube and Sargent, and he asked each of them why they had waited so long to report Croto's anarchy plans. Sargent responded that he did not believe Croto would carry out his plans, but he was fed up with him selling drugs to young people. Berube responded that he was fed up with Croto selling marijuana to his friends and that he was concerned that Croto would carry out his plans to blow up the police station.</p>\n<p>Detective Gagne investigated Croto's criminal history, verifying that his birth date matched the date provided by Berube and Sargent. He discovered that Croto had been convicted of aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs and of aggravated assault, both of which were state felony convictions. Detective Gagne sought a search warrant on February 25, 2007, authorizing the search of a particularly described apartment on the second floor of 81 Foss Street. Justice Thomas Humphrey of the Maine Superior Court issued the search warrant on February 26, 2007, and Biddeford police officers executed it the same day. The officers seized ammunition and three firearms  a .22 caliber pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a Winchester 30-30 lever action rifle.</p>\n<p>Croto was charged with being a felon in possession of three firearms, and he filed a motion to suppress the firearms seized during the February 26, 2007 warranted search.<sup>[1]</sup> The magistrate judge denied Croto's request for a <i>Franks</i><sup>[2]</sup> hearing and recommended that the district court deny the motion to suppress. The magistrate judge concluded that Detective Gagne's affidavit provided probable cause to support the warrant, and even if it did not, that the <i>Leon</i><sup>[3]</sup> good faith exception applied. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation, and thereafter Croto entered a conditional guilty plea to the charges, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"In reviewing the district court's denial of a defendant's motion to suppress, we review the district court's finding of fact for clear error and its legal determinations, including whether a particular set of facts constitutes probable cause, de novo.\" <i>United States v. Rodrigue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203723\"><a href=\"/opinion/203723/united-states-v-rodrigue/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2009) (internal marks omitted). Croto is entitled to relief only if \"no reasonable view of the evidence supports\" the district court's denial of his motion. <i>United States v. Belton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1200934\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200934/united-states-v-belton/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></span> (2008). We give \"great deference\" to the issuance of a search warrant. <i>United States v. Scalia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607107\"><a href=\"/opinion/607107/united-states-v-rickie-albert-scalia/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 986 (1st Cir.1993) (internal marks omitted). Our inquiry is limited to verifying that a substantial basis existed to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> support the issuing judge's \"common-sense determination that, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in a particular place.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>Croto takes issue with the veracity of the individuals providing the information contained in Detective Gagne's affidavit but does not dispute that those facts, if credible, supply the necessary quantum of probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant. Croto is correct to point out that most of the information in Detective Gagne's affidavit was supplied by Berube and Sargent rather than firsthand information obtained by law enforcement personnel. Detective Gagne's affidavit repeated the information provided by Berube and Sargent to the police officers who took their original statements, including information about Croto's anarchy plans and Sargent's statements that Croto had discussed the plans that same day and had shown Sargent two firearms at his apartment. The two citizen informants were named in the affidavit. The affidavit also described Detective Gagne's own investigation as verifying Croto's date of birth, address, and his convictions for felony crimes.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a police officer relying on information provided by others to support the warrant application he makes, as long as the affidavit provided to the court establishes a sufficient basis for crediting the informant's reliability and his basis for knowledge of the facts supplied. <i>See </i><i>United States v. McFarlane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202838\"><a href=\"/opinion/202838/united-states-v-mcfarlane/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2007) (face-to-face encounter with informant enhances officer's ability to judge previously unknown informant's veracity and provided sufficient basis to credit the informant's statement). Croto relies almost exclusively on case law dealing with information provided by confidential informants who are not identified in the affidavit provided to the issuing judge and who often provide information to police officers in exchange for leniency related to their own criminal conduct. Here, Berube and Sargent identified themselves to the officers, which in itself bolsters their credibility because it opens them up for charges related to making a false report. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202905\"><a href=\"/opinion/202905/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Since he was known to the police, he could have been held accountable if his information proved inaccurate or false.\"). Further, Berube and Sargent willingly provided the information and received nothing in return; they were concerned citizens reporting potential criminal activity, whose stories may be more easily accepted than those of confidential informants whose motivations make their stories more suspect. <i>See </i><i>Scalia,</i> 993 F.2d at 987 (\"In the absence of a prior record of reliability, we have recognized that, where the informant was `not a professional but a private citizen with no known criminal record or other criminal contacts, who came forward on his own, the informant's story may be more easily accepted ....'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434887\"><a href=\"/opinion/434887/united-states-v-alvin-r-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1019 (1st Cir. 1984) (some internal marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>The details of the information, as well as the timeliness of it, also lend to the credibility of the information provided by Berube and Sargent. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Strother,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200309\"><a href=\"/opinion/200309/united-states-v-strother/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that confidential informant's reliability was bolstered by the level of detail he provided about the suspect sufficient to overcome the informant's lack of a track record of providing accurate information). Detective Gagne's affidavit relayed that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> Sargent gave explicit details about the guns that Croto showed him, describing the rifle as an \"old fashion[ed] kind\" with a lever and a large brass bullet, as well as their location inside Croto's apartment, stating that the .22 pistol was kept loaded with a clip in Croto's hunting vest and the guns were kept next to a desk in the living room. The affidavit also informed the issuing judge that Sargent had seen the guns in Croto's apartment on the same day Sargent reported it to the officers and Detective Gagne completed the affidavit. Finally, Berube's statements that Croto told him about his plan to blow up the police station and kidnap the mayor and that Berube had seen numerous firearms in Croto's former residence corroborate Sargent's more detailed recitation. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
