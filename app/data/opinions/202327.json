Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Rachel Brill, William Matthewman and Seiden, Adler &\nMatthewman, P.A., and Juan A.

Defendant-appellant Carlos L. Ayala-Lopez is the\n\nsubject of three notices by plaintiff-appellee United States of\n\nAmerica under 18 U.S.C. § 3593(a), stating the bases of its intent\n\nto seek the death penalty for the murder of a policeman employed by\n\nthe United States Department of Veterans Affairs.      Ayala-Lopez\n\nmoved to strike the latest version of the notice submitted by the\n\nappellee, but the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico denied the motion. Ayala-Lopez seeks immediate review in this\n\ncourt, arguing that the denial constitutes a 'collateral order'\n\nrelative to the final judgment rule.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (\"The\n\ncourts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all\n\nfinal decisions of the district courts of the United States ....\").\n\nThe government has moved to strike the appeal, but we ordered\n\nmerits briefing while that motion was held in abeyance.        The\n\nbriefing is now complete.\n\n     We note that two other circuits have found this type of appeal\n\namenable to the collateral-order rule.       See United States v.\n\nFerebe, 332 F.3d 722 (4th Cir. 2003)(\"[W]e conclude that district\n\ncourt orders denying motions to strike Death Notices are collateral\n\norders susceptible to our review.\"); United States v. Wilk, 2006 WL\n\n1685798, --- F.3d --- (11th Cir. 2006)(\"We agree with our sister\n\ncircuit...\").   We shall assume in defendant-appellant's favor,\n\nwithout deciding, that this is a correct interpretation of the\n\ncollateral-order rule.      See generally Restoration Preservation\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fMasonry, Inc. v. Grove Europe Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 59-60 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)(inquiry      into    statutory    jurisdiction        is     not   mandatory\n\npredicate to reaching merits).          In any event, there is no need to\n\nreach   a   more    difficult     non-Article       III    issue    of   appellate\n\njurisdiction if the case may be easily disposed of on the merits.\n\nSee Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46,\n\n53-57 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n      On the merits, Ayala-Lopez argues that the amended notice of\n\nintent to seek the death penalty was not provided \"a reasonable\n\ntime before trial\" as per § 3593(a).                Ayala-Lopez cites Ferebe,\n\nsupra, for the proposition that \"a reasonable time\" is to be\n\nmeasured 'objectively.'         Id. at 731.    His primary argument is that\n\nhe   need   not    show   any   prejudice     for    the   time     period   to   be\n\nunreasonable.       The   Ferebe    majority    apparently         concluded   that\n\nreasonableness was to be measured without reference to prejudice to\n\nthe defendant.      But cf. Wilk, supra, (applicable test is objective\n\nreasonableness, determined by consideration of the totality of\n\ncircumstances).      His argument is no doubt motivated by the fact\n\nthat he has suffered no prejudice.\n\n      Ayala-Lopez's trial in the district court began on February\n\n15, 2006 with voir dire, as per a scheduling order of December 8,\n\n2005.   The amended notice in question was served on December 19,\n\n2005.   The original notice of intent to seek the death penalty was\n\nserved in December 2003, and a prior amended notice was served in\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fMay 2005. The timing of this third notice does not fall short of\n\nany test for objective reasonableness. It contained no substantive\n\nchanges from a prior amended notice, which was served in May 2005.\n\nIt only corrected cross-references to renumbered counts in the\n\nlatest version of the indictment, while leaving the allegations of\n\naggravating factors exactly the same as the May 2005 notice.\n\n     Contrary    to    appellant's    alternate      argument    that   he   has\n\nsuffered prejudice, this purely technical, non-substantive change\n\ncreated no uncertainty about the government's intent to continue\n\npursuing the death penalty, and it imposed no additional burden of\n\npreparation on defense counsel.             Since the December 2005 notice\n\ncontained no substantive changes from the notice served in May\n\n2005, it raises no serious issue of reasonable timing in its own\n\nright.   Rather, again in defendant's favor, we will take the May\n\n2005 notice, which added aggravating factors to those listed in the\n\noriginal notice, as the proper reference point for determining\n\nwhether the defense was given sufficient advance warning of the\n\ngovernment's bases for seeking the death penalty.                The December\n\n2005 amendment has no practical impact on the determination.\n\nConsequently,    even    assuming    that     an   'objective'   standard     of\n\nreasonableness applies and, dubitante, that actual prejudice is not\n\nrequired, service of the last amended notice nearly two months\n\nbefore   the   trial    proceedings    of     February   15   did   provide   a\n\nreasonable interval of time in compliance with § 3593(a).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f     Ayala-Lopez contends that § 3593(a) requires that service of\n\na notice of intent to seek the death penalty be made on him\n\npersonally,    as   opposed   to   his    lawyer.   This   contention   is\n\nuntenable.     The Eleventh Circuit, confronted with an identical\n\nargument, rejected it out of hand in a single footnote.            Wilk,\n\nsupra, at n.32.      The rules by which courts and counsel operate\n\npresuppose that communications, oral or written, with represented\n\nparties will be through their attorneys.            See Fed.R.Crim.P. R.\n\n49(b); Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 4.2.          The reference in §\n\n3593(a) to notice being \"serve[d] on defendant\" must be taken to\n\nhave been drafted with awareness of this settled practice.\n\n     Ayala-Lopez also contends that it was improper to allow\n\namendment of the notice of intent to seek the death penalty absent\n\na \"showing of good cause\" in conformity with § 3593(a).             Even\n\nwithout express leave of the district court, the allowance of the\n\namendment indicates an implicit finding of good cause, which makes\n\nsense given that the amendment followed soon after the issuance of\n\na superceding indictment, was wholly technical in nature, and did\n\nnot change the substantive notification about the aggravating\n\nfactors to be alleged by the government.\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we also reject Ayala-Lopez's\n\ncontention that the errors he alleges cumulate decisively in favor\n\nof reversal.\n\n     The order denying the \"Motion to Strike the Government's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f'Third Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty Against Carlos\n\nAyala Lopez'\" is affirmed.   The \"United States' Motion to Strike\n\nInterlocutory Notice of Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction\" is denied\n\nas moot.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
