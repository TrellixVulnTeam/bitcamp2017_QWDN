The litigation at issue here is an\n\noutgrowth    of    an    earlier       action     appealed    to    this    court,     see\n\nCommonwealth of Mass. v. Blackstone Valley Elec. Co., 67 F.3d 981\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), an environmental case in which we ordered a key\n\nquestion referred to the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency (\"EPA\") under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Not liking\n\nthe EPA's response, the successor to the defendant in the initial\n\naction filed suit directly in this court, asserting that the courts\n\nof appeals have original jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b),\n\nwhich grants direct appellate review of certain actions under the\n\nClean Water Act (\"CWA\").               Because we find that direct appellate\n\nreview of the precise action here -- an interpretation of an\n\nalready     listed       toxic    pollutant        in    response     to     a    primary\n\njurisdiction      referral       --    is   not   within     the    scope    of   section\n\n1369(b), we hold that we lack subject matter jurisdiction.                        Rather\n\nthan dismissing the petition, we transfer it, for efficiency\n\npurposes,    to    the    Federal      District     Court    for    the     District    of\n\nMassachusetts,       thus        consolidating          it   with    the     underlying\n\nenvironmental litigation that generated the primary jurisdiction\n\nreferral.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1631.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                  We briefly describe the facts, beginning with the\n\nunderlying litigation.           In 1987, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n\nsued   Blackstone        Valley       Electric     Company    (\"Blackstone\"),          the\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fcorporate      predecessor     to   Narragansett   Electric    Company\n\n(\"Narragansett\"), the plaintiff in this action, in federal district\n\ncourt for the District of Massachusetts to recover cleanup and\n\nresponse costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\n\nCompensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et\n\nseq.   See Blackstone Valley, 67 F.3d at 983-84.    The cleanup costs\n\nwere for excavation and removal of soil and wood chips contaminated\n\nwith the compound ferric ferrocyanide (\"FFC\").       See id.   The FFC\n\nwas created as a waste byproduct of a coal-based gas manufacturing\n\nprocess employed by a gas facility that had been operated by\n\nBlackstone from 1920-1961.      See id.\n\n            The Commonwealth's ability to recover its cleanup costs\n\nturned essentially on the question of whether FFC was a \"hazardous\n\nsubstance\" within the meaning of CERCLA.     See id. at 984.   CERCLA's\n\ndefinition of \"hazardous substance\" incorporated various lists of\n\nsubstances from other environmental statutes, including the list of\n\n\"toxic pollutants\" that the EPA Administrator was charged with\n\npromulgating under the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a).      See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n9601(14)(D).      FFC itself is not listed on any of the lists\n\nincorporated by CERCLA.         However, the category \"cyanides\" is\n\nincluded on the CWA's list of toxic pollutants, as determined by\n\nthe EPA Administrator.       40 C.F.R. § 401.15; see also 40 C.F.R. §\n\n302.4 & tbl. 302.4 (incorporating this list into CERCLA).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            The Commonwealth's argument in the initial litigation was\n\nthat the term \"cyanides\" in the CWA list of toxic pollutants under\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1317(a) included within it the compound FFC.                      The\n\ndistrict court granted the Commonwealth partial summary judgment on\n\nthe issue of whether FFC was a \"hazardous substance\" under CERCLA,\n\nholding that the term \"cyanides,\" by its \"plain meaning,\" included\n\nthe cyanide compound FFC.      See Commonwealth of Mass. v. Blackstone\n\nValley Elec. Co., 777 F. Supp. 1036, 1038-39 (D. Mass. 1991).\n\n            On appeal, this court vacated the district court's grant\n\nof partial summary judgment on this issue.             We held that there was\n\nno plain meaning whether the term \"cyanides\" included FFC, given\n\nconflicting expert affidavits on the scientific meaning of the\n\nterm. Blackstone Valley, 67 F.3d at 986-87.               We noted further that\n\n\"[h]aving found . . . that EPA's regulatory framework does not\n\nadequately define the term, that the legislative and regulatory\n\nhistory     of   the   term    'cyanides'       does      not     establish   the\n\nCommonwealth's position, and that the position advocated by amicus\n\n[the EPA] is not entitled to deference, we are left with virtually\n\nno legislative or administrative guidance for determining whether\"\n\nthe term \"cyanides\" includes FFC.           Id. at 991-92.       Thus, we ordered\n\nthe question referred to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction\n\ndoctrine.    See id. at 992.    Specifically, we remanded the case to\n\nthe   district   court   to   refer    to     the   EPA    the    question,   for\n\n\"administrative determination,\" of \"whether FFC qualifies as one of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe 'cyanides' within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. § 401.15 and 40\n\nC.F.R. § 302.4, Table 302.4.\"             Id. at 993.       The district court\n\nstayed its own proceedings pending this determination.\n\n            Eight years later, in 2003, the EPA finally answered the\n\nquestion in a \"final administrative determination\" (\"FAD\"), as\n\nfollows: \"ferric ferrocyanide . . . is one of the 'cyanides' within\n\nthe meaning of the Toxic Pollutant List under the Clean Water Act.\"\n\nSee   68   Fed.    Reg.   57,690   (Oct.     6,   2003).     In   reaching   this\n\nconclusion,       the   EPA   undertook    both    a   \"legal     review\"   and   a\n\n\"scientific review.\"          In its legal review, the EPA considered the\n\nlegislative history of the CWA's toxic pollutant provision, 33\n\nU.S.C. § 1317(a), the statutory language of this provision, and its\n\nown history of implementing this provision.                It acknowledged that\n\nnone of these sources specifically addressed FFC or discussed the\n\nscope of the term \"cyanides,\" but found that these three indicators\n\nshowed that the listed pollutants under 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a) were\n\n\"meant to be broad categories or families of compounds.\"                Further,\n\nthe EPA noted that the context of § 1317(a) made a broad reading of\n\nthese listed toxic pollutants sensible: \"Listing does not impose\n\nany regulatory requirements; rather it establishes how a listed\n\npollutant may be regulated in effluent limitation guidelines and\n\nnational pollutant discharge elimination system . . . permits.\"1\n\n\n      1\n      In its legal analysis, the EPA emphasized 40 C.F.R. § 423,\nApp. A, where the EPA promulgated a list of 126 \"Priority\nPollutants.\" The list included a reference to \"Cyanide, Total,\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\fIn its scientific review, the EPA stated that there was evidence\n\nthat FFC can and has released free cyanide in the environment in\n\nways   that    could    be   toxic   to   humans    and   aquatic   organisms.\n\n\"[C]omments      from   peer   reviewers    [and]    non-EPA   experts    with\n\nspecialized knowledge . . . were generally supportive of EPA's\n\nscientific analysis\"; thus this scientific analysis \"support[s]\"\n\nthe EPA's conclusion from its legal review that the term \"cyanides\"\n\nunder 40 C.F.R. § 401.15 includes FFC.\n\n              Before promulgating its FAD, the EPA provided notice and\n\nopportunities for public comment, as well as a peer review of its\n\nproposed determination by scientists.          See 60 Fed. Reg. at 57,691.\n\nThe EPA stressed that in its view, because its FAD was not a\n\n\n\nwhich the EPA stated was intended as a reference to a certain test,\nthe total cyanide test, for measuring cyanide. The test is\nexplained under 40 C.F.R. § 136.3, which establishes procedures for\nmeasuring pollutant discharges for permitting and certain other\npurposes. Cyanide is apparently detectable from FFC by using this\ntotal cyanide test.    At least one other test would not detect\ncyanide in FFC, but the EPA found that 40 C.F.R. § 423's reference\nto the total cyanide test was useful in interpreting the EPA's\ntoxic pollutant list at 40 C.F.R. § 401.15, and established that\ntest as the appropriate test for measuring which compounds were\nincluded in the term \"cyanides\" on the toxic pollutant list. In\nBlackstone Valley, this court declined, despite EPA's suggestion in\nan amicus brief, to use the reference to the total cyanide test in\n40 C.F.R. § 136.3 in order to itself interpret the listing of toxic\npollutants under the CWA at 40 C.F.R. § 401.15. See 67 F.3d at\n988-91. We expressed concern with the lack of any apparent link\nbetween the regulations at § 136.3 and the list at § 401.15, as\nwell as the potential for the total cyanide test to lead to\nnonsensical classifications. See id. at 989-90. Since we transfer\nthis case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we of course do\nnot discuss the appropriateness of the EPA's use of the \"Cyanide,\nTotal\" reference in this context.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f\"legislative rule,\" the agency did not need to provide a notice and\n\ncomment period, but had provided one solely out of choice.          See id.\n\nThe EPA also emphasized its view that:\n\n          EPA's [FAD] . . . clarifies the Agency's\n          interpretation of the term 'cyanides' and does\n          not impose new requirements. It does not mean\n          that [FFC] is a newly added pollutant to the\n          toxic   pollutant   list  under   [33   U.S.C.\n          1317(a)].   The FAD is not a regulation nor\n          does it change existing regulations under the\n          CWA or CERCLA.\n\n          Unhappy with the EPA's FAD, which obviously meant it was\n\nmore vulnerable to having to pay CERCLA clean-up costs to the\n\nCommonwealth, Narragansett (the corporate successor to Blackstone)\n\nfiled a petition for review under 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b) of the EPA's\n\nFAD in this court, on January 22, 2004.\n\n              Before us, Narragansett seeks a determination that the\n\nEPA's   FAD     constituted    a   \"legislative   rule\"   adopted   without\n\ncomplying with the strictures of the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(\"APA\"), and thus is void.         Meanwhile, the Federal District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts continues to have jurisdiction\n\nover the initial, underlying case in which the Commonwealth sued\n\nNarragansett for cleanup costs, because it was the court that\n\noriginally referred the question to the EPA under the primary\n\njurisdiction doctrine.        As best we can tell, no substantive action\n\nhas taken place in that court due to the pendency of this action.\n\n              The EPA has sought to dismiss the court of appeals review\n\npetition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that we\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdo not have original jurisdiction over this action under 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1369(b) and that any jurisdiction is instead vested in the\n\ndistrict      court   under   the    general      provisions    of       the   APA.\n\nNarragansett opposes this motion.           The Commonwealth has intervened\n\nand, while taking no position on the jurisdiction question in the\n\ncourt    of   appeals,   argues     that    if   we   find   that   we    have   no\n\njurisdiction over this case, we ought to transfer the action to the\n\ndistrict court hearing the initial case between the Commonwealth\n\nand Narragansett, rather than dismissing it entirely, so as to\n\nfacilitate efficient resolution of the underlying CERCLA claim.\n\nNarragansett opposes this as well.\n\n                                     II.\n\n              The relevant jurisdictional provision at issue, 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1369(b), provides for direct federal court of appeals review of\n\ncertain actions of the EPA Administrator under the CWA.2                 Among the\n\n\n     2\n      The statute reads as follows:\n     Review of the Administrator's action (A) in promulgating\n     any standard of performance under [33 U.S.C. § 1316], (B)\n     in making any determination pursuant to [33 U.S.C.\n     1316(b)(1)(C)], (C) in promulgating any effluent\n     standard, prohibition, or pretreatment standard under [33\n     U.S.C. § 1317], (D) in making any determination as to a\n     State permit program submitted under [33 U.S.C. §\n     1342(b)], (E) in approving or promulgating any effluent\n     limitation or other limitation under [33 U.S.C. §§ 1311,\n     1312, 1316, or 1345], (F) in issuing or denying any\n     permit under [33 U.S.C. § 1342], and (G) in promulgating\n     any individual control strategy under [33 U.S.C. §\n     1314(l)], may be had by any interested person in the\n     Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States for the\n     Federal judicial district in which such person resides or\n     transacts business . . . .\"\n\n                                      -8-\n\fEPA Administrator's actions under the CWA which are directly\n\nreviewable in the courts of appeals are the promulgation of \"any\n\neffluent standard, prohibition, or pretreatment standard under [33\n\nU.S.C. § 1317].\"   33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(C).3\n\n          Direct appellate review in the courts of appeals under\n\nsection 1369 carries with it \"a peculiar sting\" for potential\n\nchallengers: any agency action reviewable under its provisions must\n\nbe challenged within 120 days, unless based on new \"grounds\"\n\narising after   the   expiration   of    that   time   frame,   and   cannot\n\nthereafter be challenged in any \"civil or criminal proceeding for\n\nenforcement.\"   33 U.S.C. § 1369(b); see Longview Fibre Co. v.\n\nRasmussen, 980 F.2d 1307, 1313 (9th Cir. 1992); Am. Paper Inst.,\n\nInc. v. EPA, 882 F.2d 287, 288-89 (7th Cir. 1989).         The short time\n\n\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1).\n     3\n      We quickly deal with one issue. One might think that when a\nprimary jurisdiction referral originates in a certain district\ncourt, any challenge to the fruits of that referral by a party to\nthe underlying litigation must be in that same court, and the\nchallenger is precluded from bringing a challenge in some other\ncourt. This, though, is not the law. See, e.g., Port of Boston\nMarine Terminal Ass'n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S.\n62, 68-69 (1970) (where statute gives court of appeals exclusive\njurisdiction over an agency action, district court which referred\nquestion to agency under primary jurisdiction question properly\nheld that it lacked jurisdiction to review the answer to that\nquestion); Ass'n of Int'l Automobile Mfrs., Inc. v. Comm'r, Mass.\nDep't of Envtl. Prot., 196 F.3d 302, 304 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting\nthat judicial review of question referred for primary jurisdiction\ncan occur in a different court); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1336(b)\n(imposing special statutory requirement that court referring a\nquestion to Surface Transportation Board under primary jurisdiction\ndoctrine has exclusive jurisdiction over response).\n\n                                   -9-\n\fframe in § 1369(b) clearly reflects some effort to protect the\n\nEPA's   interests   in     finality   in     certain    matters,   particularly\n\ncertain rulemakings with substantial significance and scope.                  By\n\ncontrast, the standard statute of limitations for APA actions is\n\nsix years.    See Trafalgar Capital Assocs., Inc. v. Cuomo, 159 F.3d\n\n21, 34 (1st Cir. 1998).         Further, we note the obvious proposition,\n\nstated by various courts, that since some but not all of the\n\nactions that the EPA can take under the CWA are listed with\n\nconsiderable specificity in section 1369(b), not all EPA actions\n\ntaken under the CWA are directly reviewable in the courts of\n\nappeals.     See, e.g., Friends of the Earth v. EPA, 333 F.3d 184,\n\n189-90 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. EPA, 538 F.2d\n\n513, 518 (2d Cir. 1976).\n\n             Narragansett acknowledges, as it must, that the FAD\n\nissued by the EPA in this case is not specifically set forth in\n\nsection 1369(b).         Nonetheless, it argues that we have original\n\njurisdiction under section 1369(b)(1)(C), which gives this court\n\noriginal jurisdiction to hear challenges to the EPA's promulgation\n\nof any effluent standard or prohibition promulgated under 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1317.    See 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(C).          It is clear that the FAD\n\nitself did not promulgate any effluent standard or prohibition.\n\nEffluent     standards    and    prohibitions     are    quantity    limits   or\n\nprohibitions of discharges of toxic pollutants that apply to all\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\findustries and types of point sources.               See 40 C.F.R. § 129.2; 33\n\nU.S.C. § 1362(11).\n\n           However, Narragansett contends that even though the EPA\n\nlabeled its own action as merely an interpretation of an existing\n\nlisting of the category \"cyanides,\" the EPA's action should be\n\nconsidered     as    equivalent    to   a   \"listing\"    of   FFC    as   a   \"toxic\n\npollutant\" under 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a)(1).                Further, Narragansett\n\nargues that because a listing of a compound as a toxic pollutant\n\nunder section 1317(a)(1) is a precondition for the promulgation of\n\neffluent   standards       or   prohibitions        dealing   with    the     listed\n\nsubstance under section 1317(a)(2), and is so intertwined with such\n\na promulgation, the listing itself must be directly reviewable in\n\nthe   courts        of   appeals   under       33   U.S.C.    §     1369(b)(1)(C).\n\nNarragansett cites Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.\n\nTrain, 519 F.2d 287, 290-91 (D.C. Cir. 1975), for this latter\n\nproposition,4 and also notes that the statutory factors that the\n\nEPA should consider when promulgating a \"listing\" are virtually\n\n\n      4\n      Natural Resources held that the challenge at issue before it,\nwhich went to the exclusion of certain pollutants from the toxic\npollutant list, was not intertwined with the promulgation of any\neffluent standards, and thus jurisdiction lay in the district court\nunder general provisions of the APA, and not in the appeals court\nunder section 1369. 519 F.2d at 291. However, Natural Resources\nstated, in dicta, that \"when the Administrator has listed a\nsubstance and thereafter promulgated standards or prohibitions for\nthat substance the listing and the promulgation of standards are\ninterwoven; any challenge to the Administrator's action must then\nbe in a court of appeals under section [1369].\" Id. at 290-91.\nThat is not this case, since here no effluent standards have yet\nbeen promulgated dealing with cyanides or FFC.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fidentical to those used when subsequently considering an effluent\n\nstandard or prohibition for that listed substance.   See 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1317(a)(1), (2).   From a policy perspective, Narragansett notes\n\nthe potential for irrational bifurcated review if a company,\n\nseeking to challenge both specific effluent standards dealing with\n\na toxic pollutant and the underlying listing of that substance as\n\na toxic pollutant, were forced to file in two different courts to\n\nmake those challenges.\n\n          The EPA counters that a listing is not so intertwined\n\nwith a subsequent effluent standard or prohibition as to require\n\ninitial review in the courts of appeals.    It notes that Natural\n\nResources predates revisions to section 1317 that loosened the\n\nrelationship between listings and effluent standards.       See 33\n\nU.S.C. § 1317, Historical and Statutory Notes.   As well, it notes\n\nthat the EPA need not automatically subject a substance to effluent\n\nstandards or prohibitions merely because it has been listed as a\n\ntoxic pollutant; in fact, the EPA has only promulgated effluent\n\nstandards for a few listed toxic pollutants under section 1317, and\n\nno effluent standards or prohibitions have been promulgated for\n\ncyanides or FFC. See 40 C.F.R. § 129.4 (listing effluent standards\n\nfor only six toxic pollutants).\n\n          We have no need to enter into this fray.   We do not here\n\ndiscuss the issue of when, if ever, a listing of a substance as a\n\n\"toxic pollutant\" under section 1317(a) might be directly reviewed\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fin the court of appeals under section 1369(b).5        Nor must we decide\n\nwhether an EPA action labeled an \"interpretation\" of an existing\n\nlisting can ever be considered the equivalent of a \"listing\" for\n\nany purpose.     Our grounds of decision in this case are narrower: we\n\nhold only that, as the EPA argues in the alternative, the FAD\n\nissued by the EPA in this case was not equivalent to a \"listing\"\n\nunder section 1317(a).\n\n           Before listing a substance as a toxic pollutant under the\n\nCWA, the EPA is statutorily charged with considering the following\n\nfactors:   the    \"toxicity   of   the    pollutant,   its   persistence,\n\ndegradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected\n\norganisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms,\n\nand the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on\n\nsuch organisms.\"       33 U.S.C. § 1317(a)(1).         In contrast, the\n\nquestion the district court referred to the EPA under the primary\n\njurisdiction doctrine, and which was answered by the EPA, asked\n\n\"whether FFC qualifies as one of the 'cyanides' within the meaning\n\nof 40 C.F.R. § 401.15 and 40 C.F.R. § 302.4, Table 302.4.\"\n\nBlackstone Valley, 67 F.3d at 993.        The inquiry undertaken by the\n\n\n\n     5\n      We do note, though, that the challenge Narragansett raises to\nthis FAD has nothing to do with the promulgation of future effluent\nstandards or prohibitions dealing with FFC or other cyanides. It\nchallenges the EPA's determination that FFC was already included on\nthe list of toxic pollutants for its own sake, as the mere act of\nlisting a substance as a toxic pollutant under 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a)\nleads to potential liability under CERCLA, and avoiding CERCLA\nliability is the purpose of Narragansett's suit.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fEPA   in     order    to   answer      this    question         emphasized     legal\n\nconsiderations, particularly the legislative history, statutory\n\nlanguage,     statutory     context,     and    a    review      of    the   various\n\nregulations the EPA has promulgated under the CWA.                       Scientific\n\nconsiderations were used only to \"support\" this analysis, and the\n\nEPA's scientific review did not include a consideration of the\n\nstatutory factors in section 1317(a).               It considered only whether\n\ncyanide might escape from FFC.\n\n             Further, we note that procedurally, it seems clear that\n\na normal listing of a substance as a toxic pollutant under section\n\n1317(a) is a rule making, and the various procedural requirements\n\nof a rule making, including a notice and comment period, will apply.\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. § 553.        It is more doubtful that the sort of agency\n\naction at issue in this case -- a FAD in response to a primary\n\njurisdiction    referral     about     the    meaning      of   a     regulation   --\n\nconstitutes a rule making, and so it may be that various procedural\n\nrequirements for a listing, including a notice and comment period,\n\ndo not apply as of right, although the EPA chose to provide some of\n\nthose procedures here.      This is an issue that goes, as well, to the\n\nmerits of Narragansett's case against the EPA.\n\n             To salvage its argument that this FAD promulgated by the\n\nEPA is a listing, and the listing in turn should be directly\n\nreviewable    under   section    1369(b)       by    the   courts       of   appeals,\n\nNarragansett points to Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, 445 U.S.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f193 (1980).   Crown Simpson offers no support.       It held merely that\n\nthe EPA's decision to veto a state-issued permit under the CWA was\n\ndirectly   reviewable   by   the   courts   of   appeals   under   section\n\n1369(b)(1)(F), which gave the appellate courts jurisdiction over the\n\nEPA's actions in \"issuing or denying any permit\" under a certain CWA\n\nprovision, because the \"precise effect of [the EPA's] action [was]\n\nto 'deny' a permit,\" and its action was \"functionally similar\" to\n\na direct denial of an EPA permit.     See id. at 196.      Here, as stated\n\nabove, the FAD issued by the EPA has a different effect than, and\n\nis not functionally similar to, a listing (to not even speak of an\n\n\"effluent standard,\" the actual statutory language at issue).6\n\n           Since the FAD issued by the EPA here is not functionally\n\nequivalent to a listing, Narragansett's argument necessarily fails.\n\nThe interrelationship between the FAD and an \"effluent standard\"\n\ncannot be sufficient to establish jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n     6\n      Narragansett also relies on Modine Manufacturing Corp. v.\nKay, 791 F.2d 267 (3d Cir. 1986), which held that within the\ncontext of that case, an EPA interpretation of a \"pretreatment\nstandard\" to apply it to a certain type of industrial process was\nreviewable under section 1369(b) just as the EPA's promulgation of\na pretreatment standard itself would be.         While we do not\nnecessarily agree with the result in Modine, which reflected a\n\"liberal\" interpretation of section 1369, see id. at 269-70, that\nhas not been followed in other cases, we find Modine easily\ndistinguishable for several reasons. The interpretation in that\ncase was not conducted pursuant to a very limited referral under\nthe primary jurisdiction doctrine, but instead was performed\npursuant to certain formalized agency procedures.      Further, the\n\"interpretation\" here is of a listing, not of an effluent standard;\nthus the interpretation is an additional step removed from an\naction named as reviewable in the statutory text.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f1369(b)(1)(C).        Narragansett makes no arguments under any of the\n\nother    clauses      in   section    1369(b).      Thus,       we   lack   original\n\njurisdiction to hear this petition. Original jurisdiction over this\n\npetition would seem to lie in the district court under the APA.\n\nArguments such as whether the FAD                 was   a   final agency action\n\nreviewable under the APA, see 5 U.S.C. § 704, should be addressed\n\nby the district court.\n\n              The Commonwealth, as an intervenor, asks that we not\n\ndismiss this petition, thus allowing it to be refiled in any\n\ndistrict court, but rather that we transfer the petition, construed\n\nas an APA petition, to the district court currently hearing the\n\ninitial,      underlying     litigation     between       the   Commonwealth       and\n\nNarragansett.      The Commonwealth argues that this will allow both\n\ncases to be determined at the same time, preventing undue delay of\n\nthe underlying action, which began in 1987. 28 U.S.C. § 1631 allows\n\nus to transfer a case over which we lack jurisdiction to any other\n\ncourt where the action originally could have been brought, so long\n\nas such a transfer is in the \"interest of justice.\"                  See Britell v.\n\nUnited States, 318 F.3d 70, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              Transfer here is plainly in the interest of justice:\n\nNarragansett has made no argument that it will be harmed by the\n\ntransfer or would prefer a different forum for any reason. Further,\n\na District of Massachusetts forum coincides well with Narragansett's\n\nfiling   of    this    petition      with   the   First     Circuit.        Both   the\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fCommonwealth's interests and interests in \"judicial administration\"\n\n-- which is a factor in the section 1631 analysis, see id. at 75 --\n\ncounsel very strongly in favor of a transfer.          Narragansett argues\n\nthat section 1631 is intended solely to protect the interests of the\n\nfiling plaintiff and thus transfer cannot be granted over the filing\n\nparty's   objections.    Such    a    narrow    read   of   the   statute   is\n\ninconsistent with its language, with Britell, and with the fact that\n\na court can sua sponte order a transfer even absent a motion from\n\neither party, see, e.g., Phillips v. Seiter, 173 F.3d 609, 610 (7th\n\nCir. 1999), and we do not adopt it.            We will grant the transfer\n\nhere.\n\n            If and when the district court does resolve the FFC issue\n\nin light of the FAD, any party remains free to request review\n\nimmediately in this court under the certification procedure if there\n\nis a basis for believing that immediate review would be appropriate.\n\nWe are not endorsing such a course but merely noting its existence.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            We hold that we lack jurisdiction over this petition\n\nunder 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b).      The Commonwealth's motion to transfer\n\nis granted, and this case is hereby transferred to the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts. The Clerk of this\n\ncourt is directed to take the necessary steps to effectuate the\n\ntransfer.   No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

Blackstone Valley Elec. Co.,</i> 67 F.3d 981 (1st Cir.1995), an environmental case in which we ordered a key question referred to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Not liking the EPA's response, the successor to the defendant in the initial action filed suit directly in this court, asserting that the courts of appeals have original jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b), which grants direct appellate review of certain actions under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). Because we find that direct appellate review of the precise action here &#8212; an interpretation of an already listed toxic pollutant in response to a primary jurisdiction referral &#8212; is not within the scope of section 1369(b), we hold that we lack subject matter jurisdiction. Rather than dismissing the petition, we transfer it, for efficiency purposes, to the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, thus consolidating it with the underlying environmental litigation that generated the primary jurisdiction referral. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts, beginning with the underlying litigation. In 1987, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sued Blackstone Valley Electric Company (\"Blackstone\"), the corporate predecessor to Narragansett Electric Company (\"Narragansett\"), the plaintiff in this action, in federal district court for the District of Massachusetts to recover cleanup and response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9601 <i>et seq. See Blackstone Valley,</i> 67 F.3d at 983-84. The cleanup costs were for excavation and removal of soil and wood chips contaminated with the compound ferric ferrocyanide (\"FFC\"). <i>See id.</i> The FFC was created as a waste byproduct of a coal-based gas manufacturing process employed by a gas facility that had been operated by Blackstone from 1920-1961. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's ability to recover its cleanup costs turned essentially on the question of whether FFC was a \"hazardous substance\" within the meaning of CERCLA. <i>See id.</i> at 984. CERCLA's definition of \"hazardous substance\" incorporated various lists of substances from other environmental statutes, including the list of \"toxic pollutants\" that the EPA Administrator was charged with promulgating under the CWA, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9601(14)(D). FFC itself is not listed on any of the lists incorporated by CERCLA. However, the category \"cyanides\" is included on the CWA's list of toxic pollutants, as determined by the EPA Administrator. 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15; <i>see also</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 302.4 &amp; tbl. 302.4 (incorporating this list into CERCLA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's argument in the initial litigation was that the term \"cyanides\" in the CWA list of toxic pollutants under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) included within it the compound FFC. The district court granted the Commonwealth partial summary judgment on the issue of whether FFC was a \"hazardous substance\" under CERCLA, holding that the term \"cyanides,\" by its \"plain meaning,\" included the cyanide compound FFC. <i>See Commonwealth of Mass. v. Blackstone Valley Elec. Co.,</i> 777 F.Supp. 1036, 1038-39 (D.Mass. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, this court vacated the district court's grant of partial summary judgment on this issue. We held that there was no plain meaning whether the term \"cyanides\" included FFC, given conflicting expert affidavits on the scientific meaning of the term. <i>Blackstone Valley,</i> 67 F.3d at 986-87. We noted further that \"[h]aving found ... that EPA's regulatory framework does not adequately define the term, that the legislative and regulatory history of the term `cyanides' does not establish the Commonwealth's position, and that the position advocated by amicus [the EPA] is not entitled to deference, we are left with virtually no legislative or administrative guidance for determining whether\" the term \"cyanides\" includes FFC. <i>Id.</i> at 991-92. Thus, we ordered the question referred to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. <i>See id.</i> at 992. Specifically, we remanded the case to the district court to refer to the EPA the question, for \"administrative determination,\" of \"whether FFC qualifies as one of the `cyanides' within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15 and 40 C.F.R. &#167; 302.4, Table 302.4.\" <i>Id.</i> at 993. The district court stayed its own proceedings pending this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eight years later, in 2003, the EPA finally answered the question in a \"final administrative determination\" (\"FAD\"), as follows: \"ferric ferrocyanide ... is one of the `cyanides' within the meaning of the Toxic Pollutant List under the Clean Water Act.\" <i>See</i> 68 Fed.Reg. 57,690 (Oct. 6, 2003). In reaching this conclusion, the EPA undertook both a \"legal review\" and a \"scientific review.\" In its legal review, the EPA considered the legislative history of the CWA's toxic pollutant provision, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a), the statutory language of this provision, and its own history of implementing this provision. It acknowledged that none of these sources specifically addressed FFC or discussed the scope of the term \"cyanides,\" but found that these three indicators showed that the listed pollutants under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) were \"meant to be broad categories or families of compounds.\" Further, the EPA noted that the context of &#167; 1317(a) made a broad reading of these listed toxic pollutants sensible: \"Listing does not impose any regulatory requirements; rather it establishes how a listed pollutant may be regulated in effluent limitation guidelines and national pollutant discharge elimination system ... permits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In its scientific review, the EPA stated that there was evidence that FFC can and has released free cyanide in the environment in ways that could be toxic to humans and aquatic organisms. \"[C]omments from peer reviewers [and] non-EPA experts with specialized knowledge... were generally supportive of EPA's scientific analysis\"; thus this scientific analysis \"support[s]\" the EPA's conclusion from its legal review that the term \"cyanides\" under 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15 includes FFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before promulgating its FAD, the EPA provided notice and opportunities for public comment, as well as a peer review of its proposed determination by scientists. <i>See</i> 60 Fed.Reg. at 57,691. The EPA stressed that in its view, because its FAD was not a \"legislative rule,\" the agency did not need to provide a notice and comment period, but had provided one solely out of choice. <i>See id.</i> The EPA also emphasized its view that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EPA's [FAD] ... clarifies the Agency's interpretation of the term `cyanides' and does not impose new requirements. It does not mean that [FFC] is a newly added pollutant to the toxic pollutant list under [33 U.S.C. 1317(a)]. The FAD is not a regulation nor does it change existing regulations under the CWA or CERCLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unhappy with the EPA's FAD, which obviously meant it was more vulnerable to having to pay CERCLA clean-up costs to the Commonwealth, Narragansett (the corporate successor to Blackstone) filed a petition for review under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b) of the EPA's FAD in this court, on January 22, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, Narragansett seeks a determination that the EPA's FAD constituted a \"legislative rule\" adopted without complying with the strictures of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), and thus is void. Meanwhile, the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts continues to have jurisdiction over the initial, underlying case in which the Commonwealth sued Narragansett for cleanup costs, because it was the court that originally referred the question to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. As best we can tell, no substantive action has taken place in that court due to the pendency of this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA has sought to dismiss the court of appeals review petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that we do not have original jurisdiction over this action under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b) and that any jurisdiction is instead vested in the district court under the general provisions of the APA. Narragansett opposes this motion. The Commonwealth has intervened and, while taking no position on the jurisdiction question in the court of appeals, argues that if we find that we have no jurisdiction over this case, we ought to transfer the action to the district court hearing the initial case between the Commonwealth and Narragansett, rather than dismissing it entirely, so as to facilitate efficient resolution of the underlying CERCLA claim. Narragansett opposes this as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant jurisdictional provision at issue, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b), provides for direct federal court of appeals review of certain actions of the EPA Administrator under the CWA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Among the EPA Administrator's actions under the CWA which are directly reviewable in the courts of appeals are the promulgation of \"any effluent standard, prohibition, or pretreatment standard under [33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317].\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct appellate review in the courts of appeals under section 1369 carries with it \"a peculiar sting\" for potential challengers: any agency action reviewable under its provisions must be challenged within 120 days, unless based on new \"grounds\" arising after the expiration of that time frame, and cannot thereafter be challenged in any \"civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b); <i>see Longview Fibre Co. v.

The short time frame in &#167; 1369(b) clearly reflects some effort to protect the EPA's interests in finality in certain matters, particularly certain rule-makings with substantial significance and scope. By contrast, the standard statute of limitations for APA actions is six years. <i>See Trafalgar Capital Assocs., Inc. v. Cuomo,</i> 159 F.3d 21, 34 (1st Cir.1998). Further, we note the obvious proposition, stated by various courts, that since some but not all of the actions that the EPA can take under the CWA are listed with considerable specificity in section 1369(b), not all EPA actions taken under the CWA are directly reviewable in the courts of appeals. <i>See, e.g., Friends of the Earth v.

Nonetheless, it argues that we have original jurisdiction under section 1369(b)(1)(C), which gives this court original jurisdiction to hear challenges to the EPA's promulgation of any effluent standard or prohibition promulgated under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). It is clear that the FAD itself did not promulgate any effluent standard or prohibition. Effluent standards and prohibitions are quantity limits or prohibitions of discharges of toxic pollutants that apply to all industries and types of point sources. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.2; 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Narragansett contends that even though the EPA labeled its own action as merely an interpretation of an existing listing of the category \"cyanides,\" the EPA's action should be considered as equivalent to a \"listing\" of FFC as a \"toxic pollutant\" under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1). Further, Narragansett argues that because a listing of a compound as a toxic pollutant under section 1317(a)(1) is a precondition for the promulgation of effluent standards or prohibitions dealing with the listed substance under section 1317(a)(2), and is so intertwined with such a promulgation, the listing itself must be directly reviewable in the courts of appeals under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). Narragansett cites <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Train,</i> 519 F.2d 287, 290-91 (D.C.Cir.1975), for this latter proposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and also notes that the statutory factors that the EPA should consider when promulgating a \"listing\" are virtually identical to those used when subsequently considering an effluent standard or prohibition for that listed substance. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1), (2). From a policy perspective, Narragansett notes the potential for irrational bifurcated review if a company, seeking to challenge both specific effluent standards dealing with a toxic pollutant and the underlying listing of that substance as a toxic pollutant, were forced to file in two different courts to make those challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA counters that a listing is not so intertwined with a subsequent effluent standard or prohibition as to require initial review in the courts of appeals. It notes that <i>Natural Resources</i> predates revisions to section 1317 that loosened the relationship between listings and effluent standards. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317, Historical and Statutory Notes. As well, it notes that the EPA need not automatically subject a substance to effluent standards or prohibitions merely because it has been listed as a toxic pollutant; in fact, the EPA has only promulgated effluent standards for a few listed toxic pollutants under section 1317, and no effluent standards or prohibitions have been promulgated for cyanides or FFC. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.4 (listing effluent standards for only six toxic pollutants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to enter into this fray. We do not here discuss the issue of when, if ever, a listing of a substance as a \"toxic pollutant\" under section 1317(a) might be directly reviewed in the court of appeals under section 1369(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Nor must we decide whether an EPA action labeled an \"interpretation\" of an existing listing can ever be considered the equivalent of a \"listing\" for any purpose. Our grounds of decision in this case are narrower: we hold only that, as the EPA argues in the alternative, the FAD issued by the EPA in this case was not equivalent to a \"listing\" under section 1317(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before listing a substance as a toxic pollutant under the CWA, the EPA is statutorily charged with considering the following factors: the \"toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms, and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1). In contrast, the question the district court referred to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, and which was answered by the EPA, asked \"whether FFC qualifies as one of the `cyanides' within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15 and 40 C.F.R. &#167; 302.4, Table 302.4.\" <i>Blackstone Valley,</i> 67 F.3d at 993. The inquiry undertaken by the EPA in order to answer this question emphasized legal considerations, particularly the legislative history, statutory language, statutory context, and a review of the various regulations the EPA has promulgated under the CWA. Scientific considerations were used only to \"support\" this analysis, and the EPA's scientific review did not include a consideration of the statutory factors in section 1317(a). It considered only whether cyanide might escape from FFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we note that procedurally, it seems clear that a normal listing of a substance as a toxic pollutant under section 1317(a) is a rule making, and the various procedural requirements of a rule making, including a notice and comment period, will apply. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553. It is more doubtful that the sort of agency action at issue in this case &#8212; a FAD in response to a primary jurisdiction referral about the meaning of a regulation &#8212; constitutes a rule making, and so it may be that various procedural requirements for a listing, including a notice and comment period, do not apply as of right, although the EPA chose to provide some of those procedures here. This is an issue that goes, as well, to the merits of Narragansett's case against the EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To salvage its argument that this FAD promulgated by the EPA is a listing, and the listing in turn should be directly reviewable under section 1369(b) by the courts of appeals, Narragansett points to <i>Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle,</i> 445 U.S. 193, 100 S.Ct. 1093, 63 L.Ed.2d 312 (1980). <i>Crown Simpson</i> offers no support. It held merely that the EPA's decision to veto a state-issued permit under the CWA was directly reviewable by the courts of appeals under section 1369(b)(1)(F), which gave the appellate courts jurisdiction over the EPA's actions in \"issuing or denying any permit\" under a certain CWA provision, because the \"precise effect of [the EPA's] action [was] to `deny' a permit,\" and its action was \"functionally similar\" to a direct denial of an EPA permit. <i>See id.</i> at 196, 100 S.Ct. 1093. Here, as stated above, the FAD issued by the EPA has a different effect than, and is not functionally similar to, a listing (to not even speak of an \"effluent standard,\" the actual statutory language at issue).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the FAD issued by the EPA here is not functionally equivalent to a listing, Narragansett's argument necessarily fails. The interrelationship between the FAD and an \"effluent standard\" cannot be sufficient to establish jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). Narragansett makes no arguments under any of the other clauses in section 1369(b). Thus, we lack original jurisdiction to hear this petition. Original jurisdiction over this petition would seem to lie in the district court under the APA. Arguments such as whether the FAD was a final agency action reviewable under the APA, <i>see</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704, should be addressed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth, as an intervenor, asks that we not dismiss this petition, thus allowing it to be refiled in any district court, but rather that we transfer the petition, construed as an APA petition, to the district court currently hearing the initial, underlying litigation between the Commonwealth and Narragansett. The Commonwealth argues that this will allow both cases to be determined at the same time, preventing undue delay of the underlying action, which began in 1987. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 allows us to transfer a case over which we lack jurisdiction to any other court where the action originally could have been brought, so long as such a transfer is in the \"interest of justice.\" <i>See Britell v. United States,</i> 318 F.3d 70, 73-74 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transfer here is plainly in the interest of justice: Narragansett has made no argument that it will be harmed by the transfer or would prefer a different forum for any reason. Further, a District of Massachusetts forum coincides well with Narragansett's filing of this petition with the First Circuit. Both the Commonwealth's interests and interests in \"judicial administration\" &#8212; which is a factor in the section 1631 analysis, <i>see id.</i> at 75 &#8212; counsel very strongly in favor of a transfer. Narragansett argues that section 1631 is intended solely to protect the interests of the filing plaintiff and thus transfer cannot be granted over the filing party's objections. Such a narrow read of the statute is inconsistent with its language, with <i>Britell,</i> and with the fact that a court can <i>sua sponte</i> order a transfer even absent a motion from either party, <i>see, e.g., Phillips v. Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d 609, 610 (7th Cir.1999), and we do not adopt it. We will grant the transfer here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If and when the district court does resolve the FFC issue in light of the FAD, any party remains free to request review immediately in this court under the certification procedure if there is a basis for believing that immediate review would be appropriate. We are not endorsing such a course but merely noting its existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that we lack jurisdiction over this petition under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b).

The test is explained under 40 C.F.R. &#167; 136.3, which establishes procedures for measuring pollutant discharges for permitting and certain other purposes. Cyanide is apparently detectable from FFC by using this total cyanide test. At least one other test would not detect cyanide in FFC, but the EPA found that 40 C.F.R. &#167; 423's reference to the total cyanide test was useful in interpreting the EPA's toxic pollutant list at 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15, and established that test as the appropriate test for measuring which compounds were included in the term \"cyanides\" on the toxic pollutant list. In<i>Blackstone Valley,</i> this court declined, despite EPA's suggestion in an amicus brief, to use the reference to the total cyanide test in 40 C.F.R. &#167; 136.3 in order to itself interpret the listing of toxic pollutants under the CWA at 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15. <i>See</i> 67 F.3d at 988-91. We expressed concern with the lack of any apparent link between the regulations at &#167; 136.3 and the list at &#167; 401.15, as well as the potential for the total cyanide test to lead to nonsensical classifications. <i>See id.</i> at 989-90.

While we do not necessarily agree with the result in <i>Modine,</i> which reflected a \"liberal\" interpretation of section 1369, <i>see id.</i> at 269-70, that has not been followed in other cases, we find <i>Modine</i> easily distinguishable for several reasons.

Not liking the EPA's response, the successor to the defendant in the initial action filed suit directly in this court, asserting that the courts of appeals have original jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b), which grants direct appellate review of certain actions under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). Because we find that direct appellate review of the precise action here &#8212; an interpretation of an already listed toxic pollutant in response to a primary jurisdiction referral &#8212; is not within the scope of section 1369(b), we hold that we lack subject matter jurisdiction. Rather than dismissing the petition, we transfer it, for efficiency purposes, to the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, thus consolidating it with the underlying environmental litigation that generated the primary jurisdiction referral. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts, beginning with the underlying litigation. In 1987, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sued Blackstone Valley Electric Company (\"Blackstone\"), the corporate predecessor to Narragansett Electric Company (\"Narragansett\"), the plaintiff in this action, in federal district court for the District of Massachusetts to recover cleanup and response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9601 <i>et seq. See Blackstone Valley,</i> 67 F.3d at 983-84. The cleanup costs were for excavation and removal of soil and wood chips contaminated with the compound ferric ferrocyanide (\"FFC\"). <i>See id.</i> The FFC was created as a waste byproduct of a coal-based gas manufacturing process employed by a gas facility that had been operated by Blackstone from 1920-1961. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's ability to recover its cleanup costs turned essentially on the question of whether FFC was a \"hazardous substance\" within the meaning of CERCLA. <i>See id.</i> at 984. CERCLA's definition of \"hazardous substance\" incorporated various lists of substances from other environmental statutes, including the list of \"toxic pollutants\" that the EPA Administrator was charged with promulgating under the CWA, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9601(14)(D). FFC itself is not listed on any of the lists incorporated by CERCLA. However, the category \"cyanides\" is included on the CWA's list of toxic pollutants, as determined by the EPA Administrator. 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15; <i>see also</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 302.4 &amp; tbl. 302.4 (incorporating this list into CERCLA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's argument in the initial litigation was that the term \"cyanides\" in the CWA list of toxic pollutants under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) included within it the compound FFC. The district court granted the Commonwealth partial summary judgment on the issue of whether FFC was a \"hazardous substance\" under CERCLA, holding that the term \"cyanides,\" by its \"plain meaning,\" included the cyanide compound FFC. <i>See Commonwealth of Mass. v.

We noted further that \"[h]aving found ... that EPA's regulatory framework does not adequately define the term, that the legislative and regulatory history of the term `cyanides' does not establish the Commonwealth's position, and that the position advocated by amicus [the EPA] is not entitled to deference, we are left with virtually no legislative or administrative guidance for determining whether\" the term \"cyanides\" includes FFC. <i>Id.</i> at 991-92. Thus, we ordered the question referred to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. <i>See id.</i> at 992.

In reaching this conclusion, the EPA undertook both a \"legal review\" and a \"scientific review.\" In its legal review, the EPA considered the legislative history of the CWA's toxic pollutant provision, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a), the statutory language of this provision, and its own history of implementing this provision. It acknowledged that none of these sources specifically addressed FFC or discussed the scope of the term \"cyanides,\" but found that these three indicators showed that the listed pollutants under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) were \"meant to be broad categories or families of compounds.\" Further, the EPA noted that the context of &#167; 1317(a) made a broad reading of these listed toxic pollutants sensible: \"Listing does not impose any regulatory requirements; rather it establishes how a listed pollutant may be regulated in effluent limitation guidelines and national pollutant discharge elimination system ... permits.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In its scientific review, the EPA stated that there was evidence that FFC can and has released free cyanide in the environment in ways that could be toxic to humans and aquatic organisms. \"[C]omments from peer reviewers [and] non-EPA experts with specialized knowledge... were generally supportive of EPA's scientific analysis\"; thus this scientific analysis \"support[s]\" the EPA's conclusion from its legal review that the term \"cyanides\" under 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15 includes FFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before promulgating its FAD, the EPA provided notice and opportunities for public comment, as well as a peer review of its proposed determination by scientists. <i>See</i> 60 Fed.Reg. at 57,691.

Meanwhile, the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts continues to have jurisdiction over the initial, underlying case in which the Commonwealth sued Narragansett for cleanup costs, because it was the court that originally referred the question to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.

Narragansett opposes this motion. The Commonwealth has intervened and, while taking no position on the jurisdiction question in the court of appeals, argues that if we find that we have no jurisdiction over this case, we ought to transfer the action to the district court hearing the initial case between the Commonwealth and Narragansett, rather than dismissing it entirely, so as to facilitate efficient resolution of the underlying CERCLA claim.

The short time frame in &#167; 1369(b) clearly reflects some effort to protect the EPA's interests in finality in certain matters, particularly certain rule-makings with substantial significance and scope. By contrast, the standard statute of limitations for APA actions is six years. <i>See Trafalgar Capital Assocs., Inc. v.

Further, we note the obvious proposition, stated by various courts, that since some but not all of the actions that the EPA can take under the CWA are listed with considerable specificity in section 1369(b), not all EPA actions taken under the CWA are directly reviewable in the courts of appeals. <i>See, e.g., Friends of the Earth v.

Nonetheless, it argues that we have original jurisdiction under section 1369(b)(1)(C), which gives this court original jurisdiction to hear challenges to the EPA's promulgation of any effluent standard or prohibition promulgated under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). It is clear that the FAD itself did not promulgate any effluent standard or prohibition. Effluent standards and prohibitions are quantity limits or prohibitions of discharges of toxic pollutants that apply to all industries and types of point sources. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.2; 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Narragansett contends that even though the EPA labeled its own action as merely an interpretation of an existing listing of the category \"cyanides,\" the EPA's action should be considered as equivalent to a \"listing\" of FFC as a \"toxic pollutant\" under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1). Further, Narragansett argues that because a listing of a compound as a toxic pollutant under section 1317(a)(1) is a precondition for the promulgation of effluent standards or prohibitions dealing with the listed substance under section 1317(a)(2), and is so intertwined with such a promulgation, the listing itself must be directly reviewable in the courts of appeals under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). Narragansett cites <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Train,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328778\"><a href=\"/opinion/328778/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-a-non-profit-new-york-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 290-91 (D.C.Cir.1975), for this latter proposition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and also notes that the statutory factors that the EPA should consider when promulgating a \"listing\" are virtually identical to those used when subsequently considering an effluent standard or prohibition for that listed substance. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1), (2). From a policy perspective, Narragansett notes the potential for irrational bifurcated review if a company, seeking to challenge both specific effluent standards dealing with a toxic pollutant and the underlying listing of that substance as a toxic pollutant, were forced to file in two different courts to make those challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA counters that a listing is not so intertwined with a subsequent effluent standard or prohibition as to require initial review in the courts of appeals. It notes that <i>Natural Resources</i> predates revisions to section 1317 that loosened the relationship between listings and effluent standards. <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317, Historical and Statutory Notes. As well, it notes that the EPA need not automatically subject a substance to effluent standards or prohibitions merely because it has been listed as a toxic pollutant; in fact, the EPA has only promulgated effluent standards for a few listed toxic pollutants under section 1317, and no effluent standards or prohibitions have been promulgated for cyanides or FFC. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 129.4 (listing effluent standards for only six toxic pollutants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no need to enter into this fray. We do not here discuss the issue of when, if ever, a listing of a substance as a \"toxic pollutant\" under section 1317(a) might be directly reviewed in the court of appeals under section 1369(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Nor must we decide whether an EPA action labeled an \"interpretation\" of an existing listing can ever be considered the equivalent of a \"listing\" for any purpose. Our grounds of decision in this case are narrower: we hold only that, as the EPA argues in the alternative, the FAD issued by the EPA in this case was not equivalent to a \"listing\" under section 1317(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before listing a substance as a toxic pollutant under the CWA, the EPA is statutorily charged with considering the following factors: the \"toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, the usual or potential presence of the affected organisms in any waters, the importance of the affected organisms, and the nature and extent of the effect of the toxic pollutant on such organisms.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a)(1). In contrast, the question the district court referred to the EPA under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, and which was answered by the EPA, asked \"whether FFC qualifies as one of the `cyanides' within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15 and 40 C.F.R. &#167; 302.4, Table 302.4.\" <i>Blackstone Valley,</i> 67 F.3d at 993. The inquiry undertaken by the EPA in order to answer this question emphasized legal considerations, particularly the legislative history, statutory language, statutory context, and a review of the various regulations the EPA has promulgated under the CWA. Scientific considerations were used only to \"support\" this analysis, and the EPA's scientific review did not include a consideration of the statutory factors in section 1317(a). It considered only whether cyanide might escape from FFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we note that procedurally, it seems clear that a normal listing of a substance as a toxic pollutant under section 1317(a) is a rule making, and the various procedural requirements of a rule making, including a notice and comment period, will apply. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 553. It is more doubtful that the sort of agency action at issue in this case &#8212; a FAD in response to a primary jurisdiction referral about the meaning of a regulation &#8212; constitutes a rule making, and so it may be that various procedural requirements for a listing, including a notice and comment period, do not apply as of right, although the EPA chose to provide some of those procedures here. This is an issue that goes, as well, to the merits of Narragansett's case against the EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To salvage its argument that this FAD promulgated by the EPA is a listing, and the listing in turn should be directly reviewable under section 1369(b) by the courts of appeals, Narragansett points to <i>Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110219\"><a href=\"/opinion/110219/crown-simpson-pulp-co-v-costle/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110219\"><a href=\"/opinion/110219/crown-simpson-pulp-co-v-costle/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (1980). <i>Crown Simpson</i> offers no support. It held merely that the EPA's decision to veto a state-issued permit under the CWA was directly reviewable by the courts of appeals under section 1369(b)(1)(F), which gave the appellate courts jurisdiction over the EPA's actions in \"issuing or denying any permit\" under a certain CWA provision, because the \"precise effect of [the EPA's] action [was] to `deny' a permit,\" and its action was \"functionally similar\" to a direct denial of an EPA permit. <i>See id.</i> at 196, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110219\"><a href=\"/opinion/110219/crown-simpson-pulp-co-v-costle/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>. Here, as stated above, the FAD issued by the EPA has a different effect than, and is not functionally similar to, a listing (to not even speak of an \"effluent standard,\" the actual statutory language at issue).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the FAD issued by the EPA here is not functionally equivalent to a listing, Narragansett's argument necessarily fails. The interrelationship between the FAD and an \"effluent standard\" cannot be sufficient to establish jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(C). Narragansett makes no arguments under any of the other clauses in section 1369(b). Thus, we lack original jurisdiction to hear this petition. Original jurisdiction over this petition would seem to lie in the district court under the APA. Arguments such as whether the FAD was a final agency action reviewable under the APA, <i>see</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704, should be addressed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth, as an intervenor, asks that we not dismiss this petition, thus allowing it to be refiled in any district court, but rather that we transfer the petition, construed as an APA petition, to the district court currently hearing the initial, underlying litigation between the Commonwealth and Narragansett. The Commonwealth argues that this will allow both cases to be determined at the same time, preventing undue delay of the underlying action, which began in 1987. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 allows us to transfer a case over which we lack jurisdiction to any other court where the action originally could have been brought, so long as such a transfer is in the \"interest of justice.\" <i>See Britell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200310\"><a href=\"/opinion/200310/britell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 73-74 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transfer here is plainly in the interest of justice: Narragansett has made no argument that it will be harmed by the transfer or would prefer a different forum for any reason. Further, a District of Massachusetts forum coincides well with Narragansett's filing of this petition with the First Circuit. Both the Commonwealth's interests and interests in \"judicial administration\" &#8212; which is a factor in the section 1631 analysis, <i>see id.</i> at 75 &#8212; counsel very strongly in favor of a transfer. Narragansett argues that section 1631 is intended solely to protect the interests of the filing plaintiff and thus transfer cannot be granted over the filing party's objections. Such a narrow read of the statute is inconsistent with its language, with <i>Britell,</i> and with the fact that a court can <i>sua sponte</i> order a transfer even absent a motion from either party, <i>see, e.g., Phillips v. Seiter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763239\"><a href=\"/opinion/763239/andre-l-phillips-v-richard-p-seiter-glenn-watson-v-jeffrey-j-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 610 (7th Cir.1999), and we do not adopt it.

The test is explained under 40 C.F.R. &#167; 136.3, which establishes procedures for measuring pollutant discharges for permitting and certain other purposes. Cyanide is apparently detectable from FFC by using this total cyanide test. At least one other test would not detect cyanide in FFC, but the EPA found that 40 C.F.R. &#167; 423's reference to the total cyanide test was useful in interpreting the EPA's toxic pollutant list at 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15, and established that test as the appropriate test for measuring which compounds were included in the term \"cyanides\" on the toxic pollutant list. In<i>Blackstone Valley,</i> this court declined, despite EPA's suggestion in an amicus brief, to use the reference to the total cyanide test in 40 C.F.R. &#167; 136.3 in order to itself interpret the listing of toxic pollutants under the CWA at 40 C.F.R. &#167; 401.15. <i>See</i> 67 F.3d at 988-91.

That is not this case, since here no effluent standards have yet been promulgated dealing with cyanides or FFC.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We do note, though, that the challenge Narragansett raises to this FAD has nothing to do with the promulgation of future effluent standards or prohibitions dealing with FFC or other cyanides. It challenges the EPA's determination that FFC was already included on the list of toxic pollutants for its own sake, as the mere act of listing a substance as a toxic pollutant under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1317(a) leads to potential liability under CERCLA, and avoiding CERCLA liability is the purpose of Narragansett's suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Narragansett also relies on<i>Modine Manufacturing Corp. v. Kay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470296\"><a href=\"/opinion/470296/modine-manufacturing-corporation-v-morris-kay-regional-administrator/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1986), which held that within the context of that case, an EPA interpretation of a \"pretreatment standard\" to apply it to a certain type of industrial process was reviewable under section 1369(b) just as the EPA's promulgation of a pretreatment standard itself would be. While we do not necessarily agree with the result in <i>Modine,</i> which reflected a \"liberal\" interpretation of section 1369, <i>see id.</i> at 269-70, that has not been followed in other cases, we find <i>Modine</i> easily distinguishable for several reasons. The interpretation in that case was not conducted pursuant to a very limited referral under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, but instead was performed pursuant to certain formalized agency procedures. Further, the \"interpretation\" here is of a listing, not of an effluent standard; thus the interpretation is an additional step removed from an action named as reviewable in the statutory text.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
