Miles, Green, Miles,\nLipton, White & Fitz-Gibbon, John C. Sikorski, Dorothy Varon and\nRobinson Donovan, P.C. were on brief for defendant, appellee/cross-\nappellant City of Holyoke and defendants, appellees Daniel\nSzostkiewicz, Mark Cournoyer and Stephen Donoghue.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 13, 2005\n\f              Per Curiam.    In June 1998, Robert Wagner, a sergeant in\n\nthe Holyoke Police Department, brought suit against the City of\n\nHolyoke, its former mayor, two of its former police chiefs and\n\nothers for an alleged campaign of retaliation undertaken against\n\nhim   during    the   mid-1990s.       Wagner    claimed    that   he    had    been\n\nsubjected to disciplinary action, harassment and public humiliation\n\nbecause   he    had   disclosed    a   variety     of   information--including\n\nallegations of police misconduct--to newspapers and state and\n\nfederal agencies.       Wagner's initial complaint presented multiple\n\nstatutory and common law claims, but the only ones of relevance\n\nhere are those under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (2000), for violation of the\n\nfirst   and    fourteenth    amendments,     and    under   the    Massachusetts\n\nwhistleblower statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, ยง 185 (2002).\n\n              On motions for summary judgment, the district court\n\ngranted qualified immunity to the individual defendants on the\n\nsection 1983 claim and dismissed the whistleblower claim because\n\nWagner had failed to provide written notice to his supervisor\n\nbefore filing suit (as this court had previously interpreted the\n\nstatute to require).         On the section 1983 claim against Holyoke,\n\nthe court denied Wagner's motion for a partial directed verdict\n\nregarding particular incidents of speech that it had found worthy\n\nof    first   amendment     protection.      The    section   1983      claim    was\n\npresented to the jury on two alternative theories: that Wagner had\n\nsuffered an \"adverse employment action\" in retaliation for his\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fspeech, and that he had endured \"severe harassment\" for that\n\nspeech.    In June 2003, after a six-week trial, the jury found for\n\nthe city on the former theory; it found for Wagner on the latter,\n\nawarding nominal damages of one dollar.               The jury ruled for\n\ndefendants    on   Wagner's   remaining    claims,    none   of   which   are\n\npresently at issue.1\n\n             Wagner appeals, claiming that the district court erred in\n\ngranting     qualified   immunity   to    the   individual    section     1983\n\ndefendants, in denying his motion for a partial directed verdict,\n\nin dismissing his state whistleblower claim, in drafting various of\n\nits jury instructions, and in declining to grant a new trial on\n\ndamages for his \"severe harassment\" claim and in toto for his\n\n\"adverse   employment    action\"    claim.      The   city   cross-appeals,\n\nchallenging the district court's award of attorneys' fees and costs\n\nto Wagner.\n\n           Over the four years following his resignation as chief of\n\npolice in September 1994, Wagner (who remained on the force in a\n\nsubordinate capacity) received numerous suspensions and reprimands-\n\n-some allegedly in response to various disclosures and public\n\nstatements made by Wagner, but others for independent instances of\n\n\n     1\n      Wagner also sought a declaratory judgment that certain police\ndepartment regulations violated the Massachusetts Declaration of\nRights and the federal constitution. The district court initially\ngranted a preliminary injunction to Wagner on two of the challenged\nregulations; these regulations were ultimately rewritten by the\nHolyoke police department, mooting Wagner's challenge to their\nconstitutionality.\n\n                                    -4-\n\finsubordination or violations of departmental regulations.     The\n\ndistrict court found that Wagner had engaged in six categories of\n\nspeech that were provisionally protected under the first amendment,\n\nsee Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968), and that\n\nultimately formed the basis for his claims at trial: (1) statements\n\nin 1996 and 1997 to a city councilman regarding discrimination,\n\nworking conditions and illegal activity in the police department;\n\n(2) statements made to assist a fellow officer in filing formal\n\ncomplaints of discrimination; (3) statements to the state attorney\n\ngeneral's office regarding police corruption; (4) comments made to\n\na local reporter for a set of three articles in February 1997; (5)\n\na complaint to the Massachusetts Committee Against Discrimination,\n\nfiled by Wagner in May 1997, and a \"rebuttal\" filed by him in\n\nOctober of the same year; and (6) a written submission to the\n\nMassachusetts Labor Relations Commission in May 1998.\n\n          Wagner claims that the district court should have granted\n\na directed verdict on the disciplines he suffered that corresponded\n\nto the last three of these categories of speech.   He notes that a\n\nnumber of Holyoke officials testified that if he had not made these\n\nstatements or released various documents associated with them he\n\nwould not have been disciplined, and he argues that this fact--\n\ncoupled with the fact that the underlying speech was protected\n\nunder the first two prongs of Pickering--entitled him to a directed\n\nverdict in his favor on those claims.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f            These    incidents     of    Wagner's   speech,     however,    also\n\ninvolved the disclosure of confidential material protected by\n\ndepartmental regulations and Massachusetts law, as well as breaches\n\nof the police department's chain of command.                 At trial, Holyoke\n\nclaimed that it was Wagner's acts of unlawful disclosure and\n\ninsubordination that were the true grounds for disciplining him--or\n\nat least independent grounds that entitled the city to a defense\n\nunder Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).\n\n            Wagner attempts to undermine this argument by claiming\n\nthat the disclosures and disobedience were not \"independent\" acts\n\nthat could support disciplinary action, but were rather part and\n\nparcel of his speech. We disagree. While individuals are entitled\n\nto speak on matters of public concern free from the threat of\n\nretaliation    (at    least   if    their     speech    is    protected     under\n\nPickering), this does not entitle those same individuals to use\n\nwhatever methods or instrumentalities they see fit to convey their\n\nmessage.    If the use of such inappropriate means of expression--\n\nrather than the speech itself--prompts discipline, there is no\n\nfirst amendment violation.              This is the very essence both of\n\nPickering's third-prong inquiry into whether the protected speech\n\nwas   a   \"substantial   or   motivating      factor\"    behind    an     adverse\n\nemployment action, and of the Mount Healthy defense, which asks if\n\nthe plaintiff would have been disciplined even in the absence of\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fhis protected speech.   See O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 913\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1024 (1993).\n\n          The   documents   disclosed   by    Wagner    included   arrest\n\nreports, an internal affairs report concerning a fellow officer,\n\nand 20-year-old personnel documents.         His actions bypassed the\n\ndepartment's well-established chain of command.        These infractions\n\nmay or may not have been the true reasons (or independent reasons)\n\nfor Wagner's discipline at the hands of his superiors, but they\n\ncertainly could not be discounted to such an extent as to require\n\na directed verdict for Wagner.     Notwithstanding the snippets of\n\ntestimony Wagner points to that suggest that his discipline was\n\ndriven by his speech itself, the evidence was by no means enough to\n\nconclusively establish such causation--let alone preclude a defense\n\nunder Mount Healthy that Wagner would still have been disciplined,\n\nregardless of his speech, for other improprieties incidental to\n\nthat speech. The district court's denial of a directed verdict was\n\nnot error, nor (for the same reason) was its denial of Wagner's\n\nmotion for a new trial on his \"adverse employment action\" claim\n\nafter the jury had found against him.\n\n          Turning to the issue of qualified immunity, we agree with\n\nboth Wagner and the district court that, taking the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to Wagner, the disciplines he endured could\n\nhave made out a first amendment violation.             Nonetheless, as a\n\nshield to \"all but the plainly incompetent,\" Malley v. Briggs, 475\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fU.S. 335, 341 (1986), qualified immunity is meant to protect any\n\naction by a government official with a colorable argument for\n\nconstitutionality.       Such immunity can be overcome only if the\n\nconstitutional   right    at   issue   is   clearly   established     and   a\n\nreasonable official would have known that his actions violated that\n\nright.   See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\n\n           The general right invoked by Wagner--to engage in speech\n\non matters of public concern without retaliation--was clearly\n\nestablished prior to 1994.      But qualified immunity requires that\n\nthe general right be placed in a reasonably specific context; and\n\ngiven the facts surrounding Wagner's discipline, this is not a case\n\nin which reasonable officers, in light of clearly established law,\n\n\"must have known that [they were] acting unconstitutionally.\"\n\nDirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          To the contrary, Wagner's broad range of complaints (some\n\nconsisting of unprotected and antagonistic speech), coupled with\n\nhis disregard of confidentiality protocols and his disobedience in\n\nfollowing the department's chain of command, would have permitted\n\na reasonable superior officer to believe that he was entitled to\n\ndiscipline   Wagner   regardless   of    the   content   of    his   speech,\n\nconsistent with the protections of the first amendment.              Even if\n\nthis reasoning were mistaken, it would not have been egregiously so\n\nand, accordingly, qualified immunity is available.            See Ringuette\n\nv. City of Fall River, 146 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            Little need be said about Wagner's remaining claims of\n\nerror.      We    have   previously      interpreted      the    Massachusetts\n\nwhistleblower     statute   to     preclude   suits     filed    by    municipal\n\nemployees without prior written notice to their supervisors.                  See\n\nDirrane, 315 F.3d at 73.           Section 185(c)(2)(C) of the statute,\n\nwhich eliminates the notice requirement when disclosure is made to\n\nprovide evidence of a crime, is irrelevant:            Wagner makes no claim\n\nthat the disclosure at issue here--his filing of suit--was for the\n\npurpose of providing criminal intelligence, and Wagner admits that\n\nhe did not serve written notice on his supervisor before bringing\n\nsuit.    The reasoning of our prior decision in Dirrane, which is\n\nbinding on the panel, thus precludes Wagner's whistleblower claim.\n\n            Wagner's claims of error in the jury instructions also\n\nfail.     We perceive no error whatever in the district court's\n\ndefinition of \"adverse employment action.\"             Nor do we believe that\n\nits definition of \"severe harassment,\" if it was indeed error, was\n\nany more than harmless: there is no reasonable likelihood that the\n\njury,    having   awarded   only   one   dollar   to    Wagner   for    his   own\n\nemployment-related stress (supported by medical testimony), would\n\nhave given him more if the focus had been clearly broadened to\n\ncover family-related concerns.\n\n            We also see no manifest injustice or inconsistency in the\n\njury's award of nominal damages for Wagner's \"severe harassment\"\n\nclaim: we agree with the district court that it was a plausible\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\finterpretation of the evidence for the jury to find that Wagner had\n\nsuffered harassment sufficient to make out a first amendment claim,\n\nbut that his actual damages derived from such a claim (which were\n\ncontested at trial) were de minimis.           This is not a case in which\n\nundisputed evidence compelled a finding of substantial damages.\n\n              On cross-appeal, Holyoke seeks to vacate the district\n\ncourt's award of $72,840 in attorneys' fees and costs.              Where, as\n\nhere, a plaintiff has succeeded in his section 1983 claim--even if\n\nonly for nominal damages--he is a \"prevailing party\" under the\n\nrelevant statute, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 (2000), and may be entitled to\n\nsuch fees      as   the   district   court   finds   appropriate    given   the\n\nproportionate success he has achieved.               \"We review fee awards\n\ndeferentially, according substantial respect to the trial court's\n\ninformed discretion.         We will disturb such an award only for\n\nmistake of law or abuse of discretion.\"            Coutin v. Young & Rubicam\n\nP.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n              The district court ordinarily must provide reasons for\n\nits award and those reasons must be legally sound, see Coutin, 124\n\nF.3d at 337, but the court below fulfilled its duty in this regard.\n\nWagner may well have made a greater fee request than was merited\n\ngiven   his    limited    success    at   trial,   but   the   district   court\n\ncompensated for this excess and we do not believe its calculus was\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ferroneous--let alone so clearly erroneous as to constitute an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Wagner claimed that he had been subjected to disciplinary action, harassment and public humiliation because he had disclosed a variety of information &#8212; including allegations of police misconduct &#8212; to newspapers and state and federal agencies. Wagner's initial complaint presented multiple statutory and common law claims, but the only ones of relevance here are those under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), for violation of the first and fourteenth amendments, and under the Massachusetts whistleblower statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motions for summary judgment, the district court granted qualified immunity to the individual defendants on the section 1983 claim and dismissed the whistleblower claim because Wagner had failed to provide written notice to his supervisor before filing suit (as this court had previously interpreted the statute to require). On the section 1983 claim against Holyoke, the court denied Wagner's motion for a partial directed verdict regarding particular incidents of speech that it had found worthy of first amendment protection. The section 1983 claim was presented to the jury on two alternative theories: that Wagner had suffered an \"adverse employment action\" in retaliation for his speech, and that he had endured \"severe harassment\" for that speech. In June 2003, after a six-week trial, the jury found for the city on the former theory; it found for Wagner on the latter, awarding nominal damages of one dollar. The jury ruled for defendants on Wagner's remaining claims, none of which are presently at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner appeals, claiming that the district court erred in granting qualified immunity to the individual section 1983 defendants, in denying his motion for a partial directed verdict, in dismissing his state whistleblower claim, in drafting various of its jury instructions, and in declining to grant a new trial on damages for his \"severe harassment\" claim and <i>in toto</i> for his \"adverse employment action\" claim. The city cross-appeals, challenging the district court's award of attorneys' fees and costs to Wagner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the four years following his resignation as chief of police in September 1994, Wagner (who remained on the force in a subordinate capacity) received numerous suspensions and reprimands &#8212; some allegedly in response to various disclosures and public statements made by Wagner, but others for independent instances of insubordination or violations of departmental regulations. The district court found that Wagner had engaged in six categories of speech that were provisionally protected under the first amendment, <i>see Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), and that ultimately formed the basis for his claims at trial: (1) statements in 1996 and 1997 to a city councilman regarding discrimination, working conditions and illegal activity in the police department; (2) statements made to assist a fellow officer in filing formal complaints of discrimination; (3) statements to the state attorney general's office regarding police corruption; (4) comments made to a local reporter for a set of three articles in February 1997; (5) a complaint to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, filed by Wagner in May 1997, and a \"rebuttal\" filed by him in October of the same year; and (6) a written submission to the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission in May 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner claims that the district court should have granted a directed verdict on the disciplines he suffered that corresponded to the last three of these categories of speech. He notes that a number of Holyoke officials testified that if he had not made these statements or released various documents associated with them he would not have been disciplined, and he argues that this fact &#8212; coupled with the fact that the underlying speech was protected under the first two prongs of <i>Pickering</i> &#8212; entitled him to a directed verdict in his favor on those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These incidents of Wagner's speech, however, also involved the disclosure of confidential material protected by departmental regulations and Massachusetts law, as well as breaches of the police department's chain of command. At trial, Holyoke claimed that it was Wagner's acts of unlawful disclosure and insubordination that were the true grounds for disciplining him &#8212; or at least independent grounds that entitled the city to a defense under <i>Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner attempts to undermine this argument by claiming that the disclosures and disobedience were not \"independent\" acts that could support disciplinary action, but were rather part and parcel of his speech. We disagree. While individuals are entitled to speak on matters of public concern free from the threat of retaliation (at least if their speech is protected under <i>Pickering</i>), this does not entitle those same individuals to use whatever methods or instrumentalities they see fit to convey their message. If the use of such inappropriate means of expression &#8212; rather than the speech itself &#8212; prompts discipline, there is no first amendment violation. This is the very essence both of <i>Pickering's</i> third-prong inquiry into whether the protected speech was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" behind an adverse employment action, and of the <i>Mount Healthy</i> defense, which asks if the plaintiff would have been disciplined even in the absence of his protected speech. <i>See O'Connor v.

Wagner claimed that he had been subjected to disciplinary action, harassment and public humiliation because he had disclosed a variety of information &#8212; including allegations of police misconduct &#8212; to newspapers and state and federal agencies. Wagner's initial complaint presented multiple statutory and common law claims, but the only ones of relevance here are those under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), for violation of the first and fourteenth amendments, and under the Massachusetts whistleblower statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &#167; 185 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motions for summary judgment, the district court granted qualified immunity to the individual defendants on the section 1983 claim and dismissed the whistleblower claim because Wagner had failed to provide written notice to his supervisor before filing suit (as this court had previously interpreted the statute to require). On the section 1983 claim against Holyoke, the court denied Wagner's motion for a partial directed verdict regarding particular incidents of speech that it had found worthy of first amendment protection. The section 1983 claim was presented to the jury on two alternative theories: that Wagner had suffered an \"adverse employment action\" in retaliation for his speech, and that he had endured \"severe harassment\" for that speech. In June 2003, after a six-week trial, the jury found for the city on the former theory; it found for Wagner on the latter, awarding nominal damages of one dollar. The jury ruled for defendants on Wagner's remaining claims, none of which are presently at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner appeals, claiming that the district court erred in granting qualified immunity to the individual section 1983 defendants, in denying his motion for a partial directed verdict, in dismissing his state whistleblower claim, in drafting various of its jury instructions, and in declining to grant a new trial on damages for his \"severe harassment\" claim and <i>in toto</i> for his \"adverse employment action\" claim. The city cross-appeals, challenging the district court's award of attorneys' fees and costs to Wagner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the four years following his resignation as chief of police in September 1994, Wagner (who remained on the force in a subordinate capacity) received numerous suspensions and reprimands &#8212; some allegedly in response to various disclosures and public statements made by Wagner, but others for independent instances of insubordination or violations of departmental regulations. The district court found that Wagner had engaged in six categories of speech that were provisionally protected under the first amendment, <i>see Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1968), and that ultimately formed the basis for his claims at trial: (1) statements in 1996 and 1997 to a city councilman regarding discrimination, working conditions and illegal activity in the police department; (2) statements made to assist a fellow officer in filing formal complaints of discrimination; (3) statements to the state attorney general's office regarding police corruption; (4) comments made to a local reporter for a set of three articles in February 1997; (5) a complaint to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, filed by Wagner in May 1997, and a \"rebuttal\" filed by him in October of the same year; and (6) a written submission to the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission in May 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner claims that the district court should have granted a directed verdict on the disciplines he suffered that corresponded to the last three of these categories of speech. He notes that a number of Holyoke officials testified that if he had not made these statements or released various documents associated with them he would not have been disciplined, and he argues that this fact &#8212; coupled with the fact that the underlying speech was protected under the first two prongs of <i>Pickering</i> &#8212; entitled him to a directed verdict in his favor on those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These incidents of Wagner's speech, however, also involved the disclosure of confidential material protected by departmental regulations and Massachusetts law, as well as breaches of the police department's chain of command. At trial, Holyoke claimed that it was Wagner's acts of unlawful disclosure and insubordination that were the true grounds for disciplining him &#8212; or at least independent grounds that entitled the city to a defense under <i>Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We disagree. While individuals are entitled to speak on matters of public concern free from the threat of retaliation (at least if their speech is protected under <i>Pickering</i>), this does not entitle those same individuals to use whatever methods or instrumentalities they see fit to convey their message. If the use of such inappropriate means of expression &#8212; rather than the speech itself &#8212; prompts discipline, there is no first amendment violation. This is the very essence both of <i>Pickering's</i> third-prong inquiry into whether the protected speech was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" behind an adverse employment action, and of the <i>Mount Healthy</i> defense, which asks if the plaintiff would have been disciplined even in the absence of his protected speech. <i>See O'Connor v. Steeves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608078\"><a href=\"/opinion/608078/patrick-j-oconnor-v-robert-w-steeves/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span>, 913 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
