The federal courts now routinely\n\nhear cases brought under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by\n\nthose who wish to construct cellular antenna towers and have been\n\ndenied permission to do so by local town officials.       Here, the\n\nZoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Plainville, Massachusetts\n\ndenied the needed zoning permits and variances to National Tower\n\nand Omnipoint Communications (collectively \"Omnipoint\").\n\n          Omnipoint sued under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which\n\nprovides a federal cause of action to a person adversely affected\n\nby a state or local decision that violates the 1996 Act.    It also\nraised claims under state law and under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.       The\n\ndistrict court found that defendants had violated the Act, and\ngranted Omnipoint partial1 summary judgment.    Nat'l Tower, LLC v.\n\nFrey, 164 F. Supp. 2d 185 (D. Mass. 2001).      The court concluded\n\nthat the actions of the board effectively prohibited the provision\nof seamless wireless service in Plainville in violation of 47\nU.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II).      As a remedy, the court ordered\n\nissuance of the variances and permit.    We affirm.\n                                  I.\n          Because the district court granted summary judgment, we\n\nreview the facts taking all inferences in the light most favorable\nto the board.   Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 2002).      The material facts as set forth in the\n\n\n     1\n          Although the district court's order granted only partial\nsummary judgment, this court determined on December 14, 2001, that\nthe judgment was effectively final, and therefore permitted this\nappeal to proceed.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdistrict court's opinion are essentially undisputed, and so we\n\nadopt them and add some others from the record.                        The parties do,\n\nhowever, dispute the inferences to be drawn from those facts.\n           In     June    2000,       Omnipoint    applied       to    the   board    for\n\nvariances from the dimensional by-laws (prohibiting both multiple\n\nuses on one lot and structures over two stories) and from the by-\nlaw prohibiting radio transmission use.                 Omnipoint needed these\n\nvariances in order to erect a 170-foot-tall \"lattice\" transmission\n\ntower on approximately 5000 square feet of a two-and-one-half-acre\n\nparcel at 75 Washington Street in Plainville.                          The site abuts\n\nproperty owned by the New England Power Company, which contains\n\nelectric transmission lines and poles and is developed for public\n\nutility use.\n           Omnipoint’s objective was to close a two-mile (non-\n\ncontiguous) gap in its cellular coverage along the heavily traveled\n\nhighway Routes 1 and 106.              In the vicinity of the coverage gap,\napproximately 17,000 vehicles travel daily along Route 1 and 10,000\n\nalong Route 106.         Because of the gap in coverage, a cellular user\n\neither cannot      connect       or    cannot    maintain    a    connection.         The\n\nproposed   site    lies     in    a    General    Commercial          District   (a   \"CB\n\nDistrict\"), and is partially covered by a Watershed Protection\n\nOverlay District.          Under the town by-law, a radio tower is a\n\nprohibited use in a CB District and requires a special permit in a\n\nWatershed Protection District. Plainville, Mass. Zoning By-law ch.\n\nIII, § 2.8 (1999).        Moreover, a structure in a CB District may not\n\nexceed two stories in height.              An engineer working for Omnipoint\n\n                                          -3-\n\ftestified, and the board does not dispute, that a two-story tower\n\nin compliance with the by-law would not close the gap.            The board\n\nmay, however, grant both use and dimensional variances for reasons\nconsistent with the state zoning law.         See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A,\n\n§§ 10, 14 (2000).      Similarly, the board may grant a special use\n\npermit in a Watershed Protection District so long as it makes\ncertain findings, primarily that there will be no adverse impact on\n\nthe watershed as a result.     By-law ch. III, § 3.12.5.\n\n             Omnipoint conducted computer simulations and drive tests\n\nto identify possible sites for a tower to rectify the break in its\n\ncoverage. An investigation of the sites thus identified led to the\n\nselection of the disputed site.       All other possible sites were in\n\nthe same general area and therefore subject to the same zoning\nrestrictions.2    This evidence was submitted to the board, primarily\n\nthrough   Omnipoint’s   application     for    the   use   and   dimensional\n\nvariances.    In its initial application Omnipoint characterized its\ntower as a wireless communications facility.          It sought the needed\n\npermits and variances, which the by-law permitted the town to\n\ngrant.    See By-law ch. III, § 1.4.3.\n\n             The board published the requisite notice in a local\n\nnewspaper, characterizing the application as being for a \"radio\n\ntower.\"   It held a hearing to consider the application on July 18.\n\nMidway through the hearing, the board determined that it had been\n\nmistaken in publishing notice of a proposed siting of a \"radio\n\n\n     2\n          The record does not make clear whether the other\npotential sites were within the Watershed Protection District.\n\n                                  -4-\n\ftower\" on the site.        The board voted to suspend the hearing and\n\nreadvertise the tower as a \"public utility\" (a permitted use in a\n\nCB District).   The hearing resumed on September 26, with Omnipoint\npressing its case for a dimensional variance.             Omnipoint presented\n\nevidence of the coverage gap and evidence that it said showed there\n\nwere no other suitable sites. The board at the hearing articulated\nno objections to the application, although several owners of\n\nabutting property did object.\n\n          Meanwhile,       on    August    24,    2000,   Omnipoint     filed   an\n\napplication for a special watershed permit.               The hearing on this\n\napplication was held on October 3, 2000.            As at the hearing on the\n\napplication    for   the   dimensional        variance,   the   board    gave   no\n\nindication that it might not grant the permit.\n          On    October    17,    the     board   unanimously   rejected    both\n\napplications.    The board sent Omnipoint two letters dated October\n\n27 explaining its decision.         As to the request for the variances,\nthe first letter stated:\n\n          In denying the variances, the Board found that in a CB\n          Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not\n          a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted\n          by special permit and that a use variance, which would be\n          required for the construction of such is not permitted\n          under the Zoning By-Law.     In this respect, the Board\n          notes that Chapter 40A, Section 10 of the General Laws,\n          provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n                     \"Except where local ordinances or by-laws shall\n                     expressly permit variances for use, no variance\n                     may authorize a use or activity not otherwise\n                     permitted in the district in which the land or\n                     structure is located.\"\n\n          The Zoning By-Law makes no provision for use variances.\n          As the basis for its denial of the variances is that it\n          has no legal authority to grant them, the Board made no\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            further findings with respect to other objections made to\n            the construction of such facility, particularly as to\n            whether there exists any other location in the Town where\n            such construction is permitted under the Zoning By-Law.\n\nThe reasons given in the second letter for the rejection of the\n\nwatershed permit were as terse:\n            On this date, the Board denied the variances requested by\n            the applicant on the grounds that in the underlying CB\n            Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not\n            a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted\n            by special permit and that a use variance, which would be\n            required for the construction of such facility, is not\n            permitted under the Zoning By-Law. The construction of\n            a wireless communications facility is clearly not\n            permitted in the underlying CB Zoning District.\n            Accordingly, it is not permitted by special permit in the\n            overlay Watershed Protection District as the proposed use\n            must meet the zoning requirements of both the underlying\n            district and the overlay district.\nThis lawsuit, and appeal, followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             The board appeals the order against it, making three\narguments.         It   says   the   district    court     erred   in   granting\n\nOmnipoint’s motion for partial summary judgment on the facts in\n\nthis case because, first, the board’s decisions do not prohibit or\n\nhave the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services\n\nin   the   town;   second,     the   board’s   decisions    are    supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence in a written record; and, third, the board’s\n\ndecisions do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of\n\nfunctionally equivalent services.\n\n             We reach only the first two of these arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fA.    General Standards\n\n               The Telecommunications Act is an exercise in cooperative\n\nfederalism      and    represents   a   dramatic   shift    in    the   nature   of\ntelecommunications regulation. See generally Cablevision of Boston\n\nv. Pub. Improvement Comm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 97-100 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThe Act attempts, subject to five limitations, to preserve state\nand    local    authority    over    the   placement     and     construction    of\n\nfacilities.       47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(A)-(B) (1994 & Supp. II 1996);\n\nTown of Amherst, N.H. v. Omnipoint Communications Enters., 173 F.3d\n\n9, 12 (1st Cir. 1999).        Several of those limiting provisions apply\n\nto this case.\n\n               The first relevant limitation, set forth in subsection\n\n(B)(i), provides that in regulating the placement and construction\nof facilities, a state or local government or instrumentality\n\n\"shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision\n\nof personal wireless services.\"            47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II).\nIt is undisputed that in this case there is a significant coverage\n\ngap.    The argument that no tower is needed is unavailable to the\n\ntown.    Several courts have held that local zoning decisions and\n\nordinances that prevent the closing of significant gaps in the\n\navailability      of    wireless    services   violate     the    statute.       See\n\nCellular Tel. Co. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 197 F.3d 64, 68-70\n\n(3d Cir. 1999); Sprint Spectrum L.P. v. Willoth, 176 F.3d 630, 643\n\n(2d Cir. 1999); Omnipoint Communications MB Operations, LLC v. Town\n\nof Lincoln, 107 F. Supp. 2d 108, 117 (D. Mass. 2000).                     Finding\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\ftheir reasoning persuasive, we now join their number and will\n\nanalyze Omnipoint's claim with that standard in mind.\n\n            The second limitation requires the local government to\n\"act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or\n\nmodify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable\n\nperiod of time after the request is duly filed . . . taking into\naccount   the   nature    and     scope   of   such    request.\"        47   U.S.C.\n\n§ 332(c)(7)(B)(ii).       Similarly, a reviewing court must hear and\n\ndecide the action \"on an expedited basis.\"              Id. § 332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n\nThe third states that the denial of a request must be in writing\n\nand supported by substantial evidence contained in a written\n\nrecord.     Id. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii).        The fourth authorizes judicial\n\nreview of either final action or a failure to act by the local\ngovernment that is inconsistent with statutory requirements and\n\nlimitations.       Id. § 332(c)(7)(B)(v).3\n\n            There is tension between two objectives of the Act: the\nobjective    \"to     facilitate    nationally     the    growth    of    wireless\n\ntelephone service,\" and the objective \"to maintain substantial\nlocal control over siting of towers\"; this and other courts have\n\nattempted to achieve the proper balance.              Amherst, 173 F.3d at 13.\n\nThe principles announced in our opinions provide guidance as to\n\nthat balance.      The first limitation -- that a town may not through\n\nits decisions have \"the effect of prohibiting\" wireless service --\n\n\n     3\n          Another provision prohibits unreasonable discrimination\namong providers of functionally equivalent services.          Id.\n§   332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I).      Although  Omnipoint    alleges  such\ndiscrimination, we do not need to reach this issue.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fraises the question whether the statute refers only to a blanket\n\nban or whether it may, depending on the facts, encompass individual\n\napplication decisions.     This court has resolved that question and\nread the statute to encompass individual decisions:\n\n             [o]bviously, an individual denial is not automatically a\n             forbidden prohibition violating the \"effects\" provision.\n             But neither can we rule out the possibility that -- based\n             on language or circumstances -- some individual decisions\n             could be shown to reflect, or represent, an effective\n             prohibition on personal wireless service.\n\nId. at 14.     The effective prohibition clause can be violated even\n\nif   substantial   evidence     exists    to   support   the   denial   of   an\n\nindividual permit under the terms of the town's ordinances.                  The\n\nburden is on the proponent of the tower to show \"that further\nreasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste\n\nof time even to try.\"     Id.\n\n             Similarly, this court has resolved the tension between\nthe recognition that local authorities are frequently lay member\n\nboards without many resources and the recognition that the Act\n\nprovides for judicial review based on a written decision, supported\n\nby \"substantial evidence\" in a \"written record.\"                 The balance\nstruck is that we do not require formal findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law in a board's written decision.                Nor need a\n\nboard's written decision state every fact in the record that\n\nsupports its decision.    S.W. Bell Mobile Sys. v. Todd, 244 F.3d 51,\n\n59-60 (1st Cir. 2001).          By the same token, the board, in its\n\ndecision, may not hide the ball.          Its written denial must contain\n\na sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial \"to allow a\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\freviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting\n\nthose reasons.\"    Id. at 60.\n\n          We now make explicit another aspect of judicial review of\nlocal decisions.    A board may not provide the applicant with one\n\nreason for a denial and then, in court, seek to uphold its decision\n\non different grounds.       That result follows not only from the\nrequirement that the decision provide an adequate explanation to\n\nsupport judicial review, but also from the background understanding\n\nof the model of judicial review of administrative actions against\n\nwhich the Act was enacted.      See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, at 208\n\n(1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124, 223 (\"The phrase\n\n'substantial    evidence   contained    in    a   written   record'    is   the\n\ntraditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.\").\nThat model customarily prohibits a court from affirming an agency\n\non grounds other than those the agency gave in its decision.                FEC\n\nv. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S.\n\nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983); SEC v.\n\nChenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943) (\"If an order is valid only\n\nas a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is\n\nauthorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment\n\ncannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\").\n\n          The    analogy   of   a   local    zoning   board   to   a   federal\n\nadministrative agency for judicial review purposes has its limits,\n\nhowever. When a federal court refuses to uphold a federal agency's\n\ndecision based on reasons the agency has advanced only after the\n\nfact, the court will ordinarily remand to the agency for further\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\faction.   If the agency chooses, it may then reach the same result\n\nand defend it with new reasons.      See Akins, 524 U.S. at 25 (noting\n\nthat a reviewing court unsatisfied with the reasons given for an\nagency's decision \"will set aside the agency's action and remand\n\nthe case -- even though the agency . . . might later, in the\n\nexercise of its lawful discretion, reach the same result for a\ndifferent reason\").      Courts remand to agencies in such cases\n\nbecause, among other reasons, Congress has committed to the agency\n\nthe task of policymaking where the governing statute is not clear.\n\nSee Chenery, 318 U.S. at 88 (\"For purposes of affirming no less\n\nthan reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon\n\nthe   domain   which   Congress   has     exclusively    entrusted   to   an\n\nadministrative agency.\").\n           Although Congress in the Telecommunications Act left\n\nintact some of local zoning boards' authority under state law, we\n\ndo not think it meant to provide for them as much deference as a\nfederal   agency   receives,   nor   to    give   them   new   policymaking\n\nauthority under the Act. The statutory requirements that the board\n\nact within \"a reasonable period of time,\" and that the reviewing\n\ncourt hear and decide the action \"on an expedited basis,\" indicate\n\nthat Congress did not intend multiple rounds of decisions and\n\nlitigation, in which a court rejects one reason and then gives the\n\nboard the opportunity, if it chooses, to proffer another. Instead,\n\nin the majority of cases the proper remedy for a zoning board\n\ndecision that violates the Act will be an order, like the one the\n\ndistrict court issued in this case, instructing the board to\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fauthorize construction. See Brehmer v. Planning Bd., 238 F.3d 117,\n\n120-22 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing and approving decisions by the\n\nmajority   of    district     courts     granting       injunctive    relief     in\n\nTelecommunications Act cases); Cellular Tel. Co. v. Town of Oyster\n\nBay, 166 F.3d 490, 497 (2d Cir. 1999) (same).\n\n           In short, a board’s decision may not present a moving\n\ntarget and a board will not ordinarily receive a second chance.                  In\n\naddition   to    preventing   undue     delay,     this    approach    gives     the\n\napplicant a fair chance to respond to the board’s reasons, and\n\nperhaps satisfy the board, without first having, literally, to make\na federal case out of the dispute.              Thus, we will not uphold a\n\nboard's denial of a permit on grounds that it did not present in\nits   written    decision.      As     we     discuss     later,   however,      the\nappropriate     remedy   in   that     situation    may     not    always   be    an\n\ninjunction, but may sometimes be a remand, depending on the nature\nof the board's decision and the circumstances of the case.\n           Apart from its instructions to local zoning authorities,\n\nCongress has also specified the terms of judicial review.                     These\nterms themselves amount to an allocation of decisional authority\nbetween the local boards and the federal courts.               The standards by\n\nwhich district courts, and this court, review state and local\ndecisions under the Act are not unitary.                The scope of judicial\nreview depends on the nature of the issue presented and the\n\nstatutory limitation involved.\n           The      anti-prohibition,            anti-discrimination,            and\n\nunreasonable delay provisions, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(i)-(ii),\n\n                                       -12-\n\fpresent questions that a federal district court determines in the\n\nfirst instance without any deference to the board.     Any or all of\n\nthese questions may well require evidence to be presented in court\nthat is outside of the administrative record compiled by the local\n\nauthority.     Amherst, 173 F.3d at 16 n.7.    If the district court\n\nthen grants summary judgment, our review of the grant is de novo as\nwell. Id. at 15.     If the district court makes evidentiary findings\n\non such claims that go beyond the administrative record, then we\n\nwill review its factual findings for clear error and its legal\n\nconclusions de novo.\n\n           By contrast, where judicial review is on the issue of\n\nwhether the board’s written decision is supported by substantial\n\nevidence in the record, then judicial review is confined to the\nadministrative record, absent a claim of procedural irregularity.\n\nThe board, then, not the court, is the focus of the decisionmaking\n\nprocess.     In this inquiry, the substantial evidence standard of\nreview for the district court is the same that the courts have\n\napplied in certain reviews of administrative action.      S.W. Bell,\n\n244 F.3d at 58-59.    \"Substantial evidence\" review is that standard\n\narticulated in Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474 (1951),\n\nand applied in Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. FAA, 164 F.3d 713 (1st\n\nCir. 1999):\n\n             Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a\n             reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n             conclusion.\" The reviewing court must take into account\n             contradictory evidence in the record.          But \"the\n             possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from\n             the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's\n             finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\"\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fId. at 718 (quoting Universal Camera, 340 U.S. at 477, and Am.\n\nTextile   Mfrs.

S.W. Bell, 244 F.3d at 59.\n\nB.   Application of the Standards\n\n           We start with the board’s reasons for its denial, quoted\n\nverbatim earlier. It is difficult to know precisely what the board\n\nmeant by its legal jargon and its apparently purposeful obscurity.\nThe board says that it did not grant the dimensional variances\n\nbecause it lacked the legal authority to do so, and that it denied\nthe watershed permit because it denied the variances.                The board\n\nspecifically refused to make findings as to any other objections,\n\nor to make a finding on whether there exists any other location\n\nwhere such construction would be permitted under the by-law.                  The\n\nboard did not say anything about the tower’s status as a public\n\nutility or as a radio tower.       Instead, as we understand the order,\n\nthe board ruled that its by-laws did not allow for wireless\n\ncommunications facilities in CB districts either as a matter of\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fright or a use permitted by a special permit.     Citing Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 40A, § 10, therefore, the board said it lacked the power\n\nto authorize the use because the by-law did not expressly permit\nvariances for wireless communications facilities.\n\n          Consulting the by-law, however, we find that it does\n\nstate that a radio tower is not permitted in a CB district, even by\nspecial permit, but that a public utility is permitted in such a\n\ndistrict with a special permit.   By-law ch. III, § 2.8.    Viewing\n\nthe board's actions in the best light possible, then, it is\n\npossible that when it said \"wireless communications facility\" in\n\nthe October 27 letters, it meant \"radio tower.\"   Perhaps the board\n\nmeant to revisit its July 18 decision (which had recharacterized\n\nthe application as for a public utility rather than as for a radio\ntower) and to re-recharacterize the application as for a radio\n\ntower rather than as for a public utility.   That is the explanation\n\npresented by counsel for the board, who suggests that the district\ncourt must resolve whether Omnipoint's tower would be a radio tower\n\nor a public utility, and that this is a genuinely disputed issue of\n\nmaterial fact that precludes summary judgment for Omnipoint at\n\nthis time.\n\n          There are two obvious problems with this position: one\n\nfactual and one legal.   The factual problem is that the board did\n\nnot say this (perhaps it was too embarrassing a position to take)\n\nand it was the board that told Omnipoint it would republish the\n\napplication as a public utility application rather than as a radio\n\ntower application.   As Omnipoint says, the board’s position means\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fit would be left without any alternative.                  Omnipoint has tried its\n\napplication both ways -- as a radio tower and as a public utility\n\n-- and it was blocked each time.               The legal problem is that this is\nexactly the sort of behavior by a board that demonstrates that it\n\nwould effectively prohibit the provision of gap-covering wireless\n\nservices.         Setting out criteria under the zoning law that no one\ncould      ever    meet   is    an   example     of   an   effective    prohibition.\n\nAmherst, 173 F.3d at 14.             The Telecommunications Act preempts such\n\nby-law strictures.              Accordingly, it no longer matters to our\n\ninquiry      under    the      Telecommunications      Act   whether     Omnipoint's\n\nproposed tower is a radio tower or a public utility under the by-\n\nlaw.       Neither classification will save the board's decision.\n\n               Counsel for the board then offers a different rationale:\nthat Omnipoint failed to satisfy the board that there were no\n\nbetter alternative locations.              A single denial of an application\n\nbased on a supportable finding that another location was available\nwould almost certainly fall short of an effective prohibition of\n\nwireless services.          If the board had in fact made such a finding,\n\nit might also be difficult for us to say that the board’s decision\n\nto deny was unsupported by substantial evidence.4                      But the board\n\n       4\n          Engineer Elijah Luutu, Omnipoint’s expert, said that he\nwas unaware of any other feasible location, but used very qualified\nlanguage:\n\n               I am informed and believe that for reasons such as the\n               inability to obtain a lease or zoning compliance, among\n               others, there are no other feasible sites within or\n               without the Town of Plainville which would allow\n               Voicestream to provide complete service along Routes 1\n               and 106.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fdid not take that position in its decision.    Instead, it chose as\n\nits ground that it had no legal power to authorize a wireless\n\ncommunication tower anywhere in the CB district, regardless of the\nexistence of any alternative site.    We judge its decision on those\n\nterms.\n\n          The district court appears to have considered the lack of\nevidence from the board5 about other alternative sites as evidence\n\nthat further application to the board was futile. On the \"effective\n\nprohibition\" issue, district courts may take evidence beyond the\n\nrecord.   Still, even in that context, it is problematic whether\n\ncourts should rely on the board’s failure to come forward with such\n\nevidence in court.   We doubt that Congress intended local zoning\n\nboards to pay for experts to prove that there are alternative sites\nfor a proposed tower, simply to defend themselves from an easily\n\nmade accusation in court that an individual denial of a permit\n\namounts to an effective prohibition.   See S.W. Bell, 244 F.3d at 63\n\n(\"For a telecommunications provider to argue that a permit denial\n\nis impermissible because there are no alternative sites, it must\ndevelop a record demonstrating that it has made a full effort to\n\n\nThe board might well have been justified in finding insufficient an\nassertion based on information and belief. Such a qualification\nwould make Luutu's statement inadmissible, for example, to support\nsummary judgment in federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n     5\n          Where the question is one of substantial evidence,\njudicial review is based on the written record before the board and\nthere would be no basis to require evidence from the board. The\nTelecommunications Act firmly keeps initial responsibility for the\ndecision with the board and limits judicial review. It does not\nprovide for a new trial before the district court of issues\ninitially committed to boards, such as whether there are\nalternative feasible sites.\n\n                               -17-\n\fevaluate the other available alternatives and that the alternatives\n\nare not feasible to serve its customers.\").                    The board gets no\n\ncomfort from this, however.              It expressly refused to decide the\nadequacy of Omnipoint’s evidence about the lack of alternative\n\nsites.    As we have discussed earlier, we will not uphold a board’s\n\ndecision on grounds that were not stated to the applicant.\n              Since the board's order cannot be upheld on the grounds\n\nit    stated,    the       question   becomes   one   of    what    should     be   the\n\nappropriate remedy: remand to the board, or affirmance of the\n\ninjunction.          While we can conceive of circumstances in which a\n\nremand may be in order -- for example, an instance of good faith\n\nconfusion by a board that has acted quite promptly -- this case is\n\nnot a candidate for remand to the board.\n              Like the district court, we think the only fair inference\n\nfrom the board’s words and actions in this case is that whether or\n\nnot   there     is    a    coverage   gap,   and    whether    or    not    there   are\nalternative sites that could fill that coverage gap, the board is\n\nnot prepared to permit construction on Omnipoint's chosen site.                      As\n\na result, any further reasonable efforts by Omnipoint are so likely\n\nto be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.                      Thus, the\n\nrecord   compels          the   conclusion   that   the    board    has    effectively\n\nprohibited the provision of wireless services in violation of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fAct.6       That    justifies   the   remedial   order   entered   by   the\n\ndistrict court.7\n\n                                      III.\n            For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court\n\nis affirmed.       Costs are awarded against the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           As the district court noted, there is no question in this\ncase of a potential inconsistency between the need to protect\nsensitive historical or environmental sites and the \"no alternative\nsite\" theory of effective prohibition. Nat'l Tower, 164 F. Supp.\n2d at 188 n.2. Although the site is technically within a Watershed\nProtection District, at no stage of the proceedings has the board\ninvoked any substantive environmental concerns.      We reserve the\nquestion of the proper analysis were such a conflict present.\n        7\n          The district court ordered the board \"to issue within\nthirty (30) days of this Order the dimensional and use variances\nand special permit necessary for the construction of plaintiffs'\n170 foot lattice tower and maintenance facility on the locus at 75\nWashington Street in Plainville.\" Nat'l Tower, 164 F.

It also raised claims under state law and under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. The district court found that defendants had violated the Act, and granted Omnipoint partial<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> summary judgment. <i>Nat'l Tower, LLC v. Frey,</i> 164 F.Supp.2d 185 (D.Mass.2001). The court concluded that the actions of the board effectively prohibited the provision of seamless wireless service in Plainville in violation of 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II). As a remedy, the court ordered issuance of the variances and permit.

The material facts as set forth in the district court's opinion are essentially undisputed, and so we adopt them and add some others from the record. The parties do, however, dispute the inferences to be drawn from those facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2000, Omnipoint applied to the board for variances from the dimensional by-laws (prohibiting both multiple uses on one lot and structures over two stories) and from the by-law prohibiting radio transmission use. Omnipoint needed these variances in order to erect a 170-foot-tall \"lattice\" transmission tower on approximately 5000 square feet of a two-and-one-half-acre parcel at 75 Washington Street in Plainville. The site abuts property owned by the New England Power Company, which contains electric transmission lines and poles and is developed for public utility use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Omnipoint's objective was to close a two-mile (non-contiguous) gap in its cellular coverage along the heavily traveled highway Routes 1 and 106. In the vicinity of the coverage gap, approximately 17,000 vehicles travel daily along Route 1 and 10,000 along Route 106. Because of the gap in coverage, a cellular user either cannot connect or cannot maintain a connection. The proposed site lies in a General Commercial District (a \"CB District\"), and is partially covered by a Watershed Protection Overlay District. Under the town by-law, a radio tower is a prohibited use in a CB District and requires a special permit in a Watershed Protection District. Plainville, Mass. Zoning By-law ch. III, &#167; 2.8 (1999). Moreover, a structure in a CB District may not exceed two stories in height. An engineer working for Omnipoint testified, and the board does not dispute, that a two-story tower in compliance with the by-law would not close the gap. The board may, however, grant both use and dimensional variances for reasons consistent with the state zoning law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167;&#167; 10, 14 (2000). Similarly, the board may grant a special use permit in a Watershed Protection District so long as it makes certain findings, primarily that there will be no adverse impact on the watershed as a result. By-law ch. III, &#167; 3.12.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Omnipoint conducted computer simulations and drive tests to identify possible sites for a tower to rectify the break in its coverage. An investigation of the sites thus identified led to the selection of the disputed site. All other possible sites were in the same general area and therefore subject to the same zoning restrictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This evidence was submitted to the board, primarily through Omnipoint's application for the use and dimensional variances. In its initial application Omnipoint characterized its tower as a wireless communications facility. It sought the needed permits and variances, which the by-law permitted the town to grant. <i>See</i> By-law ch. III, &#167; 1.4.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The board published the requisite notice in a local newspaper, characterizing the application as being for a \"radio tower.\" It held a hearing to consider the application on July 18. Midway through the hearing, the board determined that it had been mistaken in publishing notice of a proposed siting of a \"radio tower\" on the site. The board voted to suspend the hearing and readvertise the tower as a \"public utility\" (a permitted use in a CB District). The hearing resumed on September 26, with Omnipoint pressing its case for a dimensional variance. Omnipoint presented evidence of the coverage gap and evidence that it said showed there were no other suitable sites. The board at the hearing articulated no objections to the application, although several owners of abutting property did object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on August 24, 2000, Omnipoint filed an application for a special watershed permit. The hearing on this application was held on October 3, 2000. As at the hearing on the application for the dimensional variance, the board gave no indication that it might not grant the permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, the board unanimously rejected both applications. The board sent Omnipoint two letters dated October 27 explaining its decision. As to the request for the variances, the first letter stated: In denying the variances, the Board found that in a CB Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance, which would be required for the construction of such is not permitted under the Zoning By-Law. In this respect, the Board notes that Chapter 40A, Section 10 of the General Laws, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Except where local ordinances or by-laws shall expressly permit variances for use, no variance may authorize a use or activity not otherwise permitted in the district in which the land or structure is located.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zoning By-Law makes no provision for use variances. As the basis for its denial of the variances is that it has no legal authority to grant them, the Board made no further findings with respect to other objections made to the construction of such facility, particularly as to whether there exists any other location in the Town where such construction is permitted under the Zoning By-Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons given in the second letter for the rejection of the watershed permit were as terse:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this date, the Board denied the variances requested by the applicant on the grounds that in the underlying CB Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance, which would be required for the construction of such facility, is not permitted under the Zoning By-Law. The construction of a wireless communications facility is clearly not permitted in the underlying CB Zoning District. Accordingly, it is not permitted by special permit in the overlay Watershed Protection District as the proposed use must meet the zoning requirements of both the underlying district and the overlay district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit, and appeal, followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The board appeals the order against it, making three arguments.

It is undisputed that in this case there is a significant coverage gap. The argument that no tower is needed is unavailable to the town. Several courts have held that local zoning decisions and ordinances that prevent the closing of significant gaps in the availability of wireless services violate the statute. <i>See Cellular Tel. Co. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment,</i> 197 F.3d 64, 68-70 (3d Cir.1999); <i>Sprint Spectrum L.P. v. Willoth,</i> 176 F.3d 630, 643 (2d Cir.1999); <i>Omnipoint Communications MB Operations, LLC v. Town of Lincoln,</i> 107 F.Supp.2d 108, 117 (D.Mass.2000).

Similarly, a reviewing court must hear and decide the action \"on an expedited basis.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The third states that the denial of a request must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The fourth authorizes judicial review of either final action or a failure to act by the local government that is inconsistent with statutory requirements and limitations. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is tension between two objectives of the Act: the objective \"to facilitate nationally the growth of wireless telephone service,\" and the objective \"to maintain substantial local control over siting of towers\"; this and other courts have attempted to achieve the proper balance. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 13. The principles announced in our opinions provide guidance as to that balance. The first limitation &#8212; that a town may not through its decisions have \"the effect of prohibiting\" wireless service &#8212; raises the question whether the statute refers only to a blanket ban or whether it may, depending on the facts, encompass individual application decisions. This court has resolved that question and read the statute to encompass individual decisions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]bviously, an individual denial is not automatically a forbidden prohibition violating the \"effects\" provision. But neither can we rule out the possibility that &#8212; based on language or circumstances &#8212; some individual decisions could be shown to reflect, or represent, an effective prohibition on personal wireless service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 14. The effective prohibition clause can be violated even if substantial evidence exists to support the denial of an individual permit under the terms of the town's ordinances. The burden is on the proponent of the tower to show \"that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, this court has resolved the tension between the recognition that local authorities are frequently lay member boards without many resources and the recognition that the Act provides for judicial review based on a written decision, supported by \"substantial evidence\" in a \"written record.\" The balance struck is that we do not require formal findings of fact or conclusions of law in a board's written decision. Nor need a board's written decision state every fact in the record that supports its decision. <i>S.W. Bell Mobile Sys. v. Todd,</i> 244 F.3d 51, 59-60 (1st Cir.2001). By the same token, the board, in its decision, may not hide the ball. Its written denial must contain a sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial \"to allow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting those reasons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now make explicit another aspect of judicial review of local decisions. A board may not provide the applicant with one reason for a denial and then, in court, seek to uphold its decision on different grounds. That result follows not only from the requirement that the decision provide an adequate explanation to support judicial review, but also from the background understanding of the model of judicial review of administrative actions against which the Act was enacted. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, at 208 (1996), <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124, 223 (\"The phrase `substantial evidence contained in a written record' is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.\"). That model customarily prohibits a court from affirming an agency on grounds other than those the agency gave in its decision. <i>FEC v. Akins,</i> 524 U.S. 11, 25, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998); <i>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (\"If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analogy of a local zoning board to a federal administrative agency for judicial review purposes has its limits, however. When a federal court refuses to uphold a federal agency's decision based on reasons the agency has advanced only after the fact, the court will ordinarily remand to the agency for further action. If the agency chooses, it may then reach the same result and defend it with new reasons. <i>See Akins,</i> 524 U.S. at 25, 118 S.Ct. 1777 (noting that a reviewing court unsatisfied with the reasons given for an agency's decision \"will set aside the agency's action and remand the case &#8212; even though the agency ... might later, in the exercise of its lawful discretion, reach the same result for a different reason\"). Courts remand to agencies in such cases because, among other reasons, Congress has committed to the agency the task of policymaking where the governing statute is not clear. <i>See Chenery,</i> 318 U.S. at 88, 63 S.Ct. 454 (\"For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Congress in the Telecommunications Act left intact some of local zoning boards' authority under state law, we do not think it meant to provide for them as much deference as a federal agency receives, nor to give them new policymaking authority under the Act. The statutory requirements that the board act within \"a reasonable period of time,\" and that the reviewing court hear and decide the action \"on an expedited basis,\" indicate that Congress did not intend multiple rounds of decisions and litigation, in which a court rejects one reason and then gives the board the opportunity, if it chooses, to proffer another. Instead, in the majority of cases the proper remedy for a zoning board decision that violates the Act will be an order, like the one the district court issued in this case, instructing the board to authorize construction. <i>See Brehmer v. Planning Bd.,</i> 238 F.3d 117, 120-22 (1st Cir.2001) (discussing and approving decisions by the majority of district courts granting injunctive relief in Telecommunications Act cases); <i>Cellular Tel. Co. v. Town of Oyster Bay,</i> 166 F.3d 490, 497 (2d Cir.1999) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, a board's decision may not present a moving target and a board will not ordinarily receive a second chance. In addition to preventing undue delay, this approach gives the applicant a fair chance to respond to the board's reasons, and perhaps satisfy the board, without first having, literally, to make a federal case out of the dispute. Thus, we will not uphold a board's denial of a permit on grounds that it did not present in its written decision. As we discuss later, however, the appropriate remedy in that situation may not always be an injunction, but may sometimes be a remand, depending on the nature of the board's decision and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from its instructions to local zoning authorities, Congress has also specified the terms of judicial review. These terms themselves amount to an allocation of decisional authority between the local boards and the federal courts. The standards by which district courts, and this court, review state and local decisions under the Act are not unitary. The scope of judicial review depends on the nature of the issue presented and the statutory limitation involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anti-prohibition, anti-discrimination, and unreasonable delay provisions, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)-(ii), present questions that a federal district court determines in the first instance without any deference to the board. Any or all of these questions may well require evidence to be presented in court that is outside of the administrative record compiled by the local authority. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 16 n. 7. If the district court then grants summary judgment, our review of the grant is de novo as well. <i>Id.</i> at 15. If the district court makes evidentiary findings on such claims that go beyond the administrative record, then we will review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, where judicial review is on the issue of whether the board's written decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record, then judicial review is confined to the administrative record, absent a claim of procedural irregularity. The board, then, not the court, is the focus of the decisionmaking process. In this inquiry, the substantial evidence standard of review for the district court is the same that the courts have applied in certain reviews of administrative action. <i>S.W. Bell,</i> 244 F.3d at 58-59. \"Substantial evidence\" review is that standard articulated in <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), and applied in <i>Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. FAA,</i> 164 F.3d 713 (1st Cir.1999):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" The reviewing court must take into account contradictory evidence in the record. But \"the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 718 (quoting <i>Universal Camera,</i> 340 U.S. at 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, and <i>Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan,</i> 452 U.S. 490, 523, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 69 L.Ed.2d 185 (1981)) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if the issue is simply one of whether the board's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the courts defer to the decision of the local authority, provided that the local board picks between reasonable inferences from the record before it. Because the reasonableness of inferences is a legal and not a factual question, this court gives no special weight to the district court's decision on a substantial evidence issue and applies the same standard of deference to the board as does the district court. <i>S.W. Bell,</i> 244 F.3d at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Application of the Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the board's reasons for its denial, quoted verbatim earlier. It is difficult to know precisely what the board meant by its legal jargon and its apparently purposeful obscurity. The board says that it did not grant the dimensional variances because it lacked the legal authority to do so, and that it denied the watershed permit because it denied the variances. The board specifically refused to make findings as to any other objections, or to make a finding on whether there exists any other location where such construction would be permitted under the by-law. The board did not say anything about the tower's status as a public utility or as a radio tower. Instead, as we understand the order, the board ruled that its by-laws did not allow for wireless communications facilities in CB districts either as a matter of right or a use permitted by a special permit. Citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 10, therefore, the board said it lacked the power to authorize the use because the by-law did not expressly permit variances for wireless communications facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consulting the by-law, however, we find that it does state that a radio tower is not permitted in a CB district, even by special permit, but that a public utility is permitted in such a district with a special permit. By-law ch. III, &#167; 2.8. Viewing the board's actions in the best light possible, then, it is possible that when it said \"wireless communications facility\" in the October 27 letters, it meant \"radio tower.\" Perhaps the board meant to revisit its July 18 decision (which had recharacterized the application as for a public utility rather than as for a radio tower) and to re-recharacterize the application as for a radio tower rather than as for a public utility. That is the explanation presented by counsel for the board, who suggests that the district court must resolve whether Omnipoint's tower would be a radio tower or a public utility, and that this is a genuinely disputed issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment for Omnipoint at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two obvious problems with this position: one factual and one legal. The factual problem is that the board did not say this (perhaps it was too embarrassing a position to take) and it was the board that told Omnipoint it would republish the application as a public utility application rather than as a radio tower application. As Omnipoint says, the board's position means it would be left without any alternative. Omnipoint has tried its application both ways &#8212; as a radio tower and as a public utility &#8212; and it was blocked each time. The legal problem is that this is exactly the sort of behavior by a board that demonstrates that it would effectively prohibit the provision of gap-covering wireless services. Setting out criteria under the zoning law that no one could ever meet is an example of an effective prohibition. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 14. The Telecommunications Act preempts such by-law strictures. Accordingly, it no longer matters to our inquiry under the Telecommunications Act whether Omnipoint's proposed tower is a radio tower or a public utility under the by-law. Neither classification will save the board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for the board then offers a different rationale: that Omnipoint failed to satisfy the board that there were no better alternative locations. A single denial of an application based on a supportable finding that another location was available would almost certainly fall short of an effective prohibition of wireless services. If the board had in fact made such a finding, it might also be difficult for us to say that the board's decision to deny was unsupported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But the board did not take that position in its decision. Instead, it chose as its ground that it had no legal power to authorize a wireless communication tower anywhere in the CB district, regardless of the existence of any alternative site. We judge its decision on those terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have considered the lack of evidence from the board<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> about other alternative sites as evidence that further application to the board was futile. On the \"effective prohibition\" issue, district courts may take evidence beyond the record. Still, even in that context, it is problematic whether courts should rely on the board's failure to come forward with such evidence in court. We doubt that Congress intended local zoning boards to pay for experts to prove that there are alternative sites for a proposed tower, simply to defend themselves from an easily made accusation in court that an individual denial of a permit amounts to an effective prohibition. <i>See S.W. Bell,</i> 244 F.3d at 63 (\"For a telecommunications provider to argue that a permit denial is impermissible because there are no alternative sites, it must develop a record demonstrating that it has made a full effort to evaluate the other available alternatives and that the alternatives are not feasible to serve its customers.\"). The board gets no comfort from this, however. It expressly refused to decide the adequacy of Omnipoint's evidence about the lack of alternative sites. As we have discussed earlier, we will not uphold a board's decision on grounds that were not stated to the applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the board's order cannot be upheld on the grounds it stated, the question becomes one of what should be the appropriate remedy: remand to the board, or affirmance of the injunction. While we can conceive of circumstances in which a remand may be in order &#8212; for example, an instance of good faith confusion by a board that has acted quite promptly &#8212; this case is not a candidate for remand to the board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we think the only fair inference from the board's words and actions in this case is that whether or not there is a coverage gap, and whether or not there are alternative sites that could fill that coverage gap, the board is not prepared to permit construction on Omnipoint's chosen site. As a result, any further reasonable efforts by Omnipoint are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try. Thus, the record compels the conclusion that the board has effectively prohibited the provision of wireless services in violation of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> That justifies the remedial order entered by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the district court's order granted only partial summary judgment, this court determined on December 14, 2001, that the judgment was effectively final, and therefore permitted this appeal to proceed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record does not make clear whether the other potential sites were within the Watershed Protection District</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Another provision prohibits unreasonable discrimination among providers of functionally equivalent services<i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I).

Omnipoint needed these variances in order to erect a 170-foot-tall \"lattice\" transmission tower on approximately 5000 square feet of a two-and-one-half-acre parcel at 75 Washington Street in Plainville. The site abuts property owned by the New England Power Company, which contains electric transmission lines and poles and is developed for public utility use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Omnipoint's objective was to close a two-mile (non-contiguous) gap in its cellular coverage along the heavily traveled highway Routes 1 and 106. In the vicinity of the coverage gap, approximately 17,000 vehicles travel daily along Route 1 and 10,000 along Route 106. Because of the gap in coverage, a cellular user either cannot connect or cannot maintain a connection. The proposed site lies in a General Commercial District (a \"CB District\"), and is partially covered by a Watershed Protection Overlay District. Under the town by-law, a radio tower is a prohibited use in a CB District and requires a special permit in a Watershed Protection District. Plainville, Mass. Zoning By-law ch. III, &#167; 2.8 (1999). Moreover, a structure in a CB District may not exceed two stories in height. An engineer working for Omnipoint testified, and the board does not dispute, that a two-story tower in compliance with the by-law would not close the gap. The board may, however, grant both use and dimensional variances for reasons consistent with the state zoning law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167;&#167; 10, 14 (2000). Similarly, the board may grant a special use permit in a Watershed Protection District so long as it makes certain findings, primarily that there will be no adverse impact on the watershed as a result. By-law ch. III, &#167; 3.12.5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Omnipoint conducted computer simulations and drive tests to identify possible sites for a tower to rectify the break in its coverage. An investigation of the sites thus identified led to the selection of the disputed site. All other possible sites were in the same general area and therefore subject to the same zoning restrictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This evidence was submitted to the board, primarily through Omnipoint's application for the use and dimensional variances. In its initial application Omnipoint characterized its tower as a wireless communications facility. It sought the needed permits and variances, which the by-law permitted the town to grant. <i>See</i> By-law ch. III, &#167; 1.4.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The board published the requisite notice in a local newspaper, characterizing the application as being for a \"radio tower.\" It held a hearing to consider the application on July 18. Midway through the hearing, the board determined that it had been mistaken in publishing notice of a proposed siting of a \"radio tower\" on the site. The board voted to suspend the hearing and readvertise the tower as a \"public utility\" (a permitted use in a CB District). The hearing resumed on September 26, with Omnipoint pressing its case for a dimensional variance. Omnipoint presented evidence of the coverage gap and evidence that it said showed there were no other suitable sites. The board at the hearing articulated no objections to the application, although several owners of abutting property did object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on August 24, 2000, Omnipoint filed an application for a special watershed permit. The hearing on this application was held on October 3, 2000. As at the hearing on the application for the dimensional variance, the board gave no indication that it might not grant the permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, the board unanimously rejected both applications. The board sent Omnipoint two letters dated October 27 explaining its decision. As to the request for the variances, the first letter stated: In denying the variances, the Board found that in a CB Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance, which would be required for the construction of such is not permitted under the Zoning By-Law. In this respect, the Board notes that Chapter 40A, Section 10 of the General Laws, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Except where local ordinances or by-laws shall expressly permit variances for use, no variance may authorize a use or activity not otherwise permitted in the district in which the land or structure is located.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Zoning By-Law makes no provision for use variances. As the basis for its denial of the variances is that it has no legal authority to grant them, the Board made no further findings with respect to other objections made to the construction of such facility, particularly as to whether there exists any other location in the Town where such construction is permitted under the Zoning By-Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons given in the second letter for the rejection of the watershed permit were as terse:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this date, the Board denied the variances requested by the applicant on the grounds that in the underlying CB Zoning District a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance, which would be required for the construction of such facility, is not permitted under the Zoning By-Law. The construction of a wireless communications facility is clearly not permitted in the underlying CB Zoning District. Accordingly, it is not permitted by special permit in the overlay Watershed Protection District as the proposed use must meet the zoning requirements of both the underlying district and the overlay district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit, and appeal, followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The board appeals the order against it, making three arguments. It says the district court erred in granting Omnipoint's motion for partial summary judgment on the facts in this case because, first, the board's decisions do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services in the town; second, the board's decisions are supported by substantial evidence in a written record; and, third, the board's decisions do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach only the first two of these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>General Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Telecommunications Act is an exercise in cooperative federalism and represents a dramatic shift in the nature of telecommunications regulation. <i>See generally Cablevision of Boston v.

The Act attempts, subject to five limitations, to preserve state and local authority over the placement and construction of facilities. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(A)-(B) (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996); <i>Town of Amherst, N.H. v.

It is undisputed that in this case there is a significant coverage gap. The argument that no tower is needed is unavailable to the town. Several courts have held that local zoning decisions and ordinances that prevent the closing of significant gaps in the availability of wireless services violate the statute. <i>See Cellular Tel.

Finding their reasoning persuasive, we now join their number and will analyze Omnipoint's claim with that standard in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second limitation requires the local government to \"act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed ... taking into account the nature and scope of such request.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(ii). Similarly, a reviewing court must hear and decide the action \"on an expedited basis.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The third states that the denial of a request must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The fourth authorizes judicial review of either final action or a failure to act by the local government that is inconsistent with statutory requirements and limitations. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(v).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is tension between two objectives of the Act: the objective \"to facilitate nationally the growth of wireless telephone service,\" and the objective \"to maintain substantial local control over siting of towers\"; this and other courts have attempted to achieve the proper balance. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 13. The principles announced in our opinions provide guidance as to that balance. The first limitation &#8212; that a town may not through its decisions have \"the effect of prohibiting\" wireless service &#8212; raises the question whether the statute refers only to a blanket ban or whether it may, depending on the facts, encompass individual application decisions. This court has resolved that question and read the statute to encompass individual decisions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]bviously, an individual denial is not automatically a forbidden prohibition violating the \"effects\" provision. But neither can we rule out the possibility that &#8212; based on language or circumstances &#8212; some individual decisions could be shown to reflect, or represent, an effective prohibition on personal wireless service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 14. The effective prohibition clause can be violated even if substantial evidence exists to support the denial of an individual permit under the terms of the town's ordinances. The burden is on the proponent of the tower to show \"that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, this court has resolved the tension between the recognition that local authorities are frequently lay member boards without many resources and the recognition that the Act provides for judicial review based on a written decision, supported by \"substantial evidence\" in a \"written record.\" The balance struck is that we do not require formal findings of fact or conclusions of law in a board's written decision. Nor need a board's written decision state every fact in the record that supports its decision. <i>S.W. Bell Mobile Sys. v. Todd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772557\"><a href=\"/opinion/772557/southwestern-bell-mobile-systems-inc-dba-cellular-one-v-laurence-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 59-60 (1st Cir.2001). By the same token, the board, in its decision, may not hide the ball. Its written denial must contain a sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial \"to allow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting those reasons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now make explicit another aspect of judicial review of local decisions. A board may not provide the applicant with one reason for a denial and then, in court, seek to uphold its decision on different grounds. That result follows not only from the requirement that the decision provide an adequate explanation to support judicial review, but also from the background understanding of the model of judicial review of administrative actions against which the Act was enacted. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, at 208 (1996), <i>reprinted in</i> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124, 223 (\"The phrase `substantial evidence contained in a written record' is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.\").

When a federal court refuses to uphold a federal agency's decision based on reasons the agency has advanced only after the fact, the court will ordinarily remand to the agency for further action. If the agency chooses, it may then reach the same result and defend it with new reasons. <i>See Akins,</i> 524 U.S. at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Courts remand to agencies in such cases because, among other reasons, Congress has committed to the agency the task of policymaking where the governing statute is not clear. <i>See Chenery,</i> 318 U.S. at 88, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The statutory requirements that the board act within \"a reasonable period of time,\" and that the reviewing court hear and decide the action \"on an expedited basis,\" indicate that Congress did not intend multiple rounds of decisions and litigation, in which a court rejects one reason and then gives the board the opportunity, if it chooses, to proffer another. Instead, in the majority of cases the proper remedy for a zoning board decision that violates the Act will be an order, like the one the district court issued in this case, instructing the board to authorize construction. <i>See Brehmer v.

In addition to preventing undue delay, this approach gives the applicant a fair chance to respond to the board's reasons, and perhaps satisfy the board, without first having, literally, to make a federal case out of the dispute. Thus, we will not uphold a board's denial of a permit on grounds that it did not present in its written decision. As we discuss later, however, the appropriate remedy in that situation may not always be an injunction, but may sometimes be a remand, depending on the nature of the board's decision and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from its instructions to local zoning authorities, Congress has also specified the terms of judicial review. These terms themselves amount to an allocation of decisional authority between the local boards and the federal courts. The standards by which district courts, and this court, review state and local decisions under the Act are not unitary. The scope of judicial review depends on the nature of the issue presented and the statutory limitation involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anti-prohibition, anti-discrimination, and unreasonable delay provisions, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)-(ii), present questions that a federal district court determines in the first instance without any deference to the board. Any or all of these questions may well require evidence to be presented in court that is outside of the administrative record compiled by the local authority. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 16 n. 7. If the district court then grants summary judgment, our review of the grant is de novo as well. <i>Id.</i> at 15.

Because the reasonableness of inferences is a legal and not a factual question, this court gives no special weight to the district court's decision on a substantial evidence issue and applies the same standard of deference to the board as does the district court. <i>S.W. Bell,</i> 244 F.3d at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Application of the Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the board's reasons for its denial, quoted verbatim earlier. It is difficult to know precisely what the board meant by its legal jargon and its apparently purposeful obscurity. The board says that it did not grant the dimensional variances because it lacked the legal authority to do so, and that it denied the watershed permit because it denied the variances. The board specifically refused to make findings as to any other objections, or to make a finding on whether there exists any other location where such construction would be permitted under the by-law. The board did not say anything about the tower's status as a public utility or as a radio tower. Instead, as we understand the order, the board ruled that its by-laws did not allow for wireless communications facilities in CB districts either as a matter of right or a use permitted by a special permit. Citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 10, therefore, the board said it lacked the power to authorize the use because the by-law did not expressly permit variances for wireless communications facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consulting the by-law, however, we find that it does state that a radio tower is not permitted in a CB district, even by special permit, but that a public utility is permitted in such a district with a special permit. By-law ch. III, &#167; 2.8. Viewing the board's actions in the best light possible, then, it is possible that when it said \"wireless communications facility\" in the October 27 letters, it meant \"radio tower.\" Perhaps the board meant to revisit its July 18 decision (which had recharacterized the application as for a public utility rather than as for a radio tower) and to re-recharacterize the application as for a radio tower rather than as for a public utility. That is the explanation presented by counsel for the board, who suggests that the district court must resolve whether Omnipoint's tower would be a radio tower or a public utility, and that this is a genuinely disputed issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment for Omnipoint at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two obvious problems with this position: one factual and one legal. The factual problem is that the board did not say this (perhaps it was too embarrassing a position to take) and it was the board that told Omnipoint it would republish the application as a public utility application rather than as a radio tower application. As Omnipoint says, the board's position means it would be left without any alternative. Omnipoint has tried its application both ways &#8212; as a radio tower and as a public utility &#8212; and it was blocked each time. The legal problem is that this is exactly the sort of behavior by a board that demonstrates that it would effectively prohibit the provision of gap-covering wireless services. Setting out criteria under the zoning law that no one could ever meet is an example of an effective prohibition. <i>Amherst,</i> 173 F.3d at 14. The Telecommunications Act preempts such by-law strictures. Accordingly, it no longer matters to our inquiry under the Telecommunications Act whether Omnipoint's proposed tower is a radio tower or a public utility under the by-law. Neither classification will save the board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for the board then offers a different rationale: that Omnipoint failed to satisfy the board that there were no better alternative locations. A single denial of an application based on a supportable finding that another location was available would almost certainly fall short of an effective prohibition of wireless services. If the board had in fact made such a finding, it might also be difficult for us to say that the board's decision to deny was unsupported by substantial evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But the board did not take that position in its decision. Instead, it chose as its ground that it had no legal power to authorize a wireless communication tower anywhere in the CB district, regardless of the existence of any alternative site. We judge its decision on those terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have considered the lack of evidence from the board<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> about other alternative sites as evidence that further application to the board was futile. On the \"effective prohibition\" issue, district courts may take evidence beyond the record. Still, even in that context, it is problematic whether courts should rely on the board's failure to come forward with such evidence in court. We doubt that Congress intended local zoning boards to pay for experts to prove that there are alternative sites for a proposed tower, simply to defend themselves from an easily made accusation in court that an individual denial of a permit amounts to an effective prohibition. <i>See S.W. Bell,</i> 244 F.3d at 63 (\"For a telecommunications provider to argue that a permit denial is impermissible because there are no alternative sites, it must develop a record demonstrating that it has made a full effort to evaluate the other available alternatives and that the alternatives are not feasible to serve its customers.\"). The board gets no comfort from this, however. It expressly refused to decide the adequacy of Omnipoint's evidence about the lack of alternative sites. As we have discussed earlier, we will not uphold a board's decision on grounds that were not stated to the applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the board's order cannot be upheld on the grounds it stated, the question becomes one of what should be the appropriate remedy: remand to the board, or affirmance of the injunction. While we can conceive of circumstances in which a remand may be in order &#8212; for example, an instance of good faith confusion by a board that has acted quite promptly &#8212; this case is not a candidate for remand to the board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we think the only fair inference from the board's words and actions in this case is that whether or not there is a coverage gap, and whether or not there are alternative sites that could fill that coverage gap, the board is not prepared to permit construction on Omnipoint's chosen site. As a result, any further reasonable efforts by Omnipoint are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try. Thus, the record compels the conclusion that the board has effectively prohibited the provision of wireless services in violation of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> That justifies the remedial order entered by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded against the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the district court's order granted only partial summary judgment, this court determined on December 14, 2001, that the judgment was effectively final, and therefore permitted this appeal to proceed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record does not make clear whether the other potential sites were within the Watershed Protection District</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Another provision prohibits unreasonable discrimination among providers of functionally equivalent services<i>Id.</i> &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I).
