Rodriguez.\n     Daniel Steven Goodman, Criminal Division, Appellate Section,\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States\nAttorney, and William F. Bloomer, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwere on consolidated brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 19, 2009\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.          This appeal arises from the\n\nconvictions of five co-defendants (only four seek review) on drug\n\nconspiracy charges and (as to one defendant) on associated firearms\n\ncharges.    We begin with a brief summary of the background and\n\nproceedings    and   return   later    to   the   evidence   pertinent   to\n\nsufficiency claims and to other trial and sentencing claims raised\n\nby the defendants.\n\n            The case began with a year-long investigation into a\n\nlarge-scale heroin distribution operation in or around Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts, starting in summer 2003 and ending with arrests in\n\nOctober 2004.    The investigation encompassed the five defendants\n\nwho went to trial and seven others who were indicted but pled\n\nguilty.    The four appellants before us are Julio Carrion Santiago,\n\nPedro Miranda, Juan Nunez and Jose Rodriguez; the fifth defendant\n\nwho was tried but has withdrawn his appeal is Carlos Sanchez.\n\n            The investigation was led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement\n\nAgency (\"DEA\") but included state and local police. In its course,\n\nagents tracked Santiago's van with a GPS unit and conducted visual\n\nsurveillance of it; conducted court authorized wiretaps of cell\n\nphones of the defendants; tracked and observed transactions among\n\nthe defendants revealed by cell phone conversations; and ultimately\n\nseized Santiago's van (seizing concealed drugs) and searched his\n\nresidence and those of Rodriguez (seizing drugs) and Miranda\n\n(seizing paraphernalia).\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f              In the search of Santiago's residence, officers found a\n\ndrug press in the hallway between two apartments--one of them\n\nSantiago's--and, in the attic above the press, a 9 millimeter gun\n\nand an ammunition clip along with heroin, a digital scale, a bag\n\nwith silencers and a magazine for a smaller weapon.                         They found\n\nadditional paraphernalia inside Santiago's apartment.                          Only in\n\nNunez's case were no drugs or paraphernalia seized.\n\n              Nunez,     Santiago,       Rodriguez,     Miranda      and   eight    other\n\ndefendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin and to\n\npossess    heroin      with   intent       to    distribute,    21    U.S.C.   §§       846,\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1) (2006).                    Santiago was also charged with\n\npossessing firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18\n\nU.S.C.    §    924(c)    (2006),         and    by   superceding     indictment         with\n\npossession of unregistered firearms, 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) (2006).\n\nA ten day jury trial ensued for the five defendants who declined to\n\nplead guilty.\n\n              The jury convicted all five on the conspiracy count and\n\nfound that the conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of heroin,\n\ntriggering a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment.                            21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 846, 841(b)(1).                 Santiago was found guilty on both\n\nweapons       charges.        The     district       court     at    sentencing         made\n\nindividualized drug quantity determinations.                   On his three counts,\n\nSantiago      was   sentenced       to    248    months'   imprisonment.           On    the\n\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fconspiracy count, Rodriguez, Nunez and Miranda were sentenced to\n\n264, 151 and 72 months, respectively.\n\n            On appeal, Santiago disputes the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to support the jury's finding that the amount of drugs was\n\nat least one kilogram of heroin.   Review, of course, requires that\n\nwe assume that the jury accepted the government's evidence and drew\n\ninferences in its favor.   United States v. Sherman, 551 F.3d 45, 49\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).    A rational jury could easily\n\nfind that the conspiracy involved at least a kilogram of heroin.\n\n            Almost a half kilogram (493.3 grams) was seized from\n\nSantiago's van; another 115.9 grams were found in the attic of his\n\nbuilding.     An additional 180.7 grams were seized from Reynaldo\n\nRivera (a member of the conspiracy who pled guilty), and an\n\nundercover agent purchased 135.4 grams through Rivera.       Agents\n\nseized 19.8 grams that they saw Santiago place in the door of\n\nRivera's car. And agents recovered almost 60 grams from Rodriguez.\n\nThat adds up to over a kilo--not including additional amounts\n\nseized from other co-conspirators.\n\n            Santiago says that the drugs found in the attic should\n\nnot be attributed to the conspiracy and--in a different sufficiency\n\nargument--says that the guns in the attic should not be attributed\n\nto him.     While there were two apartments upstairs in Santiago's\n\nbuilding, Santiago was the only tenant on the floor below the attic\n\nat the time of the search and had been for five months.         The\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbuilding manager testified that he knew the attic existed but he\n\nhad not been there for many years, and he was not aware that it no\n\nlonger had pull-down access stairs.\n\n            The     jury    knew    about        Santiago's      drug    dealing,    the\n\nproximity    of     his    apartment        to    the   attic,    the    corresponding\n\nparaphernalia in his apartment, the concealment of access to the\n\nattic and the absence of others likely to have used the attic.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the jury was free to reason that the\n\ndrugs in the attic were part of the conspiracy and that the gun was\n\nconstructively possessed by Santiago. See United States v. Barnes,\n\n890 F.2d 545, 549-50 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1019\n\n(1990); United States v. Calle-Cardenas, 837 F.2d 30, 32 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1024 (1988).\n\n            Santiago also says that nothing shows that the gun seized\n\nin the attic was used in furtherance of his drug trafficking.\n\nRelatedly,     he    objects       to   a    state      trooper's       testimony   that\n\nindividuals    who     have   drugs     keep       firearms   because      \"[i]t    is   a\n\nbusiness that involves a large quantity of money\" leading to a\n\n\"number of instances in which robberies are committed against each\n\nindividual.\"        Santiago's objection to the trooper's testimony is\n\nnot developed but in any event is unpersuasive, and the sufficiency\n\nclaim fails even if the testimony is disregarded.\n\n            The trooper's testimony merely explained circumstantial\n\nevidence from which the jury could have drawn the obvious inference\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthat the gun was there to protect the stockpile of drugs.                    The\n\ndrugs and gun were concealed together within easy reach of the\n\nattic opening; in addition, the gun was loaded and unregistered.\n\nSee Sherman, 551 F.3d at 50-51.        The jury's inference was entirely\n\nappropriate.      United States v. Garner, 338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 1084 (2003); United States v. Luciano, 329\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Santiago and Miranda both object to testimony by Marcos\n\nChavez, who acted as an undercover agent during the investigation;\n\nhe testified at trial as to the meaning of code words or phrases\n\nused by the defendants, primarily to designate drug quantities.\n\nThe objections are that Chavez had not been qualified as an expert,\n\nthat no advance disclosure of expert testimony was provided, see\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 16, and that inferences drawn were speculative and\n\ntheir admission an abuse of discretion.\n\n           Chavez testified as a lay witness: such witnesses may\n\ngive   opinions    as   long   as   they    are   \"rationally   based   on   the\n\nperception of the witness,\" are \"helpful to . . . the determination\n\nof a fact in issue,\" and are \"not based on scientific, technical,\n\nor other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 701.      Testimony about coded language--like, for example,\n\ntestimony about vehicle speed--can be admissible, depending on its\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcontent    and    other   circumstances,     either    as   lay   or     expert\n\ntestimony.1\n\n            Here, Chavez had been involved in the investigation,\n\nlistened to over 90 percent of the intercepts, learned voices and\n\npatterns, and heard and used the coded language in his undercover\n\ndrug buys relating to the investigation.         \"Rule 701 . . . is meant\n\nto admit testimony based on the lay expertise a witness personally\n\nacquires through experience, often on the job.\"             United States v.\n\nMaher, 454 F.3d 13, 24 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1025\n\n(2006); United States v. Ayala-Pizarro, 407 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 546 U.S. 902 (2005) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 701\n\nadvisory committee's note).\n\n            Further, various of the code word interpretations were\n\nborne out by the conduct of the defendants.           For example, Chavez's\n\ninterpretation of Rodriguez's request for \"$60 out of the bank\" was\n\nsupported by the seizure of 60 grams of heroin (10 from his person\n\nand   50   from   his   home)   shortly    thereafter.      Far   from    being\n\nspeculative, Chavez's interpretations corresponded to locations,\n\ndrug quantities and the like.       There was no error in admitting the\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n      1\n      Compare United States v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 2002) (allowing expert testimony about the meanings of \"code\nwords\"), and United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st\nCir. 1987) (same), with United States v. Grullon, 545 F.3d 93, 95-\n96 (1st Cir. 2008) (allowing lay opinion testimony on meaning of\ncoded language), and United States v. Gaines, 170 F.3d 72, 77-78\n(1st Cir. 1999) (same).\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           On cross-examination, Miranda's counsel questioned Chavez\n\nabout the use of coded language in the affidavit that agents had\n\nprepared to support the wiretap warrant and, on redirect, the\n\nprosecutor    asked   Chavez     whether   the   agents    who   provided   the\n\naffidavit had included interpretations of the codes' meanings,\n\nwhich Chavez answered affirmatively.             Miranda objects to this\n\naffirmative    response     as    hearsay    and    a     violation    of    the\n\nConfrontation Clause.\n\n           The brief reference to the affidavit was not offered for\n\nthe truth of anything said in the affidavit--the interpretations\n\nthemselves were not elicited--and so presents no hearsay problem.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801.        Likewise there is no Confrontation Clause\n\nproblem.   United States v. Rodriguez-Duran, 507 F.3d 749, 769 n.28\n\n(1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1726, 1729 (2008).                And,\n\nif this single answer had been error, it would have been harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Earle, 488 F.3d 537, 546 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 128 S. Ct. 423 (2007).\n\n           Nunez   raises   two    issues   relating      to   drug   quantity.\n\nFirst, he says that the jury should have been required to make\n\nindividual drug quantity findings for each defendant, as opposed to\n\nmaking a conspiracy-wide quantity determination. Nunez's challenge\n\nto the jury's conspiracy-wide drug finding was not preserved--and\n\nhe in fact affirmatively approved the jury instruction--so at best\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\four review is only for plain error.            United States v. Griffin, 524\n\nF.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The Supreme Court requires a jury finding as to drug\n\nquantity if it increases the statutory maximum sentence, Apprendi\n\nv.   New    Jersey,     530   U.S.   466,      490    (2000),       assertedly     on\n\nconstitutional grounds; but whether the statutory maximum sentence\n\nturns on what the conspiracy embraced or on what was foreseeable\n\nseparately    to   each   conspirator     raises      at    least    questions    of\n\nstatutory    construction.           Needless        to    say,     specific     jury\n\ndeterminations     as   to    quantity   for    each      conspirator    could    be\n\ncomplicated.\n\n            Our recent case law requires that the jury decide the\n\nconspiracy-wide quantity, which establishes the maximum penalty the\n\ndistrict court may impose under the statute.                See United States v.\n\nDe La Cruz, 514 F.3d 121, 136-37 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\n\nGonzález-Vélez, 466 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir. 2006).2                        Then, at\n\nsentencing, the judge finds the amount reasonably foreseeable to\n\neach defendant, which is used to determine his sentence.                       United\n\nStates v. Malouf, 466 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied,\n\n127 S. Ct. 1892 (2007).        That is what happened here and, under our\n\nprecedents, this was the correct process.\n\n\n\n     2\n      United States v. Wiggin, 429 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2005), allowed\nan instruction requiring an individualized jury determination, but\nthe focus of the challenge was to the clarity of the instruction,\nid. at 38, and our later decisions govern the question before us.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            Nunez's second claim is that the evidence does not\n\nsupport the amount that the district court attributed to him at\n\nsentencing--between one and three kilograms. He says that the only\n\ndrugs conclusively linked to him were the 493.3 grams seized from\n\nSantiago's van immediately after the final visit by Santiago to\n\nNunez in New York.         Santiago made other visits to him but Nunez\n\nsays that it is speculation to assume drugs were involved or to\n\ncalculate   the     amounts.      The    objection    was    not   preserved   at\n\nsentencing so review is for plain error.             United States v. Silva,\n\n554 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            Nunez says there is no evidence of drugs for any of the\n\nearlier trips, but during at least one of Santiago's trips (in\n\nSeptember 2004) officers observed Santiago and Nunez engage in\n\nbehavior similar to that of October 2004 trip where the half kilo\n\nwas seized.   United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 113-14 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)   (similarity     between    transactions       permits      drug   quantity\n\nestimates).       Conversations between Nunez and Santiago further\n\nsupported the inference that additional drugs were supplied.\n\n            As to quantity, the district court took a conservative\n\napproach in attributing only a quarter kilo to each of Santiago's\n\nother trips to Nunez's apartment instead of the nearly half kilo\n\nseized on the final visit--which the pre-sentence report had\n\nrecommended    as    the    proper      estimate     for    each    trip.      The\n\nextrapolation was not rote but reflected similarity between the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\ftrips, the GPS evidence, the wiretap evidence and the seizure\n\nfollowing the final trip.         There was no error.\n\n           Finally, Rodriguez challenges only his sentence, and his\n\nonly developed claim is for a remand in light of Kimbrough v.\n\nUnited States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007), to give the district court a\n\nchance to evaluate a policy-based objection to the career offender\n\nguideline.      Based     on    drug     quantity        and    criminal    history,\n\nRodriguez's guideline range would have been 110 to 137 months; but\n\nbecause his record also triggered the career offender guideline,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, the range increased to 360 months to life.\n\n           At sentencing, Rodriguez's primary argument was that he\n\nbarely   qualified   as    a    career    offender,       one    of   his   predicate\n\noffenses   falling     almost    outside      of   the    guideline's       look-back\n\nprovision, and that a career offender guideline sentence would be\n\nmuch higher than the sentences of his more culpable co-defendants.\n\nThe district court imposed a below-guideline sentence of 264\n\nmonths, describing Rodriguez's record as \"atrocious\" but noting the\n\nneed to take into account his co-defendants' shorter sentences.\n\n           We   have      remanded       pre-Kimbrough          sentences     without\n\npreserved claims where \"there [was] some explicit indication that\n\n[the district court] might well alter its sentence.\" United States\n\nv. Boardman, 528 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir. 2008).                    The trial judge's\n\ncomments here gave no such indication but strongly suggested, as in\n\nUnited States v.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, and William F. Bloomer, Assistant United States Attorney, were on consolidated brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal arises from the convictions of five co-defendants (only four seek review) on drug conspiracy charges and (as to one defendant) on associated firearms charges. We begin with a brief summary of the background and proceedings and return later to the evidence pertinent to sufficiency claims and to other trial and sentencing claims raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p>The case began with a year-long investigation into a large-scale heroin distribution operation in or around Lowell, Massachusetts, starting in summer 2003 and ending with arrests in October 2004. The investigation encompassed the five defendants who went to trial and seven others who were indicted but pled guilty. The four appellants before us are Julio Carrion Santiago, Pedro Miranda, Juan Nunez and Jose Rodriguez; the fifth defendant who was tried but has withdrawn his appeal is Carlos Sanchez.</p>\n<p>The investigation was led by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") but included state and local police. In its course, agents tracked Santiago's van with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> a GPS unit and conducted visual surveillance of it; conducted court authorized wiretaps of cell phones of the defendants; tracked and observed transactions among the defendants revealed by cell phone conversations; and ultimately seized Santiago's van (seizing concealed drugs) and searched his residence and those of Rodriguez (seizing drugs) and Miranda (seizing paraphernalia).</p>\n<p>In the search of Santiago's residence, officers found a drug press in the hallway between two apartmentsone of them Santiago'sand, in the attic above the press, a 9 millimeter gun and an ammunition clip along with heroin, a digital scale, a bag with silencers and a magazine for a smaller weapon. They found additional paraphernalia inside Santiago's apartment. Only in Nunez's case were no drugs or paraphernalia seized.</p>\n<p>Nunez, Santiago, Rodriguez, Miranda and eight other defendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin and to possess heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1) (2006). Santiago was also charged with possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (2006), and by superceding indictment with possession of unregistered firearms, 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) (2006). A ten day jury trial ensued for the five defendants who declined to plead guilty.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted all five on the conspiracy count and found that the conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of heroin, triggering a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(b)(1). Santiago was found guilty on both weapons charges. The district court at sentencing made individualized drug quantity determinations. On his three counts, Santiago was sentenced to 248 months' imprisonment. On the conspiracy count, Rodriguez, Nunez and Miranda were sentenced to 264, 151 and 72 months, respectively.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Santiago disputes the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding that the amount of drugs was at least one kilogram of heroin. Review, of course, requires that we assume that the jury accepted the government's evidence and drew inferences in its favor. <i>United States v. Sherman,</i> 551 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2008) (citation omitted). A rational jury could easily find that the conspiracy involved at least a kilogram of heroin.</p>\n<p>Almost a half kilogram (493.3 grams) was seized from Santiago's van; another 115.9 grams were found in the attic of his building. An additional 180.7 grams were seized from Reynaldo Rivera (a member of the conspiracy who pled guilty), and an undercover agent purchased 135.4 grams through Rivera. Agents seized 19.8 grams that they saw Santiago place in the door of Rivera's car. And agents recovered almost 60 grams from Rodriguez. That adds up to over a kilo<i>not</i> including additional amounts seized from other co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>Santiago says that the drugs found in the attic should not be attributed to the conspiracy andin a different sufficiency argumentsays that the guns in the attic should not be attributed to him. While there were two apartments upstairs in Santiago's building, Santiago was the only tenant on the floor below the attic at the time of the search and had been for five months. The building manager testified that he knew the attic existed but he had not been there for many years, and he was not aware that it no longer had pull-down access stairs.</p>\n<p>The jury knew about Santiago's drug dealing, the proximity of his apartment to the attic, the corresponding paraphernalia in his apartment, the concealment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> of access to the attic and the absence of others likely to have used the attic. Under these circumstances, the jury was free to reason that the drugs in the attic were part of the conspiracy and that the gun was constructively possessed by Santiago. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 890 F.2d 545, 549-50 (1st Cir.1989), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1019, 110 S.Ct. 1326, 108 L.Ed.2d 501 (1990); <i>United States v. Calle-Cardenas,</i> 837 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 485 U.S. 1024, 108 S.Ct. 1582, 99 L.Ed.2d 897 (1988).</p>\n<p>Santiago also says that nothing shows that the gun seized in the attic was used in furtherance of his drug trafficking. Relatedly, he objects to a state trooper's testimony that individuals who have drugs keep firearms because \"[i]t is a business that involves a large quantity of money\" leading to a \"number of instances in which robberies are committed against each individual.\" Santiago's objection to the trooper's testimony is not developed but in any event is unpersuasive, and the sufficiency claim fails even if the testimony is disregarded.</p>\n<p>The trooper's testimony merely explained circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have drawn the obvious inference that the gun was there to protect the stockpile of drugs. The drugs and gun were concealed together within easy reach of the attic opening; in addition, the gun was loaded and unregistered. <i>See </i><i>Sherman,</i> 551 F.3d at 50-51. The jury's inference was entirely appropriate. <i>United States v. Garner,</i> 338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1084, 124 S.Ct. 948, 157 L.Ed.2d 761 (2003); <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 329 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Santiago and Miranda both object to testimony by Marcos Chavez, who acted as an undercover agent during the investigation; he testified at trial as to the meaning of code words or phrases used by the defendants, primarily to designate drug quantities. The objections are that Chavez had not been qualified as an expert, that no advance disclosure of expert testimony was provided, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, and that inferences drawn were speculative and their admission an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Chavez testified as a lay witness: such witnesses may give opinions as long as they are \"rationally based on the perception of the witness,\" are \"helpful to ... the determination of a fact in issue,\" and are \"not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701. Testimony about coded languagelike, for example, testimony about vehicle speedcan be admissible, depending on its content and other circumstances, either as lay or expert testimony.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, Chavez had been involved in the investigation, listened to over 90 percent of the intercepts, learned voices and patterns, and heard and used the coded language in his undercover drug buys relating to the investigation. \"Rule 701 ... is meant to admit testimony based on the lay expertise a witness personally acquires through experience, often on the job.\" <i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 24 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 1025, 127 S.Ct. 568, 166 L.Ed.2d 420 (2006); <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 902, 126 S.Ct. 247, 163 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> L.Ed.2d 226 (2005) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 701 advisory committee's note).</p>\n<p>Further, various of the code word interpretations were borne out by the conduct of the defendants. For example, Chavez's interpretation of Rodriguez's request for \"$60 out of the bank\" was supported by the seizure of 60 grams of heroin (10 from his person and 50 from his home) shortly thereafter. Far from being speculative, Chavez's interpretations corresponded to locations, drug quantities and the like. There was no error in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Miranda's counsel questioned Chavez about the use of coded language in the affidavit that agents had prepared to support the wiretap warrant and, on redirect, the prosecutor asked Chavez whether the agents who provided the affidavit had included interpretations of the codes' meanings, which Chavez answered affirmatively. Miranda objects to this affirmative response as hearsay and a violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>The brief reference to the affidavit was not offered for the truth of anything said in the affidavitthe interpretations themselves were not elicitedand so presents no hearsay problem. Fed. R.Evid. 801. Likewise there is no Confrontation Clause problem. <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Duran,</i> 507 F.3d 749, 769 n. 28 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 1729, 170 L.Ed.2d 532 (2008). And, if this single answer had been error, it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Earle,</i> 488 F.3d 537, 546 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 423, 169 L.Ed.2d 296 (2007).</p>\n<p>Nunez raises two issues relating to drug quantity. First, he says that <i>the jury</i> should have been required to make individual drug quantity findings for each defendant, as opposed to making a conspiracywide quantity determination. Nunez's challenge to the jury's conspiracy-wide drug finding was not preservedand he in fact affirmatively approved the jury instructionso at best our review is only for plain error. <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 524 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court requires a jury finding as to drug quantity if it increases the statutory maximum sentence, <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), assertedly on constitutional grounds; but whether the statutory maximum sentence turns on what the conspiracy embraced or on what was foreseeable separately to each conspirator raises at least questions of statutory construction. Needless to say, specific jury determinations as to quantity for each conspirator could be complicated.</p>\n<p>Our recent case law requires that the jury decide the conspiracy-wide quantity, which establishes the maximum penalty the district court may impose under the statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> 514 F.3d 121, 136-37 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. González-Vélez,</i> 466 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir.2006).<sup>[2]</sup> Then, at sentencing, the judge finds the amount reasonably foreseeable to each defendant, which is used to determine his sentence. <i>United States v. Malouf,</i> 466 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 1305, 127 S.Ct. 1892, 167 L.Ed.2d 365 (2007). That is what happened here and, under our precedents, this was the correct process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> Nunez's second claim is that the evidence does not support the amount that the district court attributed to him at sentencingbetween one and three kilograms. He says that the only drugs conclusively linked to him were the 493.3 grams seized from Santiago's van immediately after the final visit by Santiago to Nunez in New York. Santiago made other visits to him but Nunez says that it is speculation to assume drugs were involved or to calculate the amounts. Although Nunez did at sentencing contest the quantity of drugs recommended by the pre-sentence report, the base offense level he requested instead was in fact the one adopted by the district judge, and reasonably so. <i>United States v. Silva,</i> 554 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Nunez says there is no evidence of drugs for any of the earlier trips, but during at least one of Santiago's trips (in September 2004) officers observed Santiago and Nunez engage in behavior similar to that of October 2004 trip where the half kilo was seized. <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 113-14 (1st Cir.1990) (similarity between transactions permits drug quantity estimates). Conversations between Nunez and Santiago further supported the inference that additional drugs were supplied.</p>\n<p>As to quantity, the district court took a conservative approach in attributing only a quarter kilo to each of Santiago's other trips to Nunez's apartment instead of the nearly half kilo seized on the final visitwhich the pre-sentence report had recommended as the proper estimate for each trip. The extrapolation was not rote but reflected similarity between the trips, the GPS evidence, the wiretap evidence and the seizure following the final trip. There was no error.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rodriguez challenges only his sentence, and his only developed claim is for a remand in light of <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), to give the district court a chance to evaluate a policy-based objection to the career offender guideline. Based on drug quantity and criminal history, Rodriguez's guideline range would have been 110 to 137 months; but because his record also triggered the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, the range increased to 360 months to life.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, Rodriguez's primary argument was that he barely qualified as a career offender, one of his predicate offenses falling almost outside of the guideline's look-back provision, and that a career offender guideline sentence would be much higher than the sentences of his more culpable co-defendants. The district court imposed a below-guideline sentence of 264 months, describing Rodriguez's record as \"atrocious\" but noting the need to take into account his co-defendants' shorter sentences.</p>\n<p>We have remanded pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> sentences without preserved claims where \"there [was] some explicit indication that [the district court] might well alter its sentence.\" <i>United States v. Boardman,</i> 528 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir.2008). The trial judge's comments here gave no such indication but strongly suggested, as in <i>United States v. King,</i> 554 F.3d 177 (1st Cir.2009), that the judge had no doubt \"about the soundness of the career offender guidelines as applied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 182.</p>\n<p>The defendants' convictions and sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>Compare </i><i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2002) (allowing expert testimony about the meanings of \"code words\"), <i>and </i><i>United States v. Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987) (same), <i>with </i><i>United States v. Grullon,</i> 545 F.3d 93, 95-96 (1st Cir.2008) (allowing lay opinion testimony on meaning of coded language), <i>and </i><i>United States v. Gaines,</i> 170 F.3d 72, 77-78 (1st Cir. 1999) (same).</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>United States v. Wiggin,</i> 429 F.3d 31 (1st Cir.2005), allowed an instruction requiring an individualized jury determination, but the focus of the challenge was to the clarity of the instruction, <i>id.</i> at 38, and our later decisions govern the question before us.</p>\n\n</div>",

We begin with a brief summary of the background and proceedings and return later to the evidence pertinent to sufficiency claims and to other trial and sentencing claims raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p>The case began with a year-long investigation into a large-scale heroin distribution operation in or around Lowell, Massachusetts, starting in summer 2003 and ending with arrests in October 2004.

They found additional paraphernalia inside Santiago's apartment. Only in Nunez's case were no drugs or paraphernalia seized.</p>\n<p>Nunez, Santiago, Rodriguez, Miranda and eight other defendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin and to possess heroin with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1) (2006). Santiago was also charged with possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (2006), and by superceding indictment with possession of unregistered firearms, 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) (2006). A ten day jury trial ensued for the five defendants who declined to plead guilty.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted all five on the conspiracy count and found that the conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of heroin, triggering a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(b)(1). Santiago was found guilty on both weapons charges. The district court at sentencing made individualized drug quantity determinations. On his three counts, Santiago was sentenced to 248 months' imprisonment. On the conspiracy count, Rodriguez, Nunez and Miranda were sentenced to 264, 151 and 72 months, respectively.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Santiago disputes the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding that the amount of drugs was at least one kilogram of heroin. Review, of course, requires that we assume that the jury accepted the government's evidence and drew inferences in its favor. <i>United States v. Sherman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203602\"><a href=\"/opinion/203602/united-states-v-sherman/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2008) (citation omitted). A rational jury could easily find that the conspiracy involved at least a kilogram of heroin.</p>\n<p>Almost a half kilogram (493.3 grams) was seized from Santiago's van; another 115.9 grams were found in the attic of his building. An additional 180.7 grams were seized from Reynaldo Rivera (a member of the conspiracy who pled guilty), and an undercover agent purchased 135.4 grams through Rivera. Agents seized 19.8 grams that they saw Santiago place in the door of Rivera's car. And agents recovered almost 60 grams from Rodriguez. That adds up to over a kilo<i>not</i> including additional amounts seized from other co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>Santiago says that the drugs found in the attic should not be attributed to the conspiracy andin a different sufficiency argumentsays that the guns in the attic should not be attributed to him.

The objections are that Chavez had not been qualified as an expert, that no advance disclosure of expert testimony was provided, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, and that inferences drawn were speculative and their admission an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Chavez testified as a lay witness: such witnesses may give opinions as long as they are \"rationally based on the perception of the witness,\" are \"helpful to ... the determination of a fact in issue,\" and are \"not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701. Testimony about coded languagelike, for example, testimony about vehicle speedcan be admissible, depending on its content and other circumstances, either as lay or expert testimony.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, Chavez had been involved in the investigation, listened to over 90 percent of the intercepts, learned voices and patterns, and heard and used the coded language in his undercover drug buys relating to the investigation. \"Rule 701 ... is meant to admit testimony based on the lay expertise a witness personally acquires through experience, often on the job.\" <i>United States v.

For example, Chavez's interpretation of Rodriguez's request for \"$60 out of the bank\" was supported by the seizure of 60 grams of heroin (10 from his person and 50 from his home) shortly thereafter. Far from being speculative, Chavez's interpretations corresponded to locations, drug quantities and the like. There was no error in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Miranda's counsel questioned Chavez about the use of coded language in the affidavit that agents had prepared to support the wiretap warrant and, on redirect, the prosecutor asked Chavez whether the agents who provided the affidavit had included interpretations of the codes' meanings, which Chavez answered affirmatively. Miranda objects to this affirmative response as hearsay and a violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>The brief reference to the affidavit was not offered for the truth of anything said in the affidavitthe interpretations themselves were not elicitedand so presents no hearsay problem. Fed. R.Evid. 801. Likewise there is no Confrontation Clause problem. <i>United States v.

And, if this single answer had been error, it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

First, he says that <i>the jury</i> should have been required to make individual drug quantity findings for each defendant, as opposed to making a conspiracywide quantity determination. Nunez's challenge to the jury's conspiracy-wide drug finding was not preservedand he in fact affirmatively approved the jury instructionso at best our review is only for plain error. <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203299\"><a href=\"/opinion/203299/united-states-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court requires a jury finding as to drug quantity if it increases the statutory maximum sentence, <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), assertedly on constitutional grounds; but whether the statutory maximum sentence turns on what the conspiracy embraced or on what was foreseeable separately to each conspirator raises at least questions of statutory construction. Needless to say, specific jury determinations as to quantity for each conspirator could be complicated.</p>\n<p>Our recent case law requires that the jury decide the conspiracy-wide quantity, which establishes the maximum penalty the district court may impose under the statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v. De La Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203128\"><a href=\"/opinion/203128/united-states-v-de-la-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 136-37 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v.

Malouf,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1860318\"><a href=\"/opinion/1860318/malouf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span> (2007). That is what happened here and, under our precedents, this was the correct process.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> Nunez's second claim is that the evidence does not support the amount that the district court attributed to him at sentencingbetween one and three kilograms. He says that the only drugs conclusively linked to him were the 493.3 grams seized from Santiago's van immediately after the final visit by Santiago to Nunez in New York. Santiago made other visits to him but Nunez says that it is speculation to assume drugs were involved or to calculate the amounts. Although Nunez did at sentencing contest the quantity of drugs recommended by the pre-sentence report, the base offense level he requested instead was in fact the one adopted by the district judge, and reasonably so. <i>United States v. Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203641\"><a href=\"/opinion/203641/united-states-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Nunez says there is no evidence of drugs for any of the earlier trips, but during at least one of Santiago's trips (in September 2004) officers observed Santiago and Nunez engage in behavior similar to that of October 2004 trip where the half kilo was seized. <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 113-14 (1st Cir.1990) (similarity between transactions permits drug quantity estimates). Conversations between Nunez and Santiago further supported the inference that additional drugs were supplied.</p>\n<p>As to quantity, the district court took a conservative approach in attributing only a quarter kilo to each of Santiago's other trips to Nunez's apartment instead of the nearly half kilo seized on the final visitwhich the pre-sentence report had recommended as the proper estimate for each trip. The extrapolation was not rote but reflected similarity between the trips, the GPS evidence, the wiretap evidence and the seizure following the final trip. There was no error.</p>\n<p>Finally, Rodriguez challenges only his sentence, and his only developed claim is for a remand in light of <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ____, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (2007), to give the district court a chance to evaluate a policy-based objection to the career offender guideline. Based on drug quantity and criminal history, Rodriguez's guideline range would have been 110 to 137 months; but because his record also triggered the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, the range increased to 360 months to life.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, Rodriguez's primary argument was that he barely qualified as a career offender, one of his predicate offenses falling almost outside of the guideline's look-back provision, and that a career offender guideline sentence would be much higher than the sentences of his more culpable co-defendants. The district court imposed a below-guideline sentence of 264 months, describing Rodriguez's record as \"atrocious\" but noting the need to take into account his co-defendants' shorter sentences.</p>\n<p>We have remanded pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> sentences without preserved claims where \"there [was] some explicit indication that [the district court] might well alter its sentence.\" <i>United States v. Boardman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203324\"><a href=\"/opinion/203324/united-states-v-boardman/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2008).
