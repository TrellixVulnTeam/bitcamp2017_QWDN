FORTE,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                THOMAS REILLY, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael B. Forte on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Eva      M.    Badway,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 8, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. Plaintiff Michael Forte was convicted of\n\nvarious state crimes back in 1987.                Although he has since been\n\nreleased from prison, he wishes to bring a damages action under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 to obtain redress for various constitutional\n\nviolations that allegedly tainted that criminal proceeding.\n\nUnder Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), however, he cannot\n\ndo   so   unless       and   until   one     or   more    of    his    underlying\n\nconvictions have been invalidated.                Accord, e.g., Figueroa v.\n\nRivera, 147 F.3d 77, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1998).                    Recognizing this\n\nfact, Forte has filed a multitude of actions in state and\n\nfederal court seeking to accomplish that task--all without\n\navail.     A recent such effort consisted of a petition for\n\ndeclaratory relief which the state court denied in 2001 on\n\nstatute-of-limitations grounds.              Claiming that he is entitled\n\nunder Heck to a state-court adjudication of his constitutional\n\nclaims on the merits (as a foundation for a future § 1983\n\naction), Forte now seeks a federal court injunction compelling\n\nthe state court to undertake such review.                  The district court\n\ndismissed.    We affirm.\n\n             As   we    understand     his    argument,        Forte   apparently\n\nbelieves that § 1983 and Heck and the Due Process Clause, in\n\nconcert,    create       a   federal   right       to    have    constitutional\n\nchallenges to a conviction heard on the merits in state court--\n\na right enforceable by injunctive relief in federal court.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f  That belief would seem clearly misplaced.                Cf. Spencer v.\n\n  Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998) (rejecting view \"that a § 1983\n\n  action for damages must always and everywhere be available\").1\n\n  But we need not decide the point, inasmuch as Forte did obtain\n\n  substantive review of his claims as part of the collateral\n\n  proceeding brought under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30.             See Forte v.\n\n  Commonwealth,    429     Mass.   1019,   1020   (1999)   (rescript)   (so\n\n  noting).2    There is no conceivable basis for an injunction here\n\n  designed simply to provide Forte with a second round of such\n\n  review.     His complaint thus fails to state a claim upon which\n\n  relief can be granted.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         We note that there has been no suggestion here of any\n\"illegal blocking [of] access to state post-conviction remedies.\"\nHoard v. Reddy, 175 F.3d 531, 533 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S.\n970 (1999).\n     2\n        Forte's failure to obtain review by the state's highest\ncourt in that regard was due to his own dereliction. See Forte,\n429 Mass. at 1020 (\"Although he could have applied for further\nappellate review, he did not do so.\").\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
