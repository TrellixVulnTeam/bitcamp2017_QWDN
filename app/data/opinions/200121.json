Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Charles Palmer on brief pro se.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney and Peter E.\nPapps, First Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 30, 2003\n\f             Per Curiam. Charles Palmer was granted a certificate of\n\nappealability (\"COA\") by the district court to appeal from the\n\ndenial of his § 2255 motion as to the following issue: \"whether\n\nCounts I and IV were multiplicitous in violation of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause.\"      Because this issue was presented for the first\n\ntime in his § 2255 motion, it is procedurally defaulted.                     To\n\novercome that procedural default, Palmer must establish cause and\n\nprejudice. See Sustache-Rivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     In an attempt to meet that standard, Palmer claims\n\nineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented\n\nhim at trial and on appeal.\n\n             \"[F]ailure to raise a well-established, straightforward\n\nand   obvious     double     jeopardy    claim   constitutes     ineffective\n\nperformance\" sufficient to excuse a procedural default. Jackson v.\n\nLeonardo, 162 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 1998).        Here, however, the issue\n\nof whether the conduct charged in Counts Two and Four of Palmer's\n\nindictment     constitutes    a   single    conspiracy    or   two   separate\n\nconspiracies seems a close question at best and not \"clearly\n\nstronger   than   those    [issues]     presented\"   on   appeal.    Smith   v.\n\nRobbins, 528 U.S. 259, 288 (2000).\n\n             \"The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall\n\n'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of\n\nlife or limb. . . .'       U.S. Const. amend. V.      The Clause has three\n\naspects: it shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsame offense after either conviction or acquittal, and it also\n\nprohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\" United States\n\nv. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir. 1996).          Here, Palmer invokes\n\nthe Clause's protection against multiple punishments for the same\n\noffense. The parties agree that although Palmer received concurrent\n\nprison   sentences     on    Counts   One   and   Four,   the   $100    special\n\nassessments imposed for each count, pursuant to            18 U.S.C. § 3013,\n\nconstitute multiple punishments. See Rutledge v. United States, 517\n\nU.S. 292 (1996).\n\n           \"In determining whether two charged conspiracies that\n\nallege violations of the same substantive statute are actually the\n\nsame   offense   for    double   jeopardy    purposes,    we    consider      five\n\nfactors: (a) the time during which the activities occurred; (b) the\n\npersons involved; (c) the places involved; (d) whether the same\n\nevidence was used to prove the two conspiracies; and (e) whether\n\nthe same statutory provision was involved in both conspiracies.\"\n\nUnited States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 860 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           As to three of these factors, Counts One and Four are\n\nidentical: personnel, location and statutory provisions.                      Both\n\ncounts charge that Palmer conspired with Curtin to rob Sell's Mobil\n\nStation in Nashua, New Hampshire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951.\n\nHowever, the time frame for the two counts and the evidence\n\nsupporting   them      are   distinct.      Count   One   charges      that    the\n\nconspiracy occurred on February 4, 1998, while Count Four charges\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthat the conspiracy occurred on February 7, 1998.                    There is\n\nevidence from which two separate agreements to rob the same store\n\non those two dates could be established.\n\n              \"A single agreement to commit several crimes constitutes\n\none conspiracy.         By the same reasoning, multiple agreements to\n\ncommit separate crimes constitute multiple conspiracies.\" United\n\nStates v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1989).             Palmer's indictment\n\nalleged multiple agreements to commit separate robberies.                  The\n\nevidence, including Palmer's confession, supports a finding that\n\nthe agreement to rob Sell's Mobil Station on February 7, 1998, was\n\nseparate from the agreement to rob the same location on February 4,\n\n1998.    The       evidence   about   the   co-conspirators'     motives   and\n\ncircumstances could reasonably be interpreted to establish two\n\nseparate agreements, each arising from an immediate need for drugs\n\nto   support    their    addiction,   rather   than   a    single   agreement,\n\nextending over several days, to rob a specific store. See United\n\nStates v. Palmer 203 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir. 2000)(commenting that the\n\nco-conspirators \"conspired to rob the stores to feed their habits.\n\nThey did not follow normal patterns of behavior\").\n\n              Counsel's failure to raise this doubtful double jeopardy\n\nclaim, as Palmer requested, did not amount to deficient performance\n\nwhich,   by    a   \"reasonably   probability,\"     prevented     Palmer    from\n\nreceiving \"a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a\n\nverdict worthy of confidence.\" Prou, 199 F.3d at 49.             We also note\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat it is uncertain whether the prejudice claimed by Palmer (a\n\n$100 special assessment) would satisfy the applicable standard. See\n\nFields v. United States, 201 F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\n          Because Palmer is not entitled to collateral relief on\n\nthe single issue for which a COA was granted, the district court's\n\ndenial of Palmer's § 2255 motion is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
