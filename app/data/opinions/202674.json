José Antonio Fusté,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                    Gibson,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Francisco Valcárcel-Fuster, Assistant Federal Public\nDefender, with whom Hector L. Ramos-Vega, Assistant Federal\nPublic Defender, and Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public\nDefender, were on brief, for appellant.\n     José Capó-Iriarte, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n                           March 27, 2007\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Belen Nieves-Castaño was convicted\n\nof two weapons charges after a jury trial.        One conviction was for\n\nunlawful possession of a machine gun, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(o), while\n\nthe second was for the unlawful possession a firearm in a school\n\nzone, see id. § 922(q)(2)(A).          This court has not had any prior\n\noccasion to construe these statutory provisions in relation to the\n\nissues presented by this appeal.\n\n           Nieves-Castaño appeals both convictions.         She presents a\n\nnovel issue on appeal: whether the school-zone statute, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(q)(2)(A), is unconstitutionally void for vagueness under the\n\nFifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because it fails to specify\n\nhow to measure the 1000 foot distance from a school that marks the\n\nboundary of a school zone.        She also raises sufficiency of the\n\nevidence claims on both counts, along with a claim of instructional\n\nerror on the machine-gun charge. The constitutional claim, and the\n\nsufficiency claims, were raised by Rule 29 motions at trial and\n\nafter the verdict, and were properly preserved.\n\n           We reverse the conviction on the first count and direct\n\nentry of a verdict for the defendant.        The prosecution's evidence\n\nwas insufficient to establish the necessary mens era requirement\n\nunder Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 602 (1994).                We\n\naffirm   the   conviction   on   the    second   count,   and   reject   the\n\nconstitutional void-for-vagueness attack.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           Nieves-Castaño was sentenced to twenty-seven months of\n\nimprisonment on the first count, and to a consecutive sentence of\n\nthree months on the second count, for a total term of imprisonment\n\nof thirty months.        She was also sentenced to three years of\n\nsupervised release, concurrent as to each count.                   We remand the\n\ncase to the district court for resentencing in light of our\n\ndisposition of the first charge.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           Nieves-Castaño       lived       in   a   third-floor   apartment   in\n\nBuilding 9 of the Nemesio R. Canales Housing Project in Puerto\n\nRico.   She shared the apartment with her mother, her mother's\n\nschool-age child, and her own two minor sons.               On August 30, 2005,\n\na joint FBI and Puerto Rico police operation was investigating drug\n\nactivity at the housing project, and law enforcement officials\n\nobtained     and   executed    a     search      warrant   at   Nieves-Castaño's\n\napartment.\n\n           An      officer    with    the     Puerto    Rico    Police   Tactical\n\nOperations Unit was posted outside the building while the warrant\n\nwas being executed.      He saw Nieves-Castaño slide an old black golf\n\nbag off the rear balcony of her apartment and onto the ground.\n\nApparently she did this after the police knocked and announced\n\ntheir presence at her apartment door.                The officer retrieved the\n\ngolf bag, which contained an AK-47 rifle.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f              The police search of the apartment revealed no illegal\n\ndrugs or drug paraphernalia. After the defendant's arrest, she and\n\nher mother were taken to a government building, where agents\n\ninterviewed them.       One of the agents testified that Nieves-Castaño\n\nsaid she was storing the weapon in the golf bag at the request of\n\nsomeone named Alexis, a friend and the owner of the gun, who had\n\nasked that she hide it for him.          Nieves-Castaño told the agent she\n\nhad once opened the bag, looked in, and observed that there was a\n\nrifle in it, and that she knew it was an AK-47.                    She did not\n\ntestify at trial.\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.            Mens Rea That the Weapon Was a Machine Gun\n\n              On the machine-gun charge, the district court found that\n\nthere was sufficient evidence to prove the elements of the offense\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.         We review this determination de novo,\n\ntaking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,\n\nand making all reasonable inferences in the government's favor.\n\nUnited States v. Carucci, 364 F.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              The statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. § 922(o), provides\n\nin relevant part that \"it shall be unlawful for any person to\n\ntransfer or possess a machinegun.\"              Although ownership of the\n\nweapon   is    not   required   for    conviction,    see   United   States   v.\n\nEscobar-De     Jesus,    187    F.3d   148,   176    (1st   Cir.   1999),   mere\n\npossession of the weapon is insufficient. The government must also\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the weapon\n\n\"had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory\n\ndefinition of a machinegun.\"          Staples, 511 U.S. at 602 (discussing\n\na prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 5861(d) for possession of a machine\n\ngun).    Pertinently, the government's burden is to prove that the\n\ndefendant had knowledge of the characteristics that brought the gun\n\nwithin the statutory definition, and not that she had knowledge\n\nthat the gun was in fact considered a machine gun under federal\n\nlaw.    See id.\n\n            A machine gun is defined as \"any weapon which shoots, is\n\ndesigned    to    shoot,   or   can     be   readily   restored   to    shoot,\n\nautomatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a\n\nsingle function of the trigger.\"          26 U.S.C. § 5845(b); see also 18\n\nU.S.C. § 921(a)(23).\n\n            The government correctly accepts that Staples's scienter\n\nrequirement also applies to prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o).\n\nSee Rogers v. United States, 522 U.S. 252, 254 n.1 (1998).              One of\n\nthe rationales relied on in Staples for the mens rea requirement\n\nwas the potentially harsh penalty for violations of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5861(d) -- up to ten years' imprisonment.            511 U.S. at 616.    The\n\npenalty for violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(o) can also include a prison\n\nterm of up to ten years.        See 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2).\n\n            There is sufficient evidence, from the agent's testimony\n\nabout    the     defendant's    statements,    that    Nieves-Castaño     both\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fpossessed and knew there was a rifle in the golf bag, and that she\n\nlooked into the golf bag once and saw a rifle there.             There is also\n\nevidence that she knew the rifle was an AK-47.                 The question is\n\nwhether the government proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she\n\nknew this particular AK-47 had the characteristics of an automatic\n\nweapon.\n\n            The rifle involved here was the commercial version of the\n\nAK-47   military    weapon.      The     term   \"AK\"   comes    from    \"Automat\n\nKalashnikov,\" as the weapon was named after its Russian inventor,\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, who designed it in 1947.                  The commercial\n\nversion comes only as a semi-automatic weapon.\n\n            While an automatic weapon meets the definition of a\n\nmachine gun, a semi-automatic weapon does not.             Staples, 511 U.S.\n\nat 602 & n.1.      The commercial semi-automatic AK-47 cannot be made\n\ninto an automatic weapon without some modification or alteration to\n\ngive it automatic firing capability. Here the evidence established\n\nthat a modification had occurred through the alteration of internal\n\nparts. The only external evidence on the weapon of this alteration\n\nwas a small mark or hole.\n\n            The government's proof concentrated on expert testimony\n\nto the effect that this particular weapon had been modified in order\n\nto   make   it   capable   of   fully    automatic     fire.     This   evidence\n\nestablished that the weapon was an automatic weapon, but it did not\n\nestablish the defendant's mens rea.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f            An FBI agent determined that the rifle was operable and\n\nthat it had fully automatic firing capabilities.             However, his\n\ntestimony was that while members of law enforcement suspected the\n\ngun had been altered, they had to fire the weapon in order to\n\ndetermine that it was automatic.         This was done at a firing range.\n\nThere was no evidence that the defendant had ever fired the weapon.\n\n            The AK-47 was also examined by Minelly Hernandez-Suerta,\n\nan expert firearms examiner, who testified that the firearm had been\n\ntampered with in its internal mechanisms to make it capable of\n\nautomatic fire.    Hernandez-Suerta suspected that this AK-47 was an\n\nautomatic weapon because there was a hole or mark between the fire\n\nand safety settings of the weapon.          But she could not be certain\n\nuntil she had fired it on the range, or examined its internal\n\nmechanisms.    And she further testified that nothing in her tests\n\npermitted   her   to   conclude   that    Nieves-Castaño   had   ever   held,\n\ntouched, or fired the AK-47.        Additionally, while the small hole\n\nsuggested to Hernandez-Suerta that the weapon had been altered, she\n\ntestified that she drew this inference because, as an expert, she\n\nknew that this hole was identical to what one would see on the\n\nmilitary version of the AK-47.      Finally, the expert testified that\n\nif she had merely looked at the weapon, and had not noticed the\n\nsmall hole, she would have been unable to determine whether the\n\nweapon had been altered to fire automatically.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            The   requisite   mens    rea   may   be   established    by\n\ncircumstantial evidence, see Staples, 511 U.S. at 615 n.11, as the\n\ngovernment attempted here.    As an officer recounted at trial, the\n\ndefendant said in her interview that the gun was an AK-47 and that\n\nshe knew it was a rifle because on one occasion she had opened the\n\ngolf bag and saw the weapon inside.     The government sought to infer\n\nknowledge that the weapon was automatic from this fact.\n\n            Circumstantial evidence includes \"external indications\n\nsignaling the nature of the weapon.\" Id. But there was no evidence\n\nthat one would see, simply by looking into the golf bag, a small\n\nmark on the weapon between the fire and safety settings.1            And\n\nalthough that mark informed an expert that perhaps the weapon had\n\nbeen altered to make it fully automatic, there was no evidence that\n\nthis hole would have similarly tipped off a lay person about the\n\nweapon's capabilities -- if anything, the evidence was to the\n\ncontrary.    Importantly, there was no evidence that Nieves-Castaño\n\nhad any expertise in firearms.       Cf. United States v. Backer, 362\n\nF.3d 504, 507 (8th Cir. 2004) (sustaining conviction where the\n\ndefendant was a firearms collector); United States v. Morgan, 216\n\nF.3d 557, 567-68 (6th Cir. 2000) (sustaining conviction where the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The agent who first recovered the golf bag, and testified\nthat the bag was open, stated only that he could see there was a\nrifle in it. He made no mention of seeing the small hole on the\nweapon, or anything else in the bag.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fdefendant was a \"gun enthusiast\" and had admitted knowing that\n\nautomatic weapons have three selector switches).\n\n           This was also not a case where the defendant was shown to\n\nhave   fired   the   weapon,   a   circumstance   which   \"would   make   the\n\nregulated characteristics of the weapon immediately apparent.\"\n\nStaples, 511 U.S. at 615 n.11.\n\n           It is true that because Nieves-Castaño slid the bag off\n\nher terrace to avoid its discovery, the jury could infer that she\n\nhad guilty knowledge.      Yet knowledge that one is guilty of some\n\ncrime is not the same as knowledge that one is guilty of the crime\n\ncharged.   See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Bermudez, 857 F.2d\n\n50, 53 (1st Cir. 1988).            And while mere possession of a non-\n\nautomatic gun by a non-felon is not itself a federal crime, the\n\ncircumstances of this case suggest reasons for the defendant's\n\ndisposal efforts other than that she knew the gun was an automatic\n\nweapon.    She had, after all, been asked to hide the weapon.\n\nFurther, there was testimony that if the gun had turned out not to\n\nbe automatic, the defendant likely would have been charged with a\n\nfirearms offense under Puerto Rico law, which provides another\n\nexplanation for her actions.\n\n           Nor is this a case in which the defendant testified, so\n\nno question is raised about what inferences a jury may rationally\n\ndraw from its observation of testimony.            See United States v.\n\nSanders, 240 F.3d 1279, 1284 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding that \"mere\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdisbelief of the defendant's testimony is insufficient to carry the\n\ngovernment's burden as to knowledge,\" and reversing a jury verdict\n\nfor insufficiency of the government's mens rea evidence under 26\n\nU.S.C. § 5861(d)).\n\n          The government points out that the golf bag contained\n\nother items besides the weapon, specifically a drum magazine and two\n\nadditional clip-type magazines.    The government contends that an\n\ninference of mens rea could be drawn from these contents. But there\n\nwas no evidence linking the clip-type magazines to machine guns\n\nspecifically.   And while the government seems to argue that a drum\n\nmagazine would only or primarily be of use for an automatic weapon,\n\nthe record evidence was merely that such a drum magazine can be used\n\nwith a machine gun.2   Moreover, the evidence was ambiguous as to\n\nwhether a person would have seen the drum magazine in the golf bag,\n\nonce the bag was opened.   In any event, and most importantly, there\n\nwas no evidence that if a lay person had seen the drum magazine in\n\nthe bag, she would have identified it as such and known that it was\n\nmeant for automatic weapons, and then drawn the further conclusion\n\nthat the AK-47 must have been modified to be fully automatic.\n\n          It is true the weapon was found in the defendant's\n\napartment.   But there were no drugs or other drug paraphernalia to\n\n\n\n     2\n       The agent who discussed the drum magazine and clips was\nlater asked why he had a suspicion that this rifle had been\naltered. Tellingly, he did not mention the drum magazine or the\nclips as motivating his suspicion.\n\n                                -10-\n\findicate that its presence there was anything more than what the\n\ndefendant had said: that she had been asked to hold or hide it for\n\nsomeone else.\n\n            In our view, this evidence is simply insufficient to\n\nestablish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant's knowledge that\n\nthe rifle possessed the characteristics of an automatic weapon.                      No\n\nreasonable finder of fact could have reached a guilty verdict on the\n\nmachine-gun charge.        We reverse the verdict on Count One and direct\n\nentry of a verdict of acquittal.3\n\nB.    Constitutionality of the School-Zone Statute\n\n            We   turn   to    the   defendant's       appeal    from   her   second\n\nconviction.       The   statute     at   issue,   18    U.S.C.    §    922(q),   was\n\noriginally enacted as part of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 101-647, § 1702, 104 Stat. 4789, 4844-45.                    In its\n\ncurrent form, and subject to certain exceptions not pertinent here,\n\nthe   statute    applies     to   any    individual    who     \"knowingly    .   .    .\n\npossess[es] a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce at a place that the individual knows,\n\nor has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\"                   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(q)(2)(A). The current form of the statute contains amendments\n\nenacted in the aftermath of United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       Because we conclude that the evidence was insufficient, we\ndo not reach the claim of instructional error.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f(1995), to provide necessary connections to interstate commerce.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 657, 110 Stat. 3009, 3379 (1996).\n\n           The       school-zone      prohibition       is    based     on    explicit\n\ncongressional findings that firearms had increasingly been found in\n\nand around schools, that concern about these firearms could deter\n\nparents from sending their children to school, that the occurrence\n\nof violent crimes in school zones had resulted in a decline in the\n\nquality   of   education      (an   effect     having    an    adverse       impact    on\n\ncommerce),     and    that   states    and   localities       had     found    it   very\n\ndifficult to handle such gun-related crimes themselves.                         See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(q)(1).          For example, one news report counted that as\n\nof the early 1990s guns were used in and around schools in crimes\n\nof violence eight-hundred times a year. See C. Scanlan, Gun-Control\n\nFight Comes to Schools, Phila. Inquirer, May 30, 1993, at C2.                         The\n\noriginal 1990 statute encouraged state and local authorities to post\n\nsigns warning that the possession of firearms in a school zone was\n\nprohibited.      See Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, § 1702(b)(5),\n\n104 Stat. at 4845 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 922 note).\n\n           A \"school zone\" is defined by 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(25) as\n\n(A) \"the grounds of . . . a public, parochial[,] or private school;\"\n\nand (B) the area \"within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds\n\nof a public, parochial[,] or private school.\"                 This definition was\n\nalso part of the original Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.                          See\n\n§ 1702(b)(2), 104 Stat. at 4845.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f            Nieves-Castaño's      argument    is    that     the   statute     is\n\nunconstitutional on its face because it provides no objective\n\ncriteria for the measurement of the 1000 foot distance specified in\n\n§ 921(a)(25)(B).        Courts, including our own, have consistently\n\nrejected    due   process   vagueness      challenges   to    other   firearms\n\nprovisions in 18 U.S.C. § 922. See, e.g., United States v.

We have\n\nfound no cases mounting this particular challenge.\n\n            Our review of the constitutional challenge is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Caro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2005).                \"[A]\n\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague only if it 'prohibits . . . an\n\nact in terms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would\n\nhave   no   choice    but   to   guess   at   its   meaning    and    modes   of\n\napplication.'\"       United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2003)) (ellipsis in original); see also Bouie v.

Nieves-Castaño's\n\nconstitutional challenge fails because the statute itself adequately\n\nput her on notice that her possession of a firearm was unlawful.\n\nBy the clear terms of the statute, she could only have been\n\nconvicted if she knew or reasonably should have known that her\n\npossession of the firearm was within a school zone, and this\n\nscienter requirement ameliorates any vagueness concerns.         See Hill\n\nv. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (rejecting a vagueness\n\nchallenge to a statute that prevented individuals from \"knowingly\"\n\ncoming within eight feet of another person to engage in certain\n\nactions); see also Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14.\n\n          Further, the evaluation of the constitutionality of the\n\nstatute is also made in light of judicial constructions of the\n\nstatute. See Wainwright v. Stone, 414 U.S. 21, 22-23 (1973). There\n\nis ample relevant judicial construction, here and elsewhere, that\n\nremoves any vagueness concerns.        One example suffices.   In United\n\nStates v. Soler, 275 F.3d 146 (1st Cir. 2002), this court provided\n\nsuch a construction. We held that \"the government must prove beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the distance from a school to the actual\n\nsite of the [prohibited] transaction, not merely to the curtilage\n\nor exterior wall of the structure in which the transaction takes\n\nplace, is 1,000 feet or less.\"        Id. at 154.   Soler also endorsed a\n\nstraight-line method of measurement, rather than pedestrian-route\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fmeasurements.         Id. at 155 n.6; accord United States v. Henderson,\n\n320 F.3d 92, 103 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              The Soler holding was under 21 U.S.C. § 860(a), which\n\ndeals with drug offenses that occur \"within one thousand feet of []\n\nthe real property comprising\" a school.                    Nonetheless, it provides\n\nnotice pertinent to the construction of the statute at issue here,\n\nwhich   defines       a    school    zone    very   similarly.         See    18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 921(a)(25) (defining a school zone as comprising the area \"within\n\na distance of 1,000 feet from [school] grounds\").\n\n              Thus,       the    statute   both    gives    fair   notice     to    people\n\npotentially subject to it and adequately guards against arbitrary\n\nand   discriminatory            enforcement.       Cf.   Papachristou        v.    City   of\n\nJacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 170-71 (1972) (municipal vagrancy law\n\nheld void for vagueness because it permitted arbitrary enforcement);\n\n1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 2.3(b),(c), at 146, 150 (2d\n\ned. 2003).     No First Amendment interests are involved in the case.\n\nCf. 1 LaFave, supra, § 2.3(d), at 152-53.                    Nor is there any risk\n\nthat a trial court could not properly instruct a jury.                             Cf. id.\n\n§   2.3(c),    at     150-51.        Nor   does    it    raise   any   concerns      about\n\nundercutting the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement. Cf.\n\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 361 & n.10 (1983) (holding that\n\na modified stop and identify statute was void on vagueness grounds,\n\nand declining to reach Fourth Amendment arguments against the\n\nstatute's validity).\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f           In the end, the defendant's argument devolves into a claim\n\nthat the government's evidence was insufficient to show that the\n\ndefendant possessed a firearm within 1000 feet of a school's\n\ngrounds.   That claim fails.   As Soler held, \"[p]recise measurements\n\nmay be unnecessary in some cases where the spatial leeway is\n\nrelatively great and the gap in the claim of proof is relatively\n\nsmall.\" 275 F.3d at 154. Here, three minor children lived with the\n\ndefendant, and it would be easy for a jury to conclude that she knew\n\nthere were two schools nearby, within or just outside her housing\n\nproject and less than 1000 feet away, and that she regularly passed\n\nby those schools.    One school was, in fact, located next to the\n\nsouth entrance of the housing project.    The prosecution's evidence\n\nwas that the distance from the main fence of that school to the\n\ncorner of Building 9 was 636 feet, and that the distance from the\n\nentrance of the school to that same corner was 670 feet. The record\n\nshows that the other school was even closer.    The distance from the\n\ncorner of Building 9 to that school's fence was 473 feet, and the\n\ndistance to its entrance was 550 feet.    The measurements were made\n\nusing a small wheel-like device commonly used to measure forensic\n\ncrime scenes.4   The government also introduced an aerial photograph\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       It appears from the record that the government measured the\ndistance using a pedestrian route.         Under a straight-line\nmeasurement, the defendant's apartment would actually be closer to\nthe schools than what the government's measurements indicated.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fshowing the location of the schools and the defendant's apartment,\n\nwhich was entirely consistent with the measurements.\n\n          Whatever the fine points about measurement, there was\n\nleeway -- before reaching the 1000 foot mark -- of at least 330 feet\n\nbetween one of the schools and Building 9.      This was more than\n\nsufficient to cover any refinements in the horizontal and vertical\n\nmeasurement needed to account for the distance between the corner\n\nof Building 9 and Nieves-Castaño's apartment.     The conviction on\n\nCount Two is affirmed.\n\n                                III.\n\n          We vacate the conviction on Count One and direct entry of\n\njudgment of acquittal on that count.    We affirm the conviction on\n\nCount Two and reject the claim that the school-zone firearms\n\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(2)(A), is unconstitutionally void for\n\nvagueness.   We also reject the claim that the government's evidence\n\nwas insufficient to convict the defendant of this second charge.\n\nWe remand to the district court for re-sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

She presents a novel issue on appeal: whether the school-zone statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(2)(A), is unconstitutionally void for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because it fails to specify how to measure the 1000 foot distance from a school that marks the boundary of a school zone. She also raises sufficiency of the evidence claims on both counts, along with a claim of instructional error on the machine-gun charge. The constitutional claim, and the sufficiency claims, were raised by Rule 29 motions at trial and after the verdict, and were properly preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the conviction on the first count and direct entry of a verdict for the defendant. The prosecution's evidence was insufficient to establish the necessary mens rea requirement under <i>Staples v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 600, 602, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994).

She was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, concurrent as to each count. We remand the case to the district court for resentencing in light of our disposition of the first charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves-Casta&#241;o lived in a third-floor apartment in Building 9 of the Nemesio R. Canales Housing Project in Puerto Rico. She shared the apartment with her mother, her mother's school-age child, and her own two minor sons. On August 30, 2005, a joint FBI and Puerto Rico police operation was investigating drug activity at the housing project, and law enforcement officials obtained and executed a search warrant at Nieves-Casta&#241;o's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An officer with the Puerto Rico Police Tactical Operations Unit was posted outside the building while the warrant was being executed. He saw Nieves-Casta&#241;o slide an old black golf bag off the rear balcony of her apartment and onto the ground. Apparently she did this after the police knocked and announced their presence at her apartment door. The officer retrieved the golf bag, which contained an AK-47 rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police search of the apartment revealed no illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia. After the defendant's arrest, she and her mother were taken to a government building, where agents interviewed them. One of the agents testified that Nieves-Casta&#241;o said she was storing the weapon in the golf bag at the request of someone named Alexis, a friend and the owner of the gun, who had asked that she hide it for him. Nieves-Casta&#241;o told the agent she had once opened the bag, looked in, and observed that there was a rifle in it, and that she knew it was an AK-47. She did not testify at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Mens Rea That the Weapon Was a Machine Gun</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the machine-gun charge, the district court found that there was sufficient evidence to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We review this determination de novo, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and making all reasonable inferences in the government's favor. <i>United States v. Carucci,</i> 364 F.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(o), provides in relevant part that \"it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.\" Although ownership of the weapon is not required for conviction, <i>see United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 176 (1st Cir. 1999), mere possession of the weapon is insufficient. The government must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the weapon \"had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun.\" <i>Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 602, 114 S.Ct. 1793 (discussing a prosecution under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) for possession of a machine gun). Pertinently, the government's burden is to prove that the defendant had knowledge of the characteristics that brought the gun within the statutory definition, and not that she had knowledge that the gun was in fact considered a machine gun under federal law. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A machine gun is defined as \"any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(b); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(23).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government correctly accepts that <i>Staples's</i> scienter requirement also applies to prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(o). <i>See Rogers v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 252, 254 n. 1, 118 S.Ct. 673, 139 L.Ed.2d 686 (1998). One of the rationales relied on in <i>Staples</i> for the mens rea requirement was the potentially harsh penalty for violations of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) &#8212; up to ten years' imprisonment. 511 U.S. at 616, 114 S.Ct. 1793. The penalty for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(o) can also include a prison term of up to ten years. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is sufficient evidence, from the agent's testimony about the defendant's statements, that Nieves-Casta&#241;o both possessed and knew there was a rifle in the golf bag, and that she looked into the golf bag once and saw a rifle there. There is also evidence that she knew the rifle was an AK-47. The question is whether the government proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she knew this particular AK-47 had the characteristics of an automatic weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rifle involved here was the commercial version of the AK-47 military weapon. The term \"AK\" comes from \"Automat Kalashnikov,\" as the weapon was named after its Russian inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, who designed it in 1947. The commercial version comes only as a semi-automatic weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an automatic weapon meets the definition of a machine gun, a semi-automatic weapon does not. <i>Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 602, 114 S.Ct. 1793 &amp; n. 1. The commercial semi-automatic AK-47 cannot be made into an automatic weapon without some modification or alteration to give it automatic firing capability. Here the evidence established that a modification had occurred through the alteration of internal parts. The only external evidence on the weapon of this alteration was a small mark or hole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's proof concentrated on expert testimony to the effect that this particular weapon had been modified in order to make it capable of fully automatic fire. This evidence established that the weapon was an automatic weapon, but it did not establish the defendant's mens rea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An FBI agent determined that the rifle was operable and that it had fully automatic firing capabilities. However, his testimony was that while members of law enforcement suspected the gun had been altered, they had to fire the weapon in order to determine that it was automatic. This was done at a firing range. There was no evidence that the defendant had ever fired the weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AK-47 was also examined by Minelly Hernandez-Suerta, an expert firearms examiner, who testified that the firearm had been tampered with in its internal mechanisms to make it capable of automatic fire. Hernandez-Suerta suspected that this AK-47 was an automatic weapon because there was a hole or mark between the fire and safety settings of the weapon. But she could not be certain until she had fired it on the range, or examined its internal mechanisms. And she further testified that nothing in her tests permitted her to conclude that Nieves-Casta&#241;o had ever held, touched, or fired the AK-47. Additionally, while the small hole suggested to Hernandez-Suerta that the weapon had been altered, she testified that she drew this inference because, as an expert, she knew that this hole was identical to what one would see on the military version of the AK-47. Finally, the expert testified that if she had merely looked at the weapon, and had not noticed the small hole, she would have been unable to determine whether the weapon had been altered to fire automatically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requisite mens rea may be established by circumstantial evidence, <i>see Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 615, 114 S.Ct. 1793 n. 11, as the government attempted here. As an officer recounted at trial, the defendant said in her interview that the gun was an AK-47 and that she knew it was a rifle because on one occasion she had opened the golf bag and saw the weapon inside. The government sought to infer knowledge that the weapon was automatic from this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Circumstantial evidence includes \"external indications signaling the nature of the weapon.\" <i>Id.</i> But there was no evidence that one would see, <i>simply by looking into the golf bag,</i> a small mark on the weapon between the fire and safety settings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> And although that mark informed an expert that perhaps the weapon had been altered to make it fully automatic, there was no evidence that this hole would have similarly tipped off a lay person about the weapon's capabilities &#8212; if anything, the evidence was to the contrary. Importantly, there was no evidence that Nieves-Casta&#241;o had any expertise in firearms. <i>Cf. United States v. Backer,</i> 362 F.3d 504, 507 (8th Cir.2004) (sustaining conviction where the defendant was a firearms collector); <i>United States v. Morgan,</i> 216 F.3d 557, 567-68 (6th Cir.2000) (sustaining conviction where the defendant was a \"gun enthusiast\" and had admitted knowing that automatic weapons have three selector switches).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was also not a case where the defendant was shown to have fired the weapon, a circumstance which \"would make the regulated characteristics of the weapon immediately apparent.\" <i>Staples,</i> 511 U.S. at 615, 114 S.Ct. 1793 n. 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that because Nieves-Casta&#241;o slid the bag off her terrace to avoid its discovery, the jury could infer that she had guilty knowledge. Yet knowledge that one is guilty of <i>some</i> crime is not the same as knowledge that one is guilty of the crime <i>charged. See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez-Bermudez,</i> 857 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1988). And while mere possession of a non-automatic gun by a non-felon is not itself a federal crime, the circumstances of this case suggest reasons for the defendant's disposal efforts other than that she knew the gun was an automatic weapon. She had, after all, been asked to hide the weapon. Further, there was testimony that if the gun had turned out not to be automatic, the defendant likely would have been charged with a firearms offense under Puerto Rico law, which provides another explanation for her actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this a case in which the defendant testified, so no question is raised about what inferences a jury may rationally draw from its observation of testimony. <i>See United States v. Sanders,</i> 240 F.3d 1279, 1284 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that \"mere disbelief of the defendant's testimony is insufficient to carry the government's burden as to knowledge,\" and reversing a jury verdict for insufficiency of the government's mens rea evidence under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points out that the golf bag contained other items besides the weapon, specifically a drum magazine and two additional clip-type magazines. The government contends that an inference of mens rea could be drawn from these contents. But there was no evidence linking the clip-type magazines to machine guns specifically. And while the government seems to argue that a drum magazine would <i>only</i> or <i>primarily</i> be of use for an automatic weapon, the record evidence was merely that such a drum magazine <i>can</i> be used with a machine gun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Moreover, the evidence was ambiguous as to whether a person would have seen the drum magazine in the golf bag, once the bag was opened. In any event, and most importantly, there was no evidence that if a lay person had seen the drum magazine in the bag, she would have identified it as such and known that it was meant for automatic weapons, and then drawn the further conclusion that the AK-47 must have been modified to be fully automatic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true the weapon was found in the defendant's apartment. But there were no drugs or other drug paraphernalia to indicate that its presence there was anything more than what the defendant had said: that she had been asked to hold or hide it for someone else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this evidence is simply insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant's knowledge that the rifle possessed the characteristics of an automatic weapon. No reasonable finder of fact could have reached a guilty verdict on the machine-gun charge. We reverse the verdict on Count One and direct entry of a verdict of acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Constitutionality of the School-Zone Statute</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the defendant's appeal from her second conviction. The statute at issue, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q), was originally enacted as part of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 101-647, &#167; 1702, 104 Stat. 4789, 4844-45. In its current form, and subject to certain exceptions not pertinent here, the statute applies to any individual who \"knowingly . . . possess[es] a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(2)(A). The current form of the statute contains amendments enacted in the aftermath of <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), to provide necessary connections to interstate commerce. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 657, 110 Stat. 3009, 3379 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school-zone prohibition is based on explicit congressional findings that firearms had increasingly been found in and around schools, that concern about these firearms could deter parents from sending their children to school, that the occurrence of violent crimes in school zones had resulted in a decline in the quality of education (an effect having an adverse impact on commerce), and that states and localities had found it very difficult to handle such gun-related crimes themselves. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(1). For example, one news report counted that as of the early 1990s guns were used in and around schools in crimes of violence eight-hundred times a year. <i>See</i> C. Scanlan, Gun-Control Fight Comes to Schools, <i>Phila. Inquirer,</i> May 30, 1993, at C2. The original 1990 statute encouraged state and local authorities to post signs warning that the possession of firearms in a school zone was prohibited. <i>See</i> Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, &#167; 1702(b)(5), 104 Stat. at 4845 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922 note).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"school zone\" is defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(25) as (A) \"the grounds of . . . a public, parochial[,] or private school;\" and (B) the area \"within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial[,] or private school.\" This definition was also part of the original Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. <i>See</i> &#167; 1702(b)(2), 104 Stat. at 4845.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves-Casta&#241;o's argument is that the statute is unconstitutional on its face because it provides no objective criteria for the measurement of the 1000 foot distance specified in &#167; 921(a)(25)(B). Courts, including our own, have consistently rejected due process vagueness challenges to other firearms provisions in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pfeifer,</i> 371 F.3d 430, 437-38 (8th Cir.2004) (rejecting a challenge to the provision criminalizing weapons possession after a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence); <i>White v. Dep't of Justice,</i> 328 F.3d 1361, 1368-69 (Fed.Cir.2003) (same); <i>United States v. Kavoukian,</i> 315 F.3d 139, 145 (2d Cir.2002) (same); <i>United States v. Meade,</i> 175 F.3d 215, 222 (1st Cir.1999) (same); <i>United States v. Purdy,</i> 264 F.3d 809, 811-13 (9th Cir.2001) (rejecting a challenge to the provision criminalizing possession of a weapon while being an unlawful user of controlled substances). We have found no cases mounting this particular challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the constitutional challenge is de novo. <i>United States v. Caro-Mu&#241;iz,</i> 406 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2005). \"[A] statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it `prohibits . . . an act in terms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.'\" <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc) (quoting <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2003)) (ellipsis in original); <i>see also Bouie v. City of Columbia,</i> 378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). Nieves-Casta&#241;o's constitutional challenge fails because the statute itself adequately put her on notice that her possession of a firearm was unlawful. By the clear terms of the statute, she could only have been convicted if she knew or reasonably should have known that her possession of the firearm was within a school zone, and this scienter requirement ameliorates any vagueness concerns. <i>See Hill v. Colorado,</i> 530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (rejecting a vagueness challenge to a statute that prevented individuals from \"knowingly\" coming within eight feet of another person to engage in certain actions); <i>see also Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the evaluation of the constitutionality of the statute is also made in light of judicial constructions of the statute. <i>See Wainwright v. Stone,</i> 414 U.S. 21, 22-23, 94 S.Ct. 190, 38 L.Ed.2d 179 (1973). There is ample relevant judicial construction, here and elsewhere, that removes any vagueness concerns. One example suffices. In <i>United States v. Soler,</i> 275 F.3d 146 (1st Cir.2002), this court provided such a construction. We held that \"the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the distance from a school to the actual site of the [prohibited] transaction, not merely to the curtilage or exterior wall of the structure in which the transaction takes place, is 1,000 feet or less.\" <i>Id.</i> at 154. <i>Soler</i> also endorsed a straight-line method of measurement, rather than pedestrian-route measurements. <i>Id.</i> at 155 n. 6; <i>accord United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 103 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Soler</i> holding was under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a), which deals with drug offenses that occur \"within one thousand feet of [ ] the real property comprising\" a school. Nonetheless, it provides notice pertinent to the construction of the statute at issue here, which defines a school zone very similarly. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(25) (defining a school zone as comprising the area \"within a distance of 1,000 feet from [school] grounds\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the statute both gives fair notice to people potentially subject to it and adequately guards against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <i>Cf. Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville,</i> 405 U.S. 156, 170-71, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972) (municipal vagrancy law held void for vagueness because it permitted arbitrary enforcement); 1 W. LaFave, <i>Substantive Criminal Law</i> &#167; 2.3(b),(c), at 146, 150 (2d ed.2003). No First Amendment interests are involved in the case. <i>Cf.</i> 1 LaFave, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2.3(d), at 152-53. Nor is there any risk that a trial court could not properly instruct a jury. <i>Cf. id.</i> &#167; 2.3(c), at 150-51. Nor does it raise any concerns about undercutting the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement. <i>Cf. Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 361 &amp; n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983) (holding that a modified stop and identify statute was void on vagueness grounds, and declining to reach Fourth Amendment arguments against the statute's validity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the defendant's argument devolves into a claim that the government's evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant possessed a firearm within 1000 feet of a school's grounds. That claim fails. As <i>Soler</i> held, \"[p]recise measurements may be unnecessary in some cases where the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the claim of proof is relatively small.\" 275 F.3d at 154. Here, three minor children lived with the defendant, and it would be easy for a jury to conclude that she knew there were two schools nearby, within or just outside her housing project and less than 1000 feet away, and that she regularly passed by those schools. One school was, in fact, located next to the south entrance of the housing project. The prosecution's evidence was that the distance from the main fence of that school to the corner of Building 9 was 636 feet, and that the distance from the entrance of the school to that same corner was 670 feet. The record shows that the other school was even closer. The distance from the corner of Building 9 to that school's fence was 473 feet, and the distance to its entrance was 550 feet. The measurements were made using a small wheel-like device commonly used to measure forensic crime scenes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government also introduced an aerial photograph showing the location of the schools and the defendant's apartment, which was entirely consistent with the measurements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the fine points about measurement, there was leeway &#8212; before reaching the 1000 foot mark &#8212; of at least 330 feet between one of the schools and Building 9. This was more than sufficient to cover any refinements in the horizontal and vertical measurement needed to account for the distance between the corner of Building 9 and Nieves-Casta&#241;o's apartment. The conviction on Count Two is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate the conviction on Count One and direct entry of judgment of acquittal on that count. We affirm the conviction on Count Two and reject the claim that the school-zone firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(2)(A), is unconstitutionally void for vagueness. We also reject the claim that the government's evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of this second charge.

The commercial semi-automatic AK-47 cannot be made into an automatic weapon without some modification or alteration to give it automatic firing capability.

But she could not be certain until she had fired it on the range, or examined its internal mechanisms.

Additionally, while the small hole suggested to Hernandez-Suerta that the weapon had been altered, she testified that she drew this inference because, as an expert, she knew that this hole was identical to what one would see on the military version of the AK-47.

In any event, and most importantly, there was no evidence that if a lay person had seen the drum magazine in the bag, she would have identified it as such and known that it was meant for automatic weapons, and then drawn the further conclusion that the AK-47 must have been modified to be fully automatic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true the weapon was found in the defendant's apartment.

As <i>Soler</i> held, \"[p]recise measurements may be unnecessary in some cases where the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the claim of proof is relatively small.\" 275 F.3d at 154. Here, three minor children lived with the defendant, and it would be easy for a jury to conclude that she knew there were two schools nearby, within or just outside her housing project and less than 1000 feet away, and that she regularly passed by those schools. One school was, in fact, located next to the south entrance of the housing project. The prosecution's evidence was that the distance from the main fence of that school to the corner of Building 9 was 636 feet, and that the distance from the entrance of the school to that same corner was 670 feet. The record shows that the other school was even closer. The distance from the corner of Building 9 to that school's fence was 473 feet, and the distance to its entrance was 550 feet. The measurements were made using a small wheel-like device commonly used to measure forensic crime scenes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government also introduced an aerial photograph showing the location of the schools and the defendant's apartment, which was entirely consistent with the measurements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the fine points about measurement, there was leeway &#8212; before reaching the 1000 foot mark &#8212; of at least 330 feet between one of the schools and Building 9. This was more than sufficient to cover any refinements in the horizontal and vertical measurement needed to account for the distance between the corner of Building 9 and Nieves-Casta&#241;o's apartment. The conviction on Count Two is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate the conviction on Count One and direct entry of judgment of acquittal on that count. We affirm the conviction on Count Two and reject the claim that the school-zone firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(2)(A), is unconstitutionally void for vagueness. We also reject the claim that the government's evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of this second charge. We remand to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The agent who first recovered the golf bag, and testified that the bag was open, stated only that he could see there was a rifle in it.
