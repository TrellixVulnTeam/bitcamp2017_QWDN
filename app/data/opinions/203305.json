Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                               May 23, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of   the   Northern      District      of    Florida,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           Per Curiam.         This is a sentencing appeal.            Clint Joseph\n\npled   guilty     in   December      2003   to   possession     with     intent     to\n\ndistribute   five      grams    or   more   of    cocaine     base.      21   U.S.C.\n\n§§   841(a)(1),    841(b)(1)(B)(iii).            On   March   19,     2004,   he   was\n\nsentenced to eighty-seven months' imprisonment, five years of\n\nsupervised release, and a special assessment of $100. The sentence\n\nwas at the low end of the Guidelines range.                   The court rejected\n\nJoseph's argument that he receive the mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nsixty months.\n\n           The sentence was imposed before the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). Joseph's\n\nfirst argument is that his sentence should be vacated and the case\n\nremanded to the sentencing court under Booker.                But Joseph plainly\n\ndoes not meet the standards for such a remand under the circuit's\n\nplain error standard for unpreserved claims of Booker error, set\n\nout in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   We affirm his sentence.\n\n           Joseph also argues the case should be remanded in light\n\nof two arguments he has never presented to the district court.\n\nFirst, he argues that he should be resentenced in light of a recent\n\namendment to the Sentencing Guidelines reducing the base offense\n\nlevel for most crack cocaine offenses.                See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1; id.\n\napp. C, amend. 711 (effective Nov. 1. 2007).                  On March 3, 2008,\n\nthis amendment to the Guidelines was made retroactive, which allows\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdefendant to file a post-sentencing motion with the district court\n\nto modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).      See id. §\n\n1B1.10.   Second, he argues that the Guideline which makes the\n\namendment retroactive, section 1B1.10, is itself unconstitutional,\n\nbecause according to Joseph, the provision provides limitations on\n\nthe court's discretion once the court calculates the amended\n\nGuidelines range.\n\n          If Joseph so chooses, he may file appropriate motions to\n\nraise these issues in the district court. Nothing in this judgment\n\nprecludes that.    We simply affirm his original sentence and remand\n\nthe matter to the district court to entertain any motions defendant\n\nmay promptly file.   See United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 197\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
