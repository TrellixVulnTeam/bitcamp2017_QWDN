The government has moved for summary\n\ndisposition in this direct criminal appeal filed by Charles\n\nWilkerson.        We        grant    the       motion        and   summarily        affirm\n\nWilkerson's conviction and sentence.\n\n              Although Wilkerson argues that the district court\n\nerred in concluding that it lacked the authority to depart\n\ndownward      based    on    Wilkerson's         extraordinary         childhood       and\n\nfamily     circumstances,            we       need     not     reach       that     issue.\n\nWilkerson's sentence was required by statute to be not less\n\nthan ten years' imprisonment, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), and ten\n\nyears    is   what     he    received.

See United States v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (discussing 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(e) and (f)).\n\n              Wilkerson also claims that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying his second motion for a new trial.\n\nThe   four     pieces       of   allegedly           newly     discovered         evidence\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fproffered by Wilkerson involved cumulative impeachment evidence\n\nof   a   government    witness.       In   light   of    the   substantial\n\nimpeachment evidence already used against that witness and the\n\nstrong    evidence    against   Wilkerson,    cumulative       impeachment\n\nevidence, specifically an undisclosed portion of the witness's\n\nprior grand jury testimony, did not result in any prejudice to\n\nWilkerson in violation of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b),\n\nand therefore, did not warrant a new trial.             See United States\n\nv. Izzi, 613 F.2d 1205, 1213 (1st Cir. 1980).             Similarly, that\n\nundisclosed     portion   of    the    witness's    prior      grand   jury\n\ntestimony, as well as other cumulative impeachment evidence\n\nregarding the dismissal of a prior traffic violation, did not\n\nresult in any prejudice to Wilkerson in violation of Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and therefore, did not warrant a\n\nnew trial. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552,\n\n559-60 (1st Cir. 1999).         Likewise, evidence of the witness's\n\nprior    drug   involvement     and    post-trial       loan   application\n\nconstituted cumulative impeachment evidence, and therefore, did\n\nnot result in any prejudice to Wilkerson to warrant a new trial\n\nunder Fed.
