Defendants    Angel    González-Méndez\n\n(“González”), Rafael Fernández-Hernández (“Fernández”), and Julio\n\nRosario-Otero (“Rosario”) (collectively, “Defendants”) appeal from\n\ntheir convictions after jury trial.             Defendants were convicted of\n\nvarious     conspiracy    and     drug     charges    arising       out    of   their\n\ninvolvement with a large drug distribution organization, which\n\noperated under the name “Los Dementes” and was based in the Juana\n\nMatos public housing project in the Cataño area of Puerto Rico.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, 860.            González and Fernández were\n\nalso convicted of gun charges, arising out of, inter alia, their\n\ninvolvement in the April 25, 2004 killing of three unintended\n\nvictims on a public highway in a botched attempt to assassinate a\n\nrival gang leader.       See 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c), (o).          Their sentences\n\nincluded    prison   terms   of     life   in   the   cases    of    González    and\n\nFernández, and in Rosario’s case, of 151 months.                          On appeal,\n\nDefendants assert numerous challenges to the conduct of their trial\n\nand imposition of their sentences, some raised by counsel, others\n\nin pro se briefs.     In the case of Rosario, we find that while the\n\nevidence was sufficient to support his involvement in crimes of\n\ndrug conspiracy and distribution, it did not support the jury’s\n\nfindings of elevated quantities of drugs.               Otherwise, we find no\n\nerror as to any defendant that would support overturning the\n\njudgment.     The judgment is therefore affirmed in part, vacated in\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpart, and the case remanded to the district court for re-sentencing\n\nof Rosario.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n     On October 25, 2007, a grand jury returned a seven-count\n\nindictment charging sixty-three individuals with participation in\n\na conspiracy dating from 1998 through 2007 to distribute narcotics\n\nat street level in the Cataño and Guaynabo areas of Puerto Rico.\n\nCarlos-Croz Mojica, a/k/a “Hueso,” was identified as the principal\n\nleader of the drug-selling organization, which used the name “Los\n\nDementes.”      The indictment identified the Juana Matos Public\n\nHousing Project (“Juana Matos”) as its base of operations, where\n\nLos Dementes members used apartments to “store, package, and\n\nprocess”     narcotics,   including    heroin,   cocaine,   cocaine   base\n\n(“crack-cocaine”), and marijuana, for sale at drug points located\n\ninside and outside Juana Matos.\n\n     On August 22, 2008, a grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment, which in major part repeated the charges asserted in\n\nthe earlier indictment.        It charged González, Fernández, and\n\nRosario, among other co-defendants, with: (1) conspiracy to possess\n\ncontrolled substances with intent to distribute, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, 860 (Count I); (2) aiding and abetting\n\nthe possession with intent to distribute of (i) at least one\n\nkilogram of heroin, (ii) at least fifty grams of crack-cocaine,\n\n(iii) at least five kilograms of cocaine, and (iv) a detectable\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\famount of marijuana, within 1000 feet of a public housing project\n\nor school,1 in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 860 (Counts II\n\n- V); and (3) using or carrying a firearm “during and in relation\n\nto any . . . drug trafficking crime,” in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A) (Count VI), and conspiring to commit an offense under\n\n§ 924(c), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(o) (Count VII).      The\n\nonly offense charged in the superseding indictment that was not\n\ncharged in the original indictment was Count VII, conspiracy under\n\n§ 924(o) to use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking crime. The superseding indictment charged, as an overt\n\nact in furtherance of this conspiracy, that: “[O]n or about April\n\n25, 2004, in Cataño, Dorado, and elsewhere within Puerto Rico,”\n\ndefendants, including Gonzales and Fernández, “carried and used\n\nfirearms, to include fully automatic pistols and rifles (machine\n\nguns).”   (In relation to this overt act, the government’s evidence\n\nat trial showed that González and Fernández, along with other Los\n\nDementes members, killed three bystanders in a failed attempt to\n\nmurder a rival gang leader.)\n\n     Most of the defendants named in the indictments pled guilty.\n\nGonzález, Fernández, and Rosario proceeded to trial on October 1,\n\n\n1\n  21 U.S.C. § 860 establishes enhanced penalties for “[a]ny person\nwho violates section 841(a)(1) . . . by distributing, possessing\nwith intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled substance\nin or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real property\ncomprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary\nschool or . . . housing facility owned by a public housing\nauthority . . . .” 21 U.S.C. § 860(a).\n\n                                -4-\n\f2008.   The government’s theory was that González, prior to his\n\narrest for bank robbery in 2004, owned a drug point outside of\n\nJuana Matos in the Vietnam Ward in Cataño and that he operated this\n\ndrug point as part of the Los Dementes organization; that Fernández\n\nwas a seller and enforcer for Los Dementes, working principally at\n\nGonzález’s Vietnam Ward drug point and eventually taking over that\n\noperation; and that Rosario was also a member of Los Dementes, who\n\nowned a drug point outside of Juana Matos in either the Amelia or\n\nthe Vietnam Ward.\n\n     At trial, the government presented the testimony of several\n\nFBI agents and Puerto Rico Police Department (“PRPD”) officers who\n\nwere tasked to the Los Dementes investigation.       They testified to,\n\ninter alia, surveillance, controlled buys, and the seizure of\n\ndrugs, cash, and weapons at the Juana Matos housing complex.          The\n\ngovernment’s evidence linking Defendants to the conspiracy was\n\nprimarily the testimony of three cooperating witnesses: Alexis\n\nGarcía-Heredia, a Los Dementes member, who testified to selling\n\ndrugs   at   González’s   drug   point   in    the   Vietnam   Ward   and\n\nparticipating with González and Fernández in the April 2004 killing\n\n(he was one of the shooters); William Rosario-Garcia (“William\n\nRosario”), a co-defendant, who testified for the government to\n\nperforming various errands on behalf of Los Dementes members at\n\nJuana Matos; and Joaquin Casiano, an informant placed by the FBI in\n\nJuana Matos for several months in 2005.       We discuss the evidence at\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\ftrial in greater detail in connection with the Defendants’ various\n\nclaims of error.\n\n     Following Rule 29 motions, the court dismissed the gun charges\n\n(counts VI and VII) against Rosario for insufficient evidence.              It\n\nalso dismissed the claim for forfeiture against all the defendants\n\n(count XIII). On October 17, 2008, after approximately ten days of\n\ntrial,   the   jury   returned     guilty   verdicts    against   all   three\n\ndefendants. It found González guilty of the conspiracy charge, the\n\nsubstantive heroin, crack-cocaine, and cocaine charges, and the gun\n\ncharges under §§ 924(c) & (o).        Fernández was found guilty of the\n\nsame, excepting the heroin charge, of which he was acquitted.\n\nRosario was found guilty of the conspiracy and the substantive\n\ncocaine and crack-cocaine charges.2         On the marijuana charge, all\n\nthree defendants were acquitted.\n\n     The court held sentencing hearings on February 2, 2009.               In\n\ndetermining    González’s    and   Fernández’s    guidelines      range,   the\n\ndistrict   court   applied   United    States    Sentencing   Guidelines     §\n\n2D1.1(d), the “murder cross-reference,” which provides: “If a\n\nvictim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1111 . . . apply [the level for first or second\n\ndegree murder] as appropriate . . . .”                 The court sentenced\n\n\n2\n  On each of the substantive drug counts, the jury convicted\nDefendants of possessing with intent to distribute specified drug\nquantities: at least one hundred fifty grams of crack-cocaine, at\nleast five kilograms of cocaine, and as to González, at least one\nkilogram of heroin.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fGonzález and Fernández to life imprisonment.          The court sentenced\n\nRosario to 151 months imprisonment, which was above the statutory\n\nmandatory   minimum   of   ten   years    in   connection   with   the   drug\n\noffenses, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), but at the bottom of his\n\nguidelines range.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Jury Notes\n\n       Defendants argue, for the first time on appeal, that the\n\ndistrict court violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel as\n\nwell as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 by responding to\n\nnotes received from the jury during deliberations without alerting\n\ncounsel to the fact of the notes and outside of the presence of\n\nDefendants and their counsel.        The government concedes that the\n\ndistrict court erred procedurally, but contends that the Defendants\n\nwere not prejudiced by the violations.          We agree.\n\n       On October 17, 2008, the court charged the jurors, and at 2:15\n\np.m. sent them to deliberate.        The court advised the parties to\n\n“Stay around in the courthouse.          In case we need you, we’ll call\n\nfrom outside.”    The court received a note from the jury at 3:15\n\np.m.    In this note, marked as Note #2,3 the jury requested (in\n\n\n3\n Fernández argues through counsel (who was not trial counsel) that\nthe record reveals that the court never “took care of” or responded\nto “Jury Note One.” Fernández Br. at 9. This is not correct. The\nrecord reveals that on October 10, 2008, during the lunch recess,\nthe jury sent a note to the court, marked as Note #1, asking that\ntwo questions be put to government witness William Rosario. After\nreceiving the note from the jury, the court read the questions to\n\n                                    -7-\n\fSpanish)   a    copy   of   the   transcript       of   the   testimony     of   the\n\ncooperating      witness    García-Heredia.             The   court    immediately\n\nresponded in writing, “The transcript is not available, it would\n\nhave to be prepared,” and “You should first rely on your collective\n\nmemory.”       The government concedes that the first part of the\n\ncourt’s response was inaccurate: a copy of the transcript of\n\nGarcía-Heredia’s       testimony    had     been    posted     on     the   court’s\n\nelectronic filing system on October 9, 2008, and accordingly, was\n\navailable to be read back to the jury.             A second note was received\n\nat 3:18 p.m.     In this note, marked as Note #3, the jury requested\n\n(this time in English) a transcript of García-Heredia’s grand jury\n\ntestimony.      The court immediately responded in writing, “This\n\ntestimony is not in evidence – no party proposed it.”\n\n     At 4:11 p.m., trial reconvened, and the court informed counsel\n\nthat the jury had reached a verdict.          Prior to reading the verdict,\n\nthe court called counsel to a sidebar and explained that it had\n\nreceived and responded to Notes #2 and #3.               The court said that it\n\nhad tried unsuccessfully to reach counsel, and showed the notes.\n\nThe court advised counsel it had provided a “[b]oiler plate type of\n\n\n\ncounsel, heard argument, and determined that it would ask the\nquestions in a neutral way. There was no objection. Upon resuming\ntrial, the court questioned the witness.       Fernández’s counsel\nappears to be confusing the first note received during\ndeliberations, which was marked as Note #2 but which was identified\nin the minutes pertaining to that trial day as “note 1,” with the\nearlier note, which, as noted above, was received and taken care of\nduring trial.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fanswer of the type suggested always when these type of things\n\nhappen,   okay?”   González’s    counsel   responded,   “Yes,   sir.”\n\nFernández’s counsel made a comment on the content of the notes.\n\nThere was no objection or further inquiry by any counsel into the\n\nsubstance of the court’s responses to the notes.\n\n     We have held that “[a] district court’s failure to attempt to\n\ninform defense counsel about the existence of a jury note, and\n\nfurther failure to solicit defense counsel’s input regarding any\n\nresponse to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure.”   United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez, 570 F.3d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 2009); see United States v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d\n\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S.\n\n35, 39 (1975) (noting that the court’s prior rulings, and those\n\ninterpreting Rule 43, “make clear . . . that the jury’s message\n\nshould have been answered in open court and that petitioner’s\n\ncounsel should have been given an opportunity to be heard before\n\nthe trial judge responded”); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(2) (the\n\ndefendant’s presence is required at “every trial stage, including\n\njury impanelment and the return of the verdict”).4      There is no\n\n\n4\n  In United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520 (1st Cir. 1991), we set\nforth the proper procedure for handling a note from the jury:\n\n     The preferred practice for handling a jury message should\n     include these steps: (1) the jury’s communique should be\n     reduced to writing; (2) the note should be marked as an\n     exhibit for identification; (3) it should be shown, or read\n     fully, to counsel; and (4) counsel should be given an\n     opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder. If the note\n\n                                -9-\n\fquestion that, in its procedure in responding to Notes #2 and #3,\n\nthe district court erred.     Counsel should have been advised of the\n\nnotes and been offered the opportunity to suggest responses (or\n\nobject   to   the   court’s   proposed   responses).5   However,   the\n\nDefendants did not object when the court revealed the jury notes.\n\nAlthough counsel did not learn of the notes until the jury had\n\nreported that it had reached a verdict, the possibility of curing\n\nthe error remained open as the court could have told the jury that\n\nthe referenced transcript did exist, caused it to be read to them,\n\nand instructed them to continue to deliberate. Defendants’ failure\n\nto bring the claim of error to the district court’s attention\n\nresults in the forfeiture of the claim.         See United States v.\n\n\n\n     requires a response ore tenus, the jury should then be\n     recalled, the note read into the record or summarized by the\n     court, the supplemental instructions given, and counsel\n     afforded an opportunity to object at sidebar. If, however, the\n     note is to be answered in writing, the court’s reply should be\n     marked as an exhibit for identification, the judge should read\n     both the jury’s note and the reply into the record, and\n     counsel should be afforded an opportunity to register\n     objections before the reply is transmitted to the jury.\n\nId. at 525; see Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d at 17 (“The rules for\nhandling a jury note that are set forth in Maraj are\nwell-settled.”).\n5\n Although the court told counsel at the time it revealed the notes\nthat it had attempted unsuccessfully to contact counsel, according\nto the record only one minute passed between the court’s receipt of\nthe notes and its responses to the jury. While the need for a\nrapid response may vary depending on a number of circumstances, in\nthis case, especially in view of the unclear status of the trial\ntranscript, no good reason appears why the court should not have\nmade more than one minute’s effort to reach counsel.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fRodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), “[a]n\n\nappellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised\n\nat trial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an\n\nerror; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to\n\nreasonable    dispute;    (3)    the    error    affected    the    appellant’s\n\nsubstantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected\n\nthe outcome of the district court proceedings; and (4) the error\n\nseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.” United States v. Marcus, ___ U.S. ___ , 130\n\nS. Ct. 2159, 2164 (2010) (internal quotation marks and alterations\n\nomitted); see United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).      We see no reason to believe this error either affected\n\nDefendants’    substantial      rights    or    affected    the    fairness   or\n\nintegrity of the trial.\n\n     With respect to Note #3, the court properly responded that\n\nGarcía-Heredia’s grand jury testimony was not in evidence and could\n\nnot be provided.      Defendants cannot show they were prejudiced, as\n\nnothing more could have or would have been done if counsel had been\n\nmade aware of the jury’s inquiry prior to the court’s response.\n\nSee Maraj, 947 F.2d at 526 (error in handling jury note did not\n\nadversely    affect   defendant’s      substantial    rights,      because    the\n\njudge’s response to the note was satisfactory and “had the full\n\nnote been contemporaneously disclosed, there was nothing more that\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdefense counsel could appropriately have done to protect their\n\nclient’s rights”).\n\n      With respect to Note #2, Defendants have not shown that the\n\ncourt’s incorrect response was prejudicial or that it affected the\n\nfairness or integrity of the proceedings.              There was no error in\n\ninstructing the jury that they should rely on their collective\n\nmemory of García-Heredia’s trial testimony.            Even if the court had\n\nbeen aware of the existence of the transcript, it would not\n\nnecessarily   have   been   read   to    the   jury.     Trial   courts   have\n\ndiscretion whether to do so.        See United States v. Akitoye, 923\n\nF.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 1991) (“[W]e have long and repeatedly held\n\nthat rereading testimony during jury deliberations rests in the\n\npresider’s sound discretion.”).         Appellants argue that the verdict\n\nmight have been different had the testimony been provided.                That\n\nis, of course, a possibility, but they make no persuasive argument\n\nsupporting such a likelihood.            García-Heredia’s testimony was\n\ndecidedly unfavorable to the Defendants, and they do not show that\n\nit was impeached in cross-examination in any significant fashion,\n\nother than the obvious point of his aiding his own case by\n\ntestifying against the Defendants, which the Defendants forcefully\n\ncommunicated to the jury in their summations. The procedural error\n\ndid not prejudice the Defendants.\n\nII.   Voir Dire of Prospective Jurors\n\n      Rosario, in a supplemental pro se filing, also argues that the\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcourt violated his constitutional rights as well as Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 43 by questioning certain prospective alternate\n\njurors   outside   of   his   presence.   We   disagree.   The   court’s\n\nquestioning of the prospective jurors outside the presence of the\n\nDefendants was justified, and, in any event, Rosario waived any\n\nright to be present pursuant to Rule 43 by his failure to object at\n\ntrial.\n\n     After selection of twelve jurors and four alternate jurors,\n\nthe court called counsel to a side bar.        The judge told them that\n\nhe and a security officer observed two of the alternate female\n\njurors laughing and sticking their tongues out at Rosario “like, ‘I\n\nknow you.’”    The court determined that it would question the two\n\nalternates, and ordered that the Defendants be removed from the\n\ncourtroom.    There was no objection.     With counsel for each of the\n\nDefendants present, the court questioned the two alternate female\n\njurors, who said that they did not know any of the Defendants.       The\n\ncourt decided, nevertheless, to excuse the two alternates.\n\n     A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present\n\nat “all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the\n\nfairness of the proceedings.”       See, e.g., Faretta v. California,\n\n422 U.S. 806, 819 n.15 (1975).        As noted above, Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 43 further provides that a defendant must be\n\npresent at “every trial stage, including jury impanelment and the\n\nreturn of the verdict,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(2), except at stages\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwhere, inter alia, “[t]he proceeding involves only a conference or\n\nhearing    on       a    question      of    law,”    Fed.     R.   Crim.   P.    43(b)(3).\n\nDefendants need not be expressly warned of their rights under Rule\n\n43, and a defendant’s failure to assert his right to be present or\n\nto object to a purported violation of the rule may result in a\n\nvalid waiver of the right.                  See United States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S.\n\n522, 529 (1985); United States v. Peterson, 385 F.3d 127, 137 (2d\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Brantley, 68 F.3d 1283, 1291 (11th\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n       In Gagnon, a multi-defendant trial, the Supreme Court rejected\n\na claim that a conference attended by one of the defense counsel\n\nand a juror, regarding a concern expressed by that juror that one\n\nof the defendants “had been sketching [portraits of] jury members\n\nduring the trial,” violated the defendants’ constitutional right to\n\nbe present.         470 U.S. at 523.              The Supreme Court recognized that\n\n“[t]he mere occurrence of an ex parte conversation between a trial\n\njudge   and     a       juror   does    not       constitute    a   deprivation        of   any\n\nconstitutional right.”              Id. at 526 (quoting Rushen v. Spain, 464\n\nU.S. 114, 125-26 (1983) (Stevens, J. concurring in the judgment)).\n\nThe    Court    explained        that       the    conference       at   issue,   “a    short\n\ninterlude in a complex trial[,] . . . was not the sort of event\n\nwhich every defendant had a right personally to attend.”                               Id. at\n\n527.    The defendants “could have done nothing had they been at the\n\nconference, nor would they have gained anything by attending.” Id.\n\n\n                                              -14-\n\f     As in Gagnon, Rosario’s absence from the bench conference did\n\nnot deprive him of any constitutional right.    It did not detract\n\nfrom his defense or in any way affect the fairness of his trial.\n\nSee id. at 526 (explaining that due process concerns are implicated\n\n“[w]henever [the defendant’s] presence has a relation, reasonably\n\nsubstantial, to the [fullness] of his opportunity to defend against\n\nthe charge . . . [and] to the extent that a fair and just hearing\n\nwould be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only”).\n\nRosario was removed (as were his co-defendants) for only a brief\n\nperiod of time, and his interests were sufficiently protected by\n\nhis counsel’s presence at the conference.    See United States v.\n\nBertoli, 40 F.3d 1384, 1397, 1399-1401 (3d Cir. 1994); see also\n\nUnited States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 182 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(finding no Rule 43 violation where the defendant was “restricted\n\nfrom full participation in a limited number of sidebar conferences\n\nthat occurred during voir dire” but otherwise was “present at, and\n\nfully participated in, his trial”), vacated on other grounds, 532\n\nU.S. 1036 (2001).\n\n     Furthermore, even assuming Rosario had a statutory right to be\n\npresent under Rule 43 in these circumstances (a proposition we\n\ndoubt), he waived that right by remaining silent.   When the court\n\nordered that the Defendants be removed from the courtroom, Rosario\n\nhad the opportunity to object, but did not.         As in Gagnon,\n\nRosario’s “total failure to assert [his] right[] to attend the\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fconference with the juror sufficed to waive [it] under Rule 43.”\n\nGagnon, 470 U.S. at 529.         “If a defendant is entitled under Rule 43\n\nto attend certain ‘stages of the trial’ which do not take place in\n\nopen court, the defendant . . . must assert that right at the time\n\n. . . [and] may not claim it for the first time on appeal from a\n\nsentence    entered    on    a   jury’s    verdict   of   ‘guilty.’”    Id.;     see\n\nPeterson, 385 F.3d at 138; Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 182.\n\nIII.   Right to Jury Selected from Fair-Cross Section of the\nCommunity\n\n      González and Rosario argue, for the first time on appeal, that\n\nthey were deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to a trial before\n\na jury representing a fair cross-section of the community.                      They\n\nargue that the jury that convicted them was not drawn from a fair\n\ncross section of the community, as it was an English-speaking,\n\n“white-collar,” and “highly professionally oriented” group drawn\n\nfrom a “universe of less than 16% of” their peers.              The local plan\n\nfor   the   District        of   Puerto     Rico   requires   that     jurors    be\n\nsufficiently proficient in English to render satisfactory jury\n\nservice, see, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19,\n\n29-30 (1st Cir. 1999), and yet, according to Defendants, eighty\n\npercent of Puerto Rico residents have little command of English.\n\n(The eighty percent figure is based on certain U.S. census surveys\n\ncited in Defendants’ briefs on appeal.)              Because this contention,\n\nat least as it pertained to the composition of the trial jury, was\n\nnot raised in the district court, it is subject to review only for\n\n                                          -16-\n\fplain error.         Even if it were properly preserved for review,\n\nDefendants’ contention is foreclosed by our precedents, which have\n\nrepeatedly upheld the English proficiency requirement against such\n\nchallenges in Puerto Rico district court.              See United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2009) (concluding that\n\nthe   English      proficiency   requirement     was    “justified    by     the\n\noverwhelming national interest served by the use of English in a\n\nUnited States court” (quoting United States v. González-Vélez, 466\n\nF.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir. 2006))); United States v. Dubón-Otero, 292\n\nF.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).          Defendants offer no persuasive reason\n\nfor reconsidering our prior rulings.\n\nIV.   Spanish Translation of Jury Instructions\n\n      González argues for the first time on appeal that his right to\n\na fair trial was violated because the district court did not\n\nprovide     the    jury   with   a   Spanish   translation    of     the    jury\n\ninstructions.        González’s argument is forfeited for failure to\n\nraise it below, and is in any event foreclosed by our precedents.\n\nIn United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\nwe explained that the practice of charging the jury using non-\n\nEnglish words was “inadvisable and should be discouraged” and\n\ninstructed “district courts to frame instructions in English.” Id.\n\nat 18-19.         As noted above, the governing rules require that all\n\njurors speak, read, and write in English with proficiency.                 At the\n\njury selection phase, the Defendants were not rebuffed in any\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\feffort to test any juror’s comprehension of English.                  González has\n\nfailed to show any error (let alone plain error).\n\nV.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     Defendants      challenge      the     sufficiency        of    the    evidence\n\nsupporting their convictions.              We review de novo the district\n\ncourt’s denial of a motion made under Rule 29 for judgment of\n\nacquittal.    United States v. Giambro, 544 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    In doing so, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable    to    the   jury’s   guilty    verdict   and      assess      whether   a\n\nreasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.            See United States v. Lipscomb,\n\n539 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).           We conclude that the evidence was\n\nsufficient    to    support   the   jury’s    verdict     as    to   González    and\n\nFernández. However, in the case of Rosario, we conclude that while\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict as to his\n\ninvolvement in crimes of drug conspiracy and distribution, it did\n\nnot support the jury’s findings of elevated quantities of drugs.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment as to Rosario\n\nto the extent it included the elevated quantities, and remand for\n\nre-sentencing.\n\n1) González and Fernández.\n\n     The evidence was clearly sufficient to show that González and\n\nFernández were involved in the Los Dementes drug distribution\n\noperation, which operated out of the Juana Matos housing project\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fand sold drugs at a drug point owned by González on F street in the\n\nVietnam Ward.    Much of the evidence was provided by the testimony\n\nof García-Heredia, who testified that he had been a member of Los\n\nDementes and sold drugs, including heroin, cocaine, crack-cocaine,\n\nand marijuana, for the organization.           He identified González as\n\nthe owner of the drug point, and Fernández as having sold drugs and\n\nhaving acted as an enforcer at the drug point.6                    According to\n\nGarcía-Heredia, drugs were routinely delivered from Juana Matos to\n\nthe Vietnam location by Los Dementes principals, and these drugs\n\nwere sold under so-called “brand names,” including Pokemon, that\n\nwere exclusive to Los Dementes drug points.                   (Other evidence\n\nestablished the large quantities supporting the jury’s verdict.)7\n\n     García-Heredia also testified to his involvement, together\n\nwith González and Fernández,         in the April 25, 2004 murders, which\n\nformed the basis for the convictions under Sections 924(c) and (o).\n\nAs   part   of   a   war   between    Los   Dementes    and    a    rival   drug\n\norganization, Las Palmas, Los Dementes members attempted to kill\n\nLas Palmas’s leader, Gilberto El Reyes.                According to García-\n\nHeredia, while González drove the car, he and Fernández opened fire\n\n\n6\n  There was also testimony that, by May 2004 (following González’s\narrest for bank robbery), Fernández operated the Vietnam Ward drug\npoint and that drugs at Juana Matos were packaged for Fernández to\nsell in the Vietnam Ward.\n7\n  During a two-month surveillance of the Juana Matos drug points,\nthe evidence established that the drug conspiracy sold “about\n71,000 decks of heroin, 62,000 baggies of cocaine, 300,000 vials of\n‘crack,’ and 60,000 baggies of marijuana.”\n\n                                     -19-\n\f(he with two semi-automatic .38 revolvers and Fernández with an AK-\n\n47) on another car they believed belonged to El-Reyes’s son. Three\n\npassengers in the car were killed.      (It turned out that the car did\n\nnot belong to El Reyes’s son; none of the victims were involved in\n\nthe drug trade.)\n\n     González and Fernández argue that the convictions under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 860 must be vacated because the drug sales in the Vietnam\n\nWard were not within 1000 feet of a public housing project or\n\nschool, as they contend is required by that statute.8             This\n\nargument is without merit.   Section 860 does not require that the\n\ndrug sales take place within 1000 feet of a housing project or\n\nschool.   The charges under § 860 included possession of drugs\n\nwithin 1000 feet of a hosing project or school, with intent to\n\ndistribute.   The evidence showed that González and Fernández, with\n\nintent to distribute, aided and abetted in such possession within\n\n1000 feet of a protected location (in this case, Juana Matos and\n\ntwo schools located therein).9     See United States v. DeLuna, 10\n\n\n8\n  21 U.S.C. § 860 provides in relevant part that: “Any person who\nviolates section 841(a)(1) of this title . . . by distributing,\npossessing with intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled\nsubstance in or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real\nproperty comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or\nsecondary school or . . . housing facility owned by a public\nhousing authority . . . is subject to (1) twice the maximum\npunishment authorized by section 841(b) of this title . . . .”\n9\n  Fernández argues in a supplemental pro se filing that the\nconvictions under Sections 924(c) and (o) must be vacated because\nthere was insufficient evidence of a “nexus” between the April 25,\n2004 killings and the drug trafficking charges. We disagree. The\n\n                                 -20-\n\fF.3d 1529, 1534-35 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n2) Rosario.\n\n     Rosario was convicted of drug conspiracy, and of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute at least one hundred fifty grams of\n\ncrack-cocaine and five kilograms of cocaine.             See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846, 860.     We conclude first that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to show that Rosario participated in the drug conspiracy\n\nand that he possessed or aided and abetted the possession of drugs\n\nat Juana Matos with intent to distribute.\n\n     The evidence of Rosario’s participation came in principally\n\nthrough two witnesses:    Casiano and William Rosario.          Casiano was\n\nan FBI informant placed in Juana Matos as an outside observer for\n\napproximately   two   months,     from    February   through    April   2005.\n\nCasiano   testified   that   he    saw    Rosario    attend    what   Casiano\n\ncharacterized as a March 2005 peace meeting between Los Dementes\n\nand Las Palmas members at Juana Matos, and that when he saw Rosario\n\nat the housing complex, “[h]e            would always be with Hueso.”10\n\n\nevidence showed that González and Fernández attempted to murder El-\nReyes as part of a war between the two drug organizations, and did\nso with the participation of other Los Dementes members.        The\nattempted murder was sufficiently connected to the drug trafficking\ncrime to satisfy Section 924(c)’s “during and in relation to”\nrequirement.\n10\n   In the district court, Rosario moved for a mistrial on the\ngrounds that the government engaged in misconduct by permitting\nCasiano to testify allegedly falsely about Rosario’s presence at\nthe peace meeting. The basis for this accusation was that Casiano\nhad previously told the government that he could not identify\nRosario on the basis of a photo given to him. The court summarily\n\n                                   -21-\n\fCasiano testified that “Hueso was the leader, and not everybody got\n\nto hang out with him.” According to Casiano, only close associates\n\nin the drug business could “hang out” with Hueso.\n\n     William   Rosario,      the   cooperating   witness,     testified   to\n\nperforming various drug-related tasks and errands for members of\n\nLos Dementes at Juana Matos.          He confirmed that the defendant\n\nRosario “would spend all of his time with, you know, with the big\n\npeople in the organization, with Hueso.”         “More than twice” he saw\n\nthe defendant Rosario in an apartment in “Building 50” – one of the\n\nprincipal apartments where Los Dementes members would prepare drugs\n\n– at times when drugs were being prepared.             He saw the defendant\n\nRosario there with other members of the organization. According to\n\nWilliam Rosario’s testimony, the apartment was outfitted with\n\nsteel-plated   doors   and    video   cameras    for    surveillance.     He\n\ntestified that there were “a lot of drugs and a lot of money” at\n\nthe apartment.   He estimated that Los Dementes members processed\n\napproximately 1/4 kilogram of cocaine into crack (the equivalent of\n\nabout 1000 vials of crack) in the apartment approximately three or\n\nfour times per week, and that he often saw approximately $5000 in\n\n\ndenied the motion, and Rosario appeals from the denial. We see no\nbasis for grant of new trial, nor any showing of misconduct on the\ncurrent record.    Rosario was given an adequate opportunity to\ndevelop this (or any other) inconsistency on cross-examination.\nCasiano testified that, although he did not recognize Rosario from\nthe picture, he realized in the courtroom that the defendant was\n“Julio Hotdog” (Rosario’s nickname), who he remembered from his\ntime at Juana Matos. The government was entitled to solicit this\ntestimony and the jury was entitled to credit it.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fcash being counted there (by machine).\n\n     William Rosario also testified about two specific drug-related\n\ninteractions he had with the defendant Rosario.   In the first, the\n\ndefendant Rosario took William to Rosario’s aunt’s house in a\n\nneighboring housing complex, where Rosario had William “cook” and\n\n“taste” (tasks he often performed at Juana Matos) a small sample\n\nfrom a bag of cocaine (the bag’s weight was approximately 1/8\n\nkilogram).   In the second, William washed a car for Rosario, and in\n\nreturn, Rosario paid him with six or seven vials of crack.       In\n\nresponse to a question from the jury as to whether he knew if “in\n\nthe Building 50 they prepare drugs for Julio Rosario,” William\n\ntestified: “I could not tell you that I was there when they were\n\npreparing drugs for Julio. But I can say that on one day, when I\n\nwashed a car for him, he told me that after I finished, that he was\n\ngoing to go to apartment 50 and that he was going to pay me with\n\nwhat they were preparing for him.”\n\n      Finally, the government introduced evidence that, following\n\nthe October 2007 indictment and arrests, Rosario fled and took on\n\na new identity.     When he was apprehended in 2008 by the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service, he was found in possession of a fake driver’s\n\nlicense and social security card (both in the name of “Omar\n\nPalma”). When confronted with the fake documents, Rosario admitted\n\nthat “he was assuming the identity of Mr. Omar Palma while being a\n\nfugitive.”   The government argued – and the jury was entitled to\n\n\n                                -23-\n\ffind – that Rosario’s attempt to evade arrest demonstrated a\n\nconsciousness of guilt.11\n\n     Taken   together,   and   in   the    light   most   favorable     to   the\n\nverdict,   this   evidence   was    sufficient     to   support   the   jury’s\n\nfindings that Rosario was guilty of participation in the drug\n\ndistribution conspiracy and of aiding and abetting the possession\n\nof drugs with intent to distribute.12\n\n\n\n11\n   Rosario argues that the district court erred in admitting\nevidence of his flight because (1) the evidence was admitted\nwithout the necessary showing of extrinsic evidence of guilt, and\n(2) the evidence was highly prejudicial and should have been\nexcluded pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403.           We reject these\ncontentions.   “A district court is afforded considerable leeway\nwhen determining whether evidence of a defendant’s flight is\naccompanied by a sufficient factual predicate . . . [and] is\nafforded similar latitude in determining whether the evidence\npasses the Rule 403 balancing test.” United States v. Benedetti,\n433 F.3d 111, 116 (1st Cir. 2005). We believe there was sufficient\nextrinsic evidence of Rosario’s guilt to support admission of the\nflight evidence.   Nor can we say that the district court acted\noutside of its discretion in admitting the flight evidence pursuant\nto Rule 403. We note further that the district court instructed\nthe jury – instructions we presume it followed – that flight alone\nis not a sufficient basis to convict, but rather should be\nconsidered in light of all the evidence presented at trial. We\ndiscern no reversible error in connection with the admission of the\nflight evidence.\n12\n   We note that Rosario testified as part of the defense case,\ndenying his involvement in any drug-related activities at Juana\nMatos.   He denied that Los Dementes was a drug distribution\norganization. He also implausibly asserted that Hueso was simply\na “recreational leader” at the housing complex.       The jury was\nentitled to disbelieve the defendant’s testimony and use its\ndisbelief to supplement the other evidence against him. See United\nStates v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1986); see also\nUnited States v. Velasquez, 271 F.3d 364, 374 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(defendant’s “incredible” testimony “transform[ed] the evidence in\nthis case from borderline to sufficient”).\n\n                                    -24-\n\f     On   the   other   hand,   we   conclude   that   the    evidence     was\n\ninsufficient to support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\nRosario was responsible for the elevated drug quantities of which\n\nhe was convicted, i.e., at least one hundred fifty grams of crack-\n\ncocaine and five kilograms of cocaine.          The government relied on\n\ntestimony that Rosario, like González and Fernández, owned a drug\n\npoint outside of Juana Matos, which, if proved, would presumably be\n\nsufficient to show responsibility for large quantities. There was,\n\nhowever, no competent evidence of his ownership of a drug point.\n\nWilliam Rosario testified that “from what [he] knew, [Rosario] had\n\na crack point” outside of Juana Matos.              When asked on direct\n\nexamination how he knew Rosario was a drug point owner, William\n\nRosario did not give any intelligible explanation.                 On cross-\n\nexamination,    William   Rosario    acknowledged    that    his   basis   for\n\nbelieving Rosario had a drug point was “because somebody told\n\n[him].”   William Rosario accordingly had no competent basis for\n\ntestifying that Rosario had a drug point.         Nor has the government\n\nidentified for us any other evidence from which a rational trier of\n\nfact could conclude that Rosario had a drug point.\n\n     We recognize that there was evidence of large quantities of\n\ndrugs, money, and drug dealing paraphernalia at the apartment in\n\nBuilding 50, and there was evidence that Rosario was seen “more\n\nthan twice” in that apartment, including at least one occasion when\n\ndrugs were being prepared. But there was no evidence showing that,\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fon any occasion when Rosario was at the apartment, he would\n\ninevitably have seen large-scale operations being conducted there.\n\nNor did the evidence show Rosario’s awareness of the continuity of\n\nsustained drug preparation there.         While the government might have\n\nbeen able to elicit such testimony with properly focused questions,\n\nit did not do so.       In order to support a criminal conviction,\n\nevidence   must   be   sufficient    to    support   a    finding   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt of the essential elements.              Without doubt there\n\nwas evidence from which jurors could speculate as to Rosario’s\n\nawareness of the large-scale operation in which he participated,\n\nbut the evidence as to him was sketchy and could not support a\n\nfinding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Accordingly, while we affirm Rosario’s convictions on the\n\nvarious drug offenses, we vacate the judgment to the extent that it\n\nincorporated convictions based on the jury’s findings of elevated\n\nquantities.   Because Rosario’s overall sentence was predicated in\n\npart on these convictions for elevated quantities, and because the\n\ncharges alleging elevated quantities included mandatory minimum\n\nsentences,13 we vacate Rosario’s sentence.       At Rosario’s sentencing\n\nhearing, the district court treated the jury’s findings of elevated\n\n\n\n13\n  The jury found the Defendants responsible for drug quantities of\nat least five kilograms of cocaine and at least one hundred fifty\ngrams of crack-cocaine.     These quantities, under 21 U.S.C. §\n841(b)(1)(A), trigger a term of imprisonment of at least ten years\nand not more than life. See United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, 541\nF.3d 19, 32 n.11 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                    -26-\n\fquantities     as    determinative.       As   set   forth     above,   there    was\n\ninsufficient        evidence   to    support   the    jury’s    findings    as    to\n\nquantity.      On imposing sentence upon remand, the district court\n\nshall   make    any     necessary      findings      as   to    drug    quantities\n\nattributable to Rosario, in accordance with our decisions in United\n\nStates v. Colon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101 (1st Cir. 2004), and United\n\nStates v. Correy, 570 F.3d 373 (1st Cir. 2009).14\n\nVI.   Sentencing Challenges\n\n      We review a “district court’s sentence for reasonableness,\n\nwhich involves a procedural as well as a substantive inquiry.”\n\nUnited States v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008).                      The\n\nfirst task is to determine whether the district court made any\n\nprocedural errors “such as failing to calculate (or improperly\n\ncalculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as\n\nmandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(a) factors,\n\nselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts or failing to\n\nadequately explain the chosen sentence – including an explanation\n\nfor any deviation from the Guidelines range.”                    Gall v. United\n\nStates, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007); United States v. Stone, 575 F.3d\n\n83, 89 (1st Cir. 2009).             In addition, we review the substantive\n\nreasonableness of the sentence imposed.              The standard of review as\n\n\n\n14\n   This opinion expresses no view as to the quantities the\nsentencing court may properly attribute to Rosario when the\nstandard, unlike the standard for conviction, is preponderance of\nthe evidence.\n\n                                        -27-\n\fto substantive reasonableness is abuse of discretion.                Politano,\n\n522 F.3d at 72.      “[W]hen a defendant fails to preserve an objection\n\nbelow, the plain error standard supplants the customary standard of\n\nreview.”   United States v. Dávila-González, 595 F.3d 42, 47 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).\n\n      González contends that the district court’s imposition of a\n\nterm of life imprisonment was procedurally unreasonable because it\n\nwas done without proper consideration of the sentencing factors\n\noutlined   in   18   U.S.C.   §   3553(a),   was   based   on   an   erroneous\n\nassumption that the court was compelled to adhere to the guideline\n\nrange, and was substantively unreasonable.15               We reject these\n\ncontentions.\n\n      The court determined that González’s guidelines range was life\n\nimprisonment, based on an offense level of 43 and a Criminal\n\nHistory Category of II (the result of a prior guilty plea to bank\n\nrobbery and gun charges).16       If the court finds by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that a murder was committed in furtherance of a\n\ndrug conspiracy, the Guidelines provide for a base offense level of\n\n43.   See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1) (“If a victim was killed under\n\n\n15\n  González was sentenced to 480 months imprisonment on Count I\n(drug conspiracy); life imprisonment on Counts II, III, and IV (the\nsubstantive drug charges); 240 months imprisonment on Count VII\n(the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(o)), to run concurrently with the\nother counts; and life imprisonment on Count VI (the violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), to run consecutively with the other counts.\n16\n  U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1 states that the base offense level for first\ndegree murder is 43.\n\n                                     -28-\n\fcircumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\n\nhad such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime\n\njurisdiction of the United States, apply § 2A1.1 (First Degree\n\nMurder) . . . .”); see also United States v. Avilés-Colón, 536 F.3d\n\n1, 27 (1st Cir. 2008).            The evidence of the April 25, 2004 murders\n\nmade this offense level applicable.17                 Nor is there reason to doubt\n\nthat the court recognized its obligation to consider the obligatory\n\nsentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), or the advisory nature\n\nof the Guidelines since Booker.                 See 2/2/09 Sentencing Hr’g Tr.\n\n(González) at 43-44 (“We have looked at this in the context of the\n\nadvisory guidelines.             We have looked at it in our own mind in the\n\ncontext of 3553(a). What is really salient in the analysis is the\n\n–    is    the   issue    of     total   disregard     for   the   life    of    others,\n\nespecially       the     total    loss   of   three    innocent    lives    that    were\n\nmurdered on a well-trafficked road in Puerto Rico.”)                            That the\n\ncourt did not discuss mitigating factors advocated by González is\n\nof no significance.              Sentencing judges are not obligated to set\n\nforth their appraisal of the pertinent factors.                    Dávila-González,\n\n595 F.3d at 48.            We find no procedural unreasonableness in the\n\ncourt’s imposition of sentence.               Nor do we find any reason to doubt\n\nthe       substantive     unreasonableness        of   the   sentence      imposed    on\n\n\n17\n   The court also determined that a four-level leadership\nenhancement applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), because the\ndefendant was a leader of criminal activity involving five or more\nparticipants. Because 43 is the highest possible offense level\nunder the Guidelines, González’s offense level remained 43.\n\n                                           -29-\n\fGonzález, especially in view of his wanton killings.\n\n       Fernández, in a pro se supplemental brief, also challenges the\n\nreasonableness of his sentence. Fernández’s principal objection is\n\nto the application of the Guidelines’ murder cross-reference in\n\ndetermining his guidelines range. As discussed above in connection\n\nwith González’s sentence, evidence of Fernández’s participation in\n\nthe April 25,       2004 murders made a base offense level of 43\n\napplicable.       See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1).          We have considered\n\nFernández’s remaining sentencing arguments, and find them without\n\nmerit.18\n\nVII.    Notice of Charges\n\n       González and Fernández argue that the superseding indictment\n\nfailed     to   provide   adequate   and   timely   notice    of   the   charges\n\nrelating to the April 25, 2004 murders and thus violated their\n\nSixth Amendment rights to notice of accusation.               González raises\n\nthe argument for the first time on appeal.19                 Fernández in the\n\ndistrict court did not object to the filing of the new charges, but\n\nmoved to exclude evidence of the murders. Regardless of the proper\n\nstandard of review, we find no error.\n\n\n\n18\n  Because we vacate Rosario’s sentence in its entirety, we do not\naddress the sentencing arguments advanced by Rosario on appeal.\n19\n   On September 4, 2008, González, through counsel, filed an in\nlimine motion seeking to suppress certain video evidence relating\nto the April 25, 2004 murders, which the motion described as “raw,\ngruesome, and inflammatory.”     The motion did not argue that\nGonzález’s Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\n\n                                     -30-\n\f       The charges added by the superseding indictment returned on\n\nAugust 22, 2008 did not expand the scope of the evidence as to the\n\nDefendants.      The original indictment included a charge under 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   924(c),    alleging     their    use    of   firearms.   The      only\n\npertinent change in the superseding indictment was to add a charge\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 924(o) of conspiracy to commit the violation of\n\n§ 924(c), which set forth as an overt act that: “[O]n or about\n\nApril 25, 2004, in Cataño, Dorado, and elsewhere within Puerto\n\nRico,” defendants, including González and Fernández, “carried and\n\nused firearms, to include fully automatic pistols and rifles\n\n(machine guns).”        The shooting down of the three occupants of the\n\ncar which the Defendants mistakenly believed carried the drug\n\nrival’s son was provable under the earlier indictment without need\n\nfor the supplemental charge. The addition of this specification of\n\nan overt act in furtherance of the Section 924(o) conspiracy did\n\nnot enlarge the admissible evidence.                 As the Dorado shootings in\n\nfurtherance of a drug dealing war were evidence of both the\n\nnarcotics and firearms offenses, they would have been admissible\n\neven     if   the   superseding       indictment        had   not   been   filed.\n\nFurthermore, the Defendants had been put on notice of this evidence\n\nlong   before   the     filing   of   the     superseding     indictment   by   the\n\ngovernment’s designation of evidence. Defendants have not asserted\n\nthat the government’s allegedly tardy filings impaired their trial\n\npreparation or their ability to present a defense.                     Nor have\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fDefendants argued on appeal that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in not delaying trial to permit further investigation or\n\npreparation. The argument is therefore forfeited. We see no basis\n\nfor disturbing the convictions of either González or Fernández on\n\nthis ground.\n\nVIII.    Hearsay Statements of Cooperating Witnesses\n\n       Defendants     argue    that     the     district     court    erred      by\n\nprovisionally    admitting        alleged    hearsay    testimony    by    certain\n\ncooperating government witnesses, without having later made a final\n\ndetermination       that   such     testimony    satisfied    Fed.    R.     Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E)’s requirements for the admission of co-conspirator\n\ntestimony.20    The argument is without merit.\n\n       On the first day of trial, the government elicited testimony\n\nfrom    García-Heredia     about    certain     statements   made    to    him   by\n\nGonzález about their intention to go ahead with the attempted\n\nassassination    of    the    Las   Palmas    leader.      González’s      counsel\n\nobjected to the testimony on the grounds that it was hearsay, and\n\nargued that for the statement to be admissible the court had to\n\nmake a finding that García-Heredia was engaged in a conspiracy with\n\nthe Defendants.       The court responded that, under our precedent in\n\nUnited States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st Cir. 1977), it\n\ncould make a tentative determination that González and García-\n\n\n\n20\n  This argument was raised by at least González and Fernández in\nRule 29 motions filed after trial.\n\n                                       -32-\n\fHeredia were members of a drug conspiracy, and if the statement was\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, it could be admitted.             The court\n\nstated that it would make final determinations on these issues\n\nafter it heard all the evidence.            González’s counsel agreed, and\n\nthere was no further inquiry.           (This came up again during the\n\ntestimony of Casiano, with respect to statements made to him by\n\nalleged members of the conspiracy during his undercover assignment\n\nat Juana Matos.    Fernández’s counsel objected on hearsay grounds,\n\nand the district court made the same ruling, i.e., that it could\n\nonly make a final ruling at the close of the evidence.                  At the\n\nclose of the government’s case, neither the Defendants nor the\n\ngovernment   requested     a   final    ruling   from     the   court   on   the\n\nadmissibility of any of the provisionally admitted co-conspirator\n\ntestimony under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), and the court did not\n\nmake one.\n\n      Under Petrozziello, the out-of-court declaration of an alleged\n\ncoconspirator may be admitted into evidence under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) if it is more likely than not that the declarant and\n\nthe   defendant   were   members   of   a    conspiracy    when   the   hearsay\n\nstatement was made, and that the statement was made in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy.       United States v. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 50\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (citing Petrozziello, 548 F.2d at 23).              The trial\n\ncourt is not required to decide what has come to be called in this\n\nCircuit the Petrozziello question prior to admitting the statement,\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fbut    may    admit    it     provisionally          subject    to    making      a    final\n\ndetermination at the close of all the evidence.                       United States v.\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d 707, 715 (1st Cir. 1992).21                     We ordinarily review\n\nsuch determinations for clear error, but where, as here, the\n\ndefendant fails to request a final Petriozziello ruling prior to\n\nverdict, this Court will vacate the defendant’s convictions on this\n\nground only upon a showing of plain error.                     Avilés-Colón, 536 F.3d\n\nat 14 (“Our precedent clearly establishes that to preserve a\n\nhearsay objection to the admission of a co-conspirator’s statement,\n\nthe    objection      must       be   renewed    at     the   close    of   all       of   the\n\nevidence.”); see also United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2003); Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 715-16.\n\n       On appeal, Defendants failed to identify the allegedly hearsay\n\nstatements on which they base their claim.                     Absent identification\n\nof    the    challenged      statements,        “[w]e    cannot      conduct   effective\n\nappellate      review       of    .   .   .    evidentiary      ruling[s]      admitting\n\ncoconspirator statements under . . . Rule 801(d)(2)(E).”                              United\n\nStates v. Isabel, 945 F.2d 1193, 1199 (1st Cir. 1991); see id.\n\n(finding waiver where appellants failed to identify the challenged\n\nhearsay statements).             Without specification of the statements, we\n\n\n21\n     If at the close of the evidence the court reverses its\nprovisional ruling, “it may give a cautionary jury instruction or,\non motion, declare a mistrial if an instruction would not prevent\nor cure the prejudice resulting from its provisional admission of\nthe hearsay.” United States v. Isabel, 945 F.2d 1193, 1199 n.10\n(1st Cir. 1991) (citing United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632,\n638 (1st Cir. 1980)).\n\n                                              -34-\n\fcannot determine whether they were hearsay, and if so, whether the\n\nevidence supported application of the exception for co-conspirator\n\nstatements in furtherance of the conspiracy.22\n\nIX.   Rosario’s remaining arguments\n\n      Rosario argues pro se and for the first time on appeal that\n\nhis due process rights were violated because a “selected sworn\n\njuror was asleep from the inception of the trial.”          Rosario Supp.\n\nBr. at 8.     Rosario cites to a portion of the transcript where\n\nRosario’s counsel alerted the trial court that one of the jurors\n\nwas “falling asleep.”    At the time, Rosario did not raise any due\n\nprocess   objection,   and   therefore,   such   argument    is   at   best\n\nforfeited on appeal, subject to review only for plain error.           The\n\ntrial court is not required to remove a juror who has slept and is\n\naccorded considerable discretion in handling the matter.               See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Freitag, 230 F.3d 1019, 1023 (7th Cir.\n\n2000); see also United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 670 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).   A sleeping juror does not violate a defendant’s due\n\nprocess rights unless the defendant can show he was prejudiced to\n\n\n\n22\n  We note that, as for the statements made by González to García-\nHeredia concerning plans to kill El-Reyes (to which González\nobjected to below), we would have no trouble concluding that the\nevidence showed a conspiracy among García-Heredia, González, and\nFernández (Rosario was not implicated by this testimony), and that\nthe statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. We note\nfurther that the statement would also be admissible, at least as to\nGonzález, as an admission of a party-opponent under Fed. R. Evid.\n801(d)(2)(A).\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fthe extent that he did not receive a fair trial.   See Freitag, 230\n\nF.3d at 1023.   Rosario’s pointing out that a single juror at one\n\npoint in the trial fell asleep does not by itself establish such\n\nprejudice, and does not support grant of new trial.\n\n     Rosario also argues for the first time on appeal that his\n\ntrial should have been severed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 14.   He argues that he was prejudiced by the spillover\n\neffects of evidence with respect to González and Fernández’s role\n\nin the April 25, 2004 murders, in which he had no part.       This\n\nargument is forfeited as he failed to raise it below.       In any\n\nevent, “[c]o-conspirators are customarily tried together absent a\n\nstrong showing of prejudice.”   United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d\n\n1271, 1280 (1st Cir. 1991).     On the current record, we have no\n\nreason to think that had a motion to sever been made, the district\n\ncourt would have been compelled to grant it.   See United States v.\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 440 (1st Cir. 1994) (“The decision to grant\n\nor deny a motion for severance is committed to the sound discretion\n\nof the trial court and we will reverse its refusal to sever only\n\nupon a finding of manifest abuse of discretion.”).23\n\n\n23\n  After oral argument, González and Fernández submitted various pro\nse motions, seeking, inter alia, a stay of the proceedings and\nappointment of new counsel or permission to proceed pro se. The\nbasis for González and Fernández’s motions appear to be that the\ngovernment breached plea agreements entered into in a prior\ncriminal case, 04-cr-217 (PG), by using evidence from that case in\nthe instant prosecution and that their trial and appellate counsel\nwere ineffective in not pursuing these allegations. The motions\nare denied. González and Fernández’s allegations should be raised\n\n                                -36-\n\f                            CONCLUSION\n\n     For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed as to González and Fernández.   The judgment as to\n\nRosario is vacated to the extent it is based on the jury’s findings\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of elevated drug quantities.    Rosario’s\n\ncase is remanded for re-sentencing.   Any pending motions are moot.\n\n\n\n\nin the first instance in the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2255.\n\n                               -37-\n\f",

Defendants    Angel    González-Méndez\n\n(“González”), Rafael Fernández-Hernández (“Fernández”), and Julio\n\nRosario-Otero (“Rosario”) (collectively, “Defendants”) appeal from\n\ntheir convictions after jury trial.             Defendants were convicted of\n\nvarious     conspiracy    and     drug     charges    arising       out    of   their\n\ninvolvement with a large drug distribution organization, which\n\noperated under the name “Los Dementes” and was based in the Juana\n\nMatos public housing project in the Cataño area of Puerto Rico.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, 860.            González and Fernández were\n\nalso convicted of gun charges, arising out of, inter alia, their\n\ninvolvement in the April 25, 2004 killing of three unintended\n\nvictims on a public highway in a botched attempt to assassinate a\n\nrival gang leader.       See 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c), (o).          Their sentences\n\nincluded    prison   terms   of     life   in   the   cases    of    González    and\n\nFernández, and in Rosario’s case, of 151 months.                          On appeal,\n\nDefendants assert numerous challenges to the conduct of their trial\n\nand imposition of their sentences, some raised by counsel, others\n\nin pro se briefs.     In the case of Rosario, we find that while the\n\nevidence was sufficient to support his involvement in crimes of\n\ndrug conspiracy and distribution, it did not support the jury’s\n\nfindings of elevated quantities of drugs.               Otherwise, we find no\n\nerror as to any defendant that would support overturning the\n\njudgment.     The judgment is therefore affirmed in part, vacated in\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpart, and the case remanded to the district court for re-sentencing\n\nof Rosario.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n     On October 25, 2007, a grand jury returned a seven-count\n\nindictment charging sixty-three individuals with participation in\n\na conspiracy dating from 1998 through 2007 to distribute narcotics\n\nat street level in the Cataño and Guaynabo areas of Puerto Rico.\n\nCarlos-Croz Mojica, a/k/a “Hueso,” was identified as the principal\n\nleader of the drug-selling organization, which used the name “Los\n\nDementes.”      The indictment identified the Juana Matos Public\n\nHousing Project (“Juana Matos”) as its base of operations, where\n\nLos Dementes members used apartments to “store, package, and\n\nprocess”     narcotics,   including    heroin,   cocaine,   cocaine   base\n\n(“crack-cocaine”), and marijuana, for sale at drug points located\n\ninside and outside Juana Matos.\n\n     On August 22, 2008, a grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment, which in major part repeated the charges asserted in\n\nthe earlier indictment.        It charged González, Fernández, and\n\nRosario, among other co-defendants, with: (1) conspiracy to possess\n\ncontrolled substances with intent to distribute, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, 860 (Count I); (2) aiding and abetting\n\nthe possession with intent to distribute of (i) at least one\n\nkilogram of heroin, (ii) at least fifty grams of crack-cocaine,\n\n(iii) at least five kilograms of cocaine, and (iv) a detectable\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\famount of marijuana, within 1000 feet of a public housing project\n\nor school,1 in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 860 (Counts II\n\n- V); and (3) using or carrying a firearm “during and in relation\n\nto any . . . drug trafficking crime,” in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A) (Count VI), and conspiring to commit an offense under\n\n§ 924(c), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(o) (Count VII).      The\n\nonly offense charged in the superseding indictment that was not\n\ncharged in the original indictment was Count VII, conspiracy under\n\n§ 924(o) to use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking crime. The superseding indictment charged, as an overt\n\nact in furtherance of this conspiracy, that: “[O]n or about April\n\n25, 2004, in Cataño, Dorado, and elsewhere within Puerto Rico,”\n\ndefendants, including Gonzales and Fernández, “carried and used\n\nfirearms, to include fully automatic pistols and rifles (machine\n\nguns).”   (In relation to this overt act, the government’s evidence\n\nat trial showed that González and Fernández, along with other Los\n\nDementes members, killed three bystanders in a failed attempt to\n\nmurder a rival gang leader.)\n\n     Most of the defendants named in the indictments pled guilty.\n\nGonzález, Fernández, and Rosario proceeded to trial on October 1,\n\n\n1\n  21 U.S.C. § 860 establishes enhanced penalties for “[a]ny person\nwho violates section 841(a)(1) . . . by distributing, possessing\nwith intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled substance\nin or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real property\ncomprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary\nschool or . . . housing facility owned by a public housing\nauthority . . . .” 21 U.S.C. § 860(a).\n\n                                -4-\n\f2008.   The government’s theory was that González, prior to his\n\narrest for bank robbery in 2004, owned a drug point outside of\n\nJuana Matos in the Vietnam Ward in Cataño and that he operated this\n\ndrug point as part of the Los Dementes organization; that Fernández\n\nwas a seller and enforcer for Los Dementes, working principally at\n\nGonzález’s Vietnam Ward drug point and eventually taking over that\n\noperation; and that Rosario was also a member of Los Dementes, who\n\nowned a drug point outside of Juana Matos in either the Amelia or\n\nthe Vietnam Ward.\n\n     At trial, the government presented the testimony of several\n\nFBI agents and Puerto Rico Police Department (“PRPD”) officers who\n\nwere tasked to the Los Dementes investigation.       They testified to,\n\ninter alia, surveillance, controlled buys, and the seizure of\n\ndrugs, cash, and weapons at the Juana Matos housing complex.          The\n\ngovernment’s evidence linking Defendants to the conspiracy was\n\nprimarily the testimony of three cooperating witnesses: Alexis\n\nGarcía-Heredia, a Los Dementes member, who testified to selling\n\ndrugs   at   González’s   drug   point   in    the   Vietnam   Ward   and\n\nparticipating with González and Fernández in the April 2004 killing\n\n(he was one of the shooters); William Rosario-Garcia (“William\n\nRosario”), a co-defendant, who testified for the government to\n\nperforming various errands on behalf of Los Dementes members at\n\nJuana Matos; and Joaquin Casiano, an informant placed by the FBI in\n\nJuana Matos for several months in 2005.       We discuss the evidence at\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\ftrial in greater detail in connection with the Defendants’ various\n\nclaims of error.\n\n     Following Rule 29 motions, the court dismissed the gun charges\n\n(counts VI and VII) against Rosario for insufficient evidence.              It\n\nalso dismissed the claim for forfeiture against all the defendants\n\n(count XIII). On October 17, 2008, after approximately ten days of\n\ntrial,   the   jury   returned     guilty   verdicts    against   all   three\n\ndefendants. It found González guilty of the conspiracy charge, the\n\nsubstantive heroin, crack-cocaine, and cocaine charges, and the gun\n\ncharges under §§ 924(c) & (o).        Fernández was found guilty of the\n\nsame, excepting the heroin charge, of which he was acquitted.\n\nRosario was found guilty of the conspiracy and the substantive\n\ncocaine and crack-cocaine charges.2         On the marijuana charge, all\n\nthree defendants were acquitted.\n\n     The court held sentencing hearings on February 2, 2009.               In\n\ndetermining    González’s    and   Fernández’s    guidelines      range,   the\n\ndistrict   court   applied   United    States    Sentencing   Guidelines     §\n\n2D1.1(d), the “murder cross-reference,” which provides: “If a\n\nvictim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1111 . . . apply [the level for first or second\n\ndegree murder] as appropriate . . . .”                 The court sentenced\n\n\n2\n  On each of the substantive drug counts, the jury convicted\nDefendants of possessing with intent to distribute specified drug\nquantities: at least one hundred fifty grams of crack-cocaine, at\nleast five kilograms of cocaine, and as to González, at least one\nkilogram of heroin.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fGonzález and Fernández to life imprisonment.          The court sentenced\n\nRosario to 151 months imprisonment, which was above the statutory\n\nmandatory   minimum   of   ten   years    in   connection   with   the   drug\n\noffenses, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), but at the bottom of his\n\nguidelines range.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nI.   Jury Notes\n\n       Defendants argue, for the first time on appeal, that the\n\ndistrict court violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel as\n\nwell as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 by responding to\n\nnotes received from the jury during deliberations without alerting\n\ncounsel to the fact of the notes and outside of the presence of\n\nDefendants and their counsel.        The government concedes that the\n\ndistrict court erred procedurally, but contends that the Defendants\n\nwere not prejudiced by the violations.          We agree.\n\n       On October 17, 2008, the court charged the jurors, and at 2:15\n\np.m. sent them to deliberate.        The court advised the parties to\n\n“Stay around in the courthouse.          In case we need you, we’ll call\n\nfrom outside.”    The court received a note from the jury at 3:15\n\np.m.    In this note, marked as Note #2,3 the jury requested (in\n\n\n3\n Fernández argues through counsel (who was not trial counsel) that\nthe record reveals that the court never “took care of” or responded\nto “Jury Note One.” Fernández Br. at 9. This is not correct. The\nrecord reveals that on October 10, 2008, during the lunch recess,\nthe jury sent a note to the court, marked as Note #1, asking that\ntwo questions be put to government witness William Rosario. After\nreceiving the note from the jury, the court read the questions to\n\n                                    -7-\n\fSpanish)   a    copy   of   the   transcript       of   the   testimony     of   the\n\ncooperating      witness    García-Heredia.             The   court    immediately\n\nresponded in writing, “The transcript is not available, it would\n\nhave to be prepared,” and “You should first rely on your collective\n\nmemory.”       The government concedes that the first part of the\n\ncourt’s response was inaccurate: a copy of the transcript of\n\nGarcía-Heredia’s       testimony    had     been    posted     on     the   court’s\n\nelectronic filing system on October 9, 2008, and accordingly, was\n\navailable to be read back to the jury.             A second note was received\n\nat 3:18 p.m.     In this note, marked as Note #3, the jury requested\n\n(this time in English) a transcript of García-Heredia’s grand jury\n\ntestimony.      The court immediately responded in writing, “This\n\ntestimony is not in evidence – no party proposed it.”\n\n     At 4:11 p.m., trial reconvened, and the court informed counsel\n\nthat the jury had reached a verdict.          Prior to reading the verdict,\n\nthe court called counsel to a sidebar and explained that it had\n\nreceived and responded to Notes #2 and #3.               The court said that it\n\nhad tried unsuccessfully to reach counsel, and showed the notes.\n\nThe court advised counsel it had provided a “[b]oiler plate type of\n\n\n\ncounsel, heard argument, and determined that it would ask the\nquestions in a neutral way. There was no objection. Upon resuming\ntrial, the court questioned the witness.       Fernández’s counsel\nappears to be confusing the first note received during\ndeliberations, which was marked as Note #2 but which was identified\nin the minutes pertaining to that trial day as “note 1,” with the\nearlier note, which, as noted above, was received and taken care of\nduring trial.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fanswer of the type suggested always when these type of things\n\nhappen,   okay?”   González’s    counsel   responded,   “Yes,   sir.”\n\nFernández’s counsel made a comment on the content of the notes.\n\nThere was no objection or further inquiry by any counsel into the\n\nsubstance of the court’s responses to the notes.\n\n     We have held that “[a] district court’s failure to attempt to\n\ninform defense counsel about the existence of a jury note, and\n\nfurther failure to solicit defense counsel’s input regarding any\n\nresponse to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure.”   United States v.

Trial   courts   have\n\ndiscretion whether to do so.        See United States v.

That\n\nis, of course, a possibility, but they make no persuasive argument\n\nsupporting such a likelihood.            García-Heredia’s testimony was\n\ndecidedly unfavorable to the Defendants, and they do not show that\n\nit was impeached in cross-examination in any significant fashion,\n\nother than the obvious point of his aiding his own case by\n\ntestifying against the Defendants, which the Defendants forcefully\n\ncommunicated to the jury in their summations.

Voir Dire of Prospective Jurors\n\n      Rosario, in a supplemental pro se filing, also argues that the\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcourt violated his constitutional rights as well as Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 43 by questioning certain prospective alternate\n\njurors   outside   of   his   presence.   We   disagree.   The   court’s\n\nquestioning of the prospective jurors outside the presence of the\n\nDefendants was justified, and, in any event, Rosario waived any\n\nright to be present pursuant to Rule 43 by his failure to object at\n\ntrial.\n\n     After selection of twelve jurors and four alternate jurors,\n\nthe court called counsel to a side bar.        The judge told them that\n\nhe and a security officer observed two of the alternate female\n\njurors laughing and sticking their tongues out at Rosario “like, ‘I\n\nknow you.’”    The court determined that it would question the two\n\nalternates, and ordered that the Defendants be removed from the\n\ncourtroom.    There was no objection.     With counsel for each of the\n\nDefendants present, the court questioned the two alternate female\n\njurors, who said that they did not know any of the Defendants.       The\n\ncourt decided, nevertheless, to excuse the two alternates.\n\n     A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be present\n\nat “all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the\n\nfairness of the proceedings.”       See, e.g., Faretta v. California,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 n.15 (1975).        As noted above, Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 43 further provides that a defendant must be\n\npresent at “every trial stage, including jury impanelment and the\n\nreturn of the verdict,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(2), except at stages\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwhere, inter alia, “[t]he proceeding involves only a conference or\n\nhearing    on       a    question      of    law,”    Fed.

P.    43(b)(3).\n\nDefendants need not be expressly warned of their rights under Rule\n\n43, and a defendant’s failure to assert his right to be present or\n\nto object to a purported violation of the rule may result in a\n\nvalid waiver of the right.

The Supreme Court recognized that\n\n“[t]he mere occurrence of an ex parte conversation between a trial\n\njudge   and     a       juror   does    not       constitute    a   deprivation        of   any\n\nconstitutional right.”              Id. at 526 (quoting Rushen v.

When the court\n\nordered that the Defendants be removed from the courtroom, Rosario\n\nhad the opportunity to object, but did not.         As in Gagnon,\n\nRosario’s “total failure to assert [his] right[] to attend the\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fconference with the juror sufficed to waive [it] under Rule 43.”\n\nGagnon, 470 U.S. at 529.         “If a defendant is entitled under Rule 43\n\nto attend certain ‘stages of the trial’ which do not take place in\n\nopen court, the defendant . . . must assert that right at the time\n\n. . .

Right to Jury Selected from Fair-Cross Section of the\nCommunity\n\n      González and Rosario argue, for the first time on appeal, that\n\nthey were deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to a trial before\n\na jury representing a fair cross-section of the community.                      They\n\nargue that the jury that convicted them was not drawn from a fair\n\ncross section of the community, as it was an English-speaking,\n\n“white-collar,” and “highly professionally oriented” group drawn\n\nfrom a “universe of less than 16% of” their peers.              The local plan\n\nfor   the   District        of   Puerto     Rico   requires   that     jurors    be\n\nsufficiently proficient in English to render satisfactory jury\n\nservice, see, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198309\"><a href=\"/opinion/198309/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n29-30 (1st Cir. 1999), and yet, according to Defendants, eighty\n\npercent of Puerto Rico residents have little command of English.\n\n(The eighty percent figure is based on certain U.S. census surveys\n\ncited in Defendants’ briefs on appeal.)              Because this contention,\n\nat least as it pertained to the composition of the trial jury, was\n\nnot raised in the district court, it is subject to review only for\n\n                                          -16-\n\fplain error.         Even if it were properly preserved for review,\n\nDefendants’ contention is foreclosed by our precedents, which have\n\nrepeatedly upheld the English proficiency requirement against such\n\nchallenges in Puerto Rico district court.

Defendants offer no persuasive reason\n\nfor reconsidering our prior rulings.\n\nIV.   Spanish Translation of Jury Instructions\n\n      González argues for the first time on appeal that his right to\n\na fair trial was violated because the district court did not\n\nprovide     the    jury   with   a   Spanish   translation    of     the    jury\n\ninstructions.

As noted above, the governing rules require that all\n\njurors speak, read, and write in English with proficiency.                 At the\n\njury selection phase, the Defendants were not rebuffed in any\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\feffort to test any juror’s comprehension of English.                  González has\n\nfailed to show any error (let alone plain error).\n\nV.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     Defendants      challenge      the     sufficiency        of    the    evidence\n\nsupporting their convictions.              We review de novo the district\n\ncourt’s denial of a motion made under Rule 29 for judgment of\n\nacquittal.    United States v. Giambro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203507\"><a href=\"/opinion/203507/united-states-v-giambro/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    In doing so, we view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable    to    the   jury’s   guilty    verdict   and      assess      whether   a\n\nreasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.            See United States v. Lipscomb,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203508\"><a href=\"/opinion/203508/united-states-v-lipscomb/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).           We conclude that the evidence was\n\nsufficient    to    support   the   jury’s    verdict     as    to   González    and\n\nFernández. However, in the case of Rosario, we conclude that while\n\nthe evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict as to his\n\ninvolvement in crimes of drug conspiracy and distribution, it did\n\nnot support the jury’s findings of elevated quantities of drugs.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court’s judgment as to Rosario\n\nto the extent it included the elevated quantities, and remand for\n\nre-sentencing.\n\n1) González and Fernández.\n\n     The evidence was clearly sufficient to show that González and\n\nFernández were involved in the Los Dementes drug distribution\n\noperation, which operated out of the Juana Matos housing project\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fand sold drugs at a drug point owned by González on F street in the\n\nVietnam Ward.    Much of the evidence was provided by the testimony\n\nof García-Heredia, who testified that he had been a member of Los\n\nDementes and sold drugs, including heroin, cocaine, crack-cocaine,\n\nand marijuana, for the organization.           He identified González as\n\nthe owner of the drug point, and Fernández as having sold drugs and\n\nhaving acted as an enforcer at the drug point.6                    According to\n\nGarcía-Heredia, drugs were routinely delivered from Juana Matos to\n\nthe Vietnam location by Los Dementes principals, and these drugs\n\nwere sold under so-called “brand names,” including Pokemon, that\n\nwere exclusive to Los Dementes drug points.                   (Other evidence\n\nestablished the large quantities supporting the jury’s verdict.)7\n\n     García-Heredia also testified to his involvement, together\n\nwith González and Fernández,         in the April 25, 2004 murders, which\n\nformed the basis for the convictions under Sections 924(c) and (o).\n\nAs   part   of   a   war   between    Los   Dementes    and    a    rival   drug\n\norganization, Las Palmas, Los Dementes members attempted to kill\n\nLas Palmas’s leader, Gilberto El Reyes.                According to García-\n\nHeredia, while González drove the car, he and Fernández opened fire\n\n\n6\n  There was also testimony that, by May 2004 (following González’s\narrest for bank robbery), Fernández operated the Vietnam Ward drug\npoint and that drugs at Juana Matos were packaged for Fernández to\nsell in the Vietnam Ward.\n7\n  During a two-month surveillance of the Juana Matos drug points,\nthe evidence established that the drug conspiracy sold “about\n71,000 decks of heroin, 62,000 baggies of cocaine, 300,000 vials of\n‘crack,’ and 60,000 baggies of marijuana.”\n\n                                     -19-\n\f(he with two semi-automatic .38 revolvers and Fernández with an AK-\n\n47) on another car they believed belonged to El-Reyes’s son. Three\n\npassengers in the car were killed.      (It turned out that the car did\n\nnot belong to El Reyes’s son; none of the victims were involved in\n\nthe drug trade.)\n\n     González and Fernández argue that the convictions under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 860 must be vacated because the drug sales in the Vietnam\n\nWard were not within 1000 feet of a public housing project or\n\nschool, as they contend is required by that statute.8             This\n\nargument is without merit.   Section 860 does not require that the\n\ndrug sales take place within 1000 feet of a housing project or\n\nschool.   The charges under § 860 included possession of drugs\n\nwithin 1000 feet of a hosing project or school, with intent to\n\ndistribute.   The evidence showed that González and Fernández, with\n\nintent to distribute, aided and abetted in such possession within\n\n1000 feet of a protected location (in this case, Juana Matos and\n\ntwo schools located therein).9     See United States v. DeLuna, 10\n\n\n8\n  21 U.S.C. § 860 provides in relevant part that: “Any person who\nviolates section 841(a)(1) of this title . . . by distributing,\npossessing with intent to distribute, or manufacturing a controlled\nsubstance in or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real\nproperty comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or\nsecondary school or . . . housing facility owned by a public\nhousing authority . . . is subject to (1) twice the maximum\npunishment authorized by section 841(b) of this title . . . .”\n9\n  Fernández argues in a supplemental pro se filing that the\nconvictions under Sections 924(c) and (o) must be vacated because\nthere was insufficient evidence of a “nexus” between the April 25,\n2004 killings and the drug trafficking charges. We disagree. The\n\n                                 -20-\n\fF.3d 1529, 1534-35 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n2) Rosario.\n\n     Rosario was convicted of drug conspiracy, and of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute at least one hundred fifty grams of\n\ncrack-cocaine and five kilograms of cocaine.             See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846, 860.     We conclude first that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to show that Rosario participated in the drug conspiracy\n\nand that he possessed or aided and abetted the possession of drugs\n\nat Juana Matos with intent to distribute.\n\n     The evidence of Rosario’s participation came in principally\n\nthrough two witnesses:    Casiano and William Rosario.          Casiano was\n\nan FBI informant placed in Juana Matos as an outside observer for\n\napproximately   two   months,     from    February   through    April   2005.\n\nCasiano   testified   that   he    saw    Rosario    attend    what   Casiano\n\ncharacterized as a March 2005 peace meeting between Los Dementes\n\nand Las Palmas members at Juana Matos, and that when he saw Rosario\n\nat the housing complex, “[h]e            would always be with Hueso.”10\n\n\nevidence showed that González and Fernández attempted to murder El-\nReyes as part of a war between the two drug organizations, and did\nso with the participation of other Los Dementes members.        The\nattempted murder was sufficiently connected to the drug trafficking\ncrime to satisfy Section 924(c)’s “during and in relation to”\nrequirement.\n10\n   In the district court, Rosario moved for a mistrial on the\ngrounds that the government engaged in misconduct by permitting\nCasiano to testify allegedly falsely about Rosario’s presence at\nthe peace meeting. The basis for this accusation was that Casiano\nhad previously told the government that he could not identify\nRosario on the basis of a photo given to him. The court summarily\n\n                                   -21-\n\fCasiano testified that “Hueso was the leader, and not everybody got\n\nto hang out with him.” According to Casiano, only close associates\n\nin the drug business could “hang out” with Hueso.\n\n     William   Rosario,      the   cooperating   witness,     testified   to\n\nperforming various drug-related tasks and errands for members of\n\nLos Dementes at Juana Matos.          He confirmed that the defendant\n\nRosario “would spend all of his time with, you know, with the big\n\npeople in the organization, with Hueso.”         “More than twice” he saw\n\nthe defendant Rosario in an apartment in “Building 50” – one of the\n\nprincipal apartments where Los Dementes members would prepare drugs\n\n– at times when drugs were being prepared.             He saw the defendant\n\nRosario there with other members of the organization. According to\n\nWilliam Rosario’s testimony, the apartment was outfitted with\n\nsteel-plated   doors   and    video   cameras    for    surveillance.     He\n\ntestified that there were “a lot of drugs and a lot of money” at\n\nthe apartment.   He estimated that Los Dementes members processed\n\napproximately 1/4 kilogram of cocaine into crack (the equivalent of\n\nabout 1000 vials of crack) in the apartment approximately three or\n\nfour times per week, and that he often saw approximately $5000 in\n\n\ndenied the motion, and Rosario appeals from the denial. We see no\nbasis for grant of new trial, nor any showing of misconduct on the\ncurrent record.    Rosario was given an adequate opportunity to\ndevelop this (or any other) inconsistency on cross-examination.\nCasiano testified that, although he did not recognize Rosario from\nthe picture, he realized in the courtroom that the defendant was\n“Julio Hotdog” (Rosario’s nickname), who he remembered from his\ntime at Juana Matos. The government was entitled to solicit this\ntestimony and the jury was entitled to credit it.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fcash being counted there (by machine).\n\n     William Rosario also testified about two specific drug-related\n\ninteractions he had with the defendant Rosario.   In the first, the\n\ndefendant Rosario took William to Rosario’s aunt’s house in a\n\nneighboring housing complex, where Rosario had William “cook” and\n\n“taste” (tasks he often performed at Juana Matos) a small sample\n\nfrom a bag of cocaine (the bag’s weight was approximately 1/8\n\nkilogram).   In the second, William washed a car for Rosario, and in\n\nreturn, Rosario paid him with six or seven vials of crack.       In\n\nresponse to a question from the jury as to whether he knew if “in\n\nthe Building 50 they prepare drugs for Julio Rosario,” William\n\ntestified: “I could not tell you that I was there when they were\n\npreparing drugs for Julio. But I can say that on one day, when I\n\nwashed a car for him, he told me that after I finished, that he was\n\ngoing to go to apartment 50 and that he was going to pay me with\n\nwhat they were preparing for him.”\n\n      Finally, the government introduced evidence that, following\n\nthe October 2007 indictment and arrests, Rosario fled and took on\n\na new identity.     When he was apprehended in 2008 by the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service, he was found in possession of a fake driver’s\n\nlicense and social security card (both in the name of “Omar\n\nPalma”). When confronted with the fake documents, Rosario admitted\n\nthat “he was assuming the identity of Mr. Omar Palma while being a\n\nfugitive.”   The government argued – and the jury was entitled to\n\n\n                                -23-\n\ffind – that Rosario’s attempt to evade arrest demonstrated a\n\nconsciousness of guilt.11\n\n     Taken   together,   and   in   the    light   most   favorable     to   the\n\nverdict,   this   evidence   was    sufficient     to   support   the   jury’s\n\nfindings that Rosario was guilty of participation in the drug\n\ndistribution conspiracy and of aiding and abetting the possession\n\nof drugs with intent to distribute.12\n\n\n\n11\n   Rosario argues that the district court erred in admitting\nevidence of his flight because (1) the evidence was admitted\nwithout the necessary showing of extrinsic evidence of guilt, and\n(2) the evidence was highly prejudicial and should have been\nexcluded pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403.           We reject these\ncontentions.   “A district court is afforded considerable leeway\nwhen determining whether evidence of a defendant’s flight is\naccompanied by a sufficient factual predicate . . . [and] is\nafforded similar latitude in determining whether the evidence\npasses the Rule 403 balancing test.” United States v. Benedetti,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201980\"><a href=\"/opinion/201980/united-states-v-benedetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (1st Cir. 2005). We believe there was sufficient\nextrinsic evidence of Rosario’s guilt to support admission of the\nflight evidence.   Nor can we say that the district court acted\noutside of its discretion in admitting the flight evidence pursuant\nto Rule 403. We note further that the district court instructed\nthe jury – instructions we presume it followed – that flight alone\nis not a sufficient basis to convict, but rather should be\nconsidered in light of all the evidence presented at trial. We\ndiscern no reversible error in connection with the admission of the\nflight evidence.\n12\n   We note that Rosario testified as part of the defense case,\ndenying his involvement in any drug-related activities at Juana\nMatos.   He denied that Los Dementes was a drug distribution\norganization. He also implausibly asserted that Hueso was simply\na “recreational leader” at the housing complex.

The government relied on\n\ntestimony that Rosario, like González and Fernández, owned a drug\n\npoint outside of Juana Matos, which, if proved, would presumably be\n\nsufficient to show responsibility for large quantities. There was,\n\nhowever, no competent evidence of his ownership of a drug point.\n\nWilliam Rosario testified that “from what [he] knew, [Rosario] had\n\na crack point” outside of Juana Matos.              When asked on direct\n\nexamination how he knew Rosario was a drug point owner, William\n\nRosario did not give any intelligible explanation.                 On cross-\n\nexamination,    William   Rosario    acknowledged    that    his   basis   for\n\nbelieving Rosario had a drug point was “because somebody told\n\n[him].”   William Rosario accordingly had no competent basis for\n\ntestifying that Rosario had a drug point.         Nor has the government\n\nidentified for us any other evidence from which a rational trier of\n\nfact could conclude that Rosario had a drug point.\n\n     We recognize that there was evidence of large quantities of\n\ndrugs, money, and drug dealing paraphernalia at the apartment in\n\nBuilding 50, and there was evidence that Rosario was seen “more\n\nthan twice” in that apartment, including at least one occasion when\n\ndrugs were being prepared. But there was no evidence showing that,\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fon any occasion when Rosario was at the apartment, he would\n\ninevitably have seen large-scale operations being conducted there.\n\nNor did the evidence show Rosario’s awareness of the continuity of\n\nsustained drug preparation there.         While the government might have\n\nbeen able to elicit such testimony with properly focused questions,\n\nit did not do so.       In order to support a criminal conviction,\n\nevidence   must   be   sufficient    to    support   a    finding   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt of the essential elements.              Without doubt there\n\nwas evidence from which jurors could speculate as to Rosario’s\n\nawareness of the large-scale operation in which he participated,\n\nbut the evidence as to him was sketchy and could not support a\n\nfinding beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Accordingly, while we affirm Rosario’s convictions on the\n\nvarious drug offenses, we vacate the judgment to the extent that it\n\nincorporated convictions based on the jury’s findings of elevated\n\nquantities.   Because Rosario’s overall sentence was predicated in\n\npart on these convictions for elevated quantities, and because the\n\ncharges alleging elevated quantities included mandatory minimum\n\nsentences,13 we vacate Rosario’s sentence.       At Rosario’s sentencing\n\nhearing, the district court treated the jury’s findings of elevated\n\n\n\n13\n  The jury found the Defendants responsible for drug quantities of\nat least five kilograms of cocaine and at least one hundred fifty\ngrams of crack-cocaine.

See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1) (“If a victim was killed under\n\n\n15\n  González was sentenced to 480 months imprisonment on Count I\n(drug conspiracy); life imprisonment on Counts II, III, and IV (the\nsubstantive drug charges); 240 months imprisonment on Count VII\n(the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(o)), to run concurrently with the\nother counts; and life imprisonment on Count VI (the violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), to run consecutively with the other counts.\n16\n  U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1 states that the base offense level for first\ndegree murder is 43.\n\n                                     -28-\n\fcircumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\n\nhad such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime\n\njurisdiction of the United States, apply § 2A1.1 (First Degree\n\nMurder) . . . .”); see also United States v.

The evidence of the April 25, 2004 murders\n\nmade this offense level applicable.17                 Nor is there reason to doubt\n\nthat the court recognized its obligation to consider the obligatory\n\nsentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), or the advisory nature\n\nof the Guidelines since Booker.                 See 2/2/09 Sentencing Hr’g Tr.\n\n(González) at 43-44 (“We have looked at this in the context of the\n\nadvisory guidelines.

Sentencing judges are not obligated to set\n\nforth their appraisal of the pertinent factors.                    Dávila-González,\n\n595 F.3d at 48.            We find no procedural unreasonableness in the\n\ncourt’s imposition of sentence.               Nor do we find any reason to doubt\n\nthe       substantive     unreasonableness        of   the   sentence      imposed    on\n\n\n17\n   The court also determined that a four-level leadership\nenhancement applied pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), because the\ndefendant was a leader of criminal activity involving five or more\nparticipants. Because 43 is the highest possible offense level\nunder the Guidelines, González’s offense level remained 43.\n\n                                           -29-\n\fGonzález, especially in view of his wanton killings.\n\n       Fernández, in a pro se supplemental brief, also challenges the\n\nreasonableness of his sentence. Fernández’s principal objection is\n\nto the application of the Guidelines’ murder cross-reference in\n\ndetermining his guidelines range. As discussed above in connection\n\nwith González’s sentence, evidence of Fernández’s participation in\n\nthe April 25,       2004 murders made a base offense level of 43\n\napplicable.       See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1).          We have considered\n\nFernández’s remaining sentencing arguments, and find them without\n\nmerit.18\n\nVII.    Notice of Charges\n\n       González and Fernández argue that the superseding indictment\n\nfailed     to   provide   adequate   and   timely   notice    of   the   charges\n\nrelating to the April 25, 2004 murders and thus violated their\n\nSixth Amendment rights to notice of accusation.               González raises\n\nthe argument for the first time on appeal.19                 Fernández in the\n\ndistrict court did not object to the filing of the new charges, but\n\nmoved to exclude evidence of the murders. Regardless of the proper\n\nstandard of review, we find no error.\n\n\n\n18\n  Because we vacate Rosario’s sentence in its entirety, we do not\naddress the sentencing arguments advanced by Rosario on appeal.\n19\n   On September 4, 2008, González, through counsel, filed an in\nlimine motion seeking to suppress certain video evidence relating\nto the April 25, 2004 murders, which the motion described as “raw,\ngruesome, and inflammatory.”     The motion did not argue that\nGonzález’s Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\n\n                                     -30-\n\f       The charges added by the superseding indictment returned on\n\nAugust 22, 2008 did not expand the scope of the evidence as to the\n\nDefendants.      The original indictment included a charge under 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   924(c),    alleging     their    use    of   firearms.   The      only\n\npertinent change in the superseding indictment was to add a charge\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 924(o) of conspiracy to commit the violation of\n\n§ 924(c), which set forth as an overt act that: “[O]n or about\n\nApril 25, 2004, in Cataño, Dorado, and elsewhere within Puerto\n\nRico,” defendants, including González and Fernández, “carried and\n\nused firearms, to include fully automatic pistols and rifles\n\n(machine guns).”        The shooting down of the three occupants of the\n\ncar which the Defendants mistakenly believed carried the drug\n\nrival’s son was provable under the earlier indictment without need\n\nfor the supplemental charge. The addition of this specification of\n\nan overt act in furtherance of the Section 924(o) conspiracy did\n\nnot enlarge the admissible evidence.                 As the Dorado shootings in\n\nfurtherance of a drug dealing war were evidence of both the\n\nnarcotics and firearms offenses, they would have been admissible\n\neven     if   the   superseding       indictment        had   not   been   filed.\n\nFurthermore, the Defendants had been put on notice of this evidence\n\nlong   before   the     filing   of   the     superseding     indictment   by   the\n\ngovernment’s designation of evidence. Defendants have not asserted\n\nthat the government’s allegedly tardy filings impaired their trial\n\npreparation or their ability to present a defense.                     Nor have\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fDefendants argued on appeal that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in not delaying trial to permit further investigation or\n\npreparation. The argument is therefore forfeited. We see no basis\n\nfor disturbing the convictions of either González or Fernández on\n\nthis ground.\n\nVIII.    Hearsay Statements of Cooperating Witnesses\n\n       Defendants     argue    that     the     district     court    erred      by\n\nprovisionally    admitting        alleged    hearsay    testimony    by    certain\n\ncooperating government witnesses, without having later made a final\n\ndetermination       that   such     testimony    satisfied    Fed.    R.     Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E)’s requirements for the admission of co-conspirator\n\ntestimony.20    The argument is without merit.\n\n       On the first day of trial, the government elicited testimony\n\nfrom    García-Heredia     about    certain     statements   made    to    him   by\n\nGonzález about their intention to go ahead with the attempted\n\nassassination    of    the    Las   Palmas    leader.      González’s      counsel\n\nobjected to the testimony on the grounds that it was hearsay, and\n\nargued that for the statement to be admissible the court had to\n\nmake a finding that García-Heredia was engaged in a conspiracy with\n\nthe Defendants.       The court responded that, under our precedent in\n\nUnited States v. Petrozziello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1977), it\n\ncould make a tentative determination that González and García-\n\n\n\n20\n  This argument was raised by at least González and Fernández in\nRule 29 motions filed after trial.\n\n                                       -32-\n\fHeredia were members of a drug conspiracy, and if the statement was\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, it could be admitted.             The court\n\nstated that it would make final determinations on these issues\n\nafter it heard all the evidence.            González’s counsel agreed, and\n\nthere was no further inquiry.           (This came up again during the\n\ntestimony of Casiano, with respect to statements made to him by\n\nalleged members of the conspiracy during his undercover assignment\n\nat Juana Matos.    Fernández’s counsel objected on hearsay grounds,\n\nand the district court made the same ruling, i.e., that it could\n\nonly make a final ruling at the close of the evidence.                  At the\n\nclose of the government’s case, neither the Defendants nor the\n\ngovernment   requested     a   final    ruling   from     the   court   on   the\n\nadmissibility of any of the provisionally admitted co-conspirator\n\ntestimony under Fed.

Rosario’s remaining arguments\n\n      Rosario argues pro se and for the first time on appeal that\n\nhis due process rights were violated because a “selected sworn\n\njuror was asleep from the inception of the trial.”          Rosario Supp.\n\nBr. at 8.     Rosario cites to a portion of the transcript where\n\nRosario’s counsel alerted the trial court that one of the jurors\n\nwas “falling asleep.”    At the time, Rosario did not raise any due\n\nprocess   objection,   and   therefore,   such   argument    is   at   best\n\nforfeited on appeal, subject to review only for plain error.           The\n\ntrial court is not required to remove a juror who has slept and is\n\naccorded considerable discretion in handling the matter.               See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Freitag, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770928\"><a href=\"/opinion/770928/united-states-v-georgia-r-freitag/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023 (7th Cir.\n\n2000); see also United States v.

A sleeping juror does not violate a defendant’s due\n\nprocess rights unless the defendant can show he was prejudiced to\n\n\n\n22\n  We note that, as for the statements made by González to García-\nHeredia concerning plans to kill El-Reyes (to which González\nobjected to below), we would have no trouble concluding that the\nevidence showed a conspiracy among García-Heredia, González, and\nFernández (Rosario was not implicated by this testimony), and that\nthe statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. We note\nfurther that the statement would also be admissible, at least as to\nGonzález, as an admission of a party-opponent under Fed. R. Evid.\n801(d)(2)(A).\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fthe extent that he did not receive a fair trial.   See Freitag, 230\n\nF.3d at 1023.   Rosario’s pointing out that a single juror at one\n\npoint in the trial fell asleep does not by itself establish such\n\nprejudice, and does not support grant of new trial.\n\n     Rosario also argues for the first time on appeal that his\n\ntrial should have been severed pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 14.   He argues that he was prejudiced by the spillover\n\neffects of evidence with respect to González and Fernández’s role\n\nin the April 25, 2004 murders, in which he had no part.       This\n\nargument is forfeited as he failed to raise it below.       In any\n\nevent, “[c]o-conspirators are customarily tried together absent a\n\nstrong showing of prejudice.”   United States v. Perkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556607\"><a href=\"/opinion/556607/united-states-v-patrick-perkins-united-states-of-america-v-lois-perkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1280 (1st Cir. 1991).     On the current record, we have no\n\nreason to think that had a motion to sever been made, the district\n\ncourt would have been compelled to grant it.   See United States v.\n\nBrandon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (1st Cir. 1994) (“The decision to grant\n\nor deny a motion for severance is committed to the sound discretion\n\nof the trial court and we will reverse its refusal to sever only\n\nupon a finding of manifest abuse of discretion.”).23\n\n\n23\n  After oral argument, González and Fernández submitted various pro\nse motions, seeking, inter alia, a stay of the proceedings and\nappointment of new counsel or permission to proceed pro se. The\nbasis for González and Fernández’s motions appear to be that the\ngovernment breached plea agreements entered into in a prior\ncriminal case, 04-cr-217 (PG), by using evidence from that case in\nthe instant prosecution and that their trial and appellate counsel\nwere ineffective in not pursuing these allegations. The motions\nare denied.

The judgment as to\n\nRosario is vacated to the extent it is based on the jury’s findings\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of elevated drug quantities.
