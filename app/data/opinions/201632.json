Gonzáles was sworn in as United States Attorney General\non February 3, 2005.      We have therefore substituted Attorney\nGeneral Gonzáles for his predecessor in office as respondent in\nthis matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.    Petitioner Michael Olusean Falae,\n\na Nigerian national, seeks review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) denying his motion to remand proceedings\n\nto an immigration judge (IJ) in order to allow him to apply for\n\nadjustment of his immigration status.    The proposed adjustment was\n\nbased on the combined force of (i) the approval of a so-called I-\n\n140 visa application sponsored by his employer, see 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255, and (ii) his marriage to a United States citizen, see id. §\n\n1182(i)(1).   The petitioner argues that these two events qualify\n\nhim for a waiver of inadmissability and an adjustment of status\n\nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).       Discerning no\n\nabuse of discretion, we deny the petition for review.\n\n           The petitioner arrived in the United States in April of\n\n1995 armed with a tourist visa that apparently authorized him to\n\nremain for six months.   We say \"apparently\" because both the visa\n\nand the petitioner's passport had been issued in the name of one\n\nVincent Olanrewaju Adeyemi.   The petitioner initially lived with\n\nhis fiancée, Stella Olujoke, a non-citizen whom he had known in\n\nNigeria.   He did not leave after six months and, in March of 1996,\n\nhe jilted Olujoke and married a United States citizen.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      During the hearings before the immigration court, the\npetitioner testified that he could not remember the last name of\nhis former spouse. He referred to her throughout as \"April,\" and\nwe follow suit.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f                In July of 1997, the petitioner divorced April without\n\never having lived with her.             Nine days later, he married his once\n\nand    former      fiancée,   Olujoke,         who   then      amended    her    pending\n\napplication        for    asylum   and    related        relief    to    include        the\n\npetitioner.         The petitioner and Olujoke were interviewed by an\n\nasylum officer in May of 1999.                  That interview resulted in an\n\nunfavorable        recommendation        and     the     institution      of     removal\n\nproceedings.         The notice to appear was made returnable to the\n\nimmigration court in Boston.\n\n                At the start, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(INS) charged the petitioner with illegal entry into the United\n\nStates in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).2 Subsequently,\n\nthe    INS       lodged   additional      charges        of    inadmissability          and\n\ndeportability, under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), based on the use of\n\nfraudulent documents to gain entry into the United States.                              The\n\nsame sort of charges were lodged against Olujoke.                        While the two\n\ncases were consolidated for some period of time, that order was\n\nrescinded after the petitioner and Olujoke divorced.                            Olujoke's\n\ncase       is   pending   before   us    (Appeal       No.    04-1252)   and     will    be\n\naddressed in a separate opinion.                 In this opinion, we chronicle\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\neliminated the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004). For simplicity's sake, we continue to refer to the INS\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fonly those facts and proceedings that relate directly to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n            To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the petitioner\n\nconceded removability and moved to amend his pleadings to permit an\n\napplication for adjustment of status based on the approval of an I-\n\n140 visa application filed on the petitioner's behalf by his\n\nemployer, the Providence School Department.             The approval of that\n\napplication resulted in his classification as a skilled worker and,\n\nthus, afforded a potential avenue to allow him to remain in the\n\nUnited States.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3)(A) (establishing a\n\nspecial    visa   category    for   skilled     workers     who      obtain   labor\n\ncertification).\n\n            In October of 2000, the IJ found that the petitioner's\n\nfraudulent use of documents to gain entry into the United States\n\ndebarred him from an adjustment of status, notwithstanding the\n\napproved   I-140   application.         The   IJ    further    found      that   the\n\npetitioner    lacked   credibility.           She   based     this      credibility\n\ndetermination on his demeanor, myriad inconsistencies in his trial\n\ntestimony, and questionable documentation submitted on his behalf\n\n(including    a    bogus     yearbook    photograph).             The    IJ   found\n\n\"particularly troubling\" the petitioner's inability to recall any\n\ndetails about his first marriage (including his wife's last name)\n\nand the fact that the petitioner and his first wife never lived\n\ntogether. Although the IJ declined to make a specific finding that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe union was entered into for the purpose of evading United States\n\nimmigration laws, see 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), she thought it probable\n\nthat the marriage was a sham (she termed it a \"green card\"\n\nmarriage).     She also deemed it \"curious\" that the petitioner's\n\nsecond marriage \"occurred a mere nine days after his divorce became\n\nfinal.\"\n\n             Based upon these and other findings, the IJ concluded\n\nthat the petitioner had not shown past persecution in Nigeria by\n\ncredible     testimony.    Consequently,   he   had   not   established\n\neligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT). Furthermore, the IJ declared\n\nthe petitioner ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(i) because he could not identify any qualifying\n\ncitizen relatives in the United States.          Accordingly, the IJ\n\npretermitted the application for adjustment of status, ordered the\n\npetitioner removed to Nigeria, and denied his request for voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The petitioner filed a timely appeal with the BIA and, a\n\nmonth later,      divorced Olujoke.     Three months thereafter, he\n\nmarried Sandra Hannah, a United States citizen.       He then filed a\n\nmotion to remand so that he might seek adjustment of status based\n\non the combination of (i) the approved I-140 visa application\n\nsubmitted by his employer and (ii) his marriage to a Untied States\n\ncitizen.     As part of his proffer, the petitioner asseverated that\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdeportation to Nigeria would impose extreme hardship upon his new\n\nbride, who allegedly suffered from a kaleidoscopic array of medical\n\nand psychological disorders.\n\n          In   January   of    2004,   the   BIA   upheld   the   IJ's\n\ndeterminations and rejected the petitioner's merits appeal.         It\n\nsimultaneously denied his motion to remand. On that score, the BIA\n\nnoted that the petitioner had married his new wife \"a mere 7\n\nmonths\" after he was ordered removed by the IJ and explained that\n\nthe petitioner's \"lack of credibility at his hearing, his prior use\n\nof fraudulent documents, his previous marital history and the\n\ntiming of his current marriage\" argued persuasively against an\n\naffirmative exercise of its discretion to reopen the proceedings.\n\nThis petition for judicial review followed.\n\n          The petitioner seeks judicial review of the BIA's denial\n\nof his motion to remand — no more and no less.3    In that motion, he\n\nasked the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ in order to allow him\n\nto pursue an adjustment of status.     Neither the INA nor the BIA's\n\nrules of practice recognize motions to remand as such.            Here,\n\nhowever, the motion to remand was plainly in the nature of a motion\n\nto reopen the proceedings before the IJ (the IJ originally adjudged\n\nhim ineligible for relief in part because he lacked a qualifying\n\ncitizen relative; once he had married a United States citizen, he\n\n\n     3\n      Given the circumscribed nature of the relief requested, we\nneed not address the BIA's affirmance of the decision to deny\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fsought to present fresh evidence of his newfound eligibility for an\n\nadjustment of status).        The BIA, therefore, properly treated the\n\nmotion to remand as a motion to reopen.        See In re Coelho, 20 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).       So do we.\n\n           Motions to reopen are disfavored in immigration practice\n\nbecause of the compelling public interests in finality and the\n\nexpeditious processing of proceedings.         INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,\n\n107 (1988); Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThe granting or denial of such a motion is discretionary.           See INS\n\nv. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992).            At a bare minimum, the\n\nmovant must make a showing of prima facie eligibility for the\n\nrelief that he seeks.       See, e.g., Afful v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).     He also must show that the evidence sought to be\n\nintroduced on remand is material and that it was not previously\n\navailable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Fesseha, 333 F.3d\n\nat 20.   Even if he satisfies these threshold conditions, he is not\n\nhome   free;   he   still   must   persuade   the   BIA   to   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion affirmatively and order the case reopened. See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(a); see also Abudu, 485 U.S. at 105.\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.        See Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).     This means that we will interfere with the BIA's\n\ndisposition of such a motion only if the petitioner can establish\n\nthat the BIA made an error of law or acted in a manner that is\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ffairly characterizable as arbitrary or capricious.                  See Carter v.\n\nINS, 90 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Henry v. INS, 74 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that the BIA may abuse its\n\ndiscretion by \"neglecting to consider a significant factor that\n\nappropriately bears on the discretionary decision, by attaching\n\nweight    to    a   factor    that   does    not    appropriately      bear   on   the\n\ndecision, or by assaying all the proper factors and no improper\n\nones, but nonetheless making a clear judgmental error in weighing\n\nthem\").    In conducting this deferential review, we must keep in\n\nmind   that     the   usual    reasons      for    ceding   deference    to   agency\n\ndecisionmaking on similar motions in other administrative contexts\n\nhave special force in the immigration context. See Abudu, 485 U.S.\n\nat 110.\n\n               We assume, for argument's sake, that the petitioner made\n\nthe required showing of prima facie eligibility for an adjustment\n\nof status.      His marriage to a United States citizen, if bona fide,\n\nrendered him presumptively eligible for such an adjustment.                    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(i) (authorizing a waiver of inadmissibility for fraud\n\nor willful misrepresentation if the Attorney General determines\n\nthat the alien's removal from the United States would result in\n\nextreme    hardship     to    the    alien's      citizen   spouse).      Moreover,\n\nevidence of such a union is material to the relief sought (i.e., it\n\nhas the potential to influence the outcome of the application for\n\nan adjustment of status) and, inasmuch as the nuptials occurred\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fafter the IJ's decision, that evidence was unavailable during the\n\noriginal hearings.\n\n              Given these assumptions, this case turns on the BIA's\n\nnegative      exercise   of   its   discretion.     We    discern    no    abuse.\n\nAlthough the BIA did not make a specific \"sham marriage\" finding,\n\nit made pellucid its grave doubts as to the suspicious timing of\n\nthe petitioner's marriage to Hannah and the genuineness of that\n\nmarriage.     It then cited, as aggravating factors, the petitioner's\n\npersistent use of fraudulent documents, his checkered marital\n\nhistory, and his overall lack of credibility.\n\n              We view these facts as relevant and the BIA's reliance on\n\nthem as reasonable.       The key is the adverse credibility finding —\n\na   finding    that   derives   ample    support   from   the   record.         The\n\npetitioner's      actions     showed    quite   clearly    that     he    had    no\n\ncompunctions about using bogus documentation (and, thus, about\n\ndissembling in an effort to evade the immigration laws).                        His\n\ncourse of conduct gave rise to a plausible inference — an inference\n\nthat the IJ chose to draw — that he viewed marriage less as a\n\nsacrament and more as a tool for ensuring continued residency in\n\nthe United States. And, finally, his demeanor on the witness stand\n\nand his evasiveness in the face of close questioning were, as the\n\nIJ noted, telling indicia of a lack of forthrightness. Perhaps the\n\nmost glaring examples are his convenient memory loss when queried\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fabout his first marriage and his attempts to \"coach\" Olujoke when\n\nshe testified in his behalf.\n\n              The short of it is that the adverse credibility finding\n\nwas   fully    supported.      That   finding     undermined       not   only   the\n\npetitioner's case in chief but also his motion to remand.                    There\n\nwas, therefore, a sound and wholly rational predicate for the BIA's\n\nnegative exercise of its discretion.            See Krazoun v. Ashcroft, 350\n\nF.3d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              In arguing for an opposite conclusion, the petitioner\n\nmakes two points that warrant brief rebuttal. First, he invites us\n\nto hold that this case is controlled by In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23\n\nI. & N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), in which the BIA granted a motion to\n\nreopen   proceedings       pending    adjudication     of     an     I-130      visa\n\napplication.      We decline the invitation because the two cases are\n\nnot fair congeners.        In Velarde-Pacheco, unlike in this case, the\n\npetitioner (whom the BIA deemed credible) had established the bona\n\nfides of his marriage to a United States citizen by clear and\n\nconvincing     evidence.      See    id.   at   256.   Even    then,      the   BIA\n\nemphasized that the grant of relief was entirely a matter of\n\ndiscretion.      Id.\n\n              Second, the petitioner claims that the BIA overlooked\n\nfactors that speak in favor of granting him relief.                These include\n\nhis record of steady employment, his lack of a criminal record, the\n\npositive impact he has had on Hannah's life, and his acquiescent\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fparticipation in immigration proceedings.             We readily agree that\n\nthese are mitigating factors, but it is sheer conjecture to say\n\nthat the BIA overlooked them. The petitioner's remonstrance, then,\n\nreduces to a claim that the BIA attached insufficient weight to\n\nthese mitigating factors.\n\n          We reject that claim. The BIA, in evaluating a motion to\n\nreopen, must consider the record as a whole.           Zhao v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nJustice, 265 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir. 2001).              Thus, its exercise of\n\ndiscretion typically will entail the weighing of multiple factors,\n\nnot all of which point in the same direction.              See Chen v. INS, 87\n\nF.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1996).      Here, the mitigating factors marshaled\n\nby the petitioner simply do not, either as a matter of law or as a\n\nmatter of logic, so overbalance the adverse factors emphasized by\n\nthe BIA as to require a finding of misused discretion.              See Henry,\n\n74 F.3d at 4 (stating that a finding of abuse of discretion, under\n\nsuch circumstances, requires a showing that the BIA made \"a clear\n\njudgmental    error    in   weighing    [competing     factors]\")   (emphasis\n\nsupplied).\n\n          We need go no further.              On this record, the BIA acted\n\nwell   within    the   realm   of   its       discretion   in   rejecting   the\n\npetitioner's motion to remand the proceedings.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

Gonzáles was sworn in as United States Attorney General\non February 3, 2005.      We have therefore substituted Attorney\nGeneral Gonzáles for his predecessor in office as respondent in\nthis matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.    Petitioner Michael Olusean Falae,\n\na Nigerian national, seeks review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) denying his motion to remand proceedings\n\nto an immigration judge (IJ) in order to allow him to apply for\n\nadjustment of his immigration status.    The proposed adjustment was\n\nbased on the combined force of (i) the approval of a so-called I-\n\n140 visa application sponsored by his employer, see 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1255, and (ii) his marriage to a United States citizen, see id. §\n\n1182(i)(1).   The petitioner argues that these two events qualify\n\nhim for a waiver of inadmissability and an adjustment of status\n\nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).       Discerning no\n\nabuse of discretion, we deny the petition for review.\n\n           The petitioner arrived in the United States in April of\n\n1995 armed with a tourist visa that apparently authorized him to\n\nremain for six months.   We say \"apparently\" because both the visa\n\nand the petitioner's passport had been issued in the name of one\n\nVincent Olanrewaju Adeyemi.   The petitioner initially lived with\n\nhis fiancée, Stella Olujoke, a non-citizen whom he had known in\n\nNigeria.   He did not leave after six months and, in March of 1996,\n\nhe jilted Olujoke and married a United States citizen.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      During the hearings before the immigration court, the\npetitioner testified that he could not remember the last name of\nhis former spouse. He referred to her throughout as \"April,\" and\nwe follow suit.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f                In July of 1997, the petitioner divorced April without\n\never having lived with her.             Nine days later, he married his once\n\nand    former      fiancée,   Olujoke,         who   then      amended    her    pending\n\napplication        for    asylum   and    related        relief    to    include        the\n\npetitioner.         The petitioner and Olujoke were interviewed by an\n\nasylum officer in May of 1999.                  That interview resulted in an\n\nunfavorable        recommendation        and     the     institution      of     removal\n\nproceedings.         The notice to appear was made returnable to the\n\nimmigration court in Boston.\n\n                At the start, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(INS) charged the petitioner with illegal entry into the United\n\nStates in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).2 Subsequently,\n\nthe    INS       lodged   additional      charges        of    inadmissability          and\n\ndeportability, under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), based on the use of\n\nfraudulent documents to gain entry into the United States.                              The\n\nsame sort of charges were lodged against Olujoke.                        While the two\n\ncases were consolidated for some period of time, that order was\n\nrescinded after the petitioner and Olujoke divorced.                            Olujoke's\n\ncase       is   pending   before   us    (Appeal       No.    04-1252)   and     will    be\n\naddressed in a separate opinion.                 In this opinion, we chronicle\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.

For simplicity's sake, we continue to refer to the INS\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fonly those facts and proceedings that relate directly to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n            To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the petitioner\n\nconceded removability and moved to amend his pleadings to permit an\n\napplication for adjustment of status based on the approval of an I-\n\n140 visa application filed on the petitioner's behalf by his\n\nemployer, the Providence School Department.             The approval of that\n\napplication resulted in his classification as a skilled worker and,\n\nthus, afforded a potential avenue to allow him to remain in the\n\nUnited States.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3)(A) (establishing a\n\nspecial    visa   category    for   skilled     workers     who      obtain   labor\n\ncertification).\n\n            In October of 2000, the IJ found that the petitioner's\n\nfraudulent use of documents to gain entry into the United States\n\ndebarred him from an adjustment of status, notwithstanding the\n\napproved   I-140   application.         The   IJ    further    found      that   the\n\npetitioner    lacked   credibility.           She   based     this      credibility\n\ndetermination on his demeanor, myriad inconsistencies in his trial\n\ntestimony, and questionable documentation submitted on his behalf\n\n(including    a    bogus     yearbook    photograph).             The    IJ   found\n\n\"particularly troubling\" the petitioner's inability to recall any\n\ndetails about his first marriage (including his wife's last name)\n\nand the fact that the petitioner and his first wife never lived\n\ntogether. Although the IJ declined to make a specific finding that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe union was entered into for the purpose of evading United States\n\nimmigration laws, see 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), she thought it probable\n\nthat the marriage was a sham (she termed it a \"green card\"\n\nmarriage).     She also deemed it \"curious\" that the petitioner's\n\nsecond marriage \"occurred a mere nine days after his divorce became\n\nfinal.\"\n\n             Based upon these and other findings, the IJ concluded\n\nthat the petitioner had not shown past persecution in Nigeria by\n\ncredible     testimony.    Consequently,   he   had   not   established\n\neligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT). Furthermore, the IJ declared\n\nthe petitioner ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(i) because he could not identify any qualifying\n\ncitizen relatives in the United States.          Accordingly, the IJ\n\npretermitted the application for adjustment of status, ordered the\n\npetitioner removed to Nigeria, and denied his request for voluntary\n\ndeparture.\n\n             The petitioner filed a timely appeal with the BIA and, a\n\nmonth later,      divorced Olujoke.     Three months thereafter, he\n\nmarried Sandra Hannah, a United States citizen.       He then filed a\n\nmotion to remand so that he might seek adjustment of status based\n\non the combination of (i) the approved I-140 visa application\n\nsubmitted by his employer and (ii) his marriage to a Untied States\n\ncitizen.     As part of his proffer, the petitioner asseverated that\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fdeportation to Nigeria would impose extreme hardship upon his new\n\nbride, who allegedly suffered from a kaleidoscopic array of medical\n\nand psychological disorders.\n\n          In   January   of    2004,   the   BIA   upheld   the   IJ's\n\ndeterminations and rejected the petitioner's merits appeal.         It\n\nsimultaneously denied his motion to remand. On that score, the BIA\n\nnoted that the petitioner had married his new wife \"a mere 7\n\nmonths\" after he was ordered removed by the IJ and explained that\n\nthe petitioner's \"lack of credibility at his hearing, his prior use\n\nof fraudulent documents, his previous marital history and the\n\ntiming of his current marriage\" argued persuasively against an\n\naffirmative exercise of its discretion to reopen the proceedings.\n\nThis petition for judicial review followed.\n\n          The petitioner seeks judicial review of the BIA's denial\n\nof his motion to remand — no more and no less.3    In that motion, he\n\nasked the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ in order to allow him\n\nto pursue an adjustment of status.     Neither the INA nor the BIA's\n\nrules of practice recognize motions to remand as such.            Here,\n\nhowever, the motion to remand was plainly in the nature of a motion\n\nto reopen the proceedings before the IJ (the IJ originally adjudged\n\nhim ineligible for relief in part because he lacked a qualifying\n\ncitizen relative; once he had married a United States citizen, he\n\n\n     3\n      Given the circumscribed nature of the relief requested, we\nneed not address the BIA's affirmance of the decision to deny\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fsought to present fresh evidence of his newfound eligibility for an\n\nadjustment of status).        The BIA, therefore, properly treated the\n\nmotion to remand as a motion to reopen.        See In re Coelho, 20 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).       So do we.\n\n           Motions to reopen are disfavored in immigration practice\n\nbecause of the compelling public interests in finality and the\n\nexpeditious processing of proceedings.

At a bare minimum, the\n\nmovant must make a showing of prima facie eligibility for the\n\nrelief that he seeks.       See, e.g., Afful v.

Even if he satisfies these threshold conditions, he is not\n\nhome   free;   he   still   must   persuade   the   BIA   to   exercise   its\n\ndiscretion affirmatively and order the case reopened.

This means that we will interfere with the BIA's\n\ndisposition of such a motion only if the petitioner can establish\n\nthat the BIA made an error of law or acted in a manner that is\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ffairly characterizable as arbitrary or capricious.

In conducting this deferential review, we must keep in\n\nmind   that     the   usual    reasons      for    ceding   deference    to   agency\n\ndecisionmaking on similar motions in other administrative contexts\n\nhave special force in the immigration context. See Abudu, 485 U.S.\n\nat 110.\n\n               We assume, for argument's sake, that the petitioner made\n\nthe required showing of prima facie eligibility for an adjustment\n\nof status.      His marriage to a United States citizen, if bona fide,\n\nrendered him presumptively eligible for such an adjustment.                    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(i) (authorizing a waiver of inadmissibility for fraud\n\nor willful misrepresentation if the Attorney General determines\n\nthat the alien's removal from the United States would result in\n\nextreme    hardship     to    the    alien's      citizen   spouse).      Moreover,\n\nevidence of such a union is material to the relief sought (i.e., it\n\nhas the potential to influence the outcome of the application for\n\nan adjustment of status) and, inasmuch as the nuptials occurred\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fafter the IJ's decision, that evidence was unavailable during the\n\noriginal hearings.\n\n              Given these assumptions, this case turns on the BIA's\n\nnegative      exercise   of   its   discretion.     We    discern    no    abuse.\n\nAlthough the BIA did not make a specific \"sham marriage\" finding,\n\nit made pellucid its grave doubts as to the suspicious timing of\n\nthe petitioner's marriage to Hannah and the genuineness of that\n\nmarriage.     It then cited, as aggravating factors, the petitioner's\n\npersistent use of fraudulent documents, his checkered marital\n\nhistory, and his overall lack of credibility.\n\n              We view these facts as relevant and the BIA's reliance on\n\nthem as reasonable.       The key is the adverse credibility finding —\n\na   finding    that   derives   ample    support   from   the   record.         The\n\npetitioner's      actions     showed    quite   clearly    that     he    had    no\n\ncompunctions about using bogus documentation (and, thus, about\n\ndissembling in an effort to evade the immigration laws).                        His\n\ncourse of conduct gave rise to a plausible inference — an inference\n\nthat the IJ chose to draw — that he viewed marriage less as a\n\nsacrament and more as a tool for ensuring continued residency in\n\nthe United States. And, finally, his demeanor on the witness stand\n\nand his evasiveness in the face of close questioning were, as the\n\nIJ noted, telling indicia of a lack of forthrightness. Perhaps the\n\nmost glaring examples are his convenient memory loss when queried\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fabout his first marriage and his attempts to \"coach\" Olujoke when\n\nshe testified in his behalf.\n\n              The short of it is that the adverse credibility finding\n\nwas   fully    supported.      That   finding     undermined       not   only   the\n\npetitioner's case in chief but also his motion to remand.                    There\n\nwas, therefore, a sound and wholly rational predicate for the BIA's\n\nnegative exercise of its discretion.            See Krazoun v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200741\"><a href=\"/opinion/200741/krazoun-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              In arguing for an opposite conclusion, the petitioner\n\nmakes two points that warrant brief rebuttal. First, he invites us\n\nto hold that this case is controlled by In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23\n\nI. & N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), in which the BIA granted a motion to\n\nreopen   proceedings       pending    adjudication     of     an     I-130      visa\n\napplication.      We decline the invitation because the two cases are\n\nnot fair congeners.        In Velarde-Pacheco, unlike in this case, the\n\npetitioner (whom the BIA deemed credible) had established the bona\n\nfides of his marriage to a United States citizen by clear and\n\nconvincing     evidence.      See    id.   at   256.   Even    then,      the   BIA\n\nemphasized that the grant of relief was entirely a matter of\n\ndiscretion.      Id.\n\n              Second, the petitioner claims that the BIA overlooked\n\nfactors that speak in favor of granting him relief.                These include\n\nhis record of steady employment, his lack of a criminal record, the\n\npositive impact he has had on Hannah's life, and his acquiescent\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fparticipation in immigration proceedings.             We readily agree that\n\nthese are mitigating factors, but it is sheer conjecture to say\n\nthat the BIA overlooked them. The petitioner's remonstrance, then,\n\nreduces to a claim that the BIA attached insufficient weight to\n\nthese mitigating factors.\n\n          We reject that claim. The BIA, in evaluating a motion to\n\nreopen, must consider the record as a whole.           Zhao v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nJustice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774878\"><a href=\"/opinion/774878/ke-zhen-zhao-v-united-states-department-of-justice-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (2d Cir. 2001).              Thus, its exercise of\n\ndiscretion typically will entail the weighing of multiple factors,\n\nnot all of which point in the same direction.              See Chen v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196819\"><a href=\"/opinion/196819/feng-chen-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 1996).      Here, the mitigating factors marshaled\n\nby the petitioner simply do not, either as a matter of law or as a\n\nmatter of logic, so overbalance the adverse factors emphasized by\n\nthe BIA as to require a finding of misused discretion.              See Henry,\n\n74 F.3d at 4 (stating that a finding of abuse of discretion, under\n\nsuch circumstances, requires a showing that the BIA made \"a clear\n\njudgmental    error    in   weighing    [competing     factors]\")   (emphasis\n\nsupplied).\n\n          We need go no further.              On this record, the BIA acted\n\nwell   within    the   realm   of   its       discretion   in   rejecting   the\n\npetitioner's motion to remand the proceedings.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f</pre>",
