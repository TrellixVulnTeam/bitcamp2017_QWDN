Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                   Torruella, Stahl and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter L. Koff, with whom Engel & Schultz, LLP was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Anton P. Giedt, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 8, 2009\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge. This appeal marks the last throes\n\nof an extended dispute between the Town of Winthrop and the Federal\n\nAviation Administration regarding a proposed expansion of Logan\n\nInternational Airport in Boston.      See Town of Winthrop v. Fed.\n\nAviation Admin., 535 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2008)(denying Town's petition\n\nfor review of agency's decision to authorize construction of\n\nadditional taxiway at Logan).   In the case sub judice, the Town\n\nchallenges the district court's determination that the FAA could\n\nwithhold certain documents in response to the Town's Freedom of\n\nInformation Act request.\n\n          The Town initially brought its FOIA suit in federal\n\ndistrict court hoping to obtain documents pertinent to its petition\n\nfor review against the FAA, which has now been concluded.1   In that\n\nvein, the Town sought expedited rulings so that it would be able to\n\nincorporate any information gleaned from its FOIA request into its\n\nopening brief in the petition for review then pending before this\n\ncourt.   As a result, the parties sought -- and the district court\n\nagreed to undertake -- an unusual procedure that yielded a prompt\n\nruling and the release of nine additional documents.   The Town now\n\nclaims that it did not agree to the expedited procedure employed in\n\nthe district court and that the district court's FOIA rulings were\n\nsubstantively incorrect.   We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n     In deciding the petition for review, we denied the Town's\nrequest to supplement the administrative record with the forty-six\ndocuments at issue in this appeal because they were the subject of\na \"separate proceeding,\" which eventually ripened into this appeal.\nTown of Winthrop, 535 F.3d at 15.\n\n                                -2-\n\f             This portion of the controversy began on August 2, 2007,\n\nwhen the Town submitted two FOIA requests, see 5 U.S.C. § 552,\n\nrequesting FAA records relating to the contemplated expansion of\n\nthe centerfield taxiway at Logan.        On October 4, 2007, the agency\n\nreleased approximately one hundred pages of records and claimed\n\nexemptions supporting non-disclosure for several other documents.\n\n5   U.S.C.   §552(b).    Without   taking   an   administrative   appeal,\n\nexhaustion of which some courts require prior to filing suit,2\n\ne.g., Ruotolo v. Dep't of Justice, Tax Div., 53 F.3d 4, 8 (2d Cir.\n\n1996); Taylor v. Appleton, 30 F.3d 1365, 1367-68 (11th Cir. 1994);\n\nSpannaus v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 824 F.2d 52, 58 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1987), the Town filed suit in the district court seeking all or a\n\nportion of the documents the agency withheld.        The district court\n\nheld an expedited status hearing and issued an order directing the\n\nFAA to produce a Vaughn index.3\n\n             The parties agreed that the agency would produce the\n\nVaughn index, but also that the Town would first exhaust its\n\n\n2\n     We have suggested without deciding that exhaustion, or at\nleast constructive exhaustion, of administrative remedies is\nrequired to initiate FOIA proceedings in this circuit.          See\nProvidence Journal Co. v. FBI, 602 F.2d 1010, 1011 (1st Cir. 1979).\nBecause, as explained below, the Town eventually exhausted its\nadministrative remedies, we need not decide whether any such\nexhaustion was required in this case.\n3\n     A practice has developed whereby any agency claiming an\nexemption under FOIA is required to furnish the requester a Vaughn\nindex, which requires a correlation of the information that an\nagency decides to withhold with the particular FOIA exemption and\nthe agency's justification for withholding the document. State of\nMaine v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 298 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2002)\n(citing Maynard v. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 556 (1st Cir. 1993)). The\nindex takes its name from Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir.\n1973).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fadministrative remedies before pressing its suit in the district\n\ncourt.       Consequently, the Town voluntarily dismissed its suit\n\nwithout prejudice and appealed administratively.                 In response, the\n\nagency       discretionarily       released      an    additional     thirty-seven\n\ndocuments      and    reaffirmed     its    decision    to   withhold   ninety-two\n\ndocuments.\n\n              Having exhausted its administrative remedies, the Town\n\nfiled    a   second    action   in    the    district    court   challenging   the\n\nagency's final decision to withhold the ninety-two documents.                   In\n\nparticular, the Town moved for another expedited status conference\n\nand further requested that the agency be instructed to arrive at\n\nthis conference with all of the withheld documents to facilitate\n\nthe district court's in camera inspection of the documents, should\n\nthe court agree to undertake such an inspection.                    In its request\n\nfor urgent relief, the Town stressed that it was seeking the\n\nwithheld documents because of their potential relevance to its\n\npetition for review of the agency's airport expansion decision then\n\npending in this court.          The Town further noted that its opening\n\nbrief in this court was due approximately two weeks from the date\n\nit filed this second action in the district court.\n\n              Against this backdrop, the parties convened for a status\n\nconference on December 12, 2007, approximately one week before the\n\nTown was required to file its opening brief in connection with the\n\npetition for review. Acknowledging the Town's desire for immediate\n\naccess to documents, as well as the Town’s objections to the\n\nagency's proffered Vaughn index, the district court suggested that\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe parties attempt to resolve their differences over as many\n\ndocuments as possible and to narrow the issues for the court to\n\ndecide.   The parties agreed to this course of action.\n\n           Over the course of several hours, the parties reviewed\n\nthe agency's Vaughn index, with the agency lawyer augmenting the\n\nindex by responding to questions from the Town's counsel, and with\n\nrespect to certain documents, providing additional information\n\nacquired by reference to a particular document itself.   At the end\n\nof this process, the agency agreed to release an additional thirty-\n\nseven documents.   As a result, only fifty-five documents remained\n\nin controversy.\n\n           The parties then returned to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings. The district court, though not required to do\n\nso, see NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 224\n\n(1978); Maynard, 986 F.2d at 557 (citing Church of Scientology v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of the Army, 611 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1979)), agreed\n\nto conduct an in camera review of the remaining documents.4   As a\n\nresult of this in camera review, the district court concluded that\n\nan additional nine documents were not exempt from disclosure and\n\nshould be released, but found the remaining documents all subject\n\nto the § 5 FOIA exemption, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), and therefore\n\n\n4\n     Discretionary in camera review enables the court to conduct a\nfirst-hand examination of the documents to determine whether the\ngovernment appropriately claimed an exception from disclosure with\nrespect to such documents. Maynard, 985 F.2d at 557. An in camera\nreview can provide the district court with an adequate factual\nbasis to determine whether the government has successfully carried\nits burden and proved that claimed exemptions apply to particular\ndocuments. Id. at 558 (citing Irons v. Bell, 596 F.2d 468, 471\n(1st Cir. 1979)).\n\n                                -5-\n\fconcluded that they were properly withheld.           The agency promptly\n\nproduced the nine documents that the district court found were not\n\nexempt from disclosure.\n\n            The   conditions   of   and   procedure   undertaken   in   the\n\ndistrict court's in camera review form the nub of the present\n\ncontroversy.      In view of the Town's desire to obtain as many\n\ndocuments as possible prior to filing its appellate brief in the\n\npetition for review proceedings, the district court decided to\n\nforego briefing on the scope of the § 5 FOIA exemptions claimed by\n\nthe agency and accepted the contested documents into evidence.           At\n\nthe time it did so, the court stated, \"I take it the parties have\n\nno objection to my offering this advice to you.         In other words, I\n\nam ruling on these documents as either being work product, you\n\nknow, privilege[d] or not privilege[d].\" (emphasis added). Moments\n\nlater, the court again confirmed that the parties had no objection\n\nto its \"making that ruling.\"\n\n            The government agreed that it had no objection, and other\n\nthan expressing concern about the adequacy of the agency's Vaughn\n\nindex, the Town also voiced no objection to the court’s proposed\n\napproach.      Although the Town did discuss nuances of the § 5\n\nexemptions from FOIA, in response to questions from the court the\n\nTown continued to maintain that it was primarily interested in an\n\nexpedited decision in the hope of acquiring additional documents\n\nfor use in connection with the petition for review.\n\n            With this background, we briefly review the well-known\n\nlegal standards and policy considerations underlying FOIA.              The\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fstatute was enacted to \"expose the operations of federal agencies\n\n'to the light of public scrutiny,'\"              Carpenter v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nJustice, 470 F.3d 434, 437 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Dep't of the\n\nAir Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 372 (1979)), and therefore the\n\nstatute   embodies      a   principle    of   broad   disclosure,      Church    of\n\nScientology, Int'l v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 30 F.3d 224, 228 (1st\n\nCir.   1994).         Consequently,     we    construe    the   nine    statutory\n\nexemptions from disclosure contained in FOIA narrowly, Dep't of\n\nInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n, 532 U.S. 1, 8\n\n(2001), with any doubts resolved in favor of disclosure, see\n\nCarpenter, 460 F.3d at 438 (citing U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Julian,\n\n468 U.S. 1, 8 (1988)); see also Trentadue v. Integrity Comm., 501\n\nF.3d 1215, 1226 (10th Cir. 2007).               Furthermore, the government\n\nbears the burden of proving that any withheld materials fall within\n\none of the statutorily enumerated exemptions to FOIA.                  Carpenter,\n\n470 F.3d at 438 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552; Orion Research, Inc. v.\n\nEPA, 615 F.2d 551, 553 (1st Cir. 1980)).\n\n           In this case, the agency relied on exemption 5, which\n\nexempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums\n\nor letters which would not be available by law to a party other\n\nthan an agency in litigation with the agency.\"                        5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(5); see also State of Maine, 298 F.3d at 66.                   The Supreme\n\nCourt has held that this exemption is coextensive with civil\n\ndiscovery privileges, including inter alia, the attorney-client\n\nprivilege,      the     attorney   work-product          privilege,     and     the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdeliberative process privilege.          See Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S.\n\nat 8; see also State of Maine, 298 F.3d at 66.\n\n           Normally, an agency seeking to claim an exemption from\n\nFOIA   prepares    a   Vaughn   index    and    supplements     the    index   with\n\naffidavit(s) and/or testimony that can be presented in camera or\n\nnot.   See Maynard, 986 F.2d at 556-58.            In addition, the district\n\ncourt has the option, but not the obligation, to review the\n\nunderlying documents in camera.           See supra note 4.           In short, by\n\nany road it chooses, the district court must, employing a de novo\n\nreview, find an adequate factual basis to support the agency's\n\nassertion of the exemption.        Maynard, 986 F.2d at 557 n.11.\n\n           Though perhaps unorthodox and expedited, the district\n\ncourt's disposition of this case was balanced and appropriate; any\n\ndeparture from normal procedures was undertaken with the consent of\n\nboth parties.      Similarly, any deficiency in the district court's\n\nanalysis was occasioned by the court's herculean efforts to provide\n\nthe Town with what it most desired: access to as many additional\n\ndocuments as possible in advance of the filing of its brief in the\n\npetition     for   review.       Basic        principles   of    fairness       and\n\nreasonableness counsel against permitting the Town, after having\n\nbenefitted    from     the   district    court's    expedited     rulings,5      to\n\ncomplain about the process it agreed to.\n\n\n\n5\n     At least partly as a result of the good offices of the\ndistrict court, it appears the agency released an additional\nthirty-seven documents to the Town at the status conference.\nMoreover, after its in camera review, the district court ordered\nthat an additional nine documents be released to the Town, and the\nagency provided those documents at the close of the hearing.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f           We therefore conclude that, on balance, by agreeing to\n\nexpedited procedures in the district court, the Town either has\n\nknowingly abandoned its right to complain about those procedures\n\n(as the government essentially argues), see United States v.\n\nGarrasteguy, 559 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing United States\n\nv. Walker (1st Cir. 2008)); accord Puleio v. Dist. Att'y for the E.\n\nDist.,   504   N.E.2d   354   (Mass.    1987),6   or,   at   a    minimum,   has\n\nforfeited any objection to them.\n\n           As the Town failed to lodge a timely objection to the\n\ndistrict court's procedure, our review is for plain error only.\n\nChestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en\n\nbanc).    Plain error will result in reversal only if the district\n\ncourt    committed   an   obvious      and   clear   error       that   affected\n\nsubstantial rights, and if left unremedied would call into question\n\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial\n\nproceedings.    Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. West\n\nLake Academy, 548 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Smith v. Kmart\n\nCorp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n           We discern no such deficiency in the district court's\n\ndisposition of this case.       As explained above, the district court\n\n\n\n6\n     In its brief, the Town contends that at the December 12 status\nconference, the district court merely agreed to give the parties\n\"advice\" about the applicability of any FOIA exemptions, and that\nthe district court would \"analyze the merits\" of the litigation at\nsome later date. Although this interpretation has some support in\nthe record, our reading of the record is that the district court\nbelieved that it was to rule on the availability of exemptions.\nMoreover, given the Town's repeated acquiescence in this procedure,\nit has abandoned, or at least forfeited, any objection as to the\noutcome of the procedure.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fis vested with the discretionary authority to review documents in\n\ncamera,   and   although   it   could   have   been   clearer   about   the\n\nconsequences of its in camera review, there is sufficient record\n\nsupport to conclude that the Town was aware of the district court's\n\nintentions, and that it acquiesced in the court's plan of action.\n\nFor example, as noted above, the Town did not object to the\n\ndistrict court's statement that it would make rulings as to whether\n\nthe withheld documents were privileged and therefore exempt from\n\ndisclosure.     Moreover, after the district court made its rulings,\n\nthe Town promised to notify the court by December 17, 2007 if it\n\nhad any objections to the court's closing the case.7        The fact that\n\nthe Town made this commitment reinforces the conclusion that the\n\nTown was aware that the district court had issued dispositive\n\nrulings that would stand, unless the Town affirmatively acted to\n\nreinvigorate the case.     In these circumstances, we cannot conclude\n\nthat upholding the district court's handling of these proceedings\n\n\n\n\n7\n     We also note that even if the Town had not agreed up front to\nthe expedited process that the district court fashioned to decide\nthis case, its later objection to this procedure was untimely.\nEven though it had agreed to inform the district court if it had\nany objections to the closure of the case by December 17, 2007, the\nTown did not file any such objection until December 26, 2007.\nBecause the district judge denied the Town's motion for\nreconsideration and the subsequent motion for a hearing on the\nmerits with margin orders, it is unclear whether the court gave any\neffect to the Town's tardiness. Had the district court done so,\nthis would have been an independently appropriate ground on which\nto deny the Town any relief.     Cf. Stonkus v. City of Brockton\nSchool Dep't., 322 F.3d 97, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding\ndistrict court's refusal to permit party to file untimely\nopposition to summary judgment and upholding grant of unopposed\nmotion for summary judgment).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fwould result in a miscarriage of justice or impugn the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of these proceedings.\n\n          We conclude by noting that although the Town must live\n\nwith the concessions that it made in return for an expedited\n\ndisposition   of   its   FOIA   action,   another   requestor   would   not\n\nnecessarily be bound by the Town's concessions.        We can envision a\n\nfuture requestor being entitled to fully litigate its FOIA claims.\n\nIn that regard, we note our initial assessment -- based on our\n\nlimited inspection -- that the Vaughn index submitted by the FAA\nappears overly scanty and insufficient to provide a factual basis\n\nfor sustaining the agency's claimed exemptions.         See Maynard, 986\n\nF.2d at 557 n.11.\n\n          For example, the agency claims that document number\n\neighty-six is subject to the attorney-client privilege.         The index\n\ndescribes the document as \"E-mail from Bettina Peronti, FAA to\n\nThomas Davidson, FAA et al re:       centerfield taxiway meeting with\n\nJohn Donnelly, FAA Legal Counsel.\"           The index entry includes\n\nneither a description of the length of the document, nor the\nidentities of all of its recipients.8      Moreover, it is unclear from\n\nthe e-mail whether either Ms. Peronti, the author of the document,\n\n8\n     The names of all recipients is necessary because that\ninformation may aid in determining whether the attorney-client\nprivilege has been waived as the result of disclosure of the\ncontents of any privileged communication to third parties. See\nUnited States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc.,\n874 F.2d 20, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1989).\n     Similarly, for documents to which the agency claims the\nattorney work-product privilege applies, it has not identified --\nin the Vaughn index or elsewhere -- \"the litigation for which the\ndocument was created,\" which is required in order for the privilege\nto attach. State of Maine, 298 F.3d at 69.\n\n                                   -11-\n\for Mr. Davidson, the only listed recipient of the document, is an\n\nattorney.\n\n            More concerning is the fact that this document does not\n\nappear   to   meet    the   standard   for   privileged   attorney-client\n\ncommunications.      The document is an email describing a meeting at\n\nwhich Massport proposed a number of mitigation measures with\n\nrespect to the centerfield taxiway, and it includes the reactions\n\nof various participants to the proposals.        Although John Donnelly,\n\nan agency attorney, was present in the meeting, the document does\nnot describe any of his views, and legal issues are barely -- if at\n\nall -- mentioned in the document.              We require more for the\n\nattorney-client privilege to attach.

In the case sub judice, the Town\n\nchallenges the district court's determination that the FAA could\n\nwithhold certain documents in response to the Town's Freedom of\n\nInformation Act request.\n\n          The Town initially brought its FOIA suit in federal\n\ndistrict court hoping to obtain documents pertinent to its petition\n\nfor review against the FAA, which has now been concluded.1   In that\n\nvein, the Town sought expedited rulings so that it would be able to\n\nincorporate any information gleaned from its FOIA request into its\n\nopening brief in the petition for review then pending before this\n\ncourt.   As a result, the parties sought -- and the district court\n\nagreed to undertake -- an unusual procedure that yielded a prompt\n\nruling and the release of nine additional documents.

In\n\nparticular, the Town moved for another expedited status conference\n\nand further requested that the agency be instructed to arrive at\n\nthis conference with all of the withheld documents to facilitate\n\nthe district court's in camera inspection of the documents, should\n\nthe court agree to undertake such an inspection.                    In its request\n\nfor urgent relief, the Town stressed that it was seeking the\n\nwithheld documents because of their potential relevance to its\n\npetition for review of the agency's airport expansion decision then\n\npending in this court.          The Town further noted that its opening\n\nbrief in this court was due approximately two weeks from the date\n\nit filed this second action in the district court.\n\n              Against this backdrop, the parties convened for a status\n\nconference on December 12, 2007, approximately one week before the\n\nTown was required to file its opening brief in connection with the\n\npetition for review. Acknowledging the Town's desire for immediate\n\naccess to documents, as well as the Town’s objections to the\n\nagency's proffered Vaughn index, the district court suggested that\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe parties attempt to resolve their differences over as many\n\ndocuments as possible and to narrow the issues for the court to\n\ndecide.

At the end\n\nof this process, the agency agreed to release an additional thirty-\n\nseven documents.   As a result, only fifty-five documents remained\n\nin controversy.\n\n           The parties then returned to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.

In view of the Town's desire to obtain as many\n\ndocuments as possible prior to filing its appellate brief in the\n\npetition for review proceedings, the district court decided to\n\nforego briefing on the scope of the § 5 FOIA exemptions claimed by\n\nthe agency and accepted the contested documents into evidence.           At\n\nthe time it did so, the court stated, \"I take it the parties have\n\nno objection to my offering this advice to you.         In other words, I\n\nam ruling on these documents as either being work product, you\n\nknow, privilege[d] or not privilege[d].\" (emphasis added). Moments\n\nlater, the court again confirmed that the parties had no objection\n\nto its \"making that ruling.\"\n\n            The government agreed that it had no objection, and other\n\nthan expressing concern about the adequacy of the agency's Vaughn\n\nindex, the Town also voiced no objection to the court’s proposed\n\napproach.      Although the Town did discuss nuances of the § 5\n\nexemptions from FOIA, in response to questions from the court the\n\nTown continued to maintain that it was primarily interested in an\n\nexpedited decision in the hope of acquiring additional documents\n\nfor use in connection with the petition for review.\n\n            With this background, we briefly review the well-known\n\nlegal standards and policy considerations underlying FOIA.

The Supreme\n\nCourt has held that this exemption is coextensive with civil\n\ndiscovery privileges, including inter alia, the attorney-client\n\nprivilege,      the     attorney   work-product          privilege,     and     the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdeliberative process privilege.          See Klamath Water Users, 532 U.S.\n\nat 8; see also State of Maine, 298 F.3d at 66.\n\n           Normally, an agency seeking to claim an exemption from\n\nFOIA   prepares    a   Vaughn   index    and    supplements     the    index   with\n\naffidavit(s) and/or testimony that can be presented in camera or\n\nnot.   See Maynard, 986 F.2d at 556-58.            In addition, the district\n\ncourt has the option, but not the obligation, to review the\n\nunderlying documents in camera.           See supra note 4.           In short, by\n\nany road it chooses, the district court must, employing a de novo\n\nreview, find an adequate factual basis to support the agency's\n\nassertion of the exemption.        Maynard, 986 F.2d at 557 n.11.\n\n           Though perhaps unorthodox and expedited, the district\n\ncourt's disposition of this case was balanced and appropriate; any\n\ndeparture from normal procedures was undertaken with the consent of\n\nboth parties.      Similarly, any deficiency in the district court's\n\nanalysis was occasioned by the court's herculean efforts to provide\n\nthe Town with what it most desired: access to as many additional\n\ndocuments as possible in advance of the filing of its brief in the\n\npetition     for   review.       Basic        principles   of    fairness       and\n\nreasonableness counsel against permitting the Town, after having\n\nbenefitted    from     the   district    court's    expedited     rulings,5      to\n\ncomplain about the process it agreed to.\n\n\n\n5\n     At least partly as a result of the good offices of the\ndistrict court, it appears the agency released an additional\nthirty-seven documents to the Town at the status conference.\nMoreover, after its in camera review, the district court ordered\nthat an additional nine documents be released to the Town, and the\nagency provided those documents at the close of the hearing.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f           We therefore conclude that, on balance, by agreeing to\n\nexpedited procedures in the district court, the Town either has\n\nknowingly abandoned its right to complain about those procedures\n\n(as the government essentially argues), see United States v.\n\nGarrasteguy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203712\"><a href=\"/opinion/203712/united-states-v-garrasteguy/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing United States\n\nv.

Although this interpretation has some support in\nthe record, our reading of the record is that the district court\nbelieved that it was to rule on the availability of exemptions.\nMoreover, given the Town's repeated acquiescence in this procedure,\nit has abandoned, or at least forfeited, any objection as to the\noutcome of the procedure.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fis vested with the discretionary authority to review documents in\n\ncamera,   and   although   it   could   have   been   clearer   about   the\n\nconsequences of its in camera review, there is sufficient record\n\nsupport to conclude that the Town was aware of the district court's\n\nintentions, and that it acquiesced in the court's plan of action.\n\nFor example, as noted above, the Town did not object to the\n\ndistrict court's statement that it would make rulings as to whether\n\nthe withheld documents were privileged and therefore exempt from\n\ndisclosure.     Moreover, after the district court made its rulings,\n\nthe Town promised to notify the court by December 17, 2007 if it\n\nhad any objections to the court's closing the case.7        The fact that\n\nthe Town made this commitment reinforces the conclusion that the\n\nTown was aware that the district court had issued dispositive\n\nrulings that would stand, unless the Town affirmatively acted to\n\nreinvigorate the case.     In these circumstances, we cannot conclude\n\nthat upholding the district court's handling of these proceedings\n\n\n\n\n7\n     We also note that even if the Town had not agreed up front to\nthe expedited process that the district court fashioned to decide\nthis case, its later objection to this procedure was untimely.\nEven though it had agreed to inform the district court if it had\nany objections to the closure of the case by December 17, 2007, the\nTown did not file any such objection until December 26, 2007.\nBecause the district judge denied the Town's motion for\nreconsideration and the subsequent motion for a hearing on the\nmerits with margin orders, it is unclear whether the court gave any\neffect to the Town's tardiness. Had the district court done so,\nthis would have been an independently appropriate ground on which\nto deny the Town any relief.     Cf. Stonkus v. City of Brockton\nSchool Dep't., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200433\"><a href=\"/opinion/200433/stonkus-v-city-of-brockton/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding\ndistrict court's refusal to permit party to file untimely\nopposition to summary judgment and upholding grant of unopposed\nmotion for summary judgment).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fwould result in a miscarriage of justice or impugn the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of these proceedings.\n\n          We conclude by noting that although the Town must live\n\nwith the concessions that it made in return for an expedited\n\ndisposition   of   its   FOIA   action,   another   requestor   would   not\n\nnecessarily be bound by the Town's concessions.        We can envision a\n\nfuture requestor being entitled to fully litigate its FOIA claims.\n\nIn that regard, we note our initial assessment -- based on our\n\nlimited inspection -- that the Vaughn index submitted by the FAA\nappears overly scanty and insufficient to provide a factual basis\n\nfor sustaining the agency's claimed exemptions.         See Maynard, 986\n\nF.2d at 557 n.11.\n\n          For example, the agency claims that document number\n\neighty-six is subject to the attorney-client privilege.         The index\n\ndescribes the document as \"E-mail from Bettina Peronti, FAA to\n\nThomas Davidson, FAA et al re:       centerfield taxiway meeting with\n\nJohn Donnelly, FAA Legal Counsel.\"           The index entry includes\n\nneither a description of the length of the document, nor the\nidentities of all of its recipients.8      Moreover, it is unclear from\n\nthe e-mail whether either Ms. Peronti, the author of the document,\n\n8\n     The names of all recipients is necessary because that\ninformation may aid in determining whether the attorney-client\nprivilege has been waived as the result of disclosure of the\ncontents of any privileged communication to third parties. See\nUnited States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522863\"><a href=\"/opinion/522863/25-socsecrepser-443-medicaremedicaid-gu-37849-28-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1989).\n     Similarly, for documents to which the agency claims the\nattorney work-product privilege applies, it has not identified --\nin the Vaughn index or elsewhere -- \"the litigation for which the\ndocument was created,\" which is required in order for the privilege\nto attach. State of Maine, 298 F.3d at 69.\n\n                                   -11-\n\for Mr. Davidson, the only listed recipient of the document, is an\n\nattorney.\n\n            More concerning is the fact that this document does not\n\nappear   to   meet    the   standard   for   privileged   attorney-client\n\ncommunications.      The document is an email describing a meeting at\n\nwhich Massport proposed a number of mitigation measures with\n\nrespect to the centerfield taxiway, and it includes the reactions\n\nof various participants to the proposals.        Although John Donnelly,\n\nan agency attorney, was present in the meeting, the document does\nnot describe any of his views, and legal issues are barely -- if at\n\nall -- mentioned in the document.              We require more for the\n\nattorney-client privilege to attach.         See State of Maine, 298 F.3d\n\nat 71 (party asserting privilege must show (1) that he was a\n\nclient; (2) that the attorney acted as a lawyer in connection with\n\nthe document; (3) that the document relates to facts communicated\n\nfor the purpose of a legal opinion; and (4) that the privilege has\n\nnot been waived).      Here, it is unclear whether Mr. Donnelly was\n\nacting as a lawyer, and it is even less clear that the purpose of\nthe meeting was to procure a legal opinion.\n\n            Thus, we have some unease with respect to the quality of\n\nthe agency's Vaughn index, and the merits of at least one of the\n\ndistrict court's rulings.9     It is possible that should an unrelated\n\nparty request similar documents, the outcome could be different.\n\n\n\n\n9\n     We have not exhaustively examined all of the documents, as\nsuch an examination is not necessary to our decision.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          Nevertheless, in the case at hand, the district court\n\nmade monumental efforts to accommodate the Town's emergency request\n\nfor access to documents, and in return, the Town conceded its right\n\nto a more deliberate and thorough determination of the issues.   In\n\nthese circumstances, it would be unfair to both the district court\n\nand the government, which complied with the district court's\n\ndecision and disclosed nine additional documents, to upend the\n\nbalance struck by the court and agreed to by the parties below.\n\nTherefore the decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f</pre>",
