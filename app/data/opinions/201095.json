George S. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Howard, Circuit Judge,\n          Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    Robert E. Mongue on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                         July 1, 2004\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.           At the earlier stage of our\n\nappellate consideration of this case, we concluded that neither we\n\nnor the district court had before us sufficient information about\n\nwhere Patrick V. would serve his detention time, and the nature of\n\nthe services such facility offered - facts which we thought were\n\nrelevant to the district court's disposition.          So we remanded the\n\ncase for completion of the record \"as to the location of the\n\nfacility of detention, its policies, programs and resources.\"\n\nUnited States v. Patrick V., 359 F.3d 3, 13 (1st Cir. 2004).             We\n\ngave both the court and the parties a difficult task.             It was to\n\nassess   \"not   the   current   care   and   custody   of   the   appellant,\n\nbut...the appropriateness of the detention facility as of the time\n\nof the initial disposition hearing.\"         Id. at 14.     In other words,\n\nafter a good look at the facility chosen by the Bureau of Prisons,\n\nwould the district court reaffirm or alter its disposition?\n\n     In a subsequent evidentiary hearing before the district court,\n\ngovernment witnesses included officials of the Cresson Secure\n\nTreatment Unit in Cresson, Pennsylvania (the detention facility in\n\nquestion), the director of Pennsylvania's Bureau of State Children\n\nand Youth Programs, and an executive of the federal Bureau of\n\nPrisons, Juvenile Services department.         Appellant's witnesses were\n\nhis mother and a psychiatrist, Dr. Keith Courtney.\n\n     The court, in an Amended Disposition Order, reported that the\n\nCresson Secure Treatment Unit was distanced by 550 miles from\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fPatrick's home and has a capacity of fifty-two residents, of whom\n\nonly   Patrick      and   one    other   were    presently   non-residents    of\n\nPennsylvania.       The average stay is 10.2 months.             The facility,\n\nstaffed by state certified faculty and following a curriculum\n\ncomplying with state standards, provides a basic education program\n\nthat consists in part of standard subjects such as mathematics,\n\nlanguage arts, and social studies, and selected other subjects such\n\nas Life Skills, Parenting, and Anger Management.               For students who\n\nhave    completed     the       high   school    curriculum,     College   Level\n\nExamination Program courses are offered, and students pursuing\n\nthese score in the eighty-fifth percentile. Mental health services\n\nof a psychologist and a psychiatrist are made available four hours\n\na week.   Family sessions take place in person or by telephone, the\n\naim being for one session a week.\n\n       Prior   to   the     court's    initial    disposition,    Dr.   Courtney\n\ninterviewed Patrick and, on his impression of Cresson's programs,\n\narrived at his conclusion that Cresson was not a good match with\n\nPatrick's needs. The shorter time span of its treatment cycle, its\n\nfocus on students with learning difficulties, and his disagreement\n\nwith several aspects of its programming, including family therapy\n\nand drug abuse prevention, were his reasons.             His testimony at the\n\nhearing on remand was necessarily limited to Patrick's needs as of\n\nthe date of the initial hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f     Dr.     Courtney   also     submitted        a    detailed,    thirty    page\n\n\"Psychiatric    Evaluation,\"      which     was       accepted   into    evidence,\n\ncontaining recommendations for more intensive drug counseling,\n\nassociation with \"positive peers,\" more attention to social skills,\n\nstrengthening    empathy,      more   intensive        family    \"face   to   face\"\n\ntherapy, and use of Multisystem Therapy and Family Focus Therapy.\n\nTwelve possible forms of mental disorders were briefly discussed.\n\n     This report obviously sought to prescribe the optimum, if not\n\nthe ideal, approach to dealing with Patrick's problems.                   It also\n\nwas based on recent interviews with Patrick and his parents, and a\n\nvisit to Cresson.       To the extent that it discerns any current\n\ninadequacy of the therapy and rehabilitation offered, it trenches\n\nfarther than the limited scope of the district court's legitimate\n\npower at this stage of proceedings - the obtaining of information\n\nrelevant to the court's determination of commitment and length of\n\ndetention.\n\n     Nevertheless, the report is significantly corroborated by the\n\naffidavit of a government witness, James C. Johns, Director of the\n\nPennsylvania Bureau of State Children and Youth Programs in the\n\nDepartment of Public Welfare. The Department, he averred, believed\n\nthat Patrick's placement at Cresson was \"not optimal to ensure his\n\neffective rehabilitation.\"        The typical shorter time span of its\n\nsystem and the distance from the juvenile's home, limiting parental\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\finvolvement, family counseling, strong judicial oversight, and\n\nregular case reviews were cited as reasons.\n\n     The court, while recognizing the criticisms levied, concluded\n\nthat the evidence did not indicate that the Cresson facility could\n\nnot provide the statutorily required \"adequate food, heat, light,\n\nsanitary facilities, bedding, clothing, recreation, counseling,\n\neducation,    training,       and    medical          care    including      necessary\n\npsychiatric, psychological, or other care and treatment.\"                       See 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 5039.      It noted that any educational program offered by a\n\ndetention facility would necessarily differ from opportunities at\n\na public or private high school.               And it recognized that distance\n\ndid make family therapy more difficult, but not insuperable with\n\ntelephone or video conferencing.\n\n     As a result of its review of the supplemented record, the\n\ncourt, noting the shorter stays typical at the Cresson facility,\n\nand trying to balance the need for rehabilitation with protection\n\nof the public, reduced the period of detention ordered from thirty\n\nto twenty-four months.          We see no abuse of discretion on this\n\nrecord.      We    think    that    this       kind   of     judgment   is    entirely\n\nappropriate       for   a   judge   in     a    juvenile      matter    under    these\n\ncircumstances.      We also echo the district court's awareness of the\n\nexclusive authority given the Attorney General in the placement of\n\njuveniles committed to his custody.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f    Perhaps of more importance is the court's recommendation that\n\n\"the remainder of Patrick's term of detention be served in an\n\ninstitution located closer to his home in Maine, if possible.\"\n\nWhat lends force to this recommendation is that on this record,\n\nthere is no dispute.   Not only Dr. Courtney but also Mr. Johns,\n\nspeaking for the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, have\n\nadvanced their reasons for a more appropriate placement.   And we\n\nnote that no opposing memorandum or comment has been submitted by\n\nthe government.   We lend our own hope to this recommendation.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
