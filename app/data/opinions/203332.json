José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 and Selya, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro-Lang, for appellant.\n     Ernesto López-Soltero, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate Division,\nand Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 13, 2008\n\f            TORRUELLA,     Circuit       Judge.           José   Skerret-Ortega\n\n(\"Skerret\")      was   indicted      along   with    six    co-defendants   for\n\nconspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute in excess of\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, fifty grams of\n\ncocaine base (crack), and a detectable amount of marijuana in\n\nviolation   of    21   U.S.C.   §§   841(a)(1)      and   (b)(1)(A).   Skerret\n\nattempted to enter a guilty plea twice; the district court rejected\n\nhis pleas, and a jury convicted him.              On appeal, Skerret argues\n\nthat the district court improperly rejected his guilty plea,\n\nimproperly admitted certain evidence, that the Government made\n\nimproper references during closing arguments, and that he had\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Skerret's attempted guilty\n\npleas and affirm the conviction.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            Between 1995 and 2002, Skerret was part of a group of\n\nindividuals who controlled a major drug operation out of the Los\n\nAlamos housing projects in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Their drug trade\n\nincluded cocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana. Each drug point in\n\nLos Alamos had an owner who, in turn, employed sellers.                     The\n\nGovernment presented evidence that Skerret operated a marijuana\n\ndrug point; rented a cocaine drug point from José Rivera Santiago;\n\nhelped process heroin for drug point owner Danny Camilla; and was\n\nan enforcer for drug point operators at the housing project between\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f1997 and 2003.     In addition to selling for others at different\n\npoints   during   those   years,   Skerret   sold   his   own   \"brand\"   of\n\nmarijuana called \"black dot.\"\n\n            Skerret sold about one kilogram of cocaine per month from\n\nhis rented drug point.      In 1998, Skerret also worked for another\n\ndrug point owner, and he processed \"green-bag\" heroin for him.\n\nSkerret owned a drug point from 1999 to 2003.             He also employed\n\nsellers and runners to help with his drug ring.\n\n            Skerret carried and used a .357 Magnum revolver and 9 mm\n\nLuger pistol that belonged to Camilla.       Skerret also had access to\n\nother    semi-automatic   weapons.     Videotapes    in   evidence   showed\n\nSkerret involved in the weapons and drug trade at Los Alamos on\n\nnumerous occasions. Rivera Santiago and Sujeilly Castellano Castro\n\n(a former resident of Los Alamos who regularly witnessed drug\n\ntransactions near her apartment) cooperated with the Government and\n\nprovided testimony about Skerret's involvement in drug trafficking\n\nat Los Alamos.    Skerret had lookout points for detecting police in\n\nthe area, used private channel walkie-talkie radios, and had\n\nmethods for getting rid of drugs quickly when the need arose.             A\n\nwatchman was on duty twenty-four hours a day at the entrance of the\n\nhousing project;    the watchman reported on every vehicle and the\n\nnumber of occupants as they entered Los Alamos.\n\n            Skerret was arrested, and on October 22, 2003, he was\n\nindicted, along with six other co-defendants, for violating 21\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) for possession with intent to\n\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more\n\nof crack, one kilogram or more of heroin, and a detectable amount\n\nof marijuana.         Skerret originally pleaded not guilty, and on\n\nAugust 15, 2004, he rejected a plea agreement.                  On September 12,\n\n2005,    both    before     and    after   the    jury   was   selected,      Skerret\n\nattempted to change his plea to guilty.               The district court, after\n\ncolloquies, rejected both requests.               The jury convicted Skerret on\n\nSeptember 14, 2005, and on December 14, 2005, the district court\n\nsentenced       him   to    360    months'      imprisonment    and    five    years'\n\nsupervised release.         He now appeals.\n\n                                   II.   Discussion\n\n            Skerret challenges the district court's rejection of his\n\nguilty    pleas,      the   admission      of    evidence,     and    some    of   the\n\nGovernment's statements during closing arguments.                    We do not find\n\nmerit in any of these claims and address them in turn below.                        He\n\nalso alleges that he suffered from ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.        Because     of    an   insufficiently    developed     evidentiary\n\nrecord, we will not review Skerret's ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim; the proper forum is a collateral proceeding under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.        See United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70,                74 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f             A.    Standard of Review\n\n             Skerret failed to object below to the district court's\n\ndenial of his change of plea requests, to the admission of certain\n\nevidence, and to impugned closing arguments. We, therefore, review\n\nhis    claims      for   plain     error.         See   United    States   v.\n\nGarcía-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2007). Review for\n\nplain error encompasses a well-known four-part test.                 We must\n\ndetermine whether (1) an error occurred (2) that was clear or\n\nobvious (3) which affected the defendant's substantial rights while\n\nalso (4) seriously impairing the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.           See United States v. Duval,\n\n496 F.3d 64, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             B.    Guilty Pleas\n\n             Skerret first attempted to enter a guilty plea before the\n\njury   was   empaneled;     he    attempted   a   second   time   immediately\n\nthereafter.       Both times, the district court rejected his requests.\n\nSkerret argues that these refusals resulted in a longer term of\n\nimprisonment than the sentence he would have received under a plea.\n\n             During Skerret's first attempted change of plea hearing,\n\nthe district court asked Skerret why he was pleading guilty.               He\n\nsaid, \"well, because I don't know.          I mean, the lawyer hasn't told\n\nme.\"   The district court then inquired whether Skerret felt forced\n\nto plead guilty; and he said: \"[Y]es.\"             Skerret's attorney then\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\faccepted the court's decision that the case had to go to trial.1\n\nSkerret's acknowledgment that he felt forced to plead guilty is\n\nreason enough for the district court to reject his plea; in fact,\n\nit is required.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(2).   District courts\n\nmust take steps to ensure that defendants are not coerced into\n\npleading guilty.\n\n           During Skerret's second attempt to enter a guilty plea,\n\nthe following colloquy took place:\n\n           THE COURT:   Well, what made you change your\n           view as to whether you were going to plead or\n           not?   Because this morning you seemed not\n           ready to plead.    And, all of a sudden, we\n           selected a jury and now you are ready to\n           plead.   Why the change in less than two or\n           three hours?\n\n           SKERRET:   Well, with all due respect, Your\n           Honor, I just want this not to be prolonged\n           any more and just to get it over with as soon\n           as possible.\n\n           THE COURT:   But prolong what?\n\n           SKERRET: Well, the process and that I am a\n           head of a household and I would like to be\n           given the opportunity to be with my children.\n\n           THE COURT: How do you know that is going to\n           be better that way?\n\n           SKERRET:   I don't know.\n\n           THE COURT:   Counsel, frankly, I don't know\n           what to tell you. I do think that the easy\n           way out would be to take his plea.    But it\n           seems to me, on the basis of my experience,\n           that this man is not the kind of person that\n\n\n1\n    The defendant is represented by different counsel on appeal.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              approaches a plea situation, a straight plea,\n              without a plea agreement with full knowledge\n              of consequences.   It seems to me - I don't\n              know what is in his mind, I don't know.     I\n              can't put a finger on it.\n\nThe   district    court    then    denied       Skerret's   request       to   enter   a\n\nstraight plea.        Skerret argues that the colloquy demonstrates that\n\nthe district court failed to articulate any sound reason for\n\nrejecting his plea attempt.\n\n              Skerret does not have an absolute right to plead guilty,\n\nand it was within the district court's discretion to reject his\n\npleas.       See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971)\n\n(citing Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 719 (1962) and Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11); In re Arvedon, 523 F.2d 914, 916 (1st Cir. 1975).\n\nThe district court must ensure that the defendant is provided with\n\ncertain      safeguards    intended       to     assure   that    his     rights    are\n\nrespected.       See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262.                 Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 11 requires the district court to address the\n\ndefendant personally to assure that, inter alia, he understands the\n\ncharge against him, the possible punishment, his right to an\n\nattorney, his right to plead not guilty, his right to a jury trial,\n\nand that his guilty plea, among other things, waives his right to\n\na   trial.      See    Fed.   R.   Crim     P.    11(b)(1);      United    States      v.\n\nVentura-Cruel, 356 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2003). The district court\n\nmust also ensure that the defendant's plea is voluntary and not the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fresult   of    \"force,   threats,   or   promises.\"     Fed.   R.   Crim.   P.\n\n11(b)(2); see also Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d at 59.\n\n              The district court is also required to ascertain whether\n\nthere is a factual basis for the defendant's guilty plea.            See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).        \"The purpose of this requirement is to\n\n'protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily\n\nwith an understanding of the nature of the charge but without\n\nrealizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the\n\ncharge.'\"      Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d at 59-60 (citation omitted).\n\nAccordingly, district courts must have \"a reasoned basis to believe\n\nthat the defendant actually committed the crime to which he is\n\nadmitting guilt.\" United States v. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)). Skerret denied any responsibility for the crimes\n\nfor which he was charged.        When the district court asked defense\n\ncounsel why the appellant had changed his mind a few hours after\n\nthe first attempt to plead guilty, counsel said that Skerret \"has\n\nalways denied participation\" in the charged crimes.             Skerret did\n\nnot   deny    his   attorney's   statement.     Because    Skerret    denied\n\nparticipation in the charged offenses, the district court would\n\nhave been unable to glean the relevant facts -- even by accepting\n\nthe prosecution's version of the evidence.            See United States v.\n\nGandía-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000). The district court\n\ndid not err when it refused to accept Skerret's plea.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          C.   Admission of Evidence and Statements During Trial\n\n                  1.   Documentary Evidence\n\n          Skerret argues that the Government presented documents\n\nthat should not have been allowed into evidence and were then\n\nimpermissibly used during closing arguments by the government. The\n\nfirst document was the indictment, and the second was Rivera\n\nSantiago's sealed motion requesting a downward departure pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.      Skerret did not object below to either\n\nsubmission, accordingly, we review for plain error.\n\n          The Government asserts that the indictment was introduced\n\ninto evidence, not as evidence against Skerret, but to offer some\n\nbackground on Rivera Santiago, whose cooperation in the case earned\n\nhim a reduced sentence.     We agree.   It is clear from the trial\n\nrecord that the Government's reference to the indictment, and the\n\nreason for presenting it to the jury, was to show the jury what\n\nRivera Santiago \"did and what he is answering for.\"       Since the\n\nindictment was not introduced into evidence to be considered\n\nagainst the defendant, subject to a proper instruction, giving the\n\nindictment to the jury for use during deliberations was well within\n\nthe trial court's discretion.   See United States v. McFarlane, 491\n\nF.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Medina, 761\n\nF.2d 12, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1985)).\n\n          The district court properly instructed the jury regarding\n\nthe indictment.   The district court told the jury:   \"You are going\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fto have a copy of the indictment for the simple reason that you\n\nhave to follow the written word of the charge to figure out whether\n\nit is something that helps you in conducting your deliberations[,]\n\nbut the indictment as such is not evidence of anything.\"   The very\n\nlast instruction the jury heard before deliberating was: \"You will\n\nget a copy of the indictment.   As I said before, it serves as the\n\nguideline, if you will, of what it is that the government charged\n\nwith the understanding that it is not evidence of guilt or anything\n\nelse.\"   The district court did not err.\n\n           Likewise, it was not plain error for the court to admit\n\nthe § 5K1.1 motion.   The purpose of the § 5K.1 motion was to show\n\nthe jury that Rivera Santiago had benefitted from cooperating with\n\nthe Government and that he had motivation to testify truthfully.\n\nThe motion also related to Skerret's main theory, which was that\n\nRivera Santiago was lying to obtain leniency.    We have held that\n\nunder these types of circumstances, may be appropriate to introduce\n\nthis kind of evidence.   See United States v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92,\n\n101-102 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 203 (2006) (\"'[A]\n\nprosecutor properly may admit a witness's plea agreement into\n\nevidence, discuss the details of the plea during closing arguments,\n\nand comment upon a witness's incentive to testify truthfully.'\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999)); see\n\nalso United States v. Page, 521 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir. 2008).   In\n\nthe absence of an objection, the district court cannot be faulted\n\n\n                                -10-\n\ffor admitting the indictment and the Government's § 5K1.1 motion\n\ninto   evidence.      The   Government    had   a    legitimate      reason    for\n\nadmitting the evidence, and Skerret's attempt to distort the\n\nGovernment's motive fails.2      There was no plain error.\n\n                     2.   Statements During Closing Arguments\n\n           Skerret    alleges   that     the    Government     made    improper\n\nstatements in its closing.      The Government stated:\n\n           And when you decide this matter as judges,\n           remember that you will live with the decision\n           of course.    You will live with the honest\n           decision that you put a criminal behind bars.\n           Not just left out in the street, another\n           criminal to continue selling drugs next to the\n           kids because you saw they sold regardless of\n           the kids, not even caring for any of those\n           kids, one of them was even giving money to a\n           little child to take God knows where. So when\n           you live with your conscience you will live\n           with your knowledge as judges of the fact you\n           did justice. . . .\n\nThe Government also stated:       \"[Castellano Castro] is an innocent\n\nvictim, living in one of our housing projects and having to endure\n\nthe trafficking by these individuals.\"\n\n           In the past, we have admonished the Government for making\n\nstatements \"'calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of\n\nthe jury,'\" United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d 12, 39 (1st\n\nCir.   2003)   (citation    omitted),     in    an   attempt    to    obtain    a\n\nconviction. See Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 527\n\n\n2\n  Since we hold that it was not plain error to admit the evidence,\nwe need not consider Skerret's claim that it was improper for the\nGovernment to refer to the evidence during closing arguments.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(1st Cir. 1993) (\"We think it is crystal clear that inflammatory\n\nlanguage of this ilk falls well outside the bounds of permissible\n\nargument.\").    We continue to believe that:\n\n            Cases are to be decided by a dispassionate\n            review of the evidence admitted in court.\n            There should be no suggestion that a jury has\n            a duty to decide one way or the other; such an\n            appeal is designed to stir passion and can\n            only distract a jury from its actual duty:\n            impartiality.\n\nUnited States v.

José   Skerret-Ortega\n\n(\"Skerret\")      was   indicted      along   with    six    co-defendants   for\n\nconspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute in excess of\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, fifty grams of\n\ncocaine base (crack), and a detectable amount of marijuana in\n\nviolation   of    21   U.S.C.   §§   841(a)(1)      and   (b)(1)(A).   Skerret\n\nattempted to enter a guilty plea twice; the district court rejected\n\nhis pleas, and a jury convicted him.              On appeal, Skerret argues\n\nthat the district court improperly rejected his guilty plea,\n\nimproperly admitted certain evidence, that the Government made\n\nimproper references during closing arguments, and that he had\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Skerret's attempted guilty\n\npleas and affirm the conviction.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n            Between 1995 and 2002, Skerret was part of a group of\n\nindividuals who controlled a major drug operation out of the Los\n\nAlamos housing projects in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Their drug trade\n\nincluded cocaine, crack, heroin, and marijuana. Each drug point in\n\nLos Alamos had an owner who, in turn, employed sellers.                     The\n\nGovernment presented evidence that Skerret operated a marijuana\n\ndrug point; rented a cocaine drug point from José Rivera Santiago;\n\nhelped process heroin for drug point owner Danny Camilla; and was\n\nan enforcer for drug point operators at the housing project between\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f1997 and 2003.     In addition to selling for others at different\n\npoints   during   those   years,   Skerret   sold   his   own   \"brand\"   of\n\nmarijuana called \"black dot.\"\n\n            Skerret sold about one kilogram of cocaine per month from\n\nhis rented drug point.      In 1998, Skerret also worked for another\n\ndrug point owner, and he processed \"green-bag\" heroin for him.\n\nSkerret owned a drug point from 1999 to 2003.             He also employed\n\nsellers and runners to help with his drug ring.\n\n            Skerret carried and used a .357 Magnum revolver and 9 mm\n\nLuger pistol that belonged to Camilla.       Skerret also had access to\n\nother    semi-automatic   weapons.     Videotapes    in   evidence   showed\n\nSkerret involved in the weapons and drug trade at Los Alamos on\n\nnumerous occasions. Rivera Santiago and Sujeilly Castellano Castro\n\n(a former resident of Los Alamos who regularly witnessed drug\n\ntransactions near her apartment) cooperated with the Government and\n\nprovided testimony about Skerret's involvement in drug trafficking\n\nat Los Alamos.    Skerret had lookout points for detecting police in\n\nthe area, used private channel walkie-talkie radios, and had\n\nmethods for getting rid of drugs quickly when the need arose.             A\n\nwatchman was on duty twenty-four hours a day at the entrance of the\n\nhousing project;    the watchman reported on every vehicle and the\n\nnumber of occupants as they entered Los Alamos.\n\n            Skerret was arrested, and on October 22, 2003, he was\n\nindicted, along with six other co-defendants, for violating 21\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) for possession with intent to\n\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more\n\nof crack, one kilogram or more of heroin, and a detectable amount\n\nof marijuana.         Skerret originally pleaded not guilty, and on\n\nAugust 15, 2004, he rejected a plea agreement.                  On September 12,\n\n2005,    both    before     and    after   the    jury   was   selected,      Skerret\n\nattempted to change his plea to guilty.               The district court, after\n\ncolloquies, rejected both requests.               The jury convicted Skerret on\n\nSeptember 14, 2005, and on December 14, 2005, the district court\n\nsentenced       him   to    360    months'      imprisonment    and    five    years'\n\nsupervised release.         He now appeals.\n\n                                   II.   Discussion\n\n            Skerret challenges the district court's rejection of his\n\nguilty    pleas,      the   admission      of    evidence,     and    some    of   the\n\nGovernment's statements during closing arguments.                    We do not find\n\nmerit in any of these claims and address them in turn below.                        He\n\nalso alleges that he suffered from ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.        Because     of    an   insufficiently    developed     evidentiary\n\nrecord, we will not review Skerret's ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim; the proper forum is a collateral proceeding under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.

See United States v. Duval,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202877\"><a href=\"/opinion/202877/united-states-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             B.    Guilty Pleas\n\n             Skerret first attempted to enter a guilty plea before the\n\njury   was   empaneled;     he    attempted   a   second   time   immediately\n\nthereafter.       Both times, the district court rejected his requests.\n\nSkerret argues that these refusals resulted in a longer term of\n\nimprisonment than the sentence he would have received under a plea.\n\n             During Skerret's first attempted change of plea hearing,\n\nthe district court asked Skerret why he was pleading guilty.               He\n\nsaid, \"well, because I don't know.          I mean, the lawyer hasn't told\n\nme.\"   The district court then inquired whether Skerret felt forced\n\nto plead guilty; and he said: \"[Y]es.\"             Skerret's attorney then\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\faccepted the court's decision that the case had to go to trial.1\n\nSkerret's acknowledgment that he felt forced to plead guilty is\n\nreason enough for the district court to reject his plea; in fact,\n\nit is required.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(2).   District courts\n\nmust take steps to ensure that defendants are not coerced into\n\npleading guilty.\n\n           During Skerret's second attempt to enter a guilty plea,\n\nthe following colloquy took place:\n\n           THE COURT:   Well, what made you change your\n           view as to whether you were going to plead or\n           not?   Because this morning you seemed not\n           ready to plead.    And, all of a sudden, we\n           selected a jury and now you are ready to\n           plead.   Why the change in less than two or\n           three hours?\n\n           SKERRET:   Well, with all due respect, Your\n           Honor, I just want this not to be prolonged\n           any more and just to get it over with as soon\n           as possible.\n\n           THE COURT:   But prolong what?\n\n           SKERRET: Well, the process and that I am a\n           head of a household and I would like to be\n           given the opportunity to be with my children.\n\n           THE COURT: How do you know that is going to\n           be better that way?\n\n           SKERRET:   I don't know.\n\n           THE COURT:   Counsel, frankly, I don't know\n           what to tell you. I do think that the easy\n           way out would be to take his plea.    But it\n           seems to me, on the basis of my experience,\n           that this man is not the kind of person that\n\n\n1\n    The defendant is represented by different counsel on appeal.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              approaches a plea situation, a straight plea,\n              without a plea agreement with full knowledge\n              of consequences.   It seems to me - I don't\n              know what is in his mind, I don't know.     I\n              can't put a finger on it.\n\nThe   district    court    then    denied       Skerret's   request       to   enter   a\n\nstraight plea.        Skerret argues that the colloquy demonstrates that\n\nthe district court failed to articulate any sound reason for\n\nrejecting his plea attempt.\n\n              Skerret does not have an absolute right to plead guilty,\n\nand it was within the district court's discretion to reject his\n\npleas.

See Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262.                 Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 11 requires the district court to address the\n\ndefendant personally to assure that, inter alia, he understands the\n\ncharge against him, the possible punishment, his right to an\n\nattorney, his right to plead not guilty, his right to a jury trial,\n\nand that his guilty plea, among other things, waives his right to\n\na   trial.

See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).        \"The purpose of this requirement is to\n\n'protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily\n\nwith an understanding of the nature of the charge but without\n\nrealizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the\n\ncharge.'\"      Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d at 59-60 (citation omitted).\n\nAccordingly, district courts must have \"a reasoned basis to believe\n\nthat the defendant actually committed the crime to which he is\n\nadmitting guilt.\" United States v.

Skerret denied any responsibility for the crimes\n\nfor which he was charged.        When the district court asked defense\n\ncounsel why the appellant had changed his mind a few hours after\n\nthe first attempt to plead guilty, counsel said that Skerret \"has\n\nalways denied participation\" in the charged crimes.             Skerret did\n\nnot   deny    his   attorney's   statement.     Because    Skerret    denied\n\nparticipation in the charged offenses, the district court would\n\nhave been unable to glean the relevant facts -- even by accepting\n\nthe prosecution's version of the evidence.

Admission of Evidence and Statements During Trial\n\n                  1.   Documentary Evidence\n\n          Skerret argues that the Government presented documents\n\nthat should not have been allowed into evidence and were then\n\nimpermissibly used during closing arguments by the government. The\n\nfirst document was the indictment, and the second was Rivera\n\nSantiago's sealed motion requesting a downward departure pursuant\n\nto U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.      Skerret did not object below to either\n\nsubmission, accordingly, we review for plain error.\n\n          The Government asserts that the indictment was introduced\n\ninto evidence, not as evidence against Skerret, but to offer some\n\nbackground on Rivera Santiago, whose cooperation in the case earned\n\nhim a reduced sentence.     We agree.   It is clear from the trial\n\nrecord that the Government's reference to the indictment, and the\n\nreason for presenting it to the jury, was to show the jury what\n\nRivera Santiago \"did and what he is answering for.\"       Since the\n\nindictment was not introduced into evidence to be considered\n\nagainst the defendant, subject to a proper instruction, giving the\n\nindictment to the jury for use during deliberations was well within\n\nthe trial court's discretion.   See United States v. McFarlane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202838\"><a href=\"/opinion/202838/united-states-v-mcfarlane/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v.

The district court told the jury:   \"You are going\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fto have a copy of the indictment for the simple reason that you\n\nhave to follow the written word of the charge to figure out whether\n\nit is something that helps you in conducting your deliberations[,]\n\nbut the indictment as such is not evidence of anything.\"   The very\n\nlast instruction the jury heard before deliberating was: \"You will\n\nget a copy of the indictment.   As I said before, it serves as the\n\nguideline, if you will, of what it is that the government charged\n\nwith the understanding that it is not evidence of guilt or anything\n\nelse.\"   The district court did not err.\n\n           Likewise, it was not plain error for the court to admit\n\nthe § 5K1.1 motion.   The purpose of the § 5K.1 motion was to show\n\nthe jury that Rivera Santiago had benefitted from cooperating with\n\nthe Government and that he had motivation to testify truthfully.\n\nThe motion also related to Skerret's main theory, which was that\n\nRivera Santiago was lying to obtain leniency.

The   Government    had   a    legitimate      reason    for\n\nadmitting the evidence, and Skerret's attempt to distort the\n\nGovernment's motive fails.2      There was no plain error.\n\n                     2.   Statements During Closing Arguments\n\n           Skerret    alleges   that     the    Government     made    improper\n\nstatements in its closing.      The Government stated:\n\n           And when you decide this matter as judges,\n           remember that you will live with the decision\n           of course.    You will live with the honest\n           decision that you put a criminal behind bars.\n           Not just left out in the street, another\n           criminal to continue selling drugs next to the\n           kids because you saw they sold regardless of\n           the kids, not even caring for any of those\n           kids, one of them was even giving money to a\n           little child to take God knows where.
