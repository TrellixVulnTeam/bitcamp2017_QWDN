Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Joseph C.

García, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 22, 2006\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Appellant Ramon Antonio Simo-López\n\npled guilty to charges of unlawful reentry into the United States\n\nafter removal and unlawful use of false identification.                  See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326, 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7).           The district court imposed\n\na forty-one-month term of imprisonment, which included a sixteen-\n\nlevel enhancement under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on\n\nits   finding   that     appellant’s    prior   conviction   for    aggravated\n\nbattery constituted a felony.          Appellant claims that, under Puerto\n\nRico law, the battery conviction was a misdemeanor, not a felony,\n\nand that he is entitled to re-sentencing.           We agree and therefore\n\nremand.\n\n                                        I.\n\nA. Factual Background1\n\n           Appellant, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, first\n\nentered the United States unlawfully in March 1989.                On December\n\n31, 1989, he was charged in Puerto Rico Superior Court with felony\n\naggravated battery, a violation of Article 95 of the Puerto Rico\n\nPenal Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, § 4032 (1983).           Appellant later\n\nentered   a     guilty    plea   and     was    sentenced    to    six   months\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      We draw the facts from the government’s proffer at\nappellant’s change of plea hearing and from two Pre-Sentence\nReports (“PSR”), one prepared in this case and one prepared in\nconnection with an earlier reentry charge.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fimprisonment.2    On May 24, 1990, he was removed to the Dominican\n\nRepublic.   He reentered the United States in September 1996, again\n\nin Puerto Rico, and in July 1999 pled guilty to a felony charge of\n\nunlawful reentry.     He was sentenced to seven months imprisonment\n\nand again removed from the United States.\n\n            The incident underlying this case occurred on April 9,\n\n2005.    During   a   pre-flight   inspection   at    the    Luis   M.    Marín\n\nInternational Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, appellant was\n\ndetained and found to be using a counterfeit Puerto Rican driver’s\n\nlicense bearing a name other than his own.            He subsequently was\n\ncharged in a two-count indictment with unlawful presence in the\n\nUnited States after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a)\n\nand (b)(1),3 and with the knowing and unauthorized use of another\n\n\n     2\n       The 2005 PSR reported that appellant also pled guilty to a\nweapons law violation stemming from the same incident, for which he\nreceived a concurrent six-month term of imprisonment.          That\nconviction is not at issue in this case.\n\n     3\n      Section 1326(a) provides, in relevant part, that “any alien\nwho – (1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed\n. . . , and thereafter (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any\ntime found in, the United States,” without having obtained\npermission to reenter shall be subject to a fine or up to two years\nimprisonment, or both.\n\n     Section (b)(1) provides       that,   in   the   case    of    any   alien\ndescribed in subsection (a):\n\n     (1) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for\n     commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs,\n     crimes against the person, or both, or a felony (other\n     than an aggravated felony), such alien shall be fined\n     under Title 18, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or\n     both[.]\n\n                                   -3-\n\fperson’s identification to facilitate his unlawful reentry, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7).             He pled guilty to both\n\ncounts.\n\n           Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of\n\nan unlawful reentry crime is subject to a sixteen-level increase in\n\nhis offense level if he previously was deported after “a conviction\n\nfor a felony that is . . . a crime of violence.”                     U.S.S.G. §\n\n2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The applicable Guidelines definition of felony\n\nis “any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor a term exceeding one year.”        U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2 cmt. n.2.         There\n\nis no dispute that the felony crime of aggravated battery, with\n\nwhich appellant was charged in 1989, would trigger the enhancement;\n\nthe question is whether appellant was convicted of that crime.4\n\n           Puerto Rico’s Article 95 divides aggravated battery into\n\ndiscrete misdemeanor and felony crimes, which cover different types\n\nof specified conduct.        See infra pp. 10-11.       The complaint filed\n\nagainst appellant framed the charge as a felony. Felony aggravated\n\nbattery is “punishable by imprisonment for a fixed term of 3\n\nyears”;   that    sentence    could   be    increased   to    five    years   if\n\naggravating      factors   existed    and   decreased    to   two     years   if\n\n“attenuating circumstances are present.”          P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33,\n\n§ 4032 (1983).      Aggravated battery otherwise is punishable by a\n\n\n     4\n       Appellant does not dispute that his conviction for aggravated\nbattery qualifies as a “crime of violence.” See U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2\ncmt. n.1(B)(iii) (crime of violence includes “aggravated assault”).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fterm “not exceeding six months,” and is thus a misdemeanor under\n\nPuerto Rico law.5\n\n             At the sentencing hearing, both defense counsel and the\n\nAssistant United States Attorney agreed that appellant’s aggravated\n\nbattery conviction should be considered a misdemeanor based on the\n\nsix-month     sentence   that   was     imposed.6   The   misdemeanor\n\nclassification would have resulted in only a four-level enhancement\n\nand a sentencing range of eight to fourteen months, compared to a\n\nrange of forty-one to fifty-one months with the sixteen-level\n\n\n     5\n      Our references throughout are to the statute as it existed at\nthe time of appellant’s conviction, although subsequent amendments\nhave not changed the provision in ways that would affect our\nanalysis. The statute continues to have separate sections for the\nfelony and misdemeanor crimes, with each section listing various\nfactual circumstances in which it applies.      As in the earlier\nversion, the current statute states explicitly that aggravated\nbattery is a felony when it occurs in the specified circumstances.\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, § 4032(2)(2003). The statute’s first\nsection, currently designated subsection (1), is not expressly\nlabeled as a misdemeanor provision; it is the prescribed penalty\nthat triggers the misdemeanor classification. Puerto Rico’s Penal\nCode defines a misdemeanor as\n\n     a crime punishable by detention for a term that does not\n     exceed six months or by a fine that does not exceed five\n     thousand (5,000) dollars, or both penalties at the\n     discretion of the court. A felony comprises all other\n     crimes.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, § 3044 (1999). Section 3044 was added to\nthe Penal Code in 1974 and its later revisions did not materially\nchange its substance.\n         6\n      The government explicitly relied on the PSR prepared in\nconnection with appellant’s 1999 unlawful reentry conviction. That\nearlier PSR considered the aggravated battery a misdemeanor. The\nPSR prepared in connection with the instant offenses treated the\nconviction as a felony.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fenhancement.       The alternative four-level increase in offense level\n\nwould not be based on the misdemeanor conviction, but would result\n\nfrom appellant's prior reentry conviction.          The Guidelines impose\n\na four-level enhancement for a prior felony conviction that has no\n\nspecial   characteristics     –   such   as   “aggravated”   or    “crime    of\n\nviolence” status – that would trigger a harsher penalty.                    See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(D).\n\n             Although the district court had before it the complaint\n\nthat   led    to    appellant’s   1990   conviction,   it    had   no   other\n\ninformation about the crime because the file could not be located.\n\nRelying on the language in the complaint, the court concluded that\n\nappellant had been convicted of a felony within the meaning of the\n\nGuidelines:\n\n             [T]he prior felony conviction is a state\n             conviction for an offence [sic] punishable by\n             [im]prisonment for a term exceeding one year,\n             regardless   of   whether  such   offense   is\n             specifically designated as a felony and\n             regardless of the actual sentence imposed,\n             which means that regardless of having been\n             sentenced to six months, and the Court there –\n             I don’t know whatever the judge did and\n             sentenced him to six months, but according to\n             what he was charged with, he was charged with\n             a felony that carried a term of imprisonment\n             of more than one year, carried a fixed term of\n             three years.\n\n                    If afterwards he plea bargained and the\n             case was reduced to a misdemeanor, that is\n             something else.    But for purposes of the\n             guidelines that we are applying, a prior\n             felony conviction means a state conviction\n             punishable   by  imprisonment   for   a   term\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f               exceeding one year regardless of the actual\n               sentence imposed.\n\nThe court therefore applied the sixteen-level enhancement and\n\nimposed the forty-one-month sentence.\n\nB. Legal Principles\n\n               The body of law surrounding the proper classification of\n\nstate crimes for purposes of federal sentencing is both complex and\n\ngrowing, see, e.g., Lopez v. Gonzales, 2006 WL 3487031 (U.S. Dec.\n\n5, 2006) (No. 05-547), and this is not the first time that we have\n\nconfronted a defendant’s attempt to link the short length of his\n\nsentence to the crime’s status under the Sentencing Guidelines. In\n\nUnited    States    v.   Santiago,    83   F.3d    20    (1st   Cir.      1996),   the\n\nappellant claimed that his two prior convictions for assault and\n\nbattery did not satisfy the career offender requirement that they\n\nbe “punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year”\n\nbecause he received six-month sentences on each occasion.                     Id. at\n\n26-27 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(1)).              We noted, however, that the\n\noffenses were punishable at the time they occurred by imprisonment\n\nof   up   to    two-and-one-half     years,   and       we   made   the    following\n\nobservation: \"The guideline . . . does not speak in terms of a\n\njudicial judgment (the length of the sentence meted out), but,\n\nrather, in terms of a legislative judgment (the maximum punishment\n\napplicable to the offense).          Id. at 27 (emphasis in original).              We\n\nthus held the crimes qualified as predicate convictions for career\n\noffender status.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           Other case law in our circuit and elsewhere confirms that\n\nit is the statutory maximum for a particular crime, and not the\n\nspecific sentence imposed, that determines the crime’s status,\n\nincluding its classification as a felony under § 2L1.2. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Caicedo-Cuero, 312 F.3d 697, 704-06 (5th Cir.\n\n2002) (rejecting defendant’s contention that mandatory suspended\n\nsentence   for   first-time      offender    removed   prior    crime   from\n\nclassification as “felony” under § 2L1.2 where statute provided for\n\nmaximum two-year term of imprisonment); United States v. Robles-\n\nRodriguez, 281 F.3d 900, 903-06 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting felony\n\nclassification under § 2L1.2 where maximum authorized punishment\n\nwas probation); United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 615 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (rejecting claim that district court erroneously treated\n\ncrimes as felonies where defendants were sentenced to six years\n\n“but actually served less than ‘one year and one month’”).\n\n           The   issue   here,    however,    is   materially    different.\n\nAppellant does not seek to classify a crime based solely on the\n\nsentence imposed, but invokes the sentence as decisive proof that\n\nhe was convicted of a misdemeanor.        Framed in the language we used\n\nin Santiago, the issue is whether appellant’s six-month term was\n\nthe product of a judicial judgment as to the appropriate sentence\n\nfor the felony with which he was charged, or a legislative judgment\n\nas to the appropriate penalty for a lesser crime.        Put another way,\n\nwas appellant convicted and sentenced for the misdemeanor crime of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\faggravated battery – for which the legislature fixed a maximum six-\n\nmonth prison term – or was he sentenced leniently for the felony\n\ncrime of aggravated battery?         If the former, the conviction would\n\nnot qualify as a felony crime of violence under § 2L1.2.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             We   typically    review    de    novo       the   district      court’s\n\ndetermination     of   the   legal   meaning       of   guidelines     provisions.\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Sanchez-Mota, 319 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam)\n\n(interpreting § 2L1.2).       A court’s factual findings on sentencing\n\nare reviewed only for clear error.            Robinson, 433 F.3d at 38.           The\n\nquestion we face here is legal, requiring us to consider both the\n\nnature of Puerto Rico’s aggravated battery statute and the legal\n\nsignificance owed to appellant’s plea and sentencing under the\n\nprovision.    Accordingly, we apply de novo review.\n\n            Appellant    concedes     that    he    was    charged     with    felony\n\naggravated battery, but he argues that the only conclusion that can\n\nbe drawn from his six-month sentence is that he was convicted of\n\nthe less serious crime of misdemeanor aggravated battery.                     This is\n\nso,   he   maintains,   because      Puerto    Rico     was     a   fixed   sentence\n\njurisdiction at the time of his conviction, and the judge who\n\nsentenced him was therefore obligated to follow the fixed term\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprescribed by statute.7              If he were convicted of a felony, that\n\nterm would have been between two and five years, with a three-year\n\nterm being the standard.             He argues that, because he was sentenced\n\nto six months’ incarceration, he must have been convicted of\n\nmisdemeanor aggravated battery.\n\n                  We find this reasoning persuasive.              Under Article 95,\n\neach       form    of   aggravated    battery    has     its   own   set     of   factual\n\ncriteria. At the time of appellant’s crime, aggravated battery was\n\nclassified as a misdemeanor when committed under one (or more) of\n\nseven specifically designated circumstances, including “[w]hen\n\ncommitted with the intent to inflict serious bodily injury.”                        P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 33, § 4032(e) (1983).8                     Aggravated battery was\n\nconsidered          a   felony,   however,       under    three      other    specified\n\ninstances, including “[w]hen serious bodily injury is inflicted on\n\n       7\n      Act No. 100, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 1044,\nstates:\n\n       The fixed sentence system is hereby established in Puerto\n       Rico. When the court orders a sentence of imprisonment,\n       it shall hand down a fixed sentence with a specific term\n       of duration. In felony cases a fixed term established by\n       law shall be imposed for the crime committed. Should\n       there be extenuating or aggravating circumstances, the\n       court must increase or decrease the established fixed\n       sentence within the limits established by law for the\n       crime.   In these cases the prison term to be imposed\n       shall also be fixed.\n\nThe “fixed sentence system” was enacted into law in 1980.\n       8\n      The current version of section 4032 lists six instances of\nmisdemeanor aggravated battery, including the one noted in the\ntext.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fthe person assaulted,” id. at § 4032(b) (second part), and when it\n\nwas   “committed   with   deadly   weapons   under   circumstances   not\n\namounting to an intent to kill or maim,” id. at § 4032(c) (second\n\npart).9\n\n            The district court had no information before it other\n\nthan that appellant had been charged with the felony version of\n\naggravated battery – and that he received a six-month sentence.\n\nTranslating from Spanish, the court quoted the complaint filed\n\nagainst appellant, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n            [D]efendant . . . illegally, voluntarily,\n            maliciously, and with criminal intention, did\n            use force or violence against a human being .\n            . . with the purpose of causing him harm,\n            committing said crime with deadly weapons\n            under circumstances that do not amount to an\n            intent to kill or to maim.10\n\nUnquestionably, the language in the complaint tracks the language\n\nin subsection (c) of the felony portion of Article 95 referring to\n\nthe use of deadly weapons.         The court concluded that it should\n\nrely on that language, rather than on the sentence, to classify the\n\ncrime.     It recognized, reasonably, that sentences often reflect a\n\nvariety of factors, and its own experience revealed that, in some\n\n\n\n      9\n      The current version of section 4032 lists seven instances of\nfelony aggravated battery, including the two noted in the text.\n      10\n      The PSR states that the charge specified that the “deadly\nweapon” was a machete.     The charging document is not in the\nsubmitted record materials.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fcases, plea bargaining can result in a “misdemeanor” penalty for a\n\nfelony charge.\n\n           However,    under    Puerto      Rico   law,      a    sentencing    judge\n\nimposing a term of imprisonment for the felony crime of aggravated\n\nbattery appears to lack the discretion to reduce the sentence below\n\nthe statutory minimum of two years.            Law 100 provides that, when\n\nextenuating or aggravating circumstances exist to justify departing\n\nfrom the standard three-year term, “the court must increase or\n\ndecrease   the    established       fixed    sentence        within      the   limits\n\nestablished by law for the crime.”           P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, § 1044\n\n(1980) (emphasis added).        Thus, the six-month sentence is strong\n\nevidence that appellant’s conviction was not for a felony and that,\n\nconsequently, it cannot support the penalty of a sixteen-level\n\nincrease in his offense level.\n\n           The Fifth Circuit also has considered an illegal reentry\n\ncase involving a challenge to the sixteen-level enhancement, and an\n\nimportant difference in context provides some perspective here. In\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Perez, 322 F.3d 350 (5th Cir. 2003) (per\n\ncuriam), the appellant argued that his prior conviction did not\n\nconstitute a felony crime of violence because his plea agreement\n\nprovided   that   he   would   be    punished      as   if       the   crime   were   a\n\nmisdemeanor, with a one-year maximum sentence, and he was sentenced\n\nto a term of ninety days.       Id. at 351-52.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f          The court rejected the appellant’s argument because,\n\nunder a provision of Texas law, “a crime remains a felony even if\n\npunished as a misdemeanor.”     Id. at 352 (citing Tex. Penal Code §\n\n12.44(a)).     Significantly, the plea bargain in that case stated,\n\nwith emphasis, that despite Rivera’s misdemeanor-like punishment,\n\nthe judgment “‘shall constitute A FINAL FELONY CONVICTION FOR THE\n\nDEFENDANT.’”    Id.\n\n          The government, which on appeal endorses the district\n\ncourt's ruling (despite its agreement at sentencing that the\n\naggravated     battery   conviction   was   a     misdemeanor),   cites    no\n\ncomparable provision of Puerto Rico law. It relies on the district\n\ncourt's rationale that a plea bargain may have prompted a reduced\n\nfelony sentence, and alternatively suggests that the Puerto Rico\n\ncourt may have imposed a six-month term because of extenuating or\n\nmitigating   circumstances.      That    logic,    however,   requires    the\n\ngovernment to argue that the Puerto Rico court imposed a sentence\n\nthat was not permitted by Commonwealth law, which sets a two-year\n\nminimum for felony aggravated battery.          We think it more sensible\n\nto conclude that the Puerto Rico court imposed a lawful sentence\n\nfor misdemeanor aggravated battery.         Indeed, if we were to deem\n\nthis conviction a felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, we think\n\nit likely that we would be elevating the severity of the crime\n\nbeyond the intent of the law that criminalized the conduct.                We\n\nhave neither authority nor inclination to take such a step.                We\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fhold that appellant’s aggravated battery conviction may not be\n\ntreated as a felony in calculating his sentence.\n\n          Vacated and remanded for re-sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f",

The district court imposed a forty-one-month term of imprisonment, which included a sixteen-level enhancement under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on its finding that appellant's prior conviction for aggravated battery constituted a felony. Appellant claims that, under Puerto Rico law, the battery conviction was a misdemeanor, not a felony, and that he is entitled to re-sentencing. We agree and therefore remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, first entered the United States unlawfully in March 1989. On December 31, 1989, he was charged in Puerto Rico Superior Court with felony aggravated battery, a violation of Article 95 of the Puerto Rico Penal Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032 (1983). Appellant later entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to six months imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On May 24, 1990, he was removed to the Dominican Republic. He reentered the United States in September 1996, again in Puerto Rico, and in July 1999 pled guilty to a felony charge of unlawful reentry. He was sentenced to seven months imprisonment and again removed from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident underlying this case occurred on April 9, 2005. During a pre-flight inspection at the Luis M. Mar&#237;n International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, appellant was detained and found to be using a counterfeit Puerto Rican driver's license bearing a name other than his own. He subsequently was charged in a two-count indictment with unlawful presence in the United States after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(a) and (b)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and with the knowing and unauthorized use of another person's identification to facilitate his unlawful reentry, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(7). He pled guilty to both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of an unlawful reentry crime is subject to a sixteen-level increase in his offense level if he previously was deported after \"a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The applicable Guidelines definition of felony is \"any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 cmt. n. 2. There is no dispute that the felony crime of aggravated battery, with which appellant was charged in 1989, would trigger the enhancement; the question is whether appellant was convicted of that crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's Article 95 divides aggravated battery into discrete misdemeanor and felony crimes, which cover different types of specified conduct. <i>See infra</i> pp. 10-11. The complaint filed against appellant framed the charge as a felony. Felony aggravated battery is \"punishable by imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years\"; that sentence could be increased to five years if aggravating factors existed and decreased to two years if \"attenuating circumstances are present.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032 (1983). Aggravated battery otherwise is punishable by a term \"not exceeding six months,\" and is thus a misdemeanor under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, both defense counsel and the Assistant United States Attorney agreed that appellant's aggravated battery conviction should be considered a misdemeanor based on the six-month sentence that was imposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The misdemeanor classification would have resulted in only a four-level enhancement and a sentencing range of eight to fourteen months, compared to a range of forty-one to fifty-one months with the sixteen-level enhancement. The alternative four-level increase in offense level would not be based on the misdemeanor conviction, but would result from appellant's prior reentry conviction. The Guidelines impose a four-level enhancement for a prior felony conviction that has no special characteristics&#8212; such as \"aggravated\" or \"crime of violence\" status&#8212;that would trigger a harsher penalty. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court had before it the complaint that led to appellant's 1990 conviction, it had no other information about the crime because the file could not be located. Relying on the language in the complaint, the court concluded that appellant had been convicted of a felony within the meaning of the Guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he prior felony conviction is a state conviction for an offence [sic] punishable by [im]prisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed, which means that regardless of having been sentenced to six months, and the Court there&#8212;I don't know whatever the judge did and sentenced him to six months, but according to what he was charged with, he was charged with a felony that carried a term of imprisonment of more than one year, carried a fixed term of three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If afterwards he plea bargained and the case was reduced to a misdemeanor, that is something else. But for purposes of the guidelines that we are applying, a prior felony conviction means a state conviction punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of the actual sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court therefore applied the sixteen-level enhancement and imposed the forty-one-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The body of law surrounding the proper classification of state crimes for purposes of federal sentencing is both complex and growing, <i>see, e.g., Lopez v. Gonzales,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 625, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2006), and this is not the first time that we have confronted a defendant's attempt to link the short length of his sentence to the crime's status under the Sentencing Guidelines. In <i>United States v. Santiago,</i> 83 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.1996), the appellant claimed that his two prior convictions for assault and battery did not satisfy the career offender requirement that they be \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" because he received six-month sentences on each occasion. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27 (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)). We noted, however, that the offenses were punishable at the time they occurred by imprisonment of up to two-and-one-half years, and we made the following observation: \"The guideline ... does not speak in terms of a <i>judicial</i> judgment (the length of the sentence meted out), but, rather, in terms of a <i>legislative</i> judgment (the maximum punishment applicable to the offense). <i>Id.</i> at 27 (emphasis in original). We thus held the crimes qualified as predicate convictions for career offender status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other case law in our circuit and elsewhere confirms that it is the statutory maximum for a particular crime, and not the specific sentence imposed, that determines the crime's status, including its classification as a felony under &#167; 2L1.2. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Caicedo-Cuero,</i> 312 F.3d 697, 704-06 (5th Cir.2002) (rejecting defendant's contention that mandatory suspended sentence for first-time offender removed prior crime from classification as \"felony\" under &#167; 2L1.2 where statute provided for maximum two-year term of imprisonment); <i>United States v. Robles-Rodriguez,</i> 281 F.3d 900, 903-06 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting felony classification under &#167; 2L1.2 where maximum authorized punishment was probation); <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d 607, 615 (1st Cir.1990) (rejecting claim that district court erroneously treated crimes as felonies where defendants were sentenced to six years \"but actually served less than `one year and one month'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here, however, is materially different. Appellant does not seek to classify a crime based solely on the sentence imposed, but invokes the sentence as decisive proof that he was convicted of a misdemeanor. Framed in the language we used in <i>Santiago,</i> the issue is whether appellant's six-month term was the product of a <i>judicial</i> judgment as to the appropriate sentence for the felony with which he was charged, or a <i>legislative</i> judgment as to the appropriate penalty for a lesser crime. Put another way, was appellant convicted and sentenced for the misdemeanor crime of aggravated battery&#8212;for which the legislature fixed a maximum six-month prison term&#8212;or was he sentenced leniently for the felony crime of aggravated battery? If the former, the conviction would not qualify as a felony crime of violence under &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We typically review de novo the district court's determination of the legal meaning of guidelines provisions. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Sanchez-Mota,</i> 319 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam) (interpreting &#167; 2L1.2). A court's factual findings on sentencing are reviewed only for clear error. <i>Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d at 38. The question we face here is legal, requiring us to consider both the nature of Puerto Rico's aggravated battery statute and the legal significance owed to appellant's plea and sentencing under the provision. Accordingly, we apply de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that he was <i>charged</i> with felony aggravated battery, but he argues that the only conclusion that can be drawn from his six-month sentence is that he was <i>convicted</i> of the less serious crime of misdemeanor aggravated battery. This is so, he maintains, because Puerto Rico was a fixed sentence jurisdiction at the time of his conviction, and the judge who sentenced him was therefore obligated to follow the fixed term prescribed by statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> If he were convicted of a felony, that term would have been between two and five years, with a three-year term being the standard. He argues that, because he was sentenced to six months' incarceration, he must have been convicted of misdemeanor aggravated battery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this reasoning persuasive. Under Article 95, each form of aggravated battery has its own set of factual criteria. At the time of appellant's crime, aggravated battery was classified as a misdemeanor when committed under one (or more) of seven specifically designated circumstances, including \"[w]hen committed with the intent to inflict serious bodily injury.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032(e) (1983).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Aggravated battery was considered a felony, however, under three other specified instances, including \"[w]hen serious bodily injury is inflicted on the person assaulted,\" <i>id.</i> at &#167; 4032(b) (second part), and when it was \"committed with deadly weapons under circumstances not amounting to an intent to kill or maim,\" <i>id.</i> at &#167; 4032(c) (second part).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had no information before it other than that appellant had been charged with the felony version of aggravated battery&#8212;and that he received a six-month sentence. Translating from Spanish, the court quoted the complaint filed against appellant, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendant . . . illegally, voluntarily, maliciously, and with criminal intention, did use force or violence against a human being . . . with the purpose of causing him harm, committing said crime with deadly weapons under circumstances that do not amount to an intent to kill or to maim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unquestionably, the language in the complaint tracks the language in subsection (c) of the felony portion of Article 95 referring to the use of deadly weapons. The court concluded that it should rely on that language, rather than on the sentence, to classify the crime. It recognized, reasonably, that sentences often reflect a variety of factors, and its own experience revealed that, in some cases, plea bargaining can result in a \"misdemeanor\" penalty for a felony charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, under Puerto Rico law, a sentencing judge imposing a term of imprisonment for the felony crime of aggravated battery appears to lack the discretion to reduce the sentence below the statutory minimum of two years. Law 100 provides that, when extenuating or aggravating circumstances exist to justify departing from the standard three-year term, \"the court <i>must increase or decrease the established fixed sentence within the limits established by law for the crime.</i>\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, &#167; 1044 (1980) (emphasis added). Thus, the six-month sentence is strong evidence that appellant's conviction was not for a felony and that, consequently, it cannot support the penalty of a sixteen-level increase in his offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit also has considered an illegal reentry case involving a challenge to the sixteen-level enhancement, and an important difference in context provides some perspective here. In <i>United States v. Rivera-Perez,</i> 322 F.3d 350 (5th Cir. 2003) (<i>per curiam</i>), the appellant argued that his prior conviction did not constitute a felony crime of violence because his plea agreement provided that he would be punished as if the crime were a misdemeanor, with a one-year maximum sentence, and he was sentenced to a term of ninety days. <i>Id.</i> at 351-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected the appellant's argument because, under a provision of Texas law, \"a crime remains a felony even if punished as a misdemeanor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 352 (citing Tex. Penal Code &#167; 12.44(a)). Significantly, the plea bargain in that case stated, with emphasis, that despite Rivera's misdemeanor-like punishment, the judgment \"`shall constitute A FINAL FELONY CONVICTION FOR THE DEFENDANT.'\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, which on appeal endorses the district court's ruling (despite its agreement at sentencing that the aggravated battery conviction was a misdemeanor), cites no comparable provision of Puerto Rico law. It relies on the district court's rationale that a plea bargain may have prompted a reduced felony sentence, and alternatively suggests that the Puerto Rico court may have imposed a six-month term because of extenuating or mitigating circumstances. That logic, however, requires the government to argue that the Puerto Rico court imposed a sentence that was not permitted by Commonwealth law, which sets a two-year minimum for felony aggravated battery. We think it more sensible to conclude that the Puerto Rico court imposed a lawful sentence for misdemeanor aggravated battery. Indeed, if we were to deem this conviction a felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, we think it likely that we would be elevating the severity of the crime beyond the intent of the law that criminalized the conduct. We have neither authority nor inclination to take such a step. We hold that appellant's aggravated battery conviction may not be treated as a felony in calculating his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We draw the facts from the government's proffer at appellant's change of plea hearing and from two Pre-Sentence Reports (\"PSR\"), one prepared in this case and one prepared in connection with an earlier reentry charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The 2005 PSR reported that appellant also pled guilty to a weapons law violation stemming from the same incident, for which he received a concurrent six-month term of imprisonment.

The statute continues to have separate sections for the felony and misdemeanor crimes, with each section listing various factual circumstances in which it applies. As in the earlier version, the current statute states explicitly that aggravated battery is a felony when it occurs in the specified circumstances<i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032(2)(2003). The statute's first section, currently designated subsection (1), is not expressly labeled as a misdemeanor provision; it is the prescribed penalty that triggers the misdemeanor classification.

The district court imposed a forty-one-month term of imprisonment, which included a sixteen-level enhancement under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on its finding that appellant's prior conviction for aggravated battery constituted a felony. Appellant claims that, under Puerto Rico law, the battery conviction was a misdemeanor, not a felony, and that he is entitled to re-sentencing. We agree and therefore remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, first entered the United States unlawfully in March 1989. On December 31, 1989, he was charged in Puerto Rico Superior Court with felony aggravated battery, a violation of Article 95 of the Puerto Rico Penal Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032 (1983). Appellant later entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to six months imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On May 24, 1990, he was removed to the Dominican Republic. He reentered the United States in September 1996, again in Puerto Rico, and in July 1999 pled guilty to a felony charge of unlawful reentry. He was sentenced to seven months imprisonment and again removed from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident underlying this case occurred on April 9, 2005. During a pre-flight inspection at the Luis M. Mar&#237;n International Airport in Carolina, Puerto Rico, appellant was detained and found to be using a counterfeit Puerto Rican driver's license bearing a name other than his own. He subsequently was charged in a two-count indictment with unlawful presence in the United States after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(a) and (b)(1),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and with the knowing and unauthorized use of another person's identification to facilitate his unlawful reentry, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(7). He pled guilty to both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of an unlawful reentry crime is subject to a sixteen-level increase in his offense level if he previously was deported after \"a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The applicable Guidelines definition of felony is \"any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 cmt. n. 2. There is no dispute that the felony crime of aggravated battery, with which appellant was charged in 1989, would trigger the enhancement; the question is whether appellant was convicted of that crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's Article 95 divides aggravated battery into discrete misdemeanor and felony crimes, which cover different types of specified conduct. <i>See infra</i> pp. 10-11. The complaint filed against appellant framed the charge as a felony. Felony aggravated battery is \"punishable by imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years\"; that sentence could be increased to five years if aggravating factors existed and decreased to two years if \"attenuating circumstances are present.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032 (1983). Aggravated battery otherwise is punishable by a term \"not exceeding six months,\" and is thus a misdemeanor under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, both defense counsel and the Assistant United States Attorney agreed that appellant's aggravated battery conviction should be considered a misdemeanor based on the six-month sentence that was imposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The misdemeanor classification would have resulted in only a four-level enhancement and a sentencing range of eight to fourteen months, compared to a range of forty-one to fifty-one months with the sixteen-level enhancement. The alternative four-level increase in offense level would not be based on the misdemeanor conviction, but would result from appellant's prior reentry conviction. The Guidelines impose a four-level enhancement for a prior felony conviction that has no special characteristics&#8212; such as \"aggravated\" or \"crime of violence\" status&#8212;that would trigger a harsher penalty. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court had before it the complaint that led to appellant's 1990 conviction, it had no other information about the crime because the file could not be located. Relying on the language in the complaint, the court concluded that appellant had been convicted of a felony within the meaning of the Guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he prior felony conviction is a state conviction for an offence [sic] punishable by [im]prisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed, which means that regardless of having been sentenced to six months, and the Court there&#8212;I don't know whatever the judge did and sentenced him to six months, but according to what he was charged with, he was charged with a felony that carried a term of imprisonment of more than one year, carried a fixed term of three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If afterwards he plea bargained and the case was reduced to a misdemeanor, that is something else. But for purposes of the guidelines that we are applying, a prior felony conviction means a state conviction punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of the actual sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court therefore applied the sixteen-level enhancement and imposed the forty-one-month sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Legal Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The body of law surrounding the proper classification of state crimes for purposes of federal sentencing is both complex and growing, <i>see, e.g., Lopez v. Gonzales,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145772\"><a href=\"/opinion/145772/lopez-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2006), and this is not the first time that we have confronted a defendant's attempt to link the short length of his sentence to the crime's status under the Sentencing Guidelines. In <i>United States v. Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196737\"><a href=\"/opinion/196737/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), the appellant claimed that his two prior convictions for assault and battery did not satisfy the career offender requirement that they be \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" because he received six-month sentences on each occasion. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27 (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)). We noted, however, that the offenses were punishable at the time they occurred by imprisonment of up to two-and-one-half years, and we made the following observation: \"The guideline ... does not speak in terms of a <i>judicial</i> judgment (the length of the sentence meted out), but, rather, in terms of a <i>legislative</i> judgment (the maximum punishment applicable to the offense). <i>Id.</i> at 27 (emphasis in original). We thus held the crimes qualified as predicate convictions for career offender status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other case law in our circuit and elsewhere confirms that it is the statutory maximum for a particular crime, and not the specific sentence imposed, that determines the crime's status, including its classification as a felony under &#167; 2L1.2. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Caicedo-Cuero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780060\"><a href=\"/opinion/780060/united-states-v-jesus-martin-caicedo-cuero/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 704-06 (5th Cir.2002) (rejecting defendant's contention that mandatory suspended sentence for first-time offender removed prior crime from classification as \"felony\" under &#167; 2L1.2 where statute provided for maximum two-year term of imprisonment); <i>United States v. Robles-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776709\"><a href=\"/opinion/776709/united-states-v-alejandro-robles-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 903-06 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting felony classification under &#167; 2L1.2 where maximum authorized punishment was probation); <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 615 (1st Cir.1990) (rejecting claim that district court erroneously treated crimes as felonies where defendants were sentenced to six years \"but actually served less than `one year and one month'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue here, however, is materially different. Appellant does not seek to classify a crime based solely on the sentence imposed, but invokes the sentence as decisive proof that he was convicted of a misdemeanor. Framed in the language we used in <i>Santiago,</i> the issue is whether appellant's six-month term was the product of a <i>judicial</i> judgment as to the appropriate sentence for the felony with which he was charged, or a <i>legislative</i> judgment as to the appropriate penalty for a lesser crime. Put another way, was appellant convicted and sentenced for the misdemeanor crime of aggravated battery&#8212;for which the legislature fixed a maximum six-month prison term&#8212;or was he sentenced leniently for the felony crime of aggravated battery? If the former, the conviction would not qualify as a felony crime of violence under &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We typically review de novo the district court's determination of the legal meaning of guidelines provisions. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201981\"><a href=\"/opinion/201981/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Sanchez-Mota,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200263\"><a href=\"/opinion/200263/united-states-v-sanchez-mota/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2002) (per curiam) (interpreting &#167; 2L1.2). A court's factual findings on sentencing are reviewed only for clear error. <i>Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d at 38. The question we face here is legal, requiring us to consider both the nature of Puerto Rico's aggravated battery statute and the legal significance owed to appellant's plea and sentencing under the provision. Accordingly, we apply de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that he was <i>charged</i> with felony aggravated battery, but he argues that the only conclusion that can be drawn from his six-month sentence is that he was <i>convicted</i> of the less serious crime of misdemeanor aggravated battery. This is so, he maintains, because Puerto Rico was a fixed sentence jurisdiction at the time of his conviction, and the judge who sentenced him was therefore obligated to follow the fixed term prescribed by statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> If he were convicted of a felony, that term would have been between two and five years, with a three-year term being the standard. He argues that, because he was sentenced to six months' incarceration, he must have been convicted of misdemeanor aggravated battery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this reasoning persuasive. Under Article 95, each form of aggravated battery has its own set of factual criteria. At the time of appellant's crime, aggravated battery was classified as a misdemeanor when committed under one (or more) of seven specifically designated circumstances, including \"[w]hen committed with the intent to inflict serious bodily injury.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032(e) (1983).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Aggravated battery was considered a felony, however, under three other specified instances, including \"[w]hen serious bodily injury is inflicted on the person assaulted,\" <i>id.</i> at &#167; 4032(b) (second part), and when it was \"committed with deadly weapons under circumstances not amounting to an intent to kill or maim,\" <i>id.</i> at &#167; 4032(c) (second part).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had no information before it other than that appellant had been charged with the felony version of aggravated battery&#8212;and that he received a six-month sentence. Translating from Spanish, the court quoted the complaint filed against appellant, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendant . . . illegally, voluntarily, maliciously, and with criminal intention, did use force or violence against a human being . . . with the purpose of causing him harm, committing said crime with deadly weapons under circumstances that do not amount to an intent to kill or to maim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unquestionably, the language in the complaint tracks the language in subsection (c) of the felony portion of Article 95 referring to the use of deadly weapons. The court concluded that it should rely on that language, rather than on the sentence, to classify the crime. It recognized, reasonably, that sentences often reflect a variety of factors, and its own experience revealed that, in some cases, plea bargaining can result in a \"misdemeanor\" penalty for a felony charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, under Puerto Rico law, a sentencing judge imposing a term of imprisonment for the felony crime of aggravated battery appears to lack the discretion to reduce the sentence below the statutory minimum of two years. Law 100 provides that, when extenuating or aggravating circumstances exist to justify departing from the standard three-year term, \"the court <i>must increase or decrease the established fixed sentence within the limits established by law for the crime.</i>\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, &#167; 1044 (1980) (emphasis added). Thus, the six-month sentence is strong evidence that appellant's conviction was not for a felony and that, consequently, it cannot support the penalty of a sixteen-level increase in his offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit also has considered an illegal reentry case involving a challenge to the sixteen-level enhancement, and an important difference in context provides some perspective here. In <i>United States v. Rivera-Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"30200\"><a href=\"/opinion/30200/united-states-v-rivera-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 2003) (<i>per curiam</i>), the appellant argued that his prior conviction did not constitute a felony crime of violence because his plea agreement provided that he would be punished as if the crime were a misdemeanor, with a one-year maximum sentence, and he was sentenced to a term of ninety days. <i>Id.</i> at 351-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected the appellant's argument because, under a provision of Texas law, \"a crime remains a felony even if punished as a misdemeanor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 352 (citing Tex. Penal Code &#167; 12.44(a)). Significantly, the plea bargain in that case stated, with emphasis, that despite Rivera's misdemeanor-like punishment, the judgment \"`shall constitute A FINAL FELONY CONVICTION FOR THE DEFENDANT.'\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, which on appeal endorses the district court's ruling (despite its agreement at sentencing that the aggravated battery conviction was a misdemeanor), cites no comparable provision of Puerto Rico law. It relies on the district court's rationale that a plea bargain may have prompted a reduced felony sentence, and alternatively suggests that the Puerto Rico court may have imposed a six-month term because of extenuating or mitigating circumstances. That logic, however, requires the government to argue that the Puerto Rico court imposed a sentence that was not permitted by Commonwealth law, which sets a two-year minimum for felony aggravated battery. We think it more sensible to conclude that the Puerto Rico court imposed a lawful sentence for misdemeanor aggravated battery. Indeed, if we were to deem this conviction a felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2, we think it likely that we would be elevating the severity of the crime beyond the intent of the law that criminalized the conduct. We have neither authority nor inclination to take such a step. We hold that appellant's aggravated battery conviction may not be treated as a felony in calculating his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We draw the facts from the government's proffer at appellant's change of plea hearing and from two Pre-Sentence Reports (\"PSR\"), one prepared in this case and one prepared in connection with an earlier reentry charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The 2005 PSR reported that appellant also pled guilty to a weapons law violation stemming from the same incident, for which he received a concurrent six-month term of imprisonment.

The statute continues to have separate sections for the felony and misdemeanor crimes, with each section listing various factual circumstances in which it applies. As in the earlier version, the current statute states explicitly that aggravated battery is a felony when it occurs in the specified circumstances<i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4032(2)(2003). The statute's first section, currently designated subsection (1), is not expressly labeled as a misdemeanor provision; it is the prescribed penalty that triggers the misdemeanor classification. Puerto Rico's Penal Code defines a misdemeanor as</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">a crime punishable by detention for a term that does not exceed six months or by a fine that does not exceed five thousand (5,000) dollars, or both penalties at the discretion of the court.
