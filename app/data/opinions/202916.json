The government appeals the sentence, and Holloway cross-\n\nappeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.\n\n                                           I.\n\n             We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on the motion to suppress, but only to the\n\nextent that they have support in the record and are not clearly\n\nerroneous.        See United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n             On     December     26,     2001,        special     officers1    Anthony\n\nCrutchfield and Shaheed Hall were patrolling the streets around\n\nhousing projects in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAt   10:30    p.m.,    the      officers        saw    Holloway    chasing     another\n\nindividual, Memogne Lamothe. As Holloway drew closer, the officers\n\nsaw him reach into his pants pocket, as if for a weapon.                      Lamothe\n\nran inside the building at 144 Seaver Street, and the door locked\n\nbehind him, preventing Holloway from following him.                           Holloway\n\nwaited    outside     for      several     minutes,       speaking     with   various\n\nindividuals.        Ultimately, Gerald Scott arrived and spoke with\n\nHolloway.         Scott proceeded to shuttle back and forth between\n\n\n1\n  These security officers were licensed by the Boston Police\nDepartment to patrol housing developments.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fHolloway and the entryway to the building at 144 Seaver Street,\n\napparently talking to someone inside. Holloway and Scott were then\n\n\"buzzed\" into the building.\n\n           Fearing a continuation of the earlier chase, Crutchfield\n\nand Hall immediately called their supervisor, Patrick Bailey, and\n\nthe three officers entered the building using their pass key. Once\n\ninside, the officers saw Holloway, Scott, and Lamothe talking on\n\nthe stairway in a common area of the building.                The officers\n\napproached the men and asked what was going on.             Holloway stated\n\nthat nothing was going on, but Lamothe responded that he lived in\n\nthe building, that he knew they should not be loitering in a common\n\narea, and that they would continue their conversation in his\n\napartment.    At this point the officers asked the three to provide\n\nidentification.      Scott   and   Lamothe    cooperated,     but   Holloway\n\nrefused.     The officers persisted, and Holloway continued to say\n\nthat he did not have to give them identification.             Lamothe then\n\nunlocked his apartment door, but the officers directed him not to\n\nmove.   Lamothe complied, but Holloway suddenly shoved Lamothe into\n\nthe officers and ran into the apartment.            Hall and Crutchfield\n\nfollowed, with Hall entering first and immediately yelling \"Gun.\"\n\nUpon entering, Crutchfield saw Holloway sitting on a chair and\n\nordered him to the ground. Holloway was arrested after a struggle,\n\nand the officers recovered a loaded pistol that Hall had seen\n\nHolloway   shove   under   the   seat   of   his   chair.     Holloway   was\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsubsequently indicted for being a felon in possession of ammunition\n\nthat traveled in interstate commerce.        See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\n            Holloway moved to suppress the ammunition on the grounds\n\nthat the officers had neither reasonable suspicion that criminal\n\nactivity was afoot to justify a Terry2 stop nor probable cause to\n\narrest when they seized Holloway.        Therefore, Holloway maintained,\n\nany evidence that resulted from the wrongful seizure must be\n\nsuppressed.      After   an    evidentiary    hearing,     at   which   only\n\nCrutchfield testified, the district court denied the motion without\n\nopinion.      Thereafter,     Holloway    entered   a    plea   of   guilty,\n\nconditioned on the right to appeal the denial of his suppression\n\nmotion.\n\n            At sentencing, the government argued that Holloway should\n\nbe sentenced to a mandatory fifteen-year prison term under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. §924(e),3 on the basis\n\nof Holloway's three Massachusetts convictions for assault and\n\nbattery. The government argued that each conviction was a \"violent\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Referring to the brief investigatory stop described by the\nSupreme Court in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\n3\n    The ACCA provides that:\n\n       In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of\n       this title and has three previous convictions ... for a\n       violent felony or a serious drug offense...such person\n       shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less\n       than fifteen years....\n       18 U.S.C. §924(e)(1).\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffelony\"4 under the ACCA because each was based on a charging\n\ndocument which alleged that Holloway did \"assault and beat\" the\n\nvictim.      Holloway      argued   that     assault   and   battery   under\n\nMassachusetts law includes two types of conduct--harmful (violent)\n\nconduct and nonharmful (offensive or nonconsensual) conduct--and\n\nonly convictions under the first prong are crimes of violence.\n\nHolloway emphasized that the \"assault and beat\" language was used\n\nto charge both types of batteries, and thus the charging language\n\nwas mere \"boilerplate\" that said nothing about the nature of the\n\nunderlying crime.    Holloway further contended that the convictions\n\ncould not be deemed predicate violent offenses under the ACCA\n\nwithout violating the principles set forth in United States v.\n\nShepard, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), and Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S.\n\n575 (1990) because there were no other relevant judicial materials\n\ndescribing   the   facts    of   the   Massachusetts    convictions.     The\n\ndistrict court accepted Holloway's position and sentenced him to\n\ntime served.\n\n\n4\n  [T]he term 'violent felony' means any crime punishable                  by\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year...that-\n               (i) has as an element the use, attempted\n          use, or threatened use of physical force\n          against the person of another; or\n               (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion,\n          involves use of explosives, or otherwise\n          involves conduct that presents a serious\n          potential   risk   of  physical   injury   to\n          another....\n\n          18 U.S.C. §924(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           A. Motion to Suppress\n\n           Holloway maintains that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress because the officers lacked the\n\nreasonable     suspicion    necessary    for   a     Terry    stop.    Holloway\n\nemphasizes that the officers only saw three men having a peaceful\n\nconversation in the stairwell, with no hint of violence or other\n\ncriminal activity.      The government rejoins that Holloway was never\n\nseized, as he never submitted to the officers' authority.\n\n           In evaluating a district court's assessment of a motion\n\nto suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal\n\nconclusions de novo.       United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     We \"will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if\n\nany reasonable view of the evidence supports it.\" United States v.\n\nGarner, 338 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted).\n\n           The primary issue is whether Holloway was \"seized\" by the\n\nofficers in the hallway before he dashed into the apartment.\n\n\"Under   the   Fourth   Amendment,   a     seizure    occurs    when   a   police\n\nofficer, by means of physical force or a show of authority, has in\n\nsome way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\"               Sealey, 30 F.3d at\n\n9.   The show of authority must be such that a reasonable person\n\nwould believe that he was not free to leave.            See United States v.\n\nSmith, 423 F.3d 25, 28-29 (1st Cir. 2005).            In addition, a seizure\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\frequires that the citizen must actually submit to the show of\n\nauthority.     See California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626-629\n\n(1991); Smith, 423 F.3d at 31-32.\n\n             The record makes it abundantly clear that Holloway never\n\nsubmitted to the officers' show of authority.           Holloway verbally\n\nrejected     the   officers'   instructions    before    escalating   his\n\nresistance by shoving Lamothe into the officers and trying to flee.\n\nSuch conduct does not manifest an intent to submit to the officers'\n\nauthority. See, e.g., Smith, 423 F.3d at 31-32 (attempting to flee\n\nand struggling with officers indicates no submission to police\n\nauthority); Sealey, 30 F.3d at 9-10 (ignoring officer's questions\n\nand fleeing was not submission to authority).           Holloway was not\n\nactually seized until the officers physically overpowered and\n\nhandcuffed him in Lamothe's apartment.        See Hodari D., 499 U.S. at\n\n629 (suspect not seized until tackled by officer).             Thus, the\n\nofficers' recovery of the gun that Holloway discarded before being\n\narrested was not the result of a wrongful seizure.          See generally\n\nSealey, 30 F.3d at 10 (contraband discarded by suspect while\n\nfleeing police was not fruit of the seizure).\n\n           Holloway counters that he was \"seized\" when he submitted\n\nto the officers' show of authority by initially answering their\n\nquestions, even if his answers were unsatisfactory to the officers.\n\nThis contention is unpersuasive for a host of reasons.         First, the\n\nofficers' initial approach and general inquiry did not trigger\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fFourth Amendment scrutiny even though Holloway responded.                        See\n\nSmith, 423 F.3d at 28 (officers may approach citizens and ask\n\nquestions     without     any     degree      of   suspicion).          Similarly,\n\n\"interrogation    relating       to   one's    identity   or     a    request    for\n\nidentification by the police does not, by itself, constitute a\n\nFourth Amendment seizure.\" Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct., 542\n\nU.S. 177, 185 (2004)(internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\nLastly, Holloway's verbal challenges to the officers' authority --\n\ngenerally to the effect that the officers had no authority to\n\nbother him or ask for identification -- were not submissions to the\n\nauthority but part of his conduct in evading it.\n\n            B. Sentencing\n\n            The government argues that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to sentence Holloway under the ACCA.                    The government\n\nemphasizes    that      the     charging     documents    for        each   of   the\n\nMassachusetts convictions specified that Holloway did \"assault and\n\nbeat\" his victim, which the government maintains suffices to show\n\nthat the underlying crime was a violent rather merely offensive\n\nbattery.    Holloway rejoins that the \"assault and beat\" language in\n\nthe Massachusetts charging documents is not determinative because\n\nit is mere boilerplate and says nothing about the nature of the\n\nunderlying offense.      We review the district court's interpretation\n\nof the ACCA de novo.      United States v. Miller, 478 F.3d 48, 50 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f             Holloway's contention is foreclosed by our precedent\n\nwhich holds that a Massachusetts charging document that states the\n\ndefendant \"assault[ed] and beat\" the victim is sufficient to\n\nestablish    that   the    conviction    was    for    a   violent   battery   and\n\ntherefore a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of the guidelines.\n\nSee United States v. Estevez, 419 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\ncert. denied, 546 U.S. 1192 (2006); United States v. Santos, 363\n\nF.3d 19, 23-24 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d\n\n460,   464   (1st   Cir.    1998);   see      also    United   States   v.   Fink,\n\n___F.3d___, ___ (1st Cir. 2007). Moreover, we have stated that the\n\ndefinitions of \"violent felony\" in the ACCA and \"crime of violence\"\n\nin U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 are essentially the same, and that we may look\n\nto cases dealing with either to inform our categorical inquiry.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 411-12 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); United States v. Jackson, 409 F.3d 479, 479 n. 1 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).       At bottom, our focus is on the usual type of proscribed\n\nconduct.      Santos, 363 F.3d at 23.                Thus, we interpreted the\n\ncharging language in the most reasonable sense--that \"the assault\n\namounted to a beating\" of the victim.                Mangos, 134 F.3d at 464.\n\nIndeed as the Supreme Court recently held, \"[w]e do not view [the\n\ncategorical approach] as requiring that every conceivable factual\n\noffense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious\n\npotential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent\n\nfelony.\"     James v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 1597 (2007).\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f\"[T]he proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the\n\nelements of the offense, in the ordinary case, present a serious\n\nrisk of injury to another.\" Id.5      Thus, the district court's\n\nconclusion was in error.\n\n          Holloway identifies no change in the law that warrants\n\nour disregard of this circuit precedent.     Instead, Holloway (and\n\nthe amici) look backward to our decision in United States v.\n\nHarris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1st Cir. 1992), arguing that our post-Harris\n\nprecedent fundamentally misinterpreted Harris.      However, it is\n\naxiomatic that new panels are bound by prior panel decisions in the\n\nabsence of supervening authority.     See, e.g., United States v.\n\nAllen, 469 F.3d 11, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2006).   Only the Supreme Court\n\nor an en banc court can overturn prior panel precedent in ordinary\n\ncircumstances, and until such time, we are bound by Estevez and\n\nSantos.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, Holloway's conviction is\n\naffirmed, his sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for\n\nresentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  We also note, as did the prior panels, that there is nothing in\nthe record to suggest that the batteries at issue here were of the\noffensive rather than the violent variety. See Santos, 363 F.3d at\n24; Mangos, 134 F.3d at 464.\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d 7, 7 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>On December 26, 2001, special officers<sup>[1]</sup> Anthony Crutchfield and Shaheed Hall were patrolling the streets around housing projects in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts. At 10:30 p.m., the officers saw Holloway chasing another individual, Memogne Lamothe. As Holloway drew closer, the officers saw him reach into his pants pocket, as if for a weapon. Lamothe ran inside the building at 144 Seaver Street, and the door locked behind him, preventing Holloway from following him. Holloway waited outside for several minutes, speaking with various individuals. Ultimately, Gerald Scott arrived and spoke with Holloway. Scott proceeded to shuttle back and forth between Holloway and the entryway to the building at 144 Seaver Street, apparently talking to someone inside.

Holloway stated that nothing was going on, but Lamothe responded that he lived in the building, that he knew they should not be loitering in a common area, and that they would continue their conversation in his apartment. At this point the officers asked the three to provide identification. Scott and Lamothe cooperated, but Holloway <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> refused. The officers persisted, and Holloway continued to say that he did not have to give them identification. Lamothe then unlocked his apartment door, but the officers directed him not to move. Lamothe complied, but Holloway suddenly shoved Lamothe into the officers and ran into the apartment. Hall and Crutchfield followed, with Hall entering first and immediately yelling \"Gun.\" Upon entering, Crutchfield saw Holloway sitting on a chair and ordered him to the ground. Holloway was arrested after a struggle, and the officers recovered a loaded pistol that Hall had seen Holloway shove under the seat of his chair. Holloway was subsequently indicted for being a felon in possession of ammunition that traveled in interstate commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>Holloway moved to suppress the ammunition on the grounds that the officers had neither reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot to justify a <i>Terry</i><sup>[2]</sup> stop nor probable cause to arrest when they seized Holloway. Therefore, Holloway maintained, any evidence that resulted from the wrongful seizure must be suppressed. After an evidentiary hearing, at which only Crutchfield testified, the district court denied the motion without opinion. Thereafter, Holloway entered a plea of guilty, conditioned on the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the government argued that Holloway should be sentenced to a mandatory fifteen-year prison term under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e),<sup>[3]</sup> on the basis of Holloway's three Massachusetts convictions for assault and battery. The government argued that each conviction was a \"violent felony\"<sup>[4]</sup> under the ACCA because each was based on a charging document which alleged that Holloway did \"assault and beat\" the victim. Holloway argued that assault and battery under Massachusetts law includes two types of conductharmful (violent) conduct and nonharmful (offensive or nonconsensual) conductand only convictions under the first prong are crimes of violence. Holloway emphasized that the \"assault and beat\" language was used to charge both types of batteries, and thus the charging language was mere \"boilerplate\" that said nothing about the nature of the underlying crime. Holloway further contended that the convictions could not be deemed predicate violent offenses under the ACCA without violating the principles set forth in <i>Shepard v.

United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) because there were no other relevant judicial materials describing the facts of the Massachusetts convictions. The district court accepted Holloway's position and sentenced him to time served.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> II.</h2>\n<p>A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p>Holloway maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the officers lacked the reasonable suspicion necessary for a <i>Terry</i> stop. Holloway emphasizes that the officers only saw three men having a peaceful conversation in the stairwell, with no hint of violence or other criminal activity. The government rejoins that Holloway was never seized, as he never submitted to the officers' authority.</p>\n<p>In evaluating a district court's assessment of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Meada,</i> 408 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir.2005). We \"will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.\" <i>United States v. Garner,</i> 338 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>The primary issue is whether Holloway was \"seized\" by the officers in the hallway before he dashed into the apartment. \"Under the Fourth Amendment, a seizure occurs when a police officer, by means of physical force or a show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\" <i>Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d at 9. The show of authority must be such that a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 28-29 (1st Cir.2005). In addition, a seizure requires that the citizen must actually submit to the show of authority. <i>See </i><i>California v. Hodari D.,</i> 499 U.S. 621, 626-629, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991); <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 31-32.</p>\n<p>The record makes it abundantly clear that Holloway never submitted to the officers' show of authority. Holloway verbally rejected the officers' instructions before escalating his resistance by shoving Lamothe into the officers and trying to flee. Such conduct does not manifest an intent to submit to the officers' authority. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 31-32 (attempting to flee and struggling with officers indicates no submission to police authority); <i>Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d at 9-10 (ignoring officer's questions and fleeing was not submission to authority). Holloway was not actually seized until the officers physically overpowered and handcuffed him in Lamothe's apartment. <i>See </i><i>Hodari D.,</i> 499 U.S. at 629, 111 S.Ct. 1547 (suspect not seized until tackled by officer). Thus, the officers' recovery of the gun that Holloway discarded before being arrested was not the result of a wrongful seizure. <i>See generally </i><i>Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d at 10 (contraband discarded by suspect while fleeing police was not fruit of the seizure).</p>\n<p>Holloway counters that he was \"seized\" when he submitted to the officers' show of authority by initially answering their questions, even if his answers were unsatisfactory to the officers. This contention is unpersuasive for a host of reasons. First, the officers' initial approach and general inquiry did not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny even though Holloway responded. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 28 (officers may approach citizens and ask questions without any degree of suspicion). Similarly, \"interrogation relating to one's identity or a request for identification by the police does not, by itself, constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.\" <i>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct.,</i> 542 U.S. 177, 185, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292 (2004)(internal citation and quotation omitted). Lastly, Holloway's verbal challenges to the officers' authoritygenerally to the effect that the officers had no authority to bother him or ask for identificationwere not submissions to the authority but part of his conduct in evading it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> B. Sentencing</p>\n<p>The government argues that the district court erred in refusing to sentence Holloway under the ACCA. The government emphasizes that the charging documents for each of the Massachusetts convictions specified that Holloway did \"assault and beat\" his victim, which the government maintains suffices to show that the underlying crime was a violent rather merely offensive battery. Holloway rejoins that the \"assault and beat\" language in the Massachusetts charging documents is not determinative because it is mere boilerplate and says nothing about the nature of the underlying offense. We review the district court's interpretation of the ACCA <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Miller,</i> 478 F.3d 48, 50 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Holloway's contention is foreclosed by our precedent which holds that a Massachusetts charging document that states the defendant \"assault[ed] and beat\" the victim is sufficient to establish that the conviction was for a violent battery and therefore a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of the guidelines. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Estevez,</i> 419 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 1192, 126 S.Ct. 1380, 164 L.Ed.2d 86 (2006); <i>United States v. Santos,</i> 363 F.3d 19, 23-24 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Mangos,</i> 134 F.3d 460, 464 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Fink,</i> 499 F.3d 81, 84, 2007 WL 2326822 (1st Cir.2007). Moreover, we have stated that the definitions of \"violent felony\" in the ACCA and \"crime of violence\" in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 are essentially the same, and that we may look to cases dealing with either to inform our categorical inquiry. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 411-12 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 409 F.3d 479, 479 n. 1 (1st Cir.2005). At bottom, our focus is on the usual type of proscribed conduct. <i>Santos,</i> 363 F.3d at 23. Thus, we interpreted the charging language in the most reasonable sensethat \"the assault amounted to a beating\" of the victim. <i>Mangos,</i> 134 F.3d at 464. Indeed as the Supreme Court recently held, \"[w]e do not view [the categorical approach] as requiring that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\" <i>James v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). \"[T]he proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, present a serious risk of injury to another.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[5]</sup> Thus, the district court's conclusion was in error.</p>\n<p>Holloway identifies no change in the law that warrants our disregard of this circuit precedent. Instead, Holloway (and the amici) look <i>backward</i> to our decision in <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 964 F.2d 1234 (1st Cir.1992), arguing that our post-<i>Harris</i> precedent fundamentally misinterpreted <i>Harris.</i> However, it is axiomatic that new panels are bound by prior panel decisions in the absence of supervening authority. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Allen,</i> 469 F.3d 11, 17-18 (1st Cir.2006). Only the Supreme Court or an <i>en banc</i> court can overturn prior panel precedent in ordinary circumstances, and until such time, we are bound by <i>Estevez</i> and <i>Santos.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, Holloway's conviction is <i>affirmed,</i> his sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> is <i>vacated,</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These security officers were licensed by the Boston Police Department to patrol housing developments.</p>\n<p>[2]  Referring to the brief investigatory stop described by the Supreme Court in <i>Terry v.

The government appeals the sentence, and Holloway cross-appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling on the motion to suppress, but only to the extent that they have support in the record and are not clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sealey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195505\"><a href=\"/opinion/195505/united-states-v-sealey/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>On December 26, 2001, special officers<sup>[1]</sup> Anthony Crutchfield and Shaheed Hall were patrolling the streets around housing projects in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts. At 10:30 p.m., the officers saw Holloway chasing another individual, Memogne Lamothe. As Holloway drew closer, the officers saw him reach into his pants pocket, as if for a weapon. Lamothe ran inside the building at 144 Seaver Street, and the door locked behind him, preventing Holloway from following him. Holloway waited outside for several minutes, speaking with various individuals. Ultimately, Gerald Scott arrived and spoke with Holloway. Scott proceeded to shuttle back and forth between Holloway and the entryway to the building at 144 Seaver Street, apparently talking to someone inside. Holloway and Scott were then \"buzzed\" into the building.</p>\n<p>Fearing a continuation of the earlier chase, Crutchfield and Hall immediately called their supervisor, Patrick Bailey, and the three officers entered the building using their pass key. Once inside, the officers saw Holloway, Scott, and Lamothe talking on the stairway in a common area of the building. The officers approached the men and asked what was going on. Holloway stated that nothing was going on, but Lamothe responded that he lived in the building, that he knew they should not be loitering in a common area, and that they would continue their conversation in his apartment. At this point the officers asked the three to provide identification. Scott and Lamothe cooperated, but Holloway <span class=\"star-pagination\">*116</span> refused. The officers persisted, and Holloway continued to say that he did not have to give them identification. Lamothe then unlocked his apartment door, but the officers directed him not to move. Lamothe complied, but Holloway suddenly shoved Lamothe into the officers and ran into the apartment. Hall and Crutchfield followed, with Hall entering first and immediately yelling \"Gun.\" Upon entering, Crutchfield saw Holloway sitting on a chair and ordered him to the ground. Holloway was arrested after a struggle, and the officers recovered a loaded pistol that Hall had seen Holloway shove under the seat of his chair. Holloway was subsequently indicted for being a felon in possession of ammunition that traveled in interstate commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>Holloway moved to suppress the ammunition on the grounds that the officers had neither reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot to justify a <i>Terry</i><sup>[2]</sup> stop nor probable cause to arrest when they seized Holloway. Therefore, Holloway maintained, any evidence that resulted from the wrongful seizure must be suppressed. After an evidentiary hearing, at which only Crutchfield testified, the district court denied the motion without opinion. Thereafter, Holloway entered a plea of guilty, conditioned on the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the government argued that Holloway should be sentenced to a mandatory fifteen-year prison term under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e),<sup>[3]</sup> on the basis of Holloway's three Massachusetts convictions for assault and battery. The government argued that each conviction was a \"violent felony\"<sup>[4]</sup> under the ACCA because each was based on a charging document which alleged that Holloway did \"assault and beat\" the victim. Holloway argued that assault and battery under Massachusetts law includes two types of conductharmful (violent) conduct and nonharmful (offensive or nonconsensual) conductand only convictions under the first prong are crimes of violence. Holloway emphasized that the \"assault and beat\" language was used to charge both types of batteries, and thus the charging language was mere \"boilerplate\" that said nothing about the nature of the underlying crime. Holloway further contended that the convictions could not be deemed predicate violent offenses under the ACCA without violating the principles set forth in <i>Shepard v.

Instead, Holloway (and the amici) look <i>backward</i> to our decision in <i>United States v.

Only the Supreme Court or an <i>en banc</i> court can overturn prior panel precedent in ordinary circumstances, and until such time, we are bound by <i>Estevez</i> and <i>Santos.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, Holloway's conviction is <i>affirmed,</i> his sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> is <i>vacated,</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These security officers were licensed by the Boston Police Department to patrol housing developments.</p>\n<p>[2]  Referring to the brief investigatory stop described by the Supreme Court in <i>Terry v.
