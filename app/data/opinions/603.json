William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n         Souter, Associate Justice,* and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Timothy J. Robenhymer for appellant.\n     John A. Donovan, with whom Christopher Reilly and Sloane &\nWalsh were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                                March 25, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.   On July 3, 2006, Joyce Wagenmaker was\n\ninjured when an unidentified vehicle collided with a car belonging\n\nto Vito Vitone, in which she was a passenger.             Wagenmaker’s\n\nsubsequent claim for benefits from defendant Amica Mutual Insurance\n\nCompany, Vitone’s insurer, was denied on the ground that Vitone’s\n\ncar had no uninsured motorist coverage, it having been cancelled at\n\nVitone’s request some nine months before the accident.      The change\n\nwas reflected in the policy’s amended declarations page, which\n\nclearly indicated that the car was “NOT COVERED” for damages by an\n\nuninsured driver.\n\n           According to Wagenmaker, the declaration means nothing.\n\nShe points to the boilerplate terms of the policy, which provide\n\nthat Amica will pay any damages that a passenger in a “covered\n\nauto” is entitled to collect from an uninsured driver.      She quotes\n\nthe definition of “covered auto” as “[a]ny vehicle shown in the\n\nDeclarations,” notes that Vitone’s car is identified in the amended\n\ndeclarations, and says “it is of no consequence whether Mr. Vitone\n\ncanceled   the   uninsured   motorist   coverage”:   an     automobile\n\nspecifically designated on the declarations page as “NOT COVERED”\n\nwith respect to a particular category of insurance is nonetheless\n\na “covered auto” as to that same category.\n\n           Wagenmaker’s position ignores the law of contract: “the\n\nrights and liabilities of the parties to an insurance contract are\n\nto be ascertained in accordance with the terms as set forth\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ftherein,”    Nat’l Refrigeration, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 947\n\nA.2d 906, 909 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n\nlike any contract, an insurance policy is to be read as a whole.\n\nTown of Cumberland v. R.I. Interlocal Risk Mgmt. Trust, Inc., 860\n\nA.2d 1210, 1215 (R.I. 2004).        The terms of a policy thus include\n\nthose    listed   on   the   declarations   page;   indeed,   these   are   of\n\n“paramount importance.” Mallane v. Holyoke Mut. Ins. Co., 658 A.2d\n\n18, 20 (R.I. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nLehroff v. Aetna Cas. & Surety Co., 638 A.2d 889, 892 (N.J. Super.\n\nCt. App. Div. 1994) (“[I]t is the declaration page, the one page of\n\nthe policy tailored to the particular insured and not merely\n\nboilerplate, which must be deemed to define coverage and the\n\ninsured’s expectation of coverage.”), quoted in Mallane, 658 A.2d\n\nat 21.      The declarations page of Vitone’s policy unambiguously\n\nstates that there is no uninsured motorist coverage for the car in\n\nwhich Wagenmaker rode.\n\n            The judgment of the district court in favor of Amica is\n\naffirmed.    Costs are taxed in favor of Amica.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
