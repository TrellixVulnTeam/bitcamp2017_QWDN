José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Howard, Selya, and Thompson,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Luis A. Guzmán Dupont on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivison, and Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                               June 28, 2011\n\f            Per Curiam. Casimiro Núñez Polanco (\"Núñez\") appeals his\n\nconviction for aggravated identity theft, claiming insufficient\n\nevidence.     He also seeks to set aside his 24-month sentence,\n\nclaiming he is entitled to a reduced offense level and a downward\n\ndeparture. We find no merit in his arguments and summarily affirm.\n\n            A grand jury returned a three-count indictment against\n\nNúñez based on his sale of official identification documents.\n\nNúñez pled guilty to two counts but took the third — aggravated\n\nidentity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1) — to trial.\n\nA jury found him guilty.    At sentencing, he sought a reduction in\n\noffense level for acceptance of responsibility because he had\n\nadmitted two of the three counts.      See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.   He also\n\nsought a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances.\n\nSee United States v. Roselli, 366 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.6.    The district court rejected both requests and\n\nimposed a sentence of 15 months for the admitted counts and a\n\nconsecutive term of 24 months for aggravated identity theft.\n\n            On appeal, Núñez first claims there is insufficient\n\nevidence to uphold his conviction.      Specifically, \"§ 1028A(a)(1)\n\nrequires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the\n\nmeans of identification at issue belonged to another person.\"\n\nFlores-Figueroa v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 1886, 1894 (2009).\n\nNúñez says that because he never directly told undercover officers\n\nhe knew the documents belonged to real people, the government did\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fnot   present     sufficient       evidence    to     prove    knowledge       under    §\n\n1028A(a)(1).\n\n            We    review     the    sufficiency       of   the      evidence    for    a\n\nconviction   de     novo,    viewing    the    evidence       \"in   the   light   most\n\nflattering to the jury's guilty verdict [and] assess[ing] whether\n\na reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"               United States v. Rodríguez-\n\nLozada, 558 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Our role is not \"to weigh the evidence; [it] is merely\n\nto ensure that some evidence exists to support sufficiently the\n\njury's determination.\"         Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Although Núñez never explicitly declared that he knew the\n\ndocuments belonged to real people, the jury could reasonably have\n\ninferred knowledge from circumstantial evidence.                    United States v.\n\nCardales-Luna, 632 F.3d 731, 732 (1st Cir. 2011).                     Specifically,\n\nNúñez made recorded statements to undercover officers from which\n\nhis knowledge could be inferred.              First, he told an officer that\n\nthere would be no problem obtaining credit cards or benefits with\n\nthe identification documents, suggesting that they reflected actual\n\nidentities that would stand up to credit checks and government\n\nscrutiny.        Second,    when    referring    to    a   birth     certificate       he\n\nprovided to an officer, he stated, \"I'm telling you that that's a\n\ngood one.    This is my business.             I know. . . . I'm not going to\n\nbring you something bad.           This is what I do for a living.\"             Third,\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fhe told an officer that users of the identification documents\n\nshould memorize the data on the documents to \"become that person\"\n\nin   order    to   live   as   a   United    States   citizen.     Given   these\n\nstatements, we find that the jury reasonably inferred the requisite\n\nknowledge needed to convict under § 1028A(a)(1).1\n\n              Next, we find that the district court did not err by\n\ndenying      Núñez    a   reduced    offense     level   for     acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.       \"We review a sentencing court's determination of\n\nwhether a defendant accepted responsibility for clear error,\" and\n\ngive   that    determination       \"great    respect.\"     United    States   v.\n\nGarrasteguy, 559 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v.\n\nRoyer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              Proceeding to trial creates a rebuttable presumption that\n\nthe defendant did not accept responsibility and is not entitled to\n\na reduction.       Garrasteguy, 559 F.3d at 38-39.       Núñez fails to offer\n\nany sufficient basis to rebut this presumption.                  Moreover, the\n\ndistrict court actually held that Núñez \"knew from day one that he\n\nwas doing something that involved real people\" but took the issue\n\nto trial anyway; \"[t]herefore, he's not accepted responsibility.\"\n\nAlthough Núñez pled guilty to two other counts, the district court\n\ndid not clearly err in finding no acceptance of responsibility for\n\naggravated identity theft.\n\n\n1\n  Núñez's pointing to evidence that could have supported a finding\nof no knowledge is irrelevant. The question is whether there is an\nevidentiary basis for the jury's finding, and there is.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            Finally, there is no merit to Núñez's argument that the\n\ndistrict    court   erred   by   denying   a   downward    departure   for\n\nexceptional family circumstances.          We review this denial for\n\nreasonableness, equivalent to an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nUnited States v. Anonymous Defendant, 629 F.3d 68, 73-74 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).     Downward departures for exceptional family circumstances\n\nare rare; they are only appropriate if the defendant provides\n\n\"irreplacable or otherwise extraordinary\" care.           United States v.\n\nRoselli, 366 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Núñez's circumstances — specifically the needs of his\n\nyoung, disabled son — are unfortunate but not extraordinary, and\n\nhis son remains in the care of his wife.       Therefore, the court was\n\nwithin its discretion to deny the downward departure.2\n\n            For these reasons, we summarily affirm Núñez's conviction\n\nand sentence.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The government argues that we cannot review the discretionary\ndenial of a downward departure, but our recent decision in United\nStates v. Anonymous Defendant, 629 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2010) provides\notherwise. See also United States v. Battle, 637 F.3d 44, 52 (1st\nCir. 2011) (\"A district court's discretionary decision not to\ndepart from the Guidelines is reviewed for reasonableness.\").\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
