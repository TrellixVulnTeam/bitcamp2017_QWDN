García, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Senior Appellate Attorney In\nCharge, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 25, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.          Orlando Ortiz-Cintrón and his\n\nparents, Francisco Ortiz-Zayas and Hilda Cintrón-Ramos, pled guilty\n\nin the summer of 2003 to conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine\n\nbase   with    the   intent   to     distribute,   21   U.S.C.   §§   841(a)(1),\n\n(b)(1)(A), 846 (2000), and certain of their property was ordered\n\nforfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853 (2000).                    The defendants\n\nappeal, contesting the forfeitures and, in the case of Ortiz-Zayas,\n\nthe guilty plea as well.\n\n              It   appears    that     the    leading   participants    in   the\n\nconspiracy were Ortiz-Cintrón and his two brothers and that other\n\nfamily members, including the parents, were involved in lesser\n\nroles. Carmen Cruz-Aviles, married to one of the sons, pled guilty\n\nand gave testimony at the forfeiture hearing about the scope and\n\noperation of the conspiracy, which was conducted from more than one\n\nlocation over an extensive period of time.\n\n              We begin with the forfeitures.        Under section 853, which\n\ngoverns criminal forfeiture in drug cases, the convicted defendant\n\nforfeits      \"any property . . . derived from[] any proceeds the\n\nperson obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such\n\nviolation [of the drug laws]; [and] . . . any of the person's\n\nproperty used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to\n\ncommit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation . . . .\"\n\n              The guilty plea agreements left the matter of forfeiture\n\nto be determined by the district judge.            The judge held hearings in\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fDecember       2003,   heard   evidence      and   ordered    forfeiture    of    two\n\nproperties located in Aibonito, Puerto Rico: \"Bella Vista,\" owned\n\nby Ortiz-Cintrón and his wife, Ivelisse Figueroa-Chacon, on the\n\nground that it had been used for drug activities and purchased with\n\ndrug       proceeds,   and   \"San   Luis,\"    belonging      to    Ortiz-Zayas    and\n\nCintrón-Ramos, as having been used for drug activities.\n\n               On this appeal, Ortiz-Cintrón claims that the evidence\n\ndid not establish a sufficient connection between Bella Vista and\n\nthe offense.        His mother, Cintrón-Ramos, argues that she and her\n\nhusband were ignorant of any use of San Luis in connection with\n\ndrug dealing.          The district court's findings were made by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence;1 our review of such findings                       are\n\nfor clear error, United States v. Iacaboni, 363 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied 543 U.S. 978 (2004).\n\n               Bella Vista was the residence of Ortiz-Cintrón and his\n\nwife (who also pled guilty to drug charges).                      At the forfeiture\n\nhearing, the government offered testimony of DEA Special Agent\n\nMelendez      and   cooperating     defendant      Cruz-Aviles,      together    with\n\nrecordings of telephone calls, to show that members of the drug\n\nconspiracy co-headed by Ortiz-Cintrón used the property both to\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Although the forfeiture occurs in a criminal proceeding\nincident to the defendant's conviction, the statute makes the\nforfeiture an aspect of the penalty.      21 U.S.C. § 853(a); see\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 39 (1995); United States v.\nKeene, 341 F.3d 78, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fpackage drugs and store drug money and for telephone calls relating\n\nto the drug conspiracy.\n\n             Ortiz-Cintrón's brief offers no colorable reason why this\n\nshowing was insufficient to support a finding that the property had\n\nbeen used to facilitate drug dealing.          There was some impeachment\n\nof the government witnesses and several of the telephone calls were\n\ncryptic; but the government offered first-hand testimony of use of\n\nthe property by the conspirators for drug activities, and the\n\ndistrict judge was fully entitled to credit the witnesses.            United\n\nStates v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 774 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\n\ndenied, 517 U.S. 1105 (1996).\n\n             The district court made an alternative finding that Bella\n\nVista had been purchased with drug proceeds, relying in part on\n\ntestimony from Cruz-Aviles that Ortiz-Cintrón had paid $90,000 in\n\ncash   for   the   property.   See     21   U.S.C.   §   853(d)   (rebuttable\n\npresumption).       This   testimony    contradicts      statements   in   the\n\nproperty deed as to amounts paid, and Ortiz-Cintrón claims that the\n\nfinding therefore fails to give full faith and credit to public\n\nrecords.     See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§ 1738-39 (2000).\n\n             It is not clear that the district court would be bound to\n\ntreat as conclusive the recitations in a property deed.             Nor is it\n\nlikely that the discrepancy in amount between the testimony and the\n\ndeed mattered to the result (Ortiz-Cintrón reported no legitimate\n\nincome in the period of the purchase).          Anyway, given the use of\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthe   property   for    drug    dealing,     the    alternative       ground   for\n\nforfeiture based on proceeds need not be considered.\n\n            The forfeiture of the San Luis property--the residence of\n\nCintrón-Ramos    and    Ortiz-Zayas--is      more    complicated.         Despite\n\nCintrón-Ramos' claim to the contrary, the finding that the property\n\nwas used by the conspiracy was supported. Agent Melendez testified\n\nthat San Luis was used to store and package drugs and that drug-\n\nrelated telephone calls were made to the property, including a call\n\nto the property by Cintrón-Ramos herself. The agent also testified\n\nthat Cintrón-Ramos' husband had admitted to seeing others packaging\n\ndrugs at the property.\n\n            Cintrón-Ramos argues that the agent did not have personal\n\nknowledge   of   packaging     on   the   premises    but    relied    only    upon\n\ninferences (e.g., from telephone calls)--a claim to which the\n\ngovernment does not trouble to respond.                But Cruz-Aviles gave\n\ncorroborating testimony, saying that the property was used for\n\npackaging, and the district judge was entitled to credit her\n\ntestimony (and draw inferences as well from the evidence of phone\n\ncalls).\n\n            Cintrón-Ramos' more interesting claim is that she and her\n\nhusband worked long hours every day at a family business located\n\nelsewhere and had no personal knowledge that the conspiracy used\n\nSan Luis for drug activities.         The guilty pleas of Cintrón-Ramos\n\nand   her   husband    established    that    they    were    members     of    the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconspiracy but the evidence also showed that the house was commonly\n\nleft open during the day so family members could visit Ortiz-Zayas'\n\nelderly mother who lived at the house.\n\n            This argument is not seriously developed on appeal: there\n\nare only a few brief references to the point in Cintrón-Ramos'\n\nbrief, none in her husband's brief, no discussion of the relevant\n\nlaw, and none about the government's evidence-–limited though it\n\nmay have been--suggesting personal knowledge by her and her husband\n\npertaining to the use of the house for drug related activities.\n\n            This may explain, although it does not excuse, the\n\ngovernment's failure to address seriously what, if adequately\n\ndeveloped, might be Cintrón-Ramos' most legally promising and\n\nfactually   sympathetic   argument.    The   district   judge   made   no\n\nspecific finding as to the parents' knowledge of the use of their\n\nproperty or whether the use of it for drug activity was foreseeable\n\n(although defendants' argument in the district court may not have\n\nbeen framed in these terms).\n\n            Nothing in our case law says that personal knowledge of\n\nthe property's use is required where the defendant is guilty of the\n\noffense; some decisions suggest that, at most, the use of the\n\nproperty must be foreseeable.2     The government says tersely that\n\n\n     2\n      United States v. Colon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 103 (1st Cir.\n2004); United States v. White, 116 F.3d 948, 951-52 (1st Cir.\n1997); United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir. 1995),\ncert. denied sub nom, 517 U.S. 1105 (1996); United States v. McHan,\n101 F.3d 1027, 1043 (4th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1281\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe statute by its terms requires only that the defendant must be\n\nguilty of drug dealing and that the property be used to facilitate\n\nthe offense.   Neither side attempts to establish, through case law\n\nor argument, their respective legal positions–-a problem ordinarily\n\nfatal to an appellant seeking to overturn a result.\n\n            We have latitude, rarely indulged, to notice an error not\n\nseriously   developed    on     the    appeal.   For   this,   there   is    no\n\nmechanical test, such as the plain error formula used where a claim\n\nwas not properly preserved in the district court but is at least\n\nadequately developed in the appellant's brief on appeal.                    Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-37 (1993).              Where the\n\nlatter condition is not met, the argument against review is even\n\nstronger.\n\n            The question what legal rule should apply is debatable\n\nand   not   briefed.     Even     an    intermediate   standard    such      as\n\nforeseeability–-probably the best Cintrón-Ramos could expect--would\n\nbe unlikely to produce an outcome in her favor: there is some\n\nevidence of actual knowledge by her and her husband.           Even without\n\nthat, a finding of foreseeability on remand would be easy and\n\nperhaps likely, if not compelled.\n\n            Several    other    arguments    against   the   forfeiture     are\n\nadequately developed but they are without merit.               Both parents\n\n\n(1997); United States v. Benevento, 836 F.2d 129, 130 (2d Cir.\n1988) (per curiam). See also U.S.S.G. §1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fargue that the forfeiture is an excessive fine in violation of the\n\nEighth Amendment.           The question is whether the fine is \"grossly\n\ndisproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 334 (1998).                Our review is de\n\nnovo,    with    deference     given   to     the   district   court's    factual\n\nfindings.       Id. at 336 & n.10.\n\n               Judged by the criteria used in the case law, this is not\n\neven arguably an excessive fine.              Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 337-40;\n\nUnited States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 2005).                   The\n\nparents' equity in the house is about $33,000; the parents both\n\npled to drug dealing in amounts that could easily have produced a\n\nmuch larger fine;3 and the house was used to facilitate drug\n\ndealing, regarded by Congress as a very serious crime with a\n\ncomparably expansive forfeiture statute.\n\n               The parents argue that the wholesale value of the drugs\n\nto which they directly admitted was less than their equity in the\n\nhouse.    No cited authority treats that as the ceiling for a lawful\n\nfine,    nor    can   the   parents    plausibly     have   believed     that   the\n\nconspiracy was limited to what they personally admitted.                   As for\n\nthe claim of hardship, the Attorney General may choose to remit a\n\nforfeiture on that ground but that is up to him.               See 19 U.S.C. §\n\n1618, 21 U.S.C. § 853(j), 21 U.S.C. § 881(d).\n\n\n     3\n      The statute and sentencing guidelines authorize a maximum\nfine of $1 million for each defendant. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C);\nU.S.S.G. §5E1.2(c)(4) (2002).\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           Ortiz-Zayas says that he was entitled to a jury trial on\n\nthe forfeiture issue under the Sixth Amendment, as construed in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).   In the district court, he agreed\n\nexpressly to have the issue decided by the judge.      Even without\n\nwaiver, we would be bound--unless and until it is overruled by the\n\nSupreme Court--by Libretti, 516 U.S. at 49, holding that the Sixth\n\nAmendment does not apply to \"criminal forfeiture as an aspect of\n\nsentencing.\"\n\n           Finally, shifting attention from the forfeiture to the\n\nguilty plea itself, Ortiz-Zayas says that the district court erred\n\nin accepting his plea.    Because Ortiz-Zayas did not move in the\n\ndistrict court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Cruz-Rivera, 357 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   In this case, there was no error at all.\n\n           Ortiz-Zayas agrees that his original plea may have been\n\nproperly conducted; he explicitly pled guilty to participating in\n\nthe conspiracy after the ordinary colloquy.    But, he says, later\n\nevidence developed in connection with the sentencing and forfeiture\n\nshowed that his only tie to the conspiracy was a failure to report\n\nhis sons to the police after learning that they were engaged in\n\ndrug dealing.   This recitation does not square with the facts.\n\n           Ortiz-Zayas' plea agreement concedes that he participated\n\nin several specific phone calls relating to drug activities and the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fpre-sentence report describes him not merely as keeping silent but\n\nas admitting to the probation officer that he advised his sons when\n\nthe police were around.   We have no reason to think that his guilty\n\nplea was unsupported.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

The guilty pleas of Cintr&#243;n-Ramos and her husband established that they were members of the conspiracy but the evidence also showed that the house was commonly left open during the day so family members could visit Ortiz-Zayas' elderly mother who lived at the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not seriously developed on appeal: there are only a few brief references to the point in Cintr&#243;n-Ramos' brief, none in her husband's brief, no discussion of the relevant law, and none about the government's evidence &#8212; limited though it may have been &#8212; suggesting personal knowledge by her and her husband pertaining to the use of the house for drug related activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This may explain, although it does not excuse, the government's failure to address seriously what, if adequately developed, might be Cintr&#243;n-Ramos' most legally promising and factually sympathetic argument. The district judge made no specific finding as to the parents' knowledge of the use of their property or whether the use of it for drug activity was foreseeable (although defendants' argument in the district court may not have been framed in these terms).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in our case law says that personal knowledge of the property's use is required where the defendant is guilty of the offense; some decisions suggest that, at most, the use of the property must be foreseeable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government says tersely that the statute by its terms requires only that the defendant must be guilty of drug dealing and that the property be used to facilitate the offense. Neither side attempts to establish, through case law or argument, their respective legal positions &#8212; a problem ordinarily fatal to an appellant seeking to overturn a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have latitude, rarely indulged, to notice an error not seriously developed on the appeal. For this, there is no mechanical test, such as the plain error formula used where a claim was not properly preserved in the district court but is at least adequately developed in the appellant's brief on appeal. <i>Cf. United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Where the latter condition is not met, the argument against review is even stronger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question what legal rule should apply is debatable and not briefed. Even an intermediate standard such as foreseeability &#8212; probably the best Cintr&#243;n-Ramos could expect &#8212; would be unlikely to produce an outcome in her favor: there is some evidence of actual knowledge by her and her husband. Even without that, a finding of foreseeability on remand would be easy and perhaps likely, if not compelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other arguments against the forfeiture are adequately developed but they are without merit. Both parents argue that the forfeiture is an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The question is whether the fine is \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense.\" <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. 321, 334, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). Our review is <i>de novo,</i> with deference given to the district court's factual findings. <i>Id.</i> at 336 &amp; n. 10, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judged by the criteria used in the case law, this is not even arguably an excessive fine. <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 337-40, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir.2005). The parents' equity in the house is about $33,000; the parents both pled to drug dealing in amounts that could easily have produced a much larger fine;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the house was used to facilitate drug dealing, regarded by Congress as a very serious crime with a comparably expansive forfeiture statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents argue that the wholesale value of the drugs to which they directly admitted was less than their equity in the house. No cited authority treats that as the ceiling for a lawful fine, nor can the parents plausibly have believed that the conspiracy was limited to what they personally admitted. As for the claim of hardship, the Attorney General may choose to remit a forfeiture on that ground but that is up to him. <i>See</i> 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1618, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(j), 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Zayas says that he was entitled to a jury trial on the forfeiture issue under the Sixth Amendment, as construed in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In the district court, he agreed expressly to have the issue decided by the judge. Even without waiver, we would be bound &#8212; unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court &#8212; by <i>Libretti,</i> 516 U.S. at 49, 116 S.Ct. 356, holding that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to \"criminal forfeiture as an aspect of sentencing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, shifting attention from the forfeiture to the guilty plea itself, Ortiz-Zayas says that the district court erred in accepting his plea. Because Ortiz-Zayas did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir.2004). In this case, there was no error at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Zayas agrees that his original plea may have been properly conducted; he explicitly pled guilty to participating in the conspiracy after the ordinary colloquy. But, he says, <i>later</i> evidence developed in connection with the sentencing and forfeiture showed that his only tie to the conspiracy was a failure to report his sons to the police after learning that they were engaged in drug dealing. This recitation does not square with the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Zayas' plea agreement concedes that he participated in several specific phone calls relating to drug activities and the pre-sentence report describes him not merely as keeping silent but as admitting to the probation officer that he advised his sons when the police were around. We have no reason to think that his guilty plea was unsupported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the forfeiture occurs in a criminal proceeding incident to the defendant's conviction, the statute makes the forfeiture an aspect of the penalty. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a);<i>see Libretti v.

Under section 853, which governs criminal forfeiture in drug cases, the convicted defendant forfeits \"any property . . . derived from[] any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation [of the drug laws]; [and] . . . any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guilty plea agreements left the matter of forfeiture to be determined by the district judge. The judge held hearings in December 2003, heard evidence and ordered forfeiture of two properties located in Aibonito, Puerto Rico: \"Bella Vista,\" owned by Ortiz-Cintr&#243;n and his wife, Ivelisse Figueroa-Chacon, on the ground that it had been used for drug activities and purchased with drug proceeds, and \"San Luis,\" belonging to Ortiz-Zayas and Cintr&#243;n-Ramos, as having been used for drug activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Ortiz-Cintr&#243;n claims that the evidence did not establish a sufficient connection between Bella Vista and the offense.

The district judge made no specific finding as to the parents' knowledge of the use of their property or whether the use of it for drug activity was foreseeable (although defendants' argument in the district court may not have been framed in these terms).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in our case law says that personal knowledge of the property's use is required where the defendant is guilty of the offense; some decisions suggest that, at most, the use of the property must be foreseeable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government says tersely that the statute by its terms requires only that the defendant must be guilty of drug dealing and that the property be used to facilitate the offense. Neither side attempts to establish, through case law or argument, their respective legal positions &#8212; a problem ordinarily fatal to an appellant seeking to overturn a result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have latitude, rarely indulged, to notice an error not seriously developed on the appeal. For this, there is no mechanical test, such as the plain error formula used where a claim was not properly preserved in the district court but is at least adequately developed in the appellant's brief on appeal. <i>Cf. United States v.

Even an intermediate standard such as foreseeability &#8212; probably the best Cintr&#243;n-Ramos could expect &#8212; would be unlikely to produce an outcome in her favor: there is some evidence of actual knowledge by her and her husband. Even without that, a finding of foreseeability on remand would be easy and perhaps likely, if not compelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other arguments against the forfeiture are adequately developed but they are without merit. Both parents argue that the forfeiture is an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The question is whether the fine is \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense.\" <i>United States v.

The parents' equity in the house is about $33,000; the parents both pled to drug dealing in amounts that could easily have produced a much larger fine;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and the house was used to facilitate drug dealing, regarded by Congress as a very serious crime with a comparably expansive forfeiture statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents argue that the wholesale value of the drugs to which they directly admitted was less than their equity in the house. No cited authority treats that as the ceiling for a lawful fine, nor can the parents plausibly have believed that the conspiracy was limited to what they personally admitted. As for the claim of hardship, the Attorney General may choose to remit a forfeiture on that ground but that is up to him. <i>See</i> 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1618, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(j), 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Zayas says that he was entitled to a jury trial on the forfeiture issue under the Sixth Amendment, as construed in <i>Apprendi v.

Even without waiver, we would be bound &#8212; unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court &#8212; by <i>Libretti,</i> 516 U.S. at 49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117979\"><a href=\"/opinion/117979/libretti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because Ortiz-Zayas did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2004).

But, he says, <i>later</i> evidence developed in connection with the sentencing and forfeiture showed that his only tie to the conspiracy was a failure to report his sons to the police after learning that they were engaged in drug dealing. This recitation does not square with the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Zayas' plea agreement concedes that he participated in several specific phone calls relating to drug activities and the pre-sentence report describes him not merely as keeping silent but as admitting to the probation officer that he advised his sons when the police were around.
