REID,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. William G. Young, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Owen S. Walker, with whom Elizabeth L. Prevett and the Federal\nDefender Office were on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Gary S. Katzmann, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nJ. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, Gerard T. Leone, Jr., First Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, and Timothy Q. Feeley and Colin Owyang, Assistant\nU.S. Attorneys, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 27, 2004\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge. On December 22, 2001, Richard Reid\n\ntried unsuccessfully to destroy American Airlines Flight 63 over\n\nthe Atlantic Ocean by detonating explosives hidden in his shoes.\n\nThe plane was diverted to Boston, where Reid was arrested.       On\n\nOctober 4, 2002, Reid pleaded guilty to eight terrorism-related\n\noffenses,1 and on January 30, 2003, he was sentenced to serve the\n\nremainder of his life in prison.     At the sentencing hearing, Reid\n\ndeclared his continuing allegiance to the terrorist Osama bin\n\nLaden, adding: \"I think I ought not apologize for my actions.   I am\n\nat war with your country . . . .\"       A few days later, Reid was\n\ntransferred from Massachusetts to a maximum security federal prison\n\nin Florence, Colorado (ADX Florence), where he remains today.\n\n          This interlocutory appeal2 concerns the conditions of\n\nReid's pre-sentence confinement. Reid contends that the government\n\nviolated his First Amendment rights by restricting his access to\n\n\n\n     1\n       Reid pleaded guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass\ndestruction, 18 U.S.C. § 2332a(a)(1); attempted homicide, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2332(b)(1); placing an explosive device on board an aircraft, 49\nU.S.C. § 46505; attempted murder, 49 U.S.C. § 46506(1) and 18\nU.S.C. § 1113; two counts of interfering with an airline flight\ncrew and attendants, 49 U.S.C. § 46504; attempted destruction of an\naircraft, 18 U.S.C. § 32(a); and using a destructive device during\nand in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The\nninth count in the indictment -- attempted wrecking of a mass\ntransportation vehicle, 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a) -- was dismissed by the\ndistrict court. See United States v. Reid, 206 F. Supp. 2d 132,\n142 (D. Mass. 2002).\n     2\n       Reid's challenge to his criminal conviction is the subject\nof a separate appeal to this court. See United States v. Reid, No.\n03-1198 (1st Cir. docketed Feb. 10, 2003).\n\n                               -2-\n\fnews media while he was detained in Massachusetts.          As a federal\n\nprisoner housed at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at\n\nCedar Junction, Reid was permitted to use funds from his prison\n\naccount to purchase a subscription to Time magazine.         Under a set\n\nof \"special administrative measures\" imposed on Reid by the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service (USMS) at the direction of the Attorney General,\n\nan FBI special agent removed the \"letters to the editor\" section\n\nfrom each issue of Time (the Time letters) before giving the\n\nmagazine to Reid.      The special agent also clipped two articles\n\nabout terrorism from the magazine and withheld them from Reid.\n\nReid petitioned the district court for access to the withheld\n\nmaterial on First Amendment grounds.      After a hearing on January\n\n21, 2003, the district court denied Reid's request.\n\n            We conclude this appeal has been overtaken by changes in\n\nthe   factual   and   legal   circumstances   of   Reid's   confinement.\n\nAlthough there remains a substantial dispute between the parties\n\nconcerning Reid's access to Time, we nonetheless dismiss the appeal\n\nunder the branch of the mootness doctrine barring courts from\n\ndeciding a case when no practical consequences would flow from the\n\ndecision.\n\n                                   I.\n\nA.    Special Administrative Measures\n\n            Reid challenges the \"special administrative measures\"\n\n(SAMs) that governed his confinement while in Massachusetts.         The\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fAttorney    General's      power    to   promulgate   SAMs    for   individual\n\nprisoners derives from 28 C.F.R. § 501.3 (\"Prevention of acts of\n\nviolence and terrorism\").          See Yousef v. Reno, 254 F.3d 1214, 1219\n\n(10th Cir. 2001).         That regulation permits the Attorney General,\n\nwho has plenary power over the management of federal prisons, see\n\n18 U.S.C. § 4001(b), to impose on any individual prisoner \"special\n\nadministrative measures that are reasonably necessary to protect\n\npersons against the risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"\n\n§ 501.3(a).    To impose such SAMs, the Attorney General or the head\n\nof any federal law enforcement or intelligence agency must certify\n\nthat, with respect to the prisoner in question,\n\n      there is a substantial risk that [the] prisoner's\n      communications or contacts with persons could result in\n      death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial\n      damage to property that would entail the risk of death or\n      serious bodily injury to persons.\n\nId.   Once authorized, SAMs may impose restrictions on the inmate's\n\nhousing or privileges, including\n\n      correspondence, visiting, interviews with representatives\n      of the news media, and use of the telephone, as is\n      reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk\n      of acts of violence or terrorism.\n\nId.   The affected prisoner must be notified of the SAMs and the\n\nbasis for their imposition.          § 501.3(b).\n\n            SAMs    are    not   indefinite    in   duration.       Before   the\n\nSeptember     11,   2001    terrorist      attacks,   the    risk   assessment\n\nunderlying a set of SAMs was deemed valid for 120 days; when that\n\nperiod expired, a new risk assessment had to be conducted before\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthe SAMs could be reimposed.           Yousef, 254 F.3d at 1219; United\n\nStates v. Johnson, 223 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2000).               After the\n\nSeptember 11 attacks, the Bureau of Prisons amended § 501.3 to\n\npermit SAMs to remain in force for up to a full year with the\n\napproval of the Attorney General.            § 501.3(c); see 66 Fed. Reg.\n\n55062, 55062 (Oct. 31, 2001).          The agency justified the extension\n\nby stating that the September 11 attacks had demonstrated \"beyond\n\nquestion\" that some terrorist conspiracies \"are carried out over a\n\nlong period--far in excess of 120 days.\"           66 Fed. Reg. at 55063.\n\nThough a     prisoner   might   have    limited   ability   to    assist   such\n\nefforts, the agency found, that fact \"do[es] not diminish the\n\nurgent need for law enforcement authorities to curb the inmate's\n\nability to participate in planning or facilitating those acts\n\nthrough communications with others within or outside the detention\n\nfacility.\"    Id.\n\nB.   SAMs Imposed on Reid\n\n           In February 2002, approximately two months after Flight\n\n63 landed in Boston, the Attorney General authorized the USMS to\n\nissue SAMs regulating Reid's pre-trial confinement.              Cf. 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 501.3(f) (allowing branches of the Justice Department other than\n\nthe Bureau of Prisons to issue SAMs for persons in their custody).\n\nAfter the district court objected to the initial version of Reid's\n\nSAMs, see United States v. Reid, 214 F. Supp. 2d 84, 92 (D. Mass.\n\n2002), a new version was issued on June 19, 2002.           It was under the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fJune 2002 SAMs that the USMS restricted Reid's access to Time\n\nmagazine.\n\n            The June 2002 SAMs purported to control all of Reid's\n\nwritten and recorded communications, including his receipt of\n\nwritten    materials.   Under   the   caption   \"Inmate   Communications\n\nProhibitions,\" the document provided:\n\n     The inmate is prohibited from passing or receiving any\n     written or recorded communications to or from any other\n     inmate, visitor, or anyone else except as outlined and\n     allowed by this document.\n\nThe SAMs then set forth detailed rules governing Reid's access to\n\nvisitors, telephone calls, and legal, consular, and non-legal mail.\n\nReid's Time subscription qualified as incoming non-legal mail:\n\n     (Non-legal/Non-consular) Mail - Any mail not clearly and\n     properly addressed to/from the inmate's attorney and\n     marked privileged, or consular mail (incoming or\n     outgoing):\n\n     i.     Copied - Shall be copied (including the surface of\n            the envelope) by the warden, or his/her designee,\n            of the facility in which the inmate is housed.\n\n     ii.    Forwarded - Shall be forwarded, in copy form, to\n            the location designated by the FBI.\n\n     ...\n\n     iv.    Mail Seizure - If outgoing/incoming mail is\n            determined by USMS or FBI to contain overt or\n            covert discussions of or requests for illegal\n            activities, the soliciting or encouraging of acts\n            of violence or terrorism, or actual or attempted\n            circumvention of SAM, the mail shall not be\n            delivered/forwarded. The inmate shall be notified\n            in writing of the seizure of any mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fThese were the only provisions in the June 2002 SAMs pertaining to\n\nReid's Time subscription.\n\nC.     Reid's Motions for Access to Time\n\n            Reid initially challenged these restrictions in June\n\n2002, when he indicated his intent to subscribe to Time and filed\n\na motion to prevent the government from interfering with the\n\nmagazine's delivery.        Because Reid had not yet subscribed to Time,\n\nhowever, the district court denied the motion as not ripe.\n\n            Reid actually began subscribing to Time in September\n\n2002.     Initially, it appears, the magazine was delivered to him\n\ncomplete and without undue delay.               Then, on October 30, the\n\ngovernment informed defense counsel that it had removed an article\n\nabout terrorism from Reid's October 21, 2002 issue of Time under\n\nthe \"Mail Seizure\" provision of the SAMs.            Reid tried to challenge\n\nthat    decision    through    administrative    channels,       cf.    28   C.F.R.\n\n§ 501.3(e) (providing that inmates subjected to SAMs may seek\n\nreview through an administrative process), but the government\n\nsuccessfully took the position that administrative remedies were\n\nunavailable    to   Reid,     apparently   because    he   had    not    yet   been\n\nsentenced.\n\n             Reid responded by filing a renewed motion in the district\n\ncourt to enjoin the government from interfering with his Time\n\nsubscription.       He argued that government's censorship of his\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsubscription violated his First Amendment rights. Reid also sought\n\npermission to purchase a radio, which was prohibited by the SAMs.\n\n              The government defended the SAMs and their application to\n\nReid's Time subscription and radio request as reasonably necessary\n\nfor   valid     penological    and    national         security     purposes.        The\n\ngovernment      justified    this    argument          in    part   by   reference   to\n\nmaterials filed under seal.           Certain outbound correspondence from\n\nReid had been seized during his confinement in Massachusetts.                        The\n\nsubstance of that correspondence is not at issue in this case; the\n\ngovernment      submitted     it     simply       to    substantiate       its    claim\n\n(articulated      in    public)     that    Reid       had    indeed     attempted    to\n\ncommunicate with others while in custody.3                      The government also\n\nemphasized that Reid is an admitted member of al Qaeda, a terrorist\n\norganization that, according to the government, trains its members\n\nto    exploit    \"innocent-looking\"          communications         to    relay   coded\n\nmessages to and from prison in the event of capture.\n\n              On January 2, 2003, the district court held a hearing on\n\nReid's motion.         As to the radio, the motion was denied, and Reid\n\nhas not appealed that decision.                  As to Time magazine, the court\n\ndenied Reid's motion as moot after the government offered to give\n\n\n      3\n       This sealed correspondence has not been made public. The\nnews media did appear at the January 21, 2003 hearing and move for\naccess to the materials, and the district court required the\ngovernment to submit an affidavit to support its assertion that\nnational   security    considerations   justified    keeping   the\ncorrespondence under seal. That was done, and on January 28, 2003,\nthe district court denied the motion.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fReid the only two Time articles it had yet seized under the SAMs.4\n\nThe court agreed to be available on short notice if the government\n\nfurther interfered with Reid's access to the magazine.\n\n          Approximately one week later, Reid filed another motion\n\nconcerning his Time subscription. He explained that the government\n\nhad informed him after the January 2 hearing that (1) all further\n\nissues of Time magazine would be held by the USMS for thirty days\n\nbefore delivery, with the possibility that some terrorism-related\n\nmaterials would be withheld longer or even permanently, and that\n\n(2) all letters to the editor would be removed and withheld\n\npermanently.      He    again    sought    to   enjoin   the    government     from\n\ninterfering with the complete and prompt delivery of the magazine.\n\n          A    new     hearing    was     scheduled   for      January   21.   The\n\ngovernment told the district court that withholding the Time\n\nletters was necessary to ensure that Time did not unwittingly\n\nbecome a vehicle for al Qaeda agents to convey coded messages to\n\nReid in prison.      The defense attacked that argument, pointing out\n\nthat Time publishes only 2-3% of the letters it receives and that\n\n\n     4\n       The first article that the government seized was from the\nOctober 21, 2002 issue of Time. Entitled \"Al-Qaeda: Alive and\nStarting to Kick Again,\" it described statements by Osama bin Laden\nand Ayman al-Zawahiri that were broadcast in early October 2002 on\nthe al-Jazeera television network. The second, entitled \"Why Can't\nWe Find Bin Laden?,\" appeared in the November 25, 2002 issue of\nTime. That article, too, discussed a recorded statement issued by\nbin Laden. The government voluntarily gave both articles to Reid\nafter the January 2, 2003 hearing, saying that delaying Reid's\naccess to that material for thirty days was sufficient for the\ngovernment's purposes.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fthose letters are subject to fact-checking and other editorial\n\ncontrol.   The government responded that deleting the letters was a\n\nreasonable    exercise   of   penological   discretion   under   the   SAMs\n\nbecause coded messages in the letters -- the possibility of which,\n\nthe government said, could not be ruled out completely -- might\n\nprovoke \"outbursts\" by Reid and might enable him to continue his\n\ncriminal activities through outgoing correspondence.\n\n             The district court expressed some skepticism about the\n\ngovernment's argument, observing:\n\n     Mr. Reid is a very tall individual. But he's not ten\n     feet tall. And this constant reiteration of we've got to\n     keep data away from him, we've got to keep his data out\n     of the hands of the public lest disaster befall,\n     respectfully, is wearing a bit thin.\n\nNevertheless, the court denied Reid's motion on the ground that the\n\nSAMs permitted the restriction:\n\n     I don't see any right that [Reid] has articulated to\n     receive Time Magazine that would overcome the appropriate\n     general concerns set forth in the SAMs. I've respected\n     the SAMs throughout. . . . And while I see nothing wrong\n     with letting him have Time Magazine . . . I see no right\n     for him to have Time Magazine.\n\nThe court added that it was persuaded to rule for the government in\n\npart because of Reid's \"ongoing intent\" to harm the United States:\n\n\"I make no bones about that.      This man shows an ongoing intent of\n\nhostility to the United States and I, I have that very much in\n\nmind.\"\n\n             Reid filed this interlocutory appeal on January 27, 2003.\n\nThree days later, on January 30, Reid was sentenced to life in\n\n                                   -10-\n\fprison, and on the following day he was committed to the custody of\n\nthe Bureau of Prisons (BOP).                On February 4, 2003, the BOP\n\ntransferred Reid from Massachusetts to ADX Florence, the maximum\n\nsecurity facility in Colorado where he will serve his sentence.\n\n                                       II.\n\n          On     appeal,   Reid      asks    this   court    to   decide   three\n\nquestions:      (i) whether the June 2002 SAMs were procedurally\n\ninvalid; (ii) whether those SAMs were unconstitutionally overbroad\n\nunder the First Amendment; and (iii) whether the USMS's withholding\n\nof the Time letters under the June 2002 SAMs violated Reid's First\n\nAmendment rights.     The government defends the SAMs but also urges\n\ndismissal on a variety of grounds, including (1) that this court\n\nlacks appellate jurisdiction over Reid's interlocutory appeal, and\n\n(2) that this appeal has been mooted by events after the district\n\ncourt denied Reid's motion, including the expiration of the June\n\n2002 SAMs and Reid's February 2003 transfer to ADX Florence.\n\n             For the reasons explained below, we conclude that Reid's\n\nappeal to this court is moot.           Accordingly, we do not reach the\n\ngovernment's challenge to our appellate jurisdiction.               See Ruhrgas\n\nAG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 584-85 (1999) (jurisdictional\n\nissues may     be   addressed   in    any    sequence);     cf. Arizonans   for\n\nOfficial English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 66-67 (1997) (court may\n\nassume without deciding that standing exists in order to analyze\n\nmootness).\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f           Article III prohibits federal courts from deciding \"moot\"\n\ncases or controversies –- that is, those in which \"the issues\n\npresented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally\n\ncognizable interest in the outcome.\"    United States Parole Comm'n\n\nv. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396 (1980) (quoting Powell v. McCormack,\n\n395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969)); Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance v.\n\nDaley, 292 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir. 2002).      Mootness problems may\n\narise at any point in a proceeding.     \"Even if an actual case or\n\ncontroversy exists at the inception of litigation, a case may be\n\nrendered moot (and, therefore, subject to dismissal) if changed\n\ncircumstances eliminate any possibility of effectual relief.\"   Me.\n\nSch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs. R., 321 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   That is because, under Article III, federal courts have no\n\nauthority to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of the\n\nlitigants before them.   Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S.\n\n472, 477 (1990) (citing North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246\n\n(1971)).\n\n           In lay terms, we recognize, it might be somewhat odd to\n\ndescribe Reid's claims in this case as \"moot.\"     Without a doubt,\n\nthere is a substantial and continuing dispute between Reid and the\n\ngovernment concerning his access to Time magazine.   The government\n\nstill has not turned over the Time letters that it seized; Reid\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fstill demands access to those letters.                  In that pragmatic sense,\n\nthe controversy remains \"live\" and the parties adverse.\n\n               The problem is that even if this court decided the\n\nquestions raised in Reid's appeal, the pragmatic dispute between\n\nthe parties would be unaffected.             That is because the factual and\n\nlegal     circumstances      surrounding       Reid's    case    have   changed   so\n\ndramatically that Reid no longer asserts an injury that is \"likely\n\nto   be   redressed     by    a    favorable    judicial     decision\"      in   this\n\nproceeding. Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998) (quoting Lewis,\n\n494 U.S. at 477).          Any opinion on the merits of Reid's appeal to\n\nthis court would be merely advisory.                    Accordingly, we have no\n\nchoice but to dismiss the case as moot.                 See Mangual, 317 F.3d at\n\n60 (\"If events have transpired to render a court opinion merely\n\nadvisory, Article III considerations require dismissal of the\n\ncase.\").\n\n               We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the\n\nJune    2002    SAMs   --    the   regulations     that     Reid    challenges    on\n\nconstitutional and procedural grounds -- are no longer in effect.\n\nBy regulation, those SAMs expired on June 19, 2003, one year after\n\ntheir adoption.        See 28 C.F.R. § 501.3(c).           No interest of Reid's\n\nwould be served by invalidating them now:                 the June 2002 SAMs no\n\nlonger determine his conditions of confinement, and there is no\n\nclaim     for    damages     (actual    or     nominal)    for     Reid's   alleged\n\ndeprivations while those SAMs were still in effect.                 Cf. Mr. & Mrs.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fR., 321 F.3d at 17 (changed circumstances do not moot claims for\n\nmoney damages).   As we observed in the Daley case, which similarly\n\ninvolved   an   attack   on   a   regulation   that   expired   while   the\n\nlitigation was pending, \"[t]his court has no means of redressing\n\neither procedural failures or substantive deficiencies associated\n\nwith a regulation that is now defunct.\"        292 F.3d at 88.\n\n           Moreover, the BOP has imposed on Reid a new set of SAMs,\n\neffective August 14, 2003, at the ADX Florence facility in Colorado\n\n(the Colorado SAMs).     Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, the Colorado SAMs\n\ncontain provisions specifically regulating Reid's access to the\n\nmass media.     The Time letters initially seized by the USMS in\n\nMassachusetts have been forwarded to ADX Florence, where the FBI\n\nhas seized them anew under the mass media provisions of the\n\nColorado SAMs.5   As a result, even an order from this court finding\n\n\n     5\n       In relevant part, the SAMs governing Reid's confinement at\nADX Florence provide:\n\n     Access to Mass Communications:\n     To prevent the inmate from receiving and acting upon\n     critically-timed information or information coded in a\n     potentially undetectable manner, the inmate's access to\n     materials of mass communication is restricted as follows:\n\n     a.    Periodicals/Newspapers -\n           ...\n           ii. Sections of the periodical/newspaper which\n                offer a forum for information to be passed by\n                unknown   and/or    unverified   individuals,\n                including but not limited to classified\n                advertisements and letters to the editor,\n                should      be     removed      from     the\n                periodicals/newspapers prior to distribution\n                to the inmate.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthat the June 2002 SAMs were unconstitutional would not result in\n\nReid's recovery of the seized Time letters.     The Colorado SAMs --\n\nthe only basis for the government's continued withholding of the\n\nTime letters -- are not before us.\n\n          Nor has Reid articulated any persuasive reason why this\n\ncourt should decide his appeal notwithstanding the expiration of\n\nthe June 2002 SAMs and his transfer to ADX Florence.     This is not\n\na case involving a defendant's property interest in something taken\n\nby the government -- defense counsel made clear at oral argument\n\nthat Reid is not interested in an order declaring that the Time\n\nletters are his property and must be returned to his family or to\n\nhis lawyer.   Cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (authorizing motions for\n\nthe return of seized property).\n\n          Rather, Reid contends that this appeal is not moot\n\nbecause a judgment from this court would assist him in future\n\nlitigation against BOP officials in Colorado.    We disagree.   This\n\nis not an appeal in a civil case; it is an interlocutory appeal\n\nfrom the denial of a motion in a criminal prosecution.      If Reid\n\nwere to prevail, his remedy would be simply the reversal of the\n\ndistrict court's January 21, 2003 order.      Plainly, the Colorado\n\nSAMs would not be affected by our reversal of that order, which was\n\npredicated on the now-expired June 2002 SAMs and which the district\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fcourt itself did not believe would apply beyond the date of\n\nsentencing.6\n\n          Even aside from the question of available remedies, a\n\nvictory for Reid in this appeal would not meaningfully assist him\n\nin challenging the conditions of his confinement at ADX Florence.7\n\nHis procedural challenge to the June 2002 SAMs obviously has no\n\nbearing on the validity of the Colorado SAMs, which were separately\n\npromulgated.   Likewise, even if Reid were to prevail in his\n\nsubstantive overbreadth challenge to the June 2002 SAMs, that would\n\nnot determine the constitutionality of the Colorado SAMs.   Reid's\n\noverbreadth argument is framed in terms of executive discretion:\n\nhe says that mail seizure provisions of the June 2002 SAMs gave the\n\nUSMS too much discretion to censor constitutionally protected\n\nspeech.   Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, however, the Colorado SAMs\n\nexpressly cabin the discretion of prison officials to deny Reid\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       During the January 21, 2003 hearing, the district court\nrecognized its limited ability to affect Reid's access to Time\nmagazine after sentencing: \"Understand that at most I'm thinking\nof the time between now and the imposition of sentence. . . . Once\nhe's sentenced I think that I would have little, if anything, to\nsay about it. But in the interim maybe I have something to say.\"\n     7\n       Of course, a favorable decision of any kind by this court\nmight be useful to Reid for its precedential value, but the mere\ndesire for a favorable precedent is not sufficient to prevent a\ncase from becoming moot. Bd. of Educ. v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ.,\n79 F.3d 654, 659 (7th Cir. 1996); United States v. Fischer, 833\nF.2d 647, 649 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n                               -16-\n\faccess to most mass media.8            So in any overbreadth attack on the\n\nColorado SAMs, the judicial inquiry will be materially different.\n\n          Nor would a victory for Reid in his as-applied challenge\n\nto the June 2002 SAMs likely bear fruit in Colorado.                         That is\n\nbecause the relevant legal question in any such First Amendment\n\nchallenge is whether the restrictions imposed are \"reasonably\n\nrelated   to        legitimate        penological     interests\"       under     the\n\ncircumstances.        Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413 (1989)\n\n(quoting Turner v. Safely, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)). If challenged,\n\nthe reasonableness of the Colorado SAMs would be evaluated against\n\nthe background of Reid's final conviction and sentence, not to\n\nmention the grave security considerations that attend the BOP's\n\nmanagement     of    one    of   the    nation's     highest      security    prison\n\nfacilities.9        See    id.   at    418   (one   factor   in    evaluating    the\n\nreasonableness of a prison restriction on incoming publications is\n\nthe effect that accommodating the asserted constitutional right\n\nwould have on order and security in the prison).                  A judgment from\n\nthis court invalidating the June 2002 SAMs, which were adopted in\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       The Colorado SAMs ensure Reid access to any \"publications\ndetermined not to facilitate criminal activity or be detrimental to\nnational security; the security, good order or discipline of the\ninstitution; or the protection of the public.\"\n     9\n       As the government noted at oral argument, Reid is not the\nonly convicted terrorist held at ADX Florence. See, e.g., Yousef\nv. Reno, 254 F.3d 1214, 1216-17 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                         -17-\n\fvery different circumstances, would not significantly assist that\n\ninquiry.\n\n           Nor does Reid's appeal come under the exception to the\n\nmootness doctrine for cases \"capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.\"   S. Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 514 (1911).\n\nThat doctrine applies only where two circumstances are present:\n\n\"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be\n\nfully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there\n\n[is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party\n\n[will] be subject to the same action again.\"     Spencer, 523 U.S. at\n\n17 (quoting Lewis, 494 U.S. at 481); see also Daley, 292 F.3d at\n\n88-89.\n\n           If the problem in this case were simply that the one-year\n\nduration of the SAMs frustrated Reid's ability to obtain judicial\n\nreview, the capable-of-repetition exception might apply.10 But that\n\nis not the situation here.     The Colorado SAMs are not the \"same\n\naction\" as the June 2002 SAMs; on the contrary, they impose\n\nsubstantively   different   restrictions   and   reflect   new   factual\n\ndevelopments (i.e., Reid's conviction, sentencing, and transfer to\n\na different prison facility).    The June 2002 SAMs themselves are\n\nnot reasonably likely to be repeated.      Under these circumstances,\n\n\n\n     10\n       But see Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance v. Daley, 292\nF.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir. 2002) (plaintiff failed to show that fishing\nregulations, though effective for only one year, could not be fully\nlitigated within that time frame).\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe capable-of-repetition exception is unavailable. See Daley, 292\n\nF.3d at 90 (new regulation was not the \"same action\" for purposes\n\nof the capable-of-repetition doctrine because the new regulation\n\nwas different in scope and based on new factual developments).\n\n          In sum, the factual and legal boundaries of the parties'\n\ndispute have changed so completely since the district court's\n\nJanuary 21, 2003 order that any decision by this court on the\n\nissues raised in Reid's appeal would be essentially irrelevant.\n\nReid may still be aggrieved by the government's conduct, but as to\n\nthe district court order that is the subject of this appeal, Reid\n\nlacks \"a particularized, concrete stake that would be affected by\n\nour judgment.\"    Lewis, 494 U.S. at 479.       Accordingly, this appeal\n\nis moot and must be dismissed.     See id.; Mangual, 317 F.3d at 60;\n\nDaley, 292 F.3d at 88.\n\n          If   Reid   still   wishes   to   challenge   the   government's\n\ncontinued withholding of the Time letters, he may do so by whatever\n\nprocedures are available to him in Colorado, including any required\n\nadministrative   review.      Cf. 42   U.S.C.    §   1997e(a);   28   C.F.R.\n\n§ 501.3(e).    Although Reid has expressed concern that the outcome\n\nof the present litigation may somehow prejudice him should he\n\nchoose to file a new action in Colorado, we see no prejudice.            Our\n\nmootness holding depends on our conclusion that the June 2002 SAMs\n\nhave expired and have no continuing effect.           And to ensure that\n\nReid suffers no adverse consequences from the district court's\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fJanuary 21, 2003 order, we will vacate it.   See United States v.\n\nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39-41 (1950) (noting that the\n\nstandard practice in cases that become moot on appeal is to vacate\n\nthe judgment below).\n\n                                  III.\n\n          The appeal is dismissed and the district court order\n\nbelow is vacated.

The plane was diverted to Boston, where Reid was arrested. On October 4, 2002, Reid pleaded guilty to eight terrorism-related offenses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and on January 30, 2003, he was sentenced to serve the remainder of his life in prison. At the sentencing hearing, Reid declared his continuing allegiance to the terrorist Osama bin Laden, adding: \"I think I ought not apologize for my actions. I am at war with your country....\" A few days later, Reid was transferred from Massachusetts to a maximum security federal prison in Florence, Colorado (ADX Florence), where he remains today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interlocutory appeal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> concerns the conditions of Reid's pre-sentence confinement. Reid contends that the government violated his First Amendment rights by restricting his access to news media while he was detained in Massachusetts. As a federal prisoner housed at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Cedar Junction, Reid was permitted to use funds from his prison account to purchase a subscription to <i>Time</i> magazine. Under a set of \"special administrative measures\" imposed on Reid by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) at the direction of the Attorney General, an FBI special agent removed the \"letters to the editor\" section from each issue of <i>Time</i> (the <i>Time</i> letters) before giving the magazine to Reid. The special agent also clipped two articles about terrorism from the magazine and withheld them from Reid. Reid petitioned the district court for access to the withheld material on First Amendment grounds. After a hearing on January 21, 2003, the district court denied Reid's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude this appeal has been overtaken by changes in the factual and legal circumstances of Reid's confinement. Although there remains a substantial dispute between the parties concerning Reid's access to <i>Time,</i> we nonetheless dismiss the appeal under the branch of the mootness doctrine barring courts from deciding a case when no practical consequences would flow from the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Special Administrative Measures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid challenges the \"special administrative measures\" (SAMs) that governed his confinement while in Massachusetts. The Attorney General's power to promulgate SAMs for individual prisoners derives from 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3 (\"Prevention of acts of violence and terrorism\"). <i>See Yousef v. Reno,</i> 254 F.3d 1214, 1219 (10th Cir.2001). That regulation permits the Attorney General, who has plenary power over the management of federal prisons, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4001(b), to impose on any individual prisoner \"special administrative measures that are reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of death or serious bodily injury.\" &#167; 501.3(a). To impose such SAMs, the Attorney General or the head of any federal law enforcement or intelligence agency must certify that, with respect to the prisoner in question,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there is a substantial risk that [the] prisoner's communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Once authorized, SAMs may impose restrictions on the inmate's housing or privileges, including</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">correspondence, visiting, interviews with representatives of the news media, and use of the telephone, as is reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of acts of violence or terrorism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The affected prisoner must be notified of the SAMs and the basis for their imposition. &#167; 501.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SAMs are not indefinite in duration. Before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the risk assessment underlying a set of SAMs was deemed valid for 120 days; when that period expired, a new risk assessment had to be conducted before the SAMs could be reimposed. <i>Yousef,</i> 254 F.3d at 1219; <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 223 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir.2000). After the September 11 attacks, the Bureau of Prisons amended &#167; 501.3 to permit SAMs to remain in force for up to a full year with the approval of the Attorney General. &#167; 501.3(c); <i>see</i> 66 Fed.Reg. 55062, 55062 (Oct. 31, 2001). The agency justified the extension by stating that the September 11 attacks had demonstrated \"beyond question\" that some terrorist conspiracies \"are carried out over a long period &#8212; far in excess of 120 days.\" 66 Fed.Reg. at 55063. Though a prisoner might have limited ability to assist such efforts, the agency found, that fact \"do[es] not diminish the urgent need for law enforcement authorities to curb the inmate's ability to participate in planning or facilitating those acts through communications with others within or outside the detention facility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. SAMs Imposed on Reid</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2002, approximately two months after Flight 63 landed in Boston, the Attorney General authorized the USMS to issue SAMs regulating Reid's pre-trial confinement. <i>Cf.</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(f) (allowing branches of the Justice Department other than the Bureau of Prisons to issue SAMs for persons in their custody). After the district court objected to the initial version of Reid's SAMs, <i>see United States v. Reid,</i> 214 F.Supp.2d 84, 92 (D.Mass.2002), a new version was issued on June 19, 2002. It was under the June 2002 SAMs that the USMS restricted Reid's access to <i>Time</i> magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The June 2002 SAMs purported to control all of Reid's written and recorded communications, including his receipt of written materials. Under the caption \"Inmate Communications Prohibitions,\" the document provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inmate is prohibited from passing or receiving any written or recorded communications to or from any other inmate, visitor, or anyone else except as outlined and allowed by this document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SAMs then set forth detailed rules governing Reid's access to visitors, telephone calls, and legal, consular, and non-legal mail.

Then, on October 30, the government informed defense counsel that it had removed an article about terrorism from Reid's October 21, 2002 issue of <i>Time</i> under the \"Mail Seizure\" provision of the SAMs. Reid tried to challenge that decision through administrative channels, <i>cf.</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(e) (providing that inmates subjected to SAMs may seek review through an administrative process), but the government successfully took the position that administrative remedies were unavailable to Reid, apparently because he had not yet been sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid responded by filing a renewed motion in the district court to enjoin the government from interfering with his <i>Time</i> subscription. He argued that government's censorship of his subscription violated his First Amendment rights. Reid also sought permission to purchase a radio, which was prohibited by the SAMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government defended the SAMs and their application to Reid's <i>Time</i> subscription and radio request as reasonably necessary for valid penological and national security purposes. The government justified this argument in part by reference to materials filed under seal. Certain outbound correspondence from Reid had been seized during his confinement in Massachusetts. The substance of that correspondence is not at issue in this case; the government submitted it simply to substantiate its claim (articulated in public) that Reid had indeed attempted to communicate with others while in custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government also emphasized that Reid is an admitted member of al Qaeda, a terrorist organization that, according to the government, trains its members to exploit \"innocent-looking\" communications to relay coded messages to and from prison in the event of capture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2003, the district court held a hearing on Reid's motion. As to the radio, the motion was denied, and Reid has not appealed that decision. As to <i>Time</i> magazine, the court denied Reid's motion as moot after the government offered to give Reid the only two <i>Time</i> articles it had yet seized under the SAMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court agreed to be available on short notice if the government further interfered with Reid's access to the magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one week later, Reid filed another motion concerning his <i>Time</i> subscription. He explained that the government had informed him after the January 2 hearing that (1) all further issues of <i>Time</i> magazine would be held by the USMS for thirty days before delivery, with the possibility that some terrorism-related materials would be withheld longer or even permanently, and that (2) all letters to the editor would be removed and withheld permanently. He again sought to enjoin the government from interfering with the complete and prompt delivery of the magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new hearing was scheduled for January 21. The government told the district court that withholding the <i>Time</i> letters was necessary to ensure that <i>Time</i> did not unwittingly become a vehicle for al Qaeda agents to convey coded messages to Reid in prison. The defense attacked that argument, pointing out that <i>Time</i> publishes only 2-3% of the letters it receives and that those letters are subject to fact-checking and other editorial control. The government responded that deleting the letters was a reasonable exercise of penological discretion under the SAMs because coded messages in the letters &#8212; the possibility of which, the government said, could not be ruled out completely &#8212; might provoke \"outbursts\" by Reid and might enable him to continue his criminal activities through outgoing correspondence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressed some skepticism about the government's argument, observing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Reid is a very tall individual. But he's not ten feet tall. And this constant reiteration of we've got to keep data away from him, we've got to keep his data out of the hands of the public lest disaster befall, respectfully, is wearing a bit thin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court denied Reid's motion on the ground that the SAMs permitted the restriction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't see any right that [Reid] has articulated to receive Time Magazine that would overcome the appropriate general concerns set forth in the SAMs. I've respected the SAMs throughout.... And while I see nothing wrong with letting him have Time Magazine... I see no right for him to have Time Magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added that it was persuaded to rule for the government in part because of Reid's \"ongoing intent\" to harm the United States: \"I make no bones about that. This man shows an ongoing intent of hostility to the United States and I, I have that very much in mind.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid filed this interlocutory appeal on January 27, 2003. Three days later, on January 30, Reid was sentenced to life in prison, and on the following day he was committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). On February 4, 2003, the BOP transferred Reid from Massachusetts to ADX Florence, the maximum security facility in Colorado where he will serve his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Reid asks this court to decide three questions: (i) whether the June 2002 SAMs were procedurally invalid; (ii) whether those SAMs were unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment; and (iii) whether the USMS's withholding of the <i>Time</i> letters under the June 2002 SAMs violated Reid's First Amendment rights. The government defends the SAMs but also urges dismissal on a variety of grounds, including (1) that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Reid's interlocutory appeal, and (2) that this appeal has been mooted by events after the district court denied Reid's motion, including the expiration of the June 2002 SAMs and Reid's February 2003 transfer to ADX Florence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that Reid's appeal to this court is moot. Accordingly, we do not reach the government's challenge to our appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co.,</i> 526 U.S. 574, 584-85, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999) (jurisdictional issues may be addressed in any sequence); <i>cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,</i> 520 U.S. 43, 66-67, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997) (court may assume without deciding that standing exists in order to analyze mootness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III prohibits federal courts from deciding \"moot\" cases or controversies &#8212; that is, those in which \"the issues presented are no longer `live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\" <i>United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty,</i> 445 U.S. 388, 396, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980) (quoting <i>Powell v. McCormack,</i> 395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969)); <i>Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance v. Daley,</i> 292 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir.2002). Mootness problems may arise at any point in a proceeding. \"Even if an actual case or controversy exists at the inception of litigation, a case may be rendered moot (and, therefore, subject to dismissal) if changed circumstances eliminate any possibility of effectual relief.\" <i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir.2003). That is because, under Article III, federal courts have no authority to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of the litigants before them. <i>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp.,</i> 494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) (citing <i>North Carolina v. Rice,</i> 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In lay terms, we recognize, it might be somewhat odd to describe Reid's claims in this case as \"moot.\" Without a doubt, there is a substantial and continuing dispute between Reid and the government concerning his access to <i>Time</i> magazine. The government still has not turned over the <i>Time</i> letters that it seized; Reid still demands access to those letters. In that pragmatic sense, the controversy remains \"live\" and the parties adverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is that even if this court decided the questions raised in Reid's appeal, the pragmatic dispute between the parties would be unaffected. That is because the factual and legal circumstances surrounding Reid's case have changed so dramatically that Reid no longer asserts an injury that is \"likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision\" in this proceeding. <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249). Any opinion on the merits of Reid's appeal to this court would be merely advisory. Accordingly, we have no choice but to dismiss the case as moot. <i>See Mangual,</i> 317 F.3d at 60 (\"If events have transpired to render a court opinion merely advisory, Article III considerations require dismissal of the case.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the June 2002 SAMs &#8212; the regulations that Reid challenges on constitutional and procedural grounds &#8212; are no longer in effect. By regulation, those SAMs expired on June 19, 2003, one year after their adoption. <i>See</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(c). No interest of Reid's would be served by invalidating them now: the June 2002 SAMs no longer determine his conditions of confinement, and there is no claim for damages (actual or nominal) for Reid's alleged deprivations while those SAMs were still in effect. <i>Cf. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d at 17 (changed circumstances do not moot claims for money damages). As we observed in the <i>Daley</i> case, which similarly involved an attack on a regulation that expired while the litigation was pending, \"[t]his court has no means of redressing either procedural failures or substantive deficiencies associated with a regulation that is now defunct.\" 292 F.3d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the BOP has imposed on Reid a new set of SAMs, effective August 14, 2003, at the ADX Florence facility in Colorado (the Colorado SAMs). Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, the Colorado SAMs contain provisions specifically regulating Reid's access to the mass media. The <i>Time</i> letters initially seized by the USMS in Massachusetts have been forwarded to ADX Florence, where the FBI has seized them anew under the mass media provisions of the Colorado SAMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, even an order from this court finding that the June 2002 SAMs were unconstitutional would not result in Reid's recovery of the seized <i>Time</i> letters. The Colorado SAMs &#8212; the only basis for the government's continued withholding of the <i>Time</i> letters &#8212; are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Reid articulated any persuasive reason why this court should decide his appeal notwithstanding the expiration of the June 2002 SAMs and his transfer to ADX Florence. This is not a case involving a defendant's <i>property</i> interest in something taken by the government &#8212; defense counsel made clear at oral argument that Reid is not interested in an order declaring that the <i>Time</i> letters are his property and must be returned to his family or to his lawyer. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (authorizing motions for the return of seized property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Reid contends that this appeal is not moot because a judgment from this court would assist him in future litigation against BOP officials in Colorado. We disagree. This is not an appeal in a civil case; it is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion in a criminal prosecution. If Reid were to prevail, his remedy would be simply the reversal of the district court's January 21, 2003 order. Plainly, the Colorado SAMs would not be affected by our reversal of that order, which was predicated on the now-expired June 2002 SAMs and which the district court itself did not believe would apply beyond the date of sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even aside from the question of available remedies, a victory for Reid in this appeal would not meaningfully assist him in challenging the conditions of his confinement at ADX Florence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> His procedural challenge to the June 2002 SAMs obviously has no bearing on the validity of the Colorado SAMs, which were separately promulgated. Likewise, even if Reid were to prevail in his substantive overbreadth challenge to the June 2002 SAMs, that would not determine the constitutionality of the Colorado SAMs. Reid's overbreadth argument is framed in terms of executive discretion: he says that mail seizure provisions of the June 2002 SAMs gave the USMS too much discretion to censor constitutionally protected speech. Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, however, the Colorado SAMs expressly cabin the discretion of prison officials to deny Reid access to most mass media.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> So in any overbreadth attack on the Colorado SAMs, the judicial inquiry will be materially different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor would a victory for Reid in his as-applied challenge to the June 2002 SAMs likely bear fruit in Colorado. That is because the relevant legal question in any such First Amendment challenge is whether the restrictions imposed are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\" under the circumstances. <i>Thornburgh v. Abbott,</i> 490 U.S. 401, 413, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989) (quoting <i>Turner v. Safley,</i> 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). If challenged, the reasonableness of the Colorado SAMs would be evaluated against the background of Reid's final conviction and sentence, not to mention the grave security considerations that attend the BOP's management of one of the nation's highest security prison facilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See id.</i> at 418, 109 S.Ct. 1874 (one factor in evaluating the reasonableness of a prison restriction on incoming publications is the effect that accommodating the asserted constitutional right would have on order and security in the prison). A judgment from this court invalidating the June 2002 SAMs, which were adopted in very different circumstances, would not significantly assist that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does Reid's appeal come under the exception to the mootness doctrine for cases \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>S. Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC,</i> 219 U.S. 498, 514, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911). That doctrine applies only where two circumstances are present: \"(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subject to the same action again.\" <i>Spencer,</i> 523 U.S. at 17, 118 S.Ct. 978 (quoting <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 481, 110 S.Ct. 1249); <i>see also Daley,</i> 292 F.3d at 88-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the problem in this case were simply that the one-year duration of the SAMs frustrated Reid's ability to obtain judicial review, the capable-of-repetition exception might apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> But that is not the situation here. The Colorado SAMs are not the \"same action\" as the June 2002 SAMs; on the contrary, they impose substantively different restrictions and reflect new factual developments (<i>i.e.,</i> Reid's conviction, sentencing, and transfer to a different prison facility). The June 2002 SAMs themselves are not reasonably likely to be repeated. Under these circumstances, the capable-of-repetition exception is unavailable. <i>See Daley,</i> 292 F.3d at 90 (new regulation was not the \"same action\" for purposes of the capable-of-repetition doctrine because the new regulation was different in scope and based on new factual developments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the factual and legal boundaries of the parties' dispute have changed so completely since the district court's January 21, 2003 order that any decision by this court on the issues raised in Reid's appeal would be essentially irrelevant. Reid may still be aggrieved by the government's conduct, but as to the district court order that is the subject of this appeal, Reid lacks \"a particularized, concrete stake that would be affected by our judgment.\" <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 479, 110 S.Ct. 1249. Accordingly, this appeal is moot and must be dismissed. <i>See id.; Mangual,</i> 317 F.3d at 60; <i>Daley,</i> 292 F.3d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Reid still wishes to challenge the government's continued withholding of the <i>Time</i> letters, he may do so by whatever procedures are available to him in Colorado, including any required administrative review. <i>Cf.</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1997e(a); 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(e). Although Reid has expressed concern that the outcome of the present litigation may somehow prejudice him should he choose to file a new action in Colorado, we see no prejudice. Our mootness holding depends on our conclusion that the June 2002 SAMs have expired and have no continuing effect. And to ensure that Reid suffers no adverse consequences from the district court's January 21, 2003 order, we will vacate it. <i>See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,</i> 340 U.S. 36, 39-41, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950) (noting that the standard practice in cases that become moot on appeal is to vacate the judgment below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is <i>dismissed</i> and the district court order below is <i>vacated.

The plane was diverted to Boston, where Reid was arrested. On October 4, 2002, Reid pleaded guilty to eight terrorism-related offenses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and on January 30, 2003, he was sentenced to serve the remainder of his life in prison. At the sentencing hearing, Reid declared his continuing allegiance to the terrorist Osama bin Laden, adding: \"I think I ought not apologize for my actions. I am at war with your country....\" A few days later, Reid was transferred from Massachusetts to a maximum security federal prison in Florence, Colorado (ADX Florence), where he remains today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interlocutory appeal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> concerns the conditions of Reid's pre-sentence confinement. Reid contends that the government violated his First Amendment rights by restricting his access to news media while he was detained in Massachusetts. As a federal prisoner housed at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Cedar Junction, Reid was permitted to use funds from his prison account to purchase a subscription to <i>Time</i> magazine. Under a set of \"special administrative measures\" imposed on Reid by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) at the direction of the Attorney General, an FBI special agent removed the \"letters to the editor\" section from each issue of <i>Time</i> (the <i>Time</i> letters) before giving the magazine to Reid. The special agent also clipped two articles about terrorism from the magazine and withheld them from Reid. Reid petitioned the district court for access to the withheld material on First Amendment grounds. After a hearing on January 21, 2003, the district court denied Reid's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude this appeal has been overtaken by changes in the factual and legal circumstances of Reid's confinement. Although there remains a substantial dispute between the parties concerning Reid's access to <i>Time,</i> we nonetheless dismiss the appeal under the branch of the mootness doctrine barring courts from deciding a case when no practical consequences would flow from the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Special Administrative Measures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid challenges the \"special administrative measures\" (SAMs) that governed his confinement while in Massachusetts. The Attorney General's power to promulgate SAMs for individual prisoners derives from 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3 (\"Prevention of acts of violence and terrorism\"). <i>See Yousef v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161259\"><a href=\"/opinion/161259/yousef-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span>, 1219 (10th Cir.2001). That regulation permits the Attorney General, who has plenary power over the management of federal prisons, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4001(b), to impose on any individual prisoner \"special administrative measures that are reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of death or serious bodily injury.\" &#167; 501.3(a). To impose such SAMs, the Attorney General or the head of any federal law enforcement or intelligence agency must certify that, with respect to the prisoner in question,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">there is a substantial risk that [the] prisoner's communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Once authorized, SAMs may impose restrictions on the inmate's housing or privileges, including</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">correspondence, visiting, interviews with representatives of the news media, and use of the telephone, as is reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of acts of violence or terrorism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The affected prisoner must be notified of the SAMs and the basis for their imposition. &#167; 501.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SAMs are not indefinite in duration. Before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the risk assessment underlying a set of SAMs was deemed valid for 120 days; when that period expired, a new risk assessment had to be conducted before the SAMs could be reimposed. <i>Yousef,</i> 254 F.3d at 1219; <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770024\"><a href=\"/opinion/770024/united-states-v-darryl-lamont-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 672 (7th Cir.2000). After the September 11 attacks, the Bureau of Prisons amended &#167; 501.3 to permit SAMs to remain in force for up to a full year with the approval of the Attorney General. &#167; 501.3(c); <i>see</i> 66 Fed.Reg. 55062, 55062 (Oct. 31, 2001). The agency justified the extension by stating that the September 11 attacks had demonstrated \"beyond question\" that some terrorist conspiracies \"are carried out over a long period &#8212; far in excess of 120 days.\" 66 Fed.Reg. at 55063. Though a prisoner might have limited ability to assist such efforts, the agency found, that fact \"do[es] not diminish the urgent need for law enforcement authorities to curb the inmate's ability to participate in planning or facilitating those acts through communications with others within or outside the detention facility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. SAMs Imposed on Reid</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2002, approximately two months after Flight 63 landed in Boston, the Attorney General authorized the USMS to issue SAMs regulating Reid's pre-trial confinement. <i>Cf.</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(f) (allowing branches of the Justice Department other than the Bureau of Prisons to issue SAMs for persons in their custody). After the district court objected to the initial version of Reid's SAMs, <i>see United States v. Reid,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2439669\"><a href=\"/opinion/2439669/united-states-v-reid/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 92 (D.Mass.2002), a new version was issued on June 19, 2002. It was under the June 2002 SAMs that the USMS restricted Reid's access to <i>Time</i> magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The June 2002 SAMs purported to control all of Reid's written and recorded communications, including his receipt of written materials. Under the caption \"Inmate Communications Prohibitions,\" the document provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inmate is prohibited from passing or receiving any written or recorded communications to or from any other inmate, visitor, or anyone else except as outlined and allowed by this document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SAMs then set forth detailed rules governing Reid's access to visitors, telephone calls, and legal, consular, and non-legal mail. Reid's <i>Time</i> subscription qualified as incoming non-legal mail:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Non-legal/Non-consular) Mail &#8212; Any mail not clearly and properly addressed to/from the inmate's attorney and marked privileged, or consular mail (incoming or outgoing):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i.

Reid's Motions for Access to <i>Time</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid initially challenged these restrictions in June 2002, when he indicated his intent to subscribe to <i>Time</i> and filed a motion to prevent the government from interfering with the magazine's delivery. Because Reid had not yet subscribed to <i>Time,</i> however, the district court denied the motion as not ripe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid actually began subscribing to <i>Time</i> in September 2002. Initially, it appears, the magazine was delivered to him complete and without undue delay. Then, on October 30, the government informed defense counsel that it had removed an article about terrorism from Reid's October 21, 2002 issue of <i>Time</i> under the \"Mail Seizure\" provision of the SAMs. Reid tried to challenge that decision through administrative channels, <i>cf.</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(e) (providing that inmates subjected to SAMs may seek review through an administrative process), but the government successfully took the position that administrative remedies were unavailable to Reid, apparently because he had not yet been sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid responded by filing a renewed motion in the district court to enjoin the government from interfering with his <i>Time</i> subscription. He argued that government's censorship of his subscription violated his First Amendment rights. Reid also sought permission to purchase a radio, which was prohibited by the SAMs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government defended the SAMs and their application to Reid's <i>Time</i> subscription and radio request as reasonably necessary for valid penological and national security purposes. The government justified this argument in part by reference to materials filed under seal. Certain outbound correspondence from Reid had been seized during his confinement in Massachusetts. The substance of that correspondence is not at issue in this case; the government submitted it simply to substantiate its claim (articulated in public) that Reid had indeed attempted to communicate with others while in custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government also emphasized that Reid is an admitted member of al Qaeda, a terrorist organization that, according to the government, trains its members to exploit \"innocent-looking\" communications to relay coded messages to and from prison in the event of capture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2003, the district court held a hearing on Reid's motion. As to the radio, the motion was denied, and Reid has not appealed that decision. As to <i>Time</i> magazine, the court denied Reid's motion as moot after the government offered to give Reid the only two <i>Time</i> articles it had yet seized under the SAMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court agreed to be available on short notice if the government further interfered with Reid's access to the magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one week later, Reid filed another motion concerning his <i>Time</i> subscription. He explained that the government had informed him after the January 2 hearing that (1) all further issues of <i>Time</i> magazine would be held by the USMS for thirty days before delivery, with the possibility that some terrorism-related materials would be withheld longer or even permanently, and that (2) all letters to the editor would be removed and withheld permanently. He again sought to enjoin the government from interfering with the complete and prompt delivery of the magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new hearing was scheduled for January 21. The government told the district court that withholding the <i>Time</i> letters was necessary to ensure that <i>Time</i> did not unwittingly become a vehicle for al Qaeda agents to convey coded messages to Reid in prison. The defense attacked that argument, pointing out that <i>Time</i> publishes only 2-3% of the letters it receives and that those letters are subject to fact-checking and other editorial control. The government responded that deleting the letters was a reasonable exercise of penological discretion under the SAMs because coded messages in the letters &#8212; the possibility of which, the government said, could not be ruled out completely &#8212; might provoke \"outbursts\" by Reid and might enable him to continue his criminal activities through outgoing correspondence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressed some skepticism about the government's argument, observing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Reid is a very tall individual. But he's not ten feet tall. And this constant reiteration of we've got to keep data away from him, we've got to keep his data out of the hands of the public lest disaster befall, respectfully, is wearing a bit thin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court denied Reid's motion on the ground that the SAMs permitted the restriction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't see any right that [Reid] has articulated to receive Time Magazine that would overcome the appropriate general concerns set forth in the SAMs. I've respected the SAMs throughout.... And while I see nothing wrong with letting him have Time Magazine... I see no right for him to have Time Magazine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added that it was persuaded to rule for the government in part because of Reid's \"ongoing intent\" to harm the United States: \"I make no bones about that. This man shows an ongoing intent of hostility to the United States and I, I have that very much in mind.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reid filed this interlocutory appeal on January 27, 2003. Three days later, on January 30, Reid was sentenced to life in prison, and on the following day he was committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). On February 4, 2003, the BOP transferred Reid from Massachusetts to ADX Florence, the maximum security facility in Colorado where he will serve his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Reid asks this court to decide three questions: (i) whether the June 2002 SAMs were procedurally invalid; (ii) whether those SAMs were unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment; and (iii) whether the USMS's withholding of the <i>Time</i> letters under the June 2002 SAMs violated Reid's First Amendment rights. The government defends the SAMs but also urges dismissal on a variety of grounds, including (1) that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Reid's interlocutory appeal, and (2) that this appeal has been mooted by events after the district court denied Reid's motion, including the expiration of the June 2002 SAMs and Reid's February 2003 transfer to ADX Florence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that Reid's appeal to this court is moot. Accordingly, we do not reach the government's challenge to our appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Ruhrgas AG v.

The government still has not turned over the <i>Time</i> letters that it seized; Reid still demands access to those letters. In that pragmatic sense, the controversy remains \"live\" and the parties adverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem is that even if this court decided the questions raised in Reid's appeal, the pragmatic dispute between the parties would be unaffected. That is because the factual and legal circumstances surrounding Reid's case have changed so dramatically that Reid no longer asserts an injury that is \"likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision\" in this proceeding. <i>Spencer v. Kemna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span>). Any opinion on the merits of Reid's appeal to this court would be merely advisory. Accordingly, we have no choice but to dismiss the case as moot. <i>See Mangual,</i> 317 F.3d at 60 (\"If events have transpired to render a court opinion merely advisory, Article III considerations require dismissal of the case.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the June 2002 SAMs &#8212; the regulations that Reid challenges on constitutional and procedural grounds &#8212; are no longer in effect. By regulation, those SAMs expired on June 19, 2003, one year after their adoption. <i>See</i> 28 C.F.R. &#167; 501.3(c). No interest of Reid's would be served by invalidating them now: the June 2002 SAMs no longer determine his conditions of confinement, and there is no claim for damages (actual or nominal) for Reid's alleged deprivations while those SAMs were still in effect. <i>Cf. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d at 17 (changed circumstances do not moot claims for money damages). As we observed in the <i>Daley</i> case, which similarly involved an attack on a regulation that expired while the litigation was pending, \"[t]his court has no means of redressing either procedural failures or substantive deficiencies associated with a regulation that is now defunct.\" 292 F.3d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the BOP has imposed on Reid a new set of SAMs, effective August 14, 2003, at the ADX Florence facility in Colorado (the Colorado SAMs). Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, the Colorado SAMs contain provisions specifically regulating Reid's access to the mass media. The <i>Time</i> letters initially seized by the USMS in Massachusetts have been forwarded to ADX Florence, where the FBI has seized them anew under the mass media provisions of the Colorado SAMs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As a result, even an order from this court finding that the June 2002 SAMs were unconstitutional would not result in Reid's recovery of the seized <i>Time</i> letters. The Colorado SAMs &#8212; the only basis for the government's continued withholding of the <i>Time</i> letters &#8212; are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Reid articulated any persuasive reason why this court should decide his appeal notwithstanding the expiration of the June 2002 SAMs and his transfer to ADX Florence. This is not a case involving a defendant's <i>property</i> interest in something taken by the government &#8212; defense counsel made clear at oral argument that Reid is not interested in an order declaring that the <i>Time</i> letters are his property and must be returned to his family or to his lawyer. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (authorizing motions for the return of seized property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Reid contends that this appeal is not moot because a judgment from this court would assist him in future litigation against BOP officials in Colorado. We disagree. This is not an appeal in a civil case; it is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion in a criminal prosecution. If Reid were to prevail, his remedy would be simply the reversal of the district court's January 21, 2003 order. Plainly, the Colorado SAMs would not be affected by our reversal of that order, which was predicated on the now-expired June 2002 SAMs and which the district court itself did not believe would apply beyond the date of sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even aside from the question of available remedies, a victory for Reid in this appeal would not meaningfully assist him in challenging the conditions of his confinement at ADX Florence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> His procedural challenge to the June 2002 SAMs obviously has no bearing on the validity of the Colorado SAMs, which were separately promulgated. Likewise, even if Reid were to prevail in his substantive overbreadth challenge to the June 2002 SAMs, that would not determine the constitutionality of the Colorado SAMs. Reid's overbreadth argument is framed in terms of executive discretion: he says that mail seizure provisions of the June 2002 SAMs gave the USMS too much discretion to censor constitutionally protected speech. Unlike the June 2002 SAMs, however, the Colorado SAMs expressly cabin the discretion of prison officials to deny Reid access to most mass media.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> So in any overbreadth attack on the Colorado SAMs, the judicial inquiry will be materially different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor would a victory for Reid in his as-applied challenge to the June 2002 SAMs likely bear fruit in Colorado. That is because the relevant legal question in any such First Amendment challenge is whether the restrictions imposed are \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\" under the circumstances. <i>Thornburgh v.

The Colorado SAMs are not the \"same action\" as the June 2002 SAMs; on the contrary, they impose substantively different restrictions and reflect new factual developments (<i>i.e.,</i> Reid's conviction, sentencing, and transfer to a different prison facility). The June 2002 SAMs themselves are not reasonably likely to be repeated. Under these circumstances, the capable-of-repetition exception is unavailable. <i>See Daley,</i> 292 F.3d at 90 (new regulation was not the \"same action\" for purposes of the capable-of-repetition doctrine because the new regulation was different in scope and based on new factual developments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the factual and legal boundaries of the parties' dispute have changed so completely since the district court's January 21, 2003 order that any decision by this court on the issues raised in Reid's appeal would be essentially irrelevant. Reid may still be aggrieved by the government's conduct, but as to the district court order that is the subject of this appeal, Reid lacks \"a particularized, concrete stake that would be affected by our judgment.\" <i>Lewis,</i> 494 U.S. at 479, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112389\"><a href=\"/opinion/112389/lewis-v-continental-bank-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although Reid has expressed concern that the outcome of the present litigation may somehow prejudice him should he choose to file a new action in Colorado, we see no prejudice. Our mootness holding depends on our conclusion that the June 2002 SAMs have expired and have no continuing effect. And to ensure that Reid suffers no adverse consequences from the district court's January 21, 2003 order, we will vacate it. <i>See United States v.
