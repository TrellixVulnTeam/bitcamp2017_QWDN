Bucholz, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                               October 20, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f     BESOSA, District Judge.            The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(“BIA”) adopted and affirmed an Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) denial\n\nof Kettly Prosper’s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection     under      the    Convention      Against      Torture      (“CAT”).\n\nMs. Prosper, a native and citizen of Haiti, petitions this court\n\nfor a review of the BIA’s denial of her claims.                      We deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n     The IJ made an adverse credibility finding because of material\n\ninconsistencies between Ms. Prosper’s testimony before the IJ and\n\nher prior testimony. This adverse credibility determination is the\n\nbasis   for   our    denial      of   Ms.   Prosper’s       claims   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under CAT.\n\n     Ms. Prosper arrived in or around Miami, Florida from Haiti on\n\nor about January 16, 2001.            She did not pass through any kind of\n\nimmigration control.           On September 6, 2001, Ms. Prosper filed a\n\nForm I-589 Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal.                    In\n\nthe form she claimed that if she returned to Haiti she would be\n\npersecuted on account of her political opinions and her membership\n\nin a particular social group known by its acronym as “MDN.”                      An\n\nAsylum Officer (“AO”) interviewed Ms. Prosper on April 4, 2002,\n\nwhich lead to the referral of her application to the immigration\n\ncourt   because     the   AO    determined     that   her    testimony     was   not\n\ncredible.     On April 18, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\n\n                                       - 2 -\n\fService (“INS”) served Ms. Prosper with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”)\n\nin person, charging her with removability, and placed her in\n\nremoval proceedings.\n\n     Ms. Prosper appeared at four hearings.   On September 6, 2002,\n\nshe appeared pro se at the Miami Immigration Court, requested a\n\ncontinuance, and informed that court that she would file a change\n\nof venue motion.   On March 5, 2003, Ms. Prosper appeared at the\n\nBoston Immigration Court where she admitted the factual allegations\n\nof the NTA and conceded removability.     On March 10, 2005, she\n\nappeared once again before the Boston Immigration Court, at which\n\ntime the court found that Ms. Prosper’s application was timely\n\nfiled.   Finally, on June 2, 2005, Ms. Prosper appeared before the\n\nBoston Immigration Court again and testified concerning the factual\n\nbackground to her claims.     The following is a summary of her\n\nJune 2, 2005 testimony, except where a statement is specifically\n\nattributed to a different source.\n\n     Ms. Prosper testified that she suffered persecution in Haiti\n\nbecause she was a member of a political party called “MDN.”    She\n\ntestified that MDN stands for “National Democratic Movement.”\n\nAfter being informed that MDN actually stands for Mobilization for\n\nNational Development, Ms. Prosper responded that some people call\n\nthe organization National Democratic Movement.   There is no other\n\nsupport for this dual name, however, in the record.   She initially\n\nsaid that she joined MDN in October 1990.     When asked if party\n\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fleader    Hubert    de   Ronceray    left   Haiti     between   1990    and   2001,\n\nMs. Prosper answered no.       When Ms. Prosper was told affirmatively\n\nthat Ronceray was expelled from Haiti in 1990 and that he went into\n\nexile in 1997, she admitted that she was unaware of Ronceray’s\n\ndepartures, but she explained this by saying that she did not join\n\nthe MDN until October 1999, not 1990.               She said she misunderstood\n\nthe earlier question concerning her joinder of MDN.                       Her MDN\n\nmembership card was dated 1995 and had an illegible seal.                       To\n\nexplain why her card was dated 1995, when she later claimed to have\n\njoined MDN in 1999, Ms. Prosper stated that the card was pre-made.\n\n       Ms. Prosper was also unaware of other significant political\n\nevents impacting the MDN.           On May 21, 2000, there was a disputed\n\nelection in Haiti, after which opposition parties, including the\n\nMDN,     joined    together   to     form     the    Democratic       Convergence.\n\nNonetheless,       Ms.   Prosper     did    not     identify    the    Democratic\n\nConvergence, was unable to state whether MDN joined any coalitions,\n\nand could not recall if there were elections in Haiti in the year\n\n2000 prior to the election held in November 2000.\n\n       Ms. Prosper said that she invited people to meetings on behalf\n\nof MDN and then listened to speakers at those meetings.                  She said\n\nthat once she arrived in the United States, she stopped all\n\ninvolvement in MDN or any other political organization.                   She did\n\nnot know the date MDN was founded.                She was also unaware of the\n\nname of the current president of Haiti.\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\f     Ms. Prosper also testified that she was attacked on two\n\nseparate occasions because of her membership in MDN.        The first\n\nalleged attack occurred on November 27, 2000.     She testified that,\n\nas she was walking along a street, she was surrounded by five men\n\nwho accused her of working for MDN.      The men told her that she had\n\nto work for Lavalas or die.     The men pushed her into a car; when\n\nthe car broke down a few miles later, the men argued over what to\n\ndo with her.    One man wanted to kill her whereas another man said\n\nto let her go because they would be able to find her again and kill\n\nher later.     The men then threw her out of the car, kicked her\n\nseveral times and left.       She laid on the ground until people\n\npassing by gave her water and helped her get into a taxi.         The\n\nattackers worked for Aristide, according to Ms. Prosper, because\n\nthey referred to Lavalas and used violence against her.\n\n     Ms. Prosper’s recollection of events seemed to vary with each\n\ntelling.   In her interview with the AO she did not mention that the\n\nmen who grabbed her were Aristide supporters, and did not say that\n\nthey told her to “work for Lavalas or die.”     In that interview she\n\nsaid they told her she would “find out” and that they said “kill\n\nthe bitch.”     In the Form I-589 submitted on September 6, 2001,\n\nhowever, Ms. Prosper claimed that she was “arrested” by “Lavalas\n\ngovernment” workers who told her “[y]ou are in opposition against\n\nLavalas.     You lost.   Aristide or death.”    In that same form she\n\nclaimed that the car only drove three blocks before running out of\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fgas.    This also differs slightly from her June 2005 affidavit, in\n\nwhich she stated that the car went five blocks, before she was\n\nthrown from the car and landed on her head, but in which she made\n\nno mention of being kicked.         In that affidavit Ms. Prosper said\n\nthat she thought she was attacked because she did not vote in the\n\nNovember 2000 presidential elections and she made no mention of her\n\nmembership in MDN.\n\n       The second alleged attack occurred on December 3, 2000.            At\n\n11:30 p.m., five men entered her house by breaking down the door.\n\nThey shouted her name, asked where she was and accused her of\n\nworking for MDN.      They blindfolded a few people that were in her\n\nhouse   and   then   she   was   beaten,    raped   and   left   unconscious.\n\nMs. Prosper’s mother treated her with herbal medicine but she began\n\nto vomit blood so her mother took her to a hospital in Aux Cayes,\n\nwhere she stayed for three days.           She did not tell the doctor at\n\nthat hospital that she had been raped because she felt embarrassed\n\nand traumatized. Upon leaving the hospital, she went to a friend’s\n\nhouse because she was afraid to go home.            From there she went to\n\nGonaives and boarded a boat for the United States.           She left Haiti\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 6 -\n\fon   January       12,   2001   and     arrived     in    the    United    States   on\n\nJanuary 16, 2001.2\n\n     As with Ms. Prosper’s testimony concerning the earlier attack,\n\nthere       are    inconsistencies          between      her    accounts     of     the\n\nDecember 3, 2000 attack.             In her June 2005 affidavit, Ms. Prosper\n\nstates      that   everyone     in   her    house   was    blindfolded.       In    her\n\nstatement to the AO, however, Ms. Prosper said that her brother and\n\nfather were tied up and blindfolded, and that she was kicked and\n\nbeaten unconscious, but she did not mention that she was raped.\n\nShe also failed to mention that she was raped in her Form I-589\n\nsubmitted on September 6, 2001.               She also failed to tell the AO\n\nthat she was hospitalized.             Nor did she mention in her September\n\n2001 Form I-589 that she was hospitalized.                     Although psychiatric\n\nevaluation did report Ms. Prosper as saying she was hospitalized,\n\nthe evaluation notes that she said that her cousin, not her mother,\n\ntook her to the hospital in Aux Cayes.                   Ms. Prosper submitted no\n\ndocumentation related to her hospital visit.\n\n     Ms. Prosper further testified that she became HIV positive as\n\na result of the rape on December 3, 2000.                 She said that she first\n\n\n        2\n       Ms. Prosper testified that she paid $2,000 to someone who\narranged her transport to the United States. She said that she\nleft Haiti on a large boat, then transferred to a small boat that\ntook her ashore in Miami. She then met a Haitian person who drove\nher to her aunt’s house.      She did not mention any of this\ninformation in her September 2001 Form I-589. In her June 2005\naffidavit, she stated that she arrived in the United States at the\n“Port of Miami” and requested asylum.         The IJ noted that\nMs. Prosper struggled to provide any more detail upon request.\n\n                                           - 7 -\n\fdiscovered she was HIV positive between 2001 and 2002, but she has\n\nno record of the diagnosis at that time.        A letter submitted by her\n\ntreating   physician   to   the   court    states   that   Ms.   Prosper   was\n\ndiagnosed as HIV positive in July 2004.\n\n     Despite Aristide’s ouster in 2004, Ms. Prosper claims that she\n\nfears returning to Haiti because Aristide supporters still abound\n\nand she believes those supporters will find her and kill her.              She\n\nheard from a friend that MDN still exists and she said that she\n\nwould continue to be active in MDN if she returned to Haiti.\n\n                       II.    Standard of Review\n\n     Ordinarily this court reviews the decision of the BIA, but\n\nwhere the BIA adopts the opinion of an IJ, we then must also review\n\nthe decision of the IJ.      Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).     In this case, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\ndecision of the IJ, although it also briefly explained why it did\n\nnot find the Petitioner’s appeal persuasive.\n\n     We review the BIA’s findings of fact under the “substantial\n\nevidence” standard which applies to claims of asylum, withholding\n\nand protection under CAT.         Id.     The BIA’s findings, including\n\ncredibility determinations, must be upheld as long as they are\n\n“supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.”         Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80,\n\n85 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478\n\n481, 112 S.Ct. 812 (1992) (citation omitted)).             This deferential\n\n\n                                   - 8 -\n\fstandard permits reversal of a BIA decision on sufficiency grounds\n\nonly where the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder\n\nto make a contrary determination.                Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 &\n\nn.1.).\n\n                                 III.     Discussion\n\n       On   appeal   Ms.      Prosper     argues      that    the     BIA   should    have\n\noverturned the IJ’s credibility determination as clearly erroneous\n\nand not based upon substantial evidence.                     In ruling against her,\n\nMs.    Prosper    argues,      the   IJ       relied    upon    illusory       or    minor\n\ninconsistencies that do not touch upon the heart of the asylum\n\nclaim.      While true that the credibility determination may not rest\n\non    trivial    discrepancies,         Pan    v.    Gonzales,       489    F.3d    at   86\n\n(citations omitted), many of the discrepancies in this case are\n\nmaterial to Ms. Prosper’s claim, and the numerous seemingly minor\n\ndiscrepancies     also     undermine       Ms.      Prosper’s    credibility.            Id.\n\n(“Some of these inconsistencies, in isolation, may seem like small\n\npotatoes. What counts, however, is that their cumulative effect is\n\ngreat.”) (citation omitted).\n\n       To    establish     eligibility        for    asylum,     an    alien    such     as\n\nMs. Prosper must demonstrate that she is a refugee.                          8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).               Refugee is defined by the act as\n\na    person    unable    or    unwilling       to    return     to    her   country      or\n\nnationality (or country of last habitual residence) “because of\n\n\n                                          - 9 -\n\fpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,       or   political     opinion.”           8     U.S.C.    §    1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nMs.    Prosper      bears   the      burden    of    proof    for       establishing   her\n\neligibility for asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). To show past\n\npersecution, she must provide “conclusive evidence” that she has\n\nsuffered      persecution       on     one    of    the    five    protected      grounds.\n\nRomilus,      385    F.3d   1     at   6     (citation      omitted).        To    show   a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, Ms. Prosper must show both\n\nthat her fear is genuine and that it is objectively reasonable,\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing\n\nAlvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1990)), or she may\n\nbenefit from a regulatory presumption based upon proof of past\n\npersecution.        Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nTo    meet    the   objective      prong      of    the   well     founded    fear   test,\n\nMs. Prosper need only show a “reasonable possibility” that, if\n\ndenied asylum (and thereafter removed to her homeland), she will be\n\npersecuted on account of a protected ground. Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,\n\n480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987)).                    This showing requires “credible,\n\ndirect, and specific evidence.”                Khalil, 337 F.3d at 55 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n       To     qualify   for     withholding         of     removal,      which    provides\n\nmandatory relief, Ms. Prosper must meet a higher standard than that\n\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\frequired for asylum:      she must show that, more likely than not, she\n\nfaces   persecution      on    account    of    race,    religion,      nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\n\nshould she return to her homeland.               INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526\n\nU.S. 415, 419 (1999).\n\n     Relief under the CAT, unlike asylum or withholding of removal,\n\ndoes not require Ms. Prosper to prove the reason for torture.\n\nRomilus, 385 F.3d at 8.         Instead, an applicant must prove that it\n\nis more likely than not that she will be tortured if she is\n\nreturned to the proposed country of removal.                 Id.   To establish a\n\nprima facie claim, Ms. Prosper must offer specific objective\n\nevidence showing that she will be subject to “(1) an act causing\n\nsevere physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally\n\ninflicted;   (3)    for    a    proscribed      purpose;     (4)   by    or   at   the\n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5)\n\nnot arising from lawful sanctions.” Id. (citing Elien v. Ashcroft,\n\n364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations omitted)).\n\n     On appeal Ms. Prosper argues that many of the inconsistencies\n\nperceived    by    the    IJ    were     actually       differences     in    detail,\n\ndifferences in word choice, or indicative of a misunderstanding by\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\fthe IJ.3   She adds that the IJ and the BIA failed to evaluate the\n\nmateriality of the inconsistencies in Ms. Prosper’s testimony.\n\nThis second assertion is simply not true; the IJ specifically\n\nstated that the discrepancies and inconsistencies in Ms. Prosper’s\n\ntestimony were material to her claims for relief.          We agree.    We\n\nalso note, as we have before, that a witness’s demeanor may be a\n\ncritical factor in determining her truthfulness.             Laurent v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, (1st Cir. 2004).          “Where, as here, the\n\njudicial officer who saw and heard the witness makes an adverse\n\ncredibility determination and supports that determination with\n\nspecific   findings,   an   appellate    court    should    treat      that\n\ndetermination with great respect.”      Id.   (citations omitted).\n\n     The IJ grouped the discrepancies in Ms. Prosper’s testimony\n\ninto six different categories: (1) her involvement in MDN; (2) the\n\n\n\n     3\n       For example, Ms. Prosper notes on appeal that the IJ found\nher testimony concerning the November 27, 2000 attack to be\ninconsistent because she asserted at one point that she was\nattacked because she did not vote in the November 2000 elections,\nwhereas she asserts at another point that she was attacked because\nof her membership in MDN. Ms. Prosper argues that this difference\nin testimony reflects a difference in detail rather than a\ndifference in substantive testimony because she explained at\nanother point in her testimony that only Lavalas party members\nvoted in the November 2000 election. Therefore when she said that\nshe was attacked for not voting in the election, it was implicit\nthat she was attacked for not being a Lavalas supporter, although\nthis does not mean that she was necessarily a MDN member (as MDN\ndid not represent all non-Lavalas supporters).             Although\nMs. Prosper’s explanation of this inconsistency cited by the IJ may\nbe persuasive, there are still numerous other inconsistencies that\nabound in the record which Ms. Prosper has not addressed to our\nsatisfaction.\n\n                               - 12 -\n\fNovember 27, 2000 attack; (3) the December 3, 2000 attack; (4) her\n\nhospitalization subsequent to the December 3, 2000 attack; (5) her\n\narrival in the United States; and (6) her diagnosis as being HIV\n\npositive.   The most important of these six categories is the first\n\none, which is the basis for Ms. Prosper’s claims for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n     Ms. Prosper claims that she was persecuted in the past because\n\nof her involvement with MDN, thus thrusting her involvement with\n\nMDN to the forefront of this case.          She erroneously believed that\n\nthe acronym MDN stands for National Democratic Movement, when it\n\nactually stands for Mobilization for National Development. She was\n\nunaware that the leader of the MDN left Haiti twice in the 1990s.\n\nShe claimed that she joined MDN in 1990, later claimed that she did\n\nso in 1999, and submitted a MDN membership card that appears to\n\nhave been issued in 1995.       Finally, and perhaps      most importantly,\n\nMs. Prosper failed to recall two watershed events in MDN history:\n\nthe disputed May 2000 election and MDN’s subsequent joinder of\n\nother   opposition    parties    to   create    a   coalition    called   the\n\nDemocratic Convergence.         Altogether, Ms. Prosper’s inconsistent\n\nstatements, and apparent lack of awareness concerning MDN-related\n\nmatters,    provide   ample     ground   to    support   the    IJ’s   adverse\n\ncredibility finding.\n\n     Although we have previously noted other discrepancies in\n\nMs. Prosper’s testimony, they are not as striking or significant as\n\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\fthose concerning MDN and do not merit additional examination here.\n\nNevertheless, they further support the IJ’s adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n     The discrepancies in Ms. Prosper’s testimony, especially those\n\nregarding events giving rise to her claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal and protection under CAT, provide substantial evidence\n\nto support the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.           This\n\nadverse credibility determination is fatal to all three claims\n\n(asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT) because they all rely on\n\nthe same discredited testimony.4   See, e.g., Desna v. Gonzales, 454\n\nF.3d 896, 898-99 (8th Cir. 2006).       Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nthe IJ did not err in determining that Ms. Prosper was not\n\ncredible.\n\n                         IV.   Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for review\n\nand affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       We note that in so deciding, we have not stated that an\nadverse credibility finding that defeats a request for asylum a\nfortiori defeats a CAT claim. See Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d\n89, 94-95 (1st Cir. 2004). Rather, Ms. Prosper does not point to\nany other evidence in the record outside of her discredited\ntestimony that supports her CAT claim.\n\n                               - 14 -\n\f",

The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(“BIA”) adopted and affirmed an Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) denial\n\nof Kettly Prosper’s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection     under      the    Convention      Against      Torture      (“CAT”).\n\nMs. Prosper, a native and citizen of Haiti, petitions this court\n\nfor a review of the BIA’s denial of her claims.                      We deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n     The IJ made an adverse credibility finding because of material\n\ninconsistencies between Ms. Prosper’s testimony before the IJ and\n\nher prior testimony. This adverse credibility determination is the\n\nbasis   for   our    denial      of   Ms.   Prosper’s       claims   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under CAT.\n\n     Ms. Prosper arrived in or around Miami, Florida from Haiti on\n\nor about January 16, 2001.            She did not pass through any kind of\n\nimmigration control.           On September 6, 2001, Ms. Prosper filed a\n\nForm I-589 Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal.                    In\n\nthe form she claimed that if she returned to Haiti she would be\n\npersecuted on account of her political opinions and her membership\n\nin a particular social group known by its acronym as “MDN.”                      An\n\nAsylum Officer (“AO”) interviewed Ms. Prosper on April 4, 2002,\n\nwhich lead to the referral of her application to the immigration\n\ncourt   because     the   AO    determined     that   her    testimony     was   not\n\ncredible.     On April 18, 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\n\n                                       - 2 -\n\fService (“INS”) served Ms. Prosper with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”)\n\nin person, charging her with removability, and placed her in\n\nremoval proceedings.\n\n     Ms. Prosper appeared at four hearings.   On September 6, 2002,\n\nshe appeared pro se at the Miami Immigration Court, requested a\n\ncontinuance, and informed that court that she would file a change\n\nof venue motion.   On March 5, 2003, Ms. Prosper appeared at the\n\nBoston Immigration Court where she admitted the factual allegations\n\nof the NTA and conceded removability.     On March 10, 2005, she\n\nappeared once again before the Boston Immigration Court, at which\n\ntime the court found that Ms. Prosper’s application was timely\n\nfiled.   Finally, on June 2, 2005, Ms. Prosper appeared before the\n\nBoston Immigration Court again and testified concerning the factual\n\nbackground to her claims.     The following is a summary of her\n\nJune 2, 2005 testimony, except where a statement is specifically\n\nattributed to a different source.\n\n     Ms. Prosper testified that she suffered persecution in Haiti\n\nbecause she was a member of a political party called “MDN.”    She\n\ntestified that MDN stands for “National Democratic Movement.”\n\nAfter being informed that MDN actually stands for Mobilization for\n\nNational Development, Ms. Prosper responded that some people call\n\nthe organization National Democratic Movement.   There is no other\n\nsupport for this dual name, however, in the record.   She initially\n\nsaid that she joined MDN in October 1990.     When asked if party\n\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fleader    Hubert    de   Ronceray    left   Haiti     between   1990    and   2001,\n\nMs. Prosper answered no.       When Ms. Prosper was told affirmatively\n\nthat Ronceray was expelled from Haiti in 1990 and that he went into\n\nexile in 1997, she admitted that she was unaware of Ronceray’s\n\ndepartures, but she explained this by saying that she did not join\n\nthe MDN until October 1999, not 1990.               She said she misunderstood\n\nthe earlier question concerning her joinder of MDN.                       Her MDN\n\nmembership card was dated 1995 and had an illegible seal.                       To\n\nexplain why her card was dated 1995, when she later claimed to have\n\njoined MDN in 1999, Ms. Prosper stated that the card was pre-made.\n\n       Ms. Prosper was also unaware of other significant political\n\nevents impacting the MDN.           On May 21, 2000, there was a disputed\n\nelection in Haiti, after which opposition parties, including the\n\nMDN,     joined    together   to     form     the    Democratic       Convergence.\n\nNonetheless,       Ms.   Prosper     did    not     identify    the    Democratic\n\nConvergence, was unable to state whether MDN joined any coalitions,\n\nand could not recall if there were elections in Haiti in the year\n\n2000 prior to the election held in November 2000.\n\n       Ms. Prosper said that she invited people to meetings on behalf\n\nof MDN and then listened to speakers at those meetings.                  She said\n\nthat once she arrived in the United States, she stopped all\n\ninvolvement in MDN or any other political organization.                   She did\n\nnot know the date MDN was founded.                She was also unaware of the\n\nname of the current president of Haiti.\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\f     Ms. Prosper also testified that she was attacked on two\n\nseparate occasions because of her membership in MDN.        The first\n\nalleged attack occurred on November 27, 2000.     She testified that,\n\nas she was walking along a street, she was surrounded by five men\n\nwho accused her of working for MDN.      The men told her that she had\n\nto work for Lavalas or die.     The men pushed her into a car; when\n\nthe car broke down a few miles later, the men argued over what to\n\ndo with her.    One man wanted to kill her whereas another man said\n\nto let her go because they would be able to find her again and kill\n\nher later.     The men then threw her out of the car, kicked her\n\nseveral times and left.       She laid on the ground until people\n\npassing by gave her water and helped her get into a taxi.         The\n\nattackers worked for Aristide, according to Ms. Prosper, because\n\nthey referred to Lavalas and used violence against her.\n\n     Ms. Prosper’s recollection of events seemed to vary with each\n\ntelling.   In her interview with the AO she did not mention that the\n\nmen who grabbed her were Aristide supporters, and did not say that\n\nthey told her to “work for Lavalas or die.”     In that interview she\n\nsaid they told her she would “find out” and that they said “kill\n\nthe bitch.”     In the Form I-589 submitted on September 6, 2001,\n\nhowever, Ms. Prosper claimed that she was “arrested” by “Lavalas\n\ngovernment” workers who told her “[y]ou are in opposition against\n\nLavalas.     You lost.   Aristide or death.”    In that same form she\n\nclaimed that the car only drove three blocks before running out of\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fgas.    This also differs slightly from her June 2005 affidavit, in\n\nwhich she stated that the car went five blocks, before she was\n\nthrown from the car and landed on her head, but in which she made\n\nno mention of being kicked.         In that affidavit Ms. Prosper said\n\nthat she thought she was attacked because she did not vote in the\n\nNovember 2000 presidential elections and she made no mention of her\n\nmembership in MDN.\n\n       The second alleged attack occurred on December 3, 2000.            At\n\n11:30 p.m., five men entered her house by breaking down the door.\n\nThey shouted her name, asked where she was and accused her of\n\nworking for MDN.      They blindfolded a few people that were in her\n\nhouse   and   then   she   was   beaten,    raped   and   left   unconscious.\n\nMs. Prosper’s mother treated her with herbal medicine but she began\n\nto vomit blood so her mother took her to a hospital in Aux Cayes,\n\nwhere she stayed for three days.           She did not tell the doctor at\n\nthat hospital that she had been raped because she felt embarrassed\n\nand traumatized. Upon leaving the hospital, she went to a friend’s\n\nhouse because she was afraid to go home.            From there she went to\n\nGonaives and boarded a boat for the United States.           She left Haiti\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 6 -\n\fon   January       12,   2001   and     arrived     in    the    United    States   on\n\nJanuary 16, 2001.2\n\n     As with Ms. Prosper’s testimony concerning the earlier attack,\n\nthere       are    inconsistencies          between      her    accounts     of     the\n\nDecember 3, 2000 attack.             In her June 2005 affidavit, Ms. Prosper\n\nstates      that   everyone     in   her    house   was    blindfolded.       In    her\n\nstatement to the AO, however, Ms. Prosper said that her brother and\n\nfather were tied up and blindfolded, and that she was kicked and\n\nbeaten unconscious, but she did not mention that she was raped.\n\nShe also failed to mention that she was raped in her Form I-589\n\nsubmitted on September 6, 2001.               She also failed to tell the AO\n\nthat she was hospitalized.             Nor did she mention in her September\n\n2001 Form I-589 that she was hospitalized.                     Although psychiatric\n\nevaluation did report Ms. Prosper as saying she was hospitalized,\n\nthe evaluation notes that she said that her cousin, not her mother,\n\ntook her to the hospital in Aux Cayes.                   Ms. Prosper submitted no\n\ndocumentation related to her hospital visit.\n\n     Ms. Prosper further testified that she became HIV positive as\n\na result of the rape on December 3, 2000.                 She said that she first\n\n\n        2\n       Ms. Prosper testified that she paid $2,000 to someone who\narranged her transport to the United States. She said that she\nleft Haiti on a large boat, then transferred to a small boat that\ntook her ashore in Miami. She then met a Haitian person who drove\nher to her aunt’s house.      She did not mention any of this\ninformation in her September 2001 Form I-589. In her June 2005\naffidavit, she stated that she arrived in the United States at the\n“Port of Miami” and requested asylum.         The IJ noted that\nMs. Prosper struggled to provide any more detail upon request.\n\n                                           - 7 -\n\fdiscovered she was HIV positive between 2001 and 2002, but she has\n\nno record of the diagnosis at that time.        A letter submitted by her\n\ntreating   physician   to   the   court    states   that   Ms.   Prosper   was\n\ndiagnosed as HIV positive in July 2004.\n\n     Despite Aristide’s ouster in 2004, Ms. Prosper claims that she\n\nfears returning to Haiti because Aristide supporters still abound\n\nand she believes those supporters will find her and kill her.              She\n\nheard from a friend that MDN still exists and she said that she\n\nwould continue to be active in MDN if she returned to Haiti.\n\n                       II.    Standard of Review\n\n     Ordinarily this court reviews the decision of the BIA, but\n\nwhere the BIA adopts the opinion of an IJ, we then must also review\n\nthe decision of the IJ.      Romilus v.

Discussion\n\n       On   appeal   Ms.      Prosper     argues      that    the     BIA   should    have\n\noverturned the IJ’s credibility determination as clearly erroneous\n\nand not based upon substantial evidence.

While true that the credibility determination may not rest\n\non    trivial    discrepancies,         Pan    v.    Gonzales,       489    F.3d    at   86\n\n(citations omitted), many of the discrepancies in this case are\n\nmaterial to Ms. Prosper’s claim, and the numerous seemingly minor\n\ndiscrepancies     also     undermine       Ms.      Prosper’s    credibility.

We agree.    We\n\nalso note, as we have before, that a witness’s demeanor may be a\n\ncritical factor in determining her truthfulness.             Laurent v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (1st Cir. 2004).          “Where, as here, the\n\njudicial officer who saw and heard the witness makes an adverse\n\ncredibility determination and supports that determination with\n\nspecific   findings,   an   appellate    court    should    treat      that\n\ndetermination with great respect.”      Id.   (citations omitted).\n\n     The IJ grouped the discrepancies in Ms. Prosper’s testimony\n\ninto six different categories: (1) her involvement in MDN; (2) the\n\n\n\n     3\n       For example, Ms. Prosper notes on appeal that the IJ found\nher testimony concerning the November 27, 2000 attack to be\ninconsistent because she asserted at one point that she was\nattacked because she did not vote in the November 2000 elections,\nwhereas she asserts at another point that she was attacked because\nof her membership in MDN. Ms. Prosper argues that this difference\nin testimony reflects a difference in detail rather than a\ndifference in substantive testimony because she explained at\nanother point in her testimony that only Lavalas party members\nvoted in the November 2000 election. Therefore when she said that\nshe was attacked for not voting in the election, it was implicit\nthat she was attacked for not being a Lavalas supporter, although\nthis does not mean that she was necessarily a MDN member (as MDN\ndid not represent all non-Lavalas supporters).             Although\nMs. Prosper’s explanation of this inconsistency cited by the IJ may\nbe persuasive, there are still numerous other inconsistencies that\nabound in the record which Ms. Prosper has not addressed to our\nsatisfaction.\n\n                               - 12 -\n\fNovember 27, 2000 attack; (3) the December 3, 2000 attack; (4) her\n\nhospitalization subsequent to the December 3, 2000 attack; (5) her\n\narrival in the United States; and (6) her diagnosis as being HIV\n\npositive.   The most important of these six categories is the first\n\none, which is the basis for Ms. Prosper’s claims for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n     Ms. Prosper claims that she was persecuted in the past because\n\nof her involvement with MDN, thus thrusting her involvement with\n\nMDN to the forefront of this case.          She erroneously believed that\n\nthe acronym MDN stands for National Democratic Movement, when it\n\nactually stands for Mobilization for National Development. She was\n\nunaware that the leader of the MDN left Haiti twice in the 1990s.\n\nShe claimed that she joined MDN in 1990, later claimed that she did\n\nso in 1999, and submitted a MDN membership card that appears to\n\nhave been issued in 1995.       Finally, and perhaps      most importantly,\n\nMs. Prosper failed to recall two watershed events in MDN history:\n\nthe disputed May 2000 election and MDN’s subsequent joinder of\n\nother   opposition    parties    to   create    a   coalition    called   the\n\nDemocratic Convergence.         Altogether, Ms. Prosper’s inconsistent\n\nstatements, and apparent lack of awareness concerning MDN-related\n\nmatters,    provide   ample     ground   to    support   the    IJ’s   adverse\n\ncredibility finding.\n\n     Although we have previously noted other discrepancies in\n\nMs. Prosper’s testimony, they are not as striking or significant as\n\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\fthose concerning MDN and do not merit additional examination here.\n\nNevertheless, they further support the IJ’s adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n     The discrepancies in Ms. Prosper’s testimony, especially those\n\nregarding events giving rise to her claims for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal and protection under CAT, provide substantial evidence\n\nto support the IJ’s adverse credibility determination.           This\n\nadverse credibility determination is fatal to all three claims\n\n(asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT) because they all rely on\n\nthe same discredited testimony.4   See, e.g., Desna v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795031\"><a href=\"/opinion/795031/larissa-nikolvevna-desna-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898-99 (8th Cir. 2006).       Accordingly, we conclude that\n\nthe IJ did not err in determining that Ms. Prosper was not\n\ncredible.\n\n                         IV.   Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for review\n\nand affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       We note that in so deciding, we have not stated that an\nadverse credibility finding that defeats a request for asylum a\nfortiori defeats a CAT claim. See Settenda v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201166\"><a href=\"/opinion/201166/settenda-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94-95 (1st Cir. 2004). Rather, Ms. Prosper does not point to\nany other evidence in the record outside of her discredited\ntestimony that supports her CAT claim.\n\n                               - 14 -\n\f</pre>",
