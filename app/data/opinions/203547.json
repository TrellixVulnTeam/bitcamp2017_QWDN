Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Boudin, Selya, and Dyk,*\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William C.

Peters, with whom Christopher Weld, Jr., Raymond P.\nAusrotas, and Todd & Weld LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                           October 29, 2008\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.   There is a line between zealous\n\nrepresentation and abuse of the processes of litigation.     Lawyers\n\nwho overstep it do so at their peril.     In the case before us, the\n\ndistrict court found that a law firm had crossed the line by\n\nunreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings in a class\n\naction.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1927.       Accordingly, the court imposed\n\nsanctions.\n\n          The law firm appeals from the sanctions order.          It\n\nargues, first, that the record fails to disclose any sanctionable\n\nconduct and that, in all events, the district court made mistakes\n\nboth in finding the facts and in gauging their import.         As a\n\nfallback, the firm maintains that, even if its principal argument\n\ndoes not carry the day, the district court nonetheless abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to reconsider the sanctions order on a\n\nsupplemented record.   The defendants, who moved for the imposition\n\nof sanctions in the first place, offer rejoinders to each and every\n\naspect of this asseverational array.\n\n          On the record at hand, we well understand the district\n\ncourt's frustration with the law firm's apparent carelessness.\n\nStill, we do not think that it can be said, as a matter of law,\n\nthat sanctions either are or are not appropriate. In attempting to\n\nproceed past that point, we find ourselves largely stymied by gaps\n\nin the record.   Consequently, we decide only one of the further\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fquestions presented, vacate the sanctions order, and remand for a\n\nnew round of proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION\n\n             The genesis of this case seemed ordinary enough; it began\n\nwith the filing of a class-action complaint by the law firm of\n\nStewart, Estes & Donnell, P.L.C. (\"SE&D\") on behalf of Thomas R.\n\nJensen and (unnamed) others similarly situated.                  The complaint\n\ndesignated two related corporations, Phillips Screw Company and\n\nPhillips Fastener Products, Inc. (collectively, \"Phillips\") as\n\ndefendants and alleged that screws manufactured and marketed by\n\nthem   for    use    with    pressure-treated      wood     suffered     from   an\n\nundisclosed propensity for premature failure in certain relatively\n\ncommonplace circumstances.\n\n             As matters turned out, Jensen had previously contacted\n\nPhillips     about   his    claims   and   had   received   at   least    partial\n\nsatisfaction for them (the record is opaque as to whether SE&D knew\n\nor should have known as much before filing suit).                   Given this\n\ncircumstance, Phillips raised an affirmative defense of accord and\n\nsatisfaction in its answer to the complaint.              Along the same line,\n\nit argued at an early scheduling conference with the district court\n\nthat   Jensen's      vulnerability    to   this   defense    rendered     him   an\n\ninappropriate class representative.\n\n             The district court agreed; it gave SE&D six weeks (i.e.,\n\nuntil January 30, 2007) to amend the complaint to add a new named\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fplaintiff.       The court subsequently granted SE&D's request for a\n\nshort extension of that deadline.\n\n               Within the allotted time, the law firm moved to file an\n\namended complaint adding a second plaintiff, Larry Vanlandingham.\n\nSE&D       implied   that   Vanlandingham     would    make   a   superior      class\n\nrepresentative because he not only had encountered problems when he\n\nused Phillips screws in the construction of a deck but also (unlike\n\nJensen) had eschewed a private settlement.\n\n               As a Scottish poet once warned, even the most carefully\n\ncontrived plans may sometimes implode.2               Six weeks after moving to\n\nadd Vanlandingham as its new champion and before the district court\n\nruled on that motion, SE&D abruptly retreated. This time, it moved\n\nto forgo Vanlandingham's entry into the lists because, in the law\n\nfirm's words, \"circumstances have arisen . . . which may compromise\n\nthe ability of [Vanlandingham] to act on behalf of the class.\"\n\nPhillips opposed this motion and sought dismissal of the action.\n\nIt     explained     in     an   attached   affidavit     the     nature   of     the\n\n\"circumstances\" to which SE&D had alluded.                The affiant, Gary M.\n\nSable, a Phillips executive, recounted that Vanlandingham's wife,\n\nGayle, had told him (Sable) that she and her husband did not wish\n\nto sue but, rather, preferred to reach a private accommodation with\n\nthe company.         According to Sable, Gayle Vanlandingham expressed\n\n\n       2\n       See Robert Burns, To a Mouse (1785) (\"The best-laid schemes\no' mice and men [g]ang aft a-gley; [a]n' leave us nought but grief\nan' pain [f]or promised joy.\").\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsurprise that her husband's name had been put forward in the class\n\naction,   noting   that   neither    she   nor   he   had   engaged     counsel.\n\nNeither of them, she added, harbored any desire to become involved\n\nin litigation.       Sable went on to quote Gayle Vanlandingham as\n\nsaying that when she and her husband expressed their concerns to\n\nSE&D, they were told that Phillips would not honor a warranty claim\n\nin the absence of legal action.\n\n            At that juncture SE&D did not directly dispute Phillips's\n\nallegations.   In a responsive pleading, it argued instead that the\n\nSable affidavit constituted hearsay and attributed any change of\n\nheart on the part of the Vanlandinghams to Phillips's influence.\n\n            In this exchange of pleadings, SE&D gave top billing to\n\nthe new candidate whom it had recruited to fill the named plaintiff\n\nposition:   Emmett    Cox.    SE&D    asserted    that      Cox   would   be   an\n\nappropriate class representative because an inspection of his deck\n\nhad   \"indicated     substantial    premature    corrosion        of   fasteners\n\nmanufactured by [Phillips].\"        Although expressing some skepticism\n\nabout SE&D's methods, the district court allowed the motion — a\n\nruling that had the effect of shelving Vanlandingham and inserting\n\nCox as a named plaintiff and putative class representative.\n\n            Over the next several months, it became apparent that,\n\nnotwithstanding SE&D's prior assurances, Cox had used a brand of\n\nscrews not manufactured by Phillips in constructing his deck. When\n\nthat conclusion became irresistible, SE&D moved to drop Cox as a\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fplaintiff and to amend the complaint yet again.                          This proposed\n\namendment sought to substitute Timothy Scott Damm in Cox's place\n\nand stead.\n\n              Once burned is twice shy.                This time the district court\n\ngave SE&D two weeks (i.e., until September 13, 2007) within which\n\nto    file        a     detailed        written      statement     describing       Damm's\n\nqualifications as a class-action plaintiff and putative class\n\nrepresentative. SE&D never proffered such a statement. At the end\n\nof the two-week grace period, it withdrew its motion to amend and\n\nterminated the class action in the federal court.\n\nII.   SANCTIONS\n\n              Throwing in the sponge on the class action did not end\n\nthe matter.           Invoking 28 U.S.C. § 1927, Phillips moved for an award\n\nof sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees and expenses.                              In\n\nsupport      of       its   motion,     Phillips      argued    that   SE&D   had   never\n\nundertaken a reasonably thorough investigation into the bona fides\n\nof any of its four proposed class representatives but had simply\n\nplunged ahead with devil-may-care abandon.\n\n              SE&D demurred. The law firm posited that sanctions under\n\nsection 1927 were inappropriate vis-à-vis the initial filing of a\n\ncomplaint;        that      two    of    the   putative        class   representatives,\n\nVanlandingham and Damm, were withdrawn before any excess costs\n\naccrued; and that if any shortcomings characterized its performance\n\n— and it conceded none — those shortcomings were not of the\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fmagnitude required for the imposition of sanctions. In framing its\n\nopposition,      SE&D   for    the    first   time   directly     contradicted\n\nPhillips's account of Vanlandingham's appearance on the scene.3 As\n\nto Cox, SE&D pointed to his reputed statement that he had purchased\n\nPhillips screws to justify its initial assertion that he was an\n\nappropriate plaintiff.\n\n            Although SE&D had requested oral argument, the district\n\ncourt rejected that request.              Then, eschewing an evidentiary\n\nhearing, it filed a written decision. See Jensen v. Phillips Screw\n\nCo., Civ. No. 05-12117, 2007 WL 3104625 (D. Mass. Sept. 26, 2007)\n\n(\"D. Ct. Op.\").     In that rescript, the court agreed with SE&D that\n\nsection 1927 does not authorize sanctions for the filing of an\n\ninitial complaint, even if that complaint is groundless.               Id. at\n\n*2-3.       It   determined,    however,      that   SE&D   had   engaged   in\n\nsanctionable conduct vis-à-vis each of the other three erstwhile\n\nplaintiffs.      Id. at *3-4.        To consummate this determination, the\n\ncourt directed Phillips to file an itemized account of counsel fees\n\nand expenses incident to those phases of the litigation.               Id. at\n\n*5.\n\n            SE&D moved for reconsideration, accompanying its motion\n\nwith copious if belated evidentiary submissions.                  Among other\n\n\n\n        3\n      SE&D's version derived from a telephone call between an SE&D\nattorney, Robert M. Kirkpatrick, and Vanlandingham himself, in\nwhich the latter reportedly recalled having given SE&D permission\nto name him as a plaintiff.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthings, it proffered affidavits from two SE&D attorneys, Robert C.\n\nBigelow    and     M.    Reid     Estes,     Jr.,    explaining    SE&D's     general\n\nprofessionalism and the particular procedures followed by the firm\n\nin     recruiting       Vanlandingham        and     Cox;    an    affidavit     from\n\nVanlandingham vouchsafing that he had given SE&D permission to name\n\nhim as a plaintiff; and an affidavit from Cox asserting that he\n\nrepeatedly, though mistakenly, had told SE&D that he had used\n\nPhillips screws to build his deck. Phillips opposed the motion for\n\nreconsideration as too late and too little.                   The district court\n\nsummarily denied the motion.\n\n            In due course, Phillips filed its account.                  The district\n\ncourt, as a sanction, awarded attorneys' fees and expenses totaling\n\n$8,775.    This timely appeal followed.               In it, SE&D challenges the\n\nappropriateness of sanctions and certain procedural aspects of the\n\ndistrict court proceedings.             SE&D does not challenge the amount of\n\nthe award.\n\nIII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            We subdivide our analysis into seven short segments. Our\n\nstarting    point       is   a    synopsis    of    the   legal   and   evidentiary\n\nprinciples    attendant          to   appellate     review   of   sanctions    orders\n\nimposed under 28 U.S.C. § 1927.                     We then briefly address a\n\nprocedural complaint advanced by SE&D.                 From there, we proceed to\n\nconsider the various phases of the litigation in chronological\n\norder.\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f                       A. The Legal Landscape.\n\n            In awarding sanctions, the district court acted under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1927. The statute permits sanctions to be imposed against\n\nlawyers who \"multipl[y] the proceedings . . . unreasonably and\n\nvexatiously.\"\n\n            In this circuit, courts use a mainly objective standard\n\nfor   the   purpose   of   determining   when   a   lawyer's   actions   are\n\nunreasonable or vexatious.      See Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 632\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that \"[b]ehavior is vexatious when it\n\nis harassing or annoying, regardless of whether it is intended to\n\nbe so\" (emphasis supplied)).      This focus on objective measurement\n\ncomports with the majority view across the circuits.            See, e.g.,\n\nAmlong & Amlong, P.A. v. Denny's, Inc., 500 F.3d 1230, 1241 (11th\n\nCir. 2007); Salkil v. Mt. Sterling Police Dep't, 458 F.3d 520, 532\n\n(6th Cir. 2006); Jolly Group, Ltd. v. Medline Indus., Inc., 435\n\nF.3d 717, 720 (7th Cir. 2006); Julien v. Zeringue, 864 F.2d 1572,\n\n1575 (Fed. Cir. 1989).\n\n            Garden-variety carelessness or even incompetence, without\n\nmore, will not suffice to ground the imposition of sanctions under\n\nsection 1927.    Rather, an attorney's actions must evince a studied\n\ndisregard of the need for an orderly judicial process, see Jolly\n\nGroup, 435 F.3d at 720, or add up to a reckless breach of the\n\nlawyer's obligations as an officer of the court, see Salkil, 458\n\nF.3d at 532; Braley v. Campbell, 832 F.2d 1504, 1512 (10th Cir.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f1987).   Bad faith is not an essential element, but a finding of bad\n\nfaith is usually a telltale indicium of sanctionable conduct. See,\n\ne.g., FDIC v. Cooper, 20 F.3d 1376, 1385 (5th Cir. 1994); Cruz, 896\n\nF.2d at 631.\n\n           Our standard of review is familiar. We review a district\n\ncourt's imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. See Cruz,\n\n896 F.2d at 632.    This standard is not appellant-friendly, and \"a\n\nsanctioned litigant bears a weighty burden in attempting to show\n\nthat an abuse occurred.\"     Young v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    To shoulder that burden, the sanctioned litigant must\n\nestablish that the sanctioning court ignored \"a material factor\n\ndeserving significant weight,\" or that its decision rested upon \"an\n\nimproper factor,\" or that it considered all the appropriate factors\n\nbut made \"a serious mistake in weighing them.\"          Vélez v. Awning\n\nWindows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).         Of course, if a\n\ndiscretionary decision rests on an error of law, that is perforce\n\nan abuse of discretion.    See Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel, 524\n\nF.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Before   attempting   to   evaluate   the   district   court's\n\nsanctions order, we pause to clarify an evidentiary issue that is\n\npertinent here.     A sanctions order must be evaluated on appeal in\n\nlight of the record that was before the district court at the time\n\nthe order issued.     Cf. McMillan v. Mass. SPCA, 140 F.3d 288, 309\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (limiting appellate review of summary judgment\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdecision to \"only those facts that were available at the summary\n\njudgment stage\"). In defiance of this principle, SE&D has premised\n\nmany of its appellate arguments on an array of facts mined from\n\nattachments to its motion for reconsideration.         But those facts\n\nwere not before the district court when it issued the sanctions\n\norder.   Because a court's factual findings must be tested in light\n\nof the information available to the court when it ruled, we reject\n\nSE&D's back-door attempt to reconfigure the record.\n\n                 B.    Entitlement to Oral Argument.\n\n           Citing our decision in Media Duplication Services, Inc.,\n\nv. HDG Software, Inc., 928 F.2d 1228 (1st Cir. 1991), SE&D contends\n\nthat the district court made an error that tainted every aspect of\n\nits order when it declined to hear oral argument before imposing\n\nsanctions.   That contention is groundless.\n\n           In the first place, the case that SE&D cites holds only\n\nthat, as a matter of due process, a trial court ordinarily may not\n\nimpose sanctions on a party without giving that party notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard.    See id. at 1238.   Here, however, SE&D was\n\ngiven ample notice; indeed, Phillips filed an aposematic motion.\n\nAs a result, SE&D had a full opportunity to set out its side of the\n\nmatter in a written response.    Had it opted to do so, it could have\n\nsubmitted additional affidavits or evidentiary materials as part of\n\nthat response.    In the usual course, matters can adequately be\n\nheard on the papers.    See EEOC v. S.S. Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fF.3d 594, 609 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that dispositive motions may\n\nbe \"heard\" on the papers because due process does not require \"any\n\nparticular kind of hearing\"); Domegan v. Fair, 859 F.2d 1059, 1065\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (explaining that \"district courts have considerable\n\ndiscretion in deciding whether or not to allow oral argument on a\n\ndispositive motion\").            So it is here.\n\n                     C.    Naming Jensen as a Plaintiff.\n\n          We begin our march through the ranks of the putative\n\nclass representatives with Thomas Jensen.                SE&D's enlistment of\n\nJensen   as    the    initial        class   representative      proved   to    be\n\nimprovident.    Nevertheless, the district court declined to impose\n\nsanctions with respect to that phase of litigation.                 Reading the\n\nunvarnished    text       of    section   1927,   the   court   determined     that\n\nsanctions were not available under that statute for activity\n\nassociated with the initial filing of a complaint.                  D. Ct. Op.,\n\n2007 WL 3104626, at *2.\n\n          We agree with the district court's reasoning.                         The\n\ntouchstone of all statutory construction is the wording of the\n\nstatute under review.            See Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. & Customs Enf.,\n\n510 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007); Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock, 352 F.3d\n\n16, 25 (1st Cir. 2003).            Here, the plain language of the statute\n\nrestricts its operation to acts that \"multipl[y]\" the proceedings.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1927.              Commencing a proceeding is not the same as\n\nmultiplying a proceeding. In our view, then, Congress's use of the\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fverb \"multipl[y]\" in the text of the statute clearly contemplates\n\nthat, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have an effect on\n\nan already initiated proceeding. Consequently, we join an unbroken\n\nband of cases across the courts of appeals holding that a lawyer\n\ncannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action.\n\nSee, e.g., Steinert v. Winn Group, Inc., 440 F.3d 1214, 1224 (10th\n\nCir. 2006); MEMC Elec. Mat'ls, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Mat'ls Silicone\n\nCorp., 420 F.3d 1369, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2005); DeBauche v. Trani, 191\n\nF.3d 499, 511 (4th Cir. 1999); Zul v. E. Pa. Psych. Inst., 103 F.3d\n\n294, 297 (3d Cir. 1996); In re Keegan Mgmt. Co., 78 F.3d 431, 435\n\n(9th Cir. 1996). We therefore affirm the district court's decision\n\nthat sanctions under section 1927 were not available for any\n\nalleged failure on SE&D's part to vet Jensen or investigate the\n\nbona fides of his claim.\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear about two related points.\n\nFirst, we limit this holding to section 1927.   Shoddy work related\n\nto the commencement of an action may be sanctionable under other\n\napproaches.   See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.   Second, to the extent\n\nthat SE&D knew or should have known of Jensen's weaknesses as a\n\nlead plaintiff, those weaknesses may inform the question of whether\n\nSE&D was guilty down the line of unreasonably and vexatiously\n\nmultiplying the proceedings.   See Bowler v. U.S. INS, 901 F. Supp.\n\n597, 605 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (noting that section 1927 exists to punish\n\na course of conduct, not merely individual acts).\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f            D.   Naming Vanlandingham as a Plaintiff.\n\n            When it ruled on the motion for sanctions, the district\n\ncourt had before it the parties' legal memoranda.                        It also had\n\nbefore it four main sources of raw factual information anent\n\nVanlandingham: (i) its own observations concerning what had taken\n\nplace; (ii) the Sable affidavit; (iii) SE&D's response to the Sable\n\naffidavit, which contained among other things a recitation of a\n\ntelephone    conversation        that    supposedly        had   taken   place      with\n\nVanlandingham, see supra note 2; and (iv) the bare fact that\n\nVanlandingham's     name    was        withdrawn     six    weeks    after     it   was\n\nproffered. The district court explicitly refused to accept \"either\n\nparty's hearsay version of Mr. VanLandingham's statements,\" D. Ct.\n\nOp., 2007 WL 3104625, at *3, which seemingly eliminated everything\n\nexcept    the    first     and     fourth       sources      of     information.4\n\n            On this slender predicate, the court concluded that SE&D\n\nwas either \"unaware\" of Vanlandingham's reluctance to litigate or\n\n\"persisted in naming him . . . regardless.\"                  Id.    Either way, the\n\ncourt    believed   that   the     naming       of   Vanlandingham       was   an   act\n\ndeserving of sanctions.          Id.\n\n            If the lower court had relied simply on Vanlandingham's\n\nseeming unwillingness to proceed and reasonable inferences drawn\n\nfrom the sequencing of the pleadings, that would have been too\n\n\n     4\n       The district court declined to bolster its conclusion anent\nSE&D's carelessness by referring to SE&D's \"course of conduct\" vis-\nà-vis Jensen.\n\n                                         -14-\n\flittle to underpin a sanctions order.            From that exiguous showing,\n\nthe   court    had   no   reliable   way    of   knowing   whether   SE&D   had\n\ndisregarded      Vanlandingham's       wishes      from    the     start    or,\n\nalternatively, had been taken by surprise when he performed an\n\nabout-face.      Furthermore, such an about-face, unexplained, could\n\nnot support a finding of sanctionable conduct.             See McLane, Graf,\n\nRaulerson & Middleton, P.A. v. Rechberger, 280 F.3d 26, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (noting that sanctions under section 1927 require a\n\nshowing that the conduct \"be more severe than mere negligence,\n\ninadvertence, or incompetence\").           After all, a party can turn on a\n\ndime, change his mind, and decide to pursue settlement rather than\n\nlitigation without any fault attaching to his counsel.\n\n              Presumably recognizing the need to fill this gap, the\n\ndistrict court appears (albeit implicitly) to have credited the\n\nhearsay allegations limned in the Sable affidavit.               The court did\n\nso notwithstanding its avowed unwillingness to rely upon hearsay\n\naccounts.      While credibility determinations ordinarily are grist\n\nfor the district court's mill — the court, as trier of the facts,\n\ncan choose to believe one version of events and disbelieve the\n\nother, see, e.g., Fed. Refin., 352 F.3d at 27 — the court must\n\napply its methodology uniformly. Thus, it cannot reject one side's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fevidence on hearsay grounds while overlooking the same defect in\n\nthe other side's proffer.5\n\n            We need not belabor the point.      The short of it is that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in reaching the sanctions\n\ndetermination with respect to this phase of the litigation.\n\n                       E.   Naming Cox as a Plaintiff.\n\n            In    an   affidavit   submitted   prior   to   the   sanctions\n\ndetermination, an SE&D attorney, Robert Gore, swore that a pre-suit\n\ninspection of Cox's deck showed corrosion of fasteners made by\n\nPhillips.        Notwithstanding this affidavit, the district court\n\ndeclared that SE&D had conceded that it moved to name Cox as a\n\nplaintiff without any such inspection having taken place.               The\n\nrecord contains no proof of such a concession.\n\n            The closet thing in the record is the following.             In\n\nopposing sanctions SE&D relied primarily on Cox's statements rather\n\nthan its own inspection.        But the effect of this strategic choice\n\nis tempered by the fact that SE&D was responding to Phillips's\n\nmotion — and Phillips had not challenged SE&D's performance of an\n\ninspection but only the reasonableness of its overall inquiry.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we hardly think that this can be termed a\n\n\"concession\" by SE&D that its earlier statement was false.\n\n\n     5\n       We do not suggest that the rules of evidence necessarily\napply to factfinding in the context of sanctions. That is not the\ncase. See, e.g., Cook v. Am. S.S. Co., 134 F.3d 771, 774 (6th Cir.\n1998). But to the extent that a court applies those rules, it must\ndo so even-handedly.\n\n                                     -16-\n\f          That effectively ends this aspect of the matter.   Where,\n\nas here, a court relies explicitly on a non-fact to make a factual\n\ndetermination, that reliance constitutes an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Vélez 375 F.3d at 42.         It follows that, insofar as the\n\nsanctions order relates to SE&D's efforts in connection with\n\nintroducing Cox as the lead plaintiff, the order must be revisited.\n\n                   F.   Naming Damm as a Plaintiff.\n\n          The district court determined that SE&D had committed\n\nsanctionable acts in connection with the abortive filing of the\n\nmotion to substitute Damm as the named plaintiff and putative class\n\nrepresentative.    SE&D contends that this determination lacks any\n\nfactual or legal basis.\n\n          The unique position occupied by a trial judge gives her\n\nan intimate familiarity with the ebb and flow of the cases on her\n\ndocket.   Appellate courts recognize, therefore, that they must\n\ndefer in large measure to a trial judge's \"first-line authority for\n\ncase-management decisions.\"    Torres v. Puerto Rico, 485 F.3d 5, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).   Orders granting or denying sanctions fall within\n\nthat taxonomy.    See, e.g., Roasrio-Diaz v. González, 140 F.3d 312,\n\n314 (1st Cir. 1998).    Consequently, appellate courts \"step softly\"\n\nwhen reviewing the imposition of sanctions.    United States v. One\n\n1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Given the trial judge's special coign of vantage, common\n\nsense suggests that she must be accorded wide latitude in drawing\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\finferences as to when multiplication of the proceedings crosses the\n\nline between what is acceptable if tedious and what is unreasonable\n\nand vexatious.      The case law so indicates.        See, e.g., Rosario-\n\nDiaz, 140 F.3d at 315; Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 1993).       Distinguishing between what is a vigorous but\n\nreasonable attempt to salvage a case that is going badly and a\n\nstubbornly capricious attempt to gain advantage by prolonging\n\nmatters is not easy.       There will be a certain class of cases in\n\nwhich the facts may support either characterization.                 In that\n\nmiddle ground, the abuse of discretion standard tips the balance in\n\nfavor of the trial court's view.            See Anderson v. Beatrice Foods\n\nCo., 900 F.2d 388, 393-94 (1st Cir. 1990); In re San Juan Dupont\n\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir. 1988).              It\n\nmay   well   be   that   the   proposed   substitution   of   Damm   and   the\n\nsubsequent dismissal without explanation of the action under the\n\ncircumstances could support an imposition of sanctions.\n\n             Here, however, there is a rub.       As we understand it, the\n\ndistrict court premised its finding of sanctionable conduct vis-à-\n\nvis Damm at least in part on its findings that SE&D had engaged in\n\nsanctionable conduct with respect to two other plaintiffs.            See D.\n\nCt. Op., 2007 WL 3104625, at *4.; cf. Obert v. Repub. W. Ins. Co.,\n\n398 F.3d 138, 146 (1st Cir. 2005) (acknowledging that sanctions\n\nmight be appropriate for a series of \"hopeless motions,\" but\n\nwarning that imposing sanctions \"routinely\" for easy filing of such\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fa motion \"would tie courts and counsel in knots\").                 Because we have\n\nset aside those precursor findings (at least for now), see supra\n\nParts III(D)-(E), we must set aside this cumulative finding as\n\nwell.   See Local Div. 589, Amalg. Transit Union v. Massachusetts,\n\n666 F.2d 618, 645 (1st Cir. 1981) (remanding preliminary injunction\n\norder     for    reconsideration         where     order    was     predicated        on\n\n\"uncontradicted           affidavit\"   that     appellate   court    found      to    be\n\ndisputed).      The district court can, of course, revisit this aspect\n\nof the matter on remand.\n\n                     G.    The Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n            SE&D's final plaint is that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion      in   denying     its    motion    for   reconsideration      of      the\n\nsanctions order. Because we have determined that the order must be\n\nvacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings, this\n\nassignment of error has become moot.\n\n            In the interest of good practice, we add a coda.                    When a\n\nmotion for sanctions is made, the target has an obligation to put\n\nits best foot forward.           It cannot hang back and withhold evidence\n\nhelpful    to    its       position    merely    because    it    hopes   (or     even\n\nanticipates) that the district court will hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing. Such hearings are matters of discretion, see, e.g., In re\n\nThirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire\n\nLitig., 56 F.3d 295, 301-02 (1st Cir. 1995), and it will be rare\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fthat a court of appeals will meddle with a district court's\n\ndecision to forgo an evidentiary hearing on a motion for sanctions.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           To recapitulate, we affirm the district court's ruling as\n\nto the inapplicability of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 to the initial pleading\n\nherein.   See supra Part III(C).    But although the able district\n\njudge had ample reasons to chafe at the way in which SE&D conducted\n\nthe plaintiffs' side of this litigation, we are constrained, for\n\nthe reasons elucidated above, to vacate the remainder of the\n\nsanctions order.    We remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n           We envision that the district court, on remand, will\n\nafford the parties a further opportunity to submit materials in\n\nsupport of their respective positions.    Whether to entertain oral\n\nargument and/or convene an evidentiary hearing remains within the\n\ninformed discretion of the district court.    Nothing that we have\n\nseen in the record thus far convinces us that SE&D's actions are or\n\nare not sanctionable.     Consequently, we take no view on the\n\nappropriate outcome of those incremental proceedings.\n\n           Although we need go no further, we think it advisable to\n\nmention another possibility.    The battle that is presently being\n\nfought is obviously about principle, not money (experience suggests\n\nthat each side has spent more than the dollar amount of the\n\nsanctions in briefing and arguing this appeal).     As a matter of\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fmutual interest, the time may have come for the protagonists to\n\ncall it quits.   On the one hand, Phillips prevailed in the district\n\ncourt and can credibly claim a moral victory.    On the other hand,\n\nSE&D has prevailed in large part on this appeal and, at this point,\n\nhas erased the stain on its escutcheon.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. All parties shall\n\nbear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                   - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f           BOUDIN, Circuit Judge (concurring). The sanction in this\n\ncase rested, it appears, not upon a single act but on a cumulative\n\ncourse of conduct: the successive proffer and then abandonment of\n\nfour successive lead plaintiffs; an inference of inadequate and\n\narguably careless investigation in most or all of these four\n\ninstances; and the suspicious failure to explain at all why the\n\nfourth plaintiff was withdrawn.          That the result--a defunct law\n\nsuit--wasted court time and imposed litigation costs on the defense\n\ncan scarcely be doubted.\n\n           The record permits a finding of recurring negligence.\n\nThe first plaintiff had settled before the case was brought; the\n\nsecond, even if he originally consented to proceed, does not seem\n\nto have had any serious commitment to the case; the third had not\n\nused    Phillips   screws;   and   the     fourth   was   pulled   without\n\nexplanation--the fair inference being that problems had again been\n\nbelatedly identified. True, the firm later offered new exculpatory\n\naffidavits, but the district court permissibly declined to consider\n\nthem.\n\n           The law is thin as to whether the vexatious litigation\n\nstatute is violated by successive acts of negligence, doubtlessly\n\nprolonging the litigation but aimed (however fumbling the efforts)\n\nat success on the merits rather than harassment.           The cases say\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fthat simple negligence is not enough6 but, where the facts involve\n\nsuccessive     acts   of   negligence,         the    courts    sometimes    uphold\n\nsanctions, using the phrase \"bad faith\" but without any indication\n\nthat it rests on more than repeated error.7                    Here, the district\n\ncourt's comment on the firm's affidavit about the deck inspection\n\nsuggests that the judge thought it worse than mere negligence.\n\n           Nevertheless,         strictly      speaking   it    is   possible   (if\n\nunlikely) that the second plaintiff (VanLandingham)--was originally\n\non board with qualification and then simply reversed course; and\n\nwhile the firm's initial affidavit on the suitability of Cox as the\n\nthird lead plaintiff is no model of clarity (e.g., as to who\n\nsupposedly did the deck inspection), it is hard to tell without\n\nmore facts whether it was also disingenuous--as the district judge\n\nimplied--or just what inquiries the firm had made.\n\n           There is a good deal of carelessness in litigation and,\n\nwhere the trial judge thinks the situation is serious enough to\n\ntake the time for sanctions, the judge on the scene is entitled to\n\na healthy latitude in making the ultimate judgment.                    Still, the\n\nstakes   are   high   when   a    law   firm     is   sanctioned     for    improper\n\nbehavior, Obert v. Republic Western Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 138, 143\n\n\n     6\n      See, e.g., United States v. Wallace, 964 F.2d 1214, 1219\n(D.C. Cir. 1992); Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir.\n1990); In re Ruben, 825 F.2d 977, 984 (6th Cir. 1987).\n     7\n      O'Rear v. American Family Life Assur.

Ill. 1985).\n\n                                        -23-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005), and the risk remains that sanctions may be sought\n\nfor tactical reasons--for example, to discourage litigation.\n\n          There having been no evidentiary hearing, the lack of\n\nclarity in the record can justify a remand, especially as our\n\nprecedents on fault-based lawyer sanctions have been fairly strict.\n\nObert, 398 F.3d at 146-47; Young v. City of Providence, 404 F.3d\n\n33, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2005).    It would be a different matter if,\n\nafter Cox had been withdrawn, the district court had held that\n\nthree strikes were enough and simply declined to allow any further\n\namendment.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

Lawyers who overstep it do so at their peril. In the case before us, the district court found that a law firm had crossed the line by unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings in a class action. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Accordingly, the court imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p>The law firm appeals from the sanctions order. It argues, first, that the record fails to disclose any sanctionable conduct and that, in all events, the district court made mistakes both in finding the facts and in gauging their import. As a fallback, the firm maintains that, even if its principal argument does not carry the day, the district court nonetheless abused its discretion in refusing to reconsider the sanctions order on a supplemented record.

Consequently, we decide only one of the further questions presented, vacate the sanctions order, and remand for a new round of proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION</h2>\n<p>The genesis of this case seemed ordinary enough; it began with the filing of a class-action complaint by the law firm of Stewart, Estes &amp; Donnell, P.L.C. (\"SE &amp; D\") on behalf of Thomas R. Jensen and (unnamed) others similarly situated. The complaint designated two related corporations, Phillips Screw Company and Phillips Fastener Products, Inc. (collectively, \"Phillips\") as defendants and alleged that screws manufactured and marketed by them for use with pressure-treated wood suffered from an undisclosed propensity for premature failure in certain relatively commonplace circumstances.</p>\n<p>As matters turned out, Jensen had previously contacted Phillips about his claims and had received at least partial satisfaction for them (the record is opaque as to whether SE &amp; D knew or should have known as much before filing suit). Given this circumstance, Phillips raised an affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction in its answer to the complaint. Along the same line, it argued at an early scheduling conference with the district court that Jensen's vulnerability to this defense rendered him an inappropriate class representative.</p>\n<p>The district court agreed; it gave SE &amp; D six weeks (i.e., until January 30, 2007) to amend the complaint to add a new named plaintiff. The court subsequently granted SE &amp; D's request for a short extension of that deadline.</p>\n<p>Within the allotted time, the law firm moved to file an amended complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> adding a second plaintiff, Larry Vanlandingham. SE &amp; D implied that Vanlandingham would make a superior class representative because he not only had encountered problems when he used Phillips screws in the construction of a deck but also (unlike Jensen) had eschewed a private settlement.</p>\n<p>As a Scottish poet once warned, even the most carefully contrived plans may sometimes implode.<sup>[2]</sup> Six weeks after moving to add Vanlandingham as its new champion and before the district court ruled on that motion, SE &amp; D abruptly retreated. This time, it moved to forgo Vanlandingham's entry into the lists because, in the law firm's words, \"circumstances have arisen ... which may compromise the ability of [Vanlandingham] to act on behalf of the class.\" Phillips opposed this motion and sought dismissal of the action. It explained in an attached affidavit the nature of the \"circumstances\" to which SE &amp; D had alluded. The affiant, Gary M. Sable, a Phillips executive, recounted that Vanlandingham's wife, Gayle, had told him (Sable) that she and her husband did not wish to sue but, rather, preferred to reach a private accommodation with the company. According to Sable, Gayle Vanlandingham expressed surprise that her husband's name had been put forward in the class action, noting that neither she nor he had engaged counsel. Neither of them, she added, harbored any desire to become involved in litigation. Sable went on to quote Gayle Vanlandingham as saying that when she and her husband expressed their concerns to SE &amp; D, they were told that Phillips would not honor a warranty claim in the absence of legal action.</p>\n<p>At that juncture SE &amp; D did not directly dispute Phillips's allegations. In a responsive pleading, it argued instead that the Sable affidavit constituted hearsay and attributed any change of heart on the part of the Vanlandinghams to Phillips's influence.</p>\n<p>In this exchange of pleadings, SE &amp; D gave top billing to the new candidate whom it had recruited to fill the named plaintiff position: Emmett Cox. SE &amp; D asserted that Cox would be an appropriate class representative because an inspection of his deck had \"indicated substantial premature corrosion of fasteners manufactured by [Phillips].\" Although expressing some skepticism about SE &amp; D's methods, the district court allowed the motiona ruling that had the effect of shelving Vanlandingham and inserting Cox as a named plaintiff and putative class representative.</p>\n<p>Over the next several months, it became apparent that, notwithstanding SE &amp; D's prior assurances, Cox had used a brand of screws not manufactured by Phillips in constructing his deck. When that conclusion became irresistible, SE &amp; D moved to drop Cox as a plaintiff and to amend the complaint yet again. This proposed amendment sought to substitute Timothy Scott Damm in Cox's place and stead.</p>\n<p>Once burned is twice shy. This time the district court gave SE &amp; D two weeks (i.e., until September 13, 2007) within which to file a detailed written statement describing Damm's qualifications as a class-action plaintiff and putative class representative. SE &amp; D never proffered such a statement. At the end of the two-week grace period, it withdrew its motion to amend and terminated the class action in the federal court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. SANCTIONS</h2>\n<p>Throwing in the sponge on the class action did not end the matter. Invoking 28 U.S.C. § 1927, Phillips moved for an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> award of sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees and expenses. In support of its motion, Phillips argued that SE &amp; D had never undertaken a reasonably thorough investigation into the bona fides of any of its four proposed class representatives but had simply plunged ahead with devil-may-care abandon.</p>\n<p>SE &amp; D demurred. The law firm posited that sanctions under section 1927 were inappropriate vis-à-vis the initial filing of a complaint; that two of the putative class representatives, Vanlandingham and Damm, were withdrawn before any excess costs accrued; and that if any shortcomings characterized its performanceand it conceded nonethose shortcomings were not of the magnitude required for the imposition of sanctions. In framing its opposition, SE &amp; D for the first time directly contradicted Phillips's account of Vanlandingham's appearance on the scene.<sup>[3]</sup> As to Cox, SE &amp; D pointed to his reputed statement that he had purchased Phillips screws to justify its initial assertion that he was an appropriate plaintiff.</p>\n<p>Although SE &amp; D had requested oral argument, the district court rejected that request. Then, eschewing an evidentiary hearing, it filed a written decision. <i>See Jensen v. Phillips Screw Co.,</i> Civ. No. 05-12117, 2007 WL 3104625 (D.Mass. Sept. 26, 2007) (<i>\"D.Ct.Op.\"</i>). In that rescript, the court agreed with SE &amp; D that section 1927 does not authorize sanctions for the filing of an initial complaint, even if that complaint is groundless. <i>Id.</i> at *2-3. It determined, however, that SE &amp; D had engaged in sanctionable conduct vis-à-vis each of the other three erstwhile plaintiffs. <i>Id.</i> at *3-4. To consummate this determination, the court directed Phillips to file an itemized account of counsel fees and expenses incident to those phases of the litigation. <i>Id.</i> at *5.</p>\n<p>SE &amp; D moved for reconsideration, accompanying its motion with copious if belated evidentiary submissions. Among other things, it proffered affidavits from two SE &amp; D attorneys, Robert C. Bigelow and M. Reid Estes, Jr., explaining SE &amp; D's general professionalism and the particular procedures followed by the firm in recruiting Vanlandingham and Cox; an affidavit from Vanlandingham vouchsafing that he had given SE &amp; D permission to name him as a plaintiff; and an affidavit from Cox asserting that he repeatedly, though mistakenly, had told SE &amp; D that he had used Phillips screws to build his deck. Phillips opposed the motion for reconsideration as too late and too little. The district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n<p>In due course, Phillips filed its account. The district court, as a sanction, awarded attorneys' fees and expenses totaling $8,775. This timely appeal followed. In it, SE &amp; D challenges the appropriateness of sanctions and certain procedural aspects of the district court proceedings. SE &amp; D does not challenge the amount of the award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We subdivide our analysis into seven short segments. Our starting point is a synopsis of the legal and evidentiary principles attendant to appellate review of sanctions orders imposed under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. We then briefly address a procedural complaint advanced by SE &amp; D. From there, we proceed to consider the various phases of the litigation in chronological order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> A. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In awarding sanctions, the district court acted under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. The statute permits sanctions to be imposed against lawyers who \"multipl[y] the proceedings... unreasonably and vexatiously.\"</p>\n<p>In this circuit, courts use a mainly objective standard for the purpose of determining when a lawyer's actions are unreasonable or vexatious. <i>See </i><i>Cruz v. Savage,</i> 896 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"[b]ehavior is vexatious when it is harassing or annoying, <i>regardless of whether it is intended to be so</i>\" (emphasis supplied)). This focus on objective measurement comports with the majority view across the circuits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny's, Inc.,</i> 500 F.3d 1230, 1241 (11th Cir.2007); <i>Salkil v. Mt. Sterling Tp. Police Dep't,</i> 458 F.3d 520, 532 (6th Cir.2006); <i>Jolly Group, Ltd. v. Medline Indus., Inc.,</i> 435 F.3d 717, 720 (7th Cir.2006); <i>Julien v. Zeringue,</i> 864 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>Garden-variety carelessness or even incompetence, without more, will not suffice to ground the imposition of sanctions under section 1927. Rather, an attorney's actions must evince a studied disregard of the need for an orderly judicial process, <i>see </i><i>Jolly Group,</i> 435 F.3d at 720, or add up to a reckless breach of the lawyer's obligations as an officer of the court, <i>see </i><i>Salkil,</i> 458 F.3d at 532; <i>Braley v. Campbell,</i> 832 F.2d 1504, 1512 (10th Cir.1987). Bad faith is not an essential element, but a finding of bad faith is usually a telltale indicium of sanctionable conduct. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FDIC v. Conner,</i> 20 F.3d 1376, 1385 (5th Cir.1994); <i>Cruz,</i> 896 F.2d at 631.</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is familiar. We review a district court's imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cruz,</i> 896 F.2d at 632. This standard is not appellant-friendly, and \"a sanctioned litigant bears a weighty burden in attempting to show that an abuse occurred.\" <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.2003). To shoulder that burden, the sanctioned litigant must establish that the sanctioning court ignored \"a material factor deserving significant weight,\" or that its decision rested upon \"an improper factor,\" or that it considered all the appropriate factors but made \"a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> 375 F.3d 35, 42 (1st Cir.2004). Of course, if a discretionary decision rests on an error of law, that is perforce an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> 524 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>Before attempting to evaluate the district court's sanctions order, we pause to clarify an evidentiary issue that is pertinent here. A sanctions order must be evaluated on appeal in light of the record that was before the district court at the time the order issued. <i>Cf. </i><i>McMillan v. Mass. SPCA,</i> 140 F.3d 288, 309 (1st Cir. 1998) (limiting appellate review of summary judgment decision to \"only those facts that were available at the summary judgment stage\"). In defiance of this principle, SE &amp; D has premised many of its appellate arguments on an array of facts mined from attachments to its motion for reconsideration. But those facts were not before the district court when it issued the sanctions order. Because a court's factual findings must be tested in light of the information available to the court when it ruled, we reject SE &amp; D's back-door attempt to reconfigure the record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Entitlement to Oral Argument.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Citing our decision in <i>Media Duplication Services, Inc., v. HDG Software, Inc.,</i> 928 F.2d 1228 (1st Cir.1991), SE &amp; D <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> contends that the district court made an error that tainted every aspect of its order when it declined to hear oral argument before imposing sanctions. That contention is groundless.</p>\n<p>In the first place, the case that SE &amp; D cites holds only that, as a matter of due process, a trial court ordinarily may not impose sanctions on a party without giving that party notice and an opportunity to be heard. <i>See id.</i> at 1238. Here, however, SE &amp; D was given ample notice; indeed, Phillips filed an aposematic motion. As a result, SE &amp; D had a full opportunity to set out its side of the matter in a written response. Had it opted to do so, it could have submitted additional affidavits or evidentiary materials as part of that response. In the usual course, matters can adequately be heard on the papers. <i>See </i><i>EEOC v. S.S. Clerks Union, Local 1066,</i> 48 F.3d 594, 609 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that dispositive motions may be \"heard\" on the papers because due process does not require \"any particular kind of hearing\"); <i>Domegan v. Fair,</i> 859 F.2d 1059, 1065 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that \"district courts have considerable discretion in deciding whether or not to allow oral argument on a dispositive motion\"). So it is here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Naming Jensen as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin our march through the ranks of the putative class representatives with Thomas Jensen. SE &amp; D's enlistment of Jensen as the initial class representative proved to be improvident. Nevertheless, the district court declined to impose sanctions with respect to that phase of litigation. Reading the unvarnished text of section 1927, the court determined that sanctions were not available under that statute for activity associated with the initial filing of a complaint. <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> 2007 WL 3104626, at *2.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court's reasoning. The touchstone of all statutory construction is the wording of the statute under review. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. &amp; Customs Enf.,</i> 510 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> 352 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the plain language of the statute restricts its operation to acts that \"multipl[y]\" the proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Commencing a proceeding is not the same as multiplying a proceeding. In our view, then, Congress's use of the verb \"multipl[y]\" in the text of the statute clearly contemplates that, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have an effect on an already initiated proceeding. Consequently, we join an unbroken band of cases across the courts of appeals holding that a lawyer cannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Steinert v. Winn Group, Inc.,</i> 440 F.3d 1214, 1224 (10th Cir.2006); <i>MEMC Elec. Mat'ls, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Mat'ls Silicone Corp.,</i> 420 F.3d 1369, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2005); <i>DeBauche v. Trani,</i> 191 F.3d 499, 511 (4th Cir.1999); <i>Zuk v. E. Pa. Psych. Inst.,</i> 103 F.3d 294, 297 (3d Cir.1996); <i>In re Keegan Mgmt. Co.,</i> 78 F.3d 431, 435 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore affirm the district court's decision that sanctions under section 1927 were not available for any alleged failure on SE &amp; D's part to vet Jensen or investigate the bona fides of his claim.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear about two related points. First, we limit this holding to section 1927. Shoddy work related to the commencement of an action may be sanctionable under other approaches. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. Second, to the extent that SE &amp; D knew or should have known of Jensen's weaknesses as a lead plaintiff, those weaknesses may inform the question of whether SE &amp; D was guilty down the line of unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> <i>Bowler v. U.S. INS,</i> 901 F.Supp. 597, 605 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (noting that section 1927 exists to punish a course of conduct, not merely individual acts).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Naming Vanlandingham as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When it ruled on the motion for sanctions, the district court had before it the parties' legal memoranda. It also had before it four main sources of raw factual information anent Vanlandingham: (i) its own observations concerning what had taken place; (ii) the Sable affidavit; (iii) SE &amp; D's response to the Sable affidavit, which contained among other things a recitation of a telephone conversation that supposedly had taken place with Vanlandingham, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and (iv) the bare fact that Vanlandingham's name was withdrawn six weeks after it was proffered. The district court explicitly refused to accept \"either party's hearsay version of Mr. VanLandingham's statements,\" <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> 2007 WL 3104625, at *3, which seemingly eliminated everything except the first and fourth sources of information.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On this slender predicate, the court concluded that SE &amp; D was either \"unaware\" of Vanlandingham's reluctance to litigate or \"persisted in naming him ... regardless.\" <i>Id.</i> Either way, the court believed that the naming of Vanlandingham was an act deserving of sanctions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>If the lower court had relied simply on Vanlandingham's seeming unwillingness to proceed and reasonable inferences drawn from the sequencing of the pleadings, that would have been too little to underpin a sanctions order. From that exiguous showing, the court had no reliable way of knowing whether SE &amp; D had disregarded Vanlandingham's wishes from the start or, alternatively, had been taken by surprise when he performed an about-face. Furthermore, such an about-face, unexplained, could not support a finding of sanctionable conduct. <i>See </i><i>McLane, Graf, Raulerson &amp; Middleton, P.A. v. Rechberger,</i> 280 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that sanctions under section 1927 require a showing that the conduct \"be more severe than mere negligence, inadvertence, or incompetence\"). After all, a party can turn on a dime, change his mind, and decide to pursue settlement rather than litigation without any fault attaching to his counsel.</p>\n<p>Presumably recognizing the need to fill this gap, the district court appears (albeit implicitly) to have credited the hearsay allegations limned in the Sable affidavit. The court did so notwithstanding its avowed unwillingness to rely upon hearsay accounts. While credibility determinations ordinarily are grist for the district court's millthe court, as trier of the facts, can choose to believe one version of events and disbelieve the other, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 352 F.3d at 27the court must apply its methodology uniformly. Thus, it cannot reject one side's evidence on hearsay grounds while overlooking the same defect in the other side's proffer.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We need not belabor the point. The short of it is that the district court abused its discretion in reaching the sanctions determination with respect to this phase of the litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> E. <i>Naming Cox as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In an affidavit submitted prior to the sanctions determination, an SE &amp; D attorney, Robert Gore, swore that a pre-suit inspection of Cox's deck showed corrosion of fasteners made by Phillips. Notwithstanding this affidavit, the district court declared that SE &amp; D had conceded that it moved to name Cox as a plaintiff without any such inspection having taken place. The record contains no proof of such a concession.</p>\n<p>The closest thing in the record is the following. In opposing sanctions SE &amp; D relied primarily on Cox's statements rather than its own inspection. But the effect of this strategic choice is tempered by the fact that SE &amp; D was responding to Phillips's motionand Phillips had not challenged SE &amp; D's performance of an inspection but only the reasonableness of its overall inquiry. Under the circumstances, we hardly think that this can be termed a \"concession\" by SE &amp; D that its earlier statement was false.</p>\n<p>That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Where, as here, a court relies explicitly on a non-fact to make a factual determination, that reliance constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Vélez,</i> 375 F.3d at 42. It follows that, insofar as the sanctions order relates to SE &amp; D's efforts in connection with introducing Cox as the lead plaintiff, the order must be revisited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Naming Damm as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court determined that SE &amp; D had committed sanctionable acts in connection with the abortive filing of the motion to substitute Damm as the named plaintiff and putative class representative. SE &amp; D contends that this determination lacks any factual or legal basis.</p>\n<p>The unique position occupied by a trial judge gives her an intimate familiarity with the ebb and flow of the cases on her docket. Appellate courts recognize, therefore, that they must defer in large measure to a trial judge's \"first-line authority for case-management decisions.\" <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> 485 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2007). Orders granting or denying sanctions fall within that taxonomy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Diaz v. González,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 314 (1st Cir.1998). Consequently, appellate courts \"step softly\" when reviewing the imposition of sanctions. <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>Given the trial judge's special coign of vantage, common sense suggests that she must be accorded wide latitude in drawing inferences as to when multiplication of the proceedings crosses the line between what is acceptable if tedious and what is unreasonable and vexatious. The case law so indicates. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315; <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993). Distinguishing between what is a vigorous but reasonable attempt to salvage a case that is going badly and a stubbornly capricious attempt to gain advantage by prolonging matters is not easy. There will be a certain class of cases in which the facts may support either characterization. In that middle ground, the abuse of discretion standard tips the balance in favor of the trial court's view. <i>See </i><i>Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 388, 393-94 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988). It may well be that the proposed substitution of Damm and the subsequent dismissal without explanation of the action under the circumstances could support an imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p>Here, however, there is a rub. As we understand it, the district court premised its finding of sanctionable conduct vis-à-vis Damm at least in part on its findings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> that SE &amp; D had engaged in sanctionable conduct with respect to two other plaintiffs. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> 2007 WL 3104625, at *4; <i>cf. </i><i>Obert v. Repub. W. Ins. Co.,</i> 398 F.3d 138, 146 (1st Cir.2005) (acknowledging that sanctions might be appropriate for a series of \"hopeless motions,\" but warning that imposing sanctions \"routinely\" for easy filing of such a motion \"would tie courts and counsel in knots\"). Because we have set aside those precursor findings (at least for now), <i>see supra</i> Parts III(D)-(E), we must set aside this cumulative finding as well. <i>See </i><i>Local Div. 589, Amalg. Transit Union v. Massachusetts,</i> 666 F.2d 618, 645 (1st Cir.1981) (remanding preliminary injunction order for reconsideration where order was predicated on \"uncontradicted affidavit\" that appellate court found to be disputed). The district court can, of course, revisit this aspect of the matter on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. <i>The Motion for Reconsideration.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SE &amp; D's final plaint is that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion for reconsideration of the sanctions order. Because we have determined that the order must be vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings, this assignment of error has become moot.</p>\n<p>In the interest of good practice, we add a coda. When a motion for sanctions is made, the target has an obligation to put its best foot forward. It cannot hang back and withhold evidence helpful to its position merely because it hopes (or even anticipates) that the district court will hold an evidentiary hearing. Such hearings are matters of discretion, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 56 F.3d 295, 301-02 (1st Cir.1995), and it will be rare that a court of appeals will meddle with a district court's decision to forgo an evidentiary hearing on a motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, we affirm the district court's ruling as to the inapplicability of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 to the initial pleading herein. <i>See supra</i> Part III(C). But although the able district judge had ample reasons to chafe at the way in which SE &amp; D conducted the plaintiffs' side of this litigation, we are constrained, for the reasons elucidated above, to vacate the remainder of the sanctions order. We remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>We envision that the district court, on remand, will afford the parties a further opportunity to submit materials in support of their respective positions. Whether to entertain oral argument and/or convene an evidentiary hearing remains within the informed discretion of the district court. Nothing that we have seen in the record thus far convinces us that SE &amp; D's actions are or are not sanctionable. Consequently, we take no view on the appropriate outcome of those incremental proceedings.</p>\n<p>Although we need go no further, we think it advisable to mention another possibility. The battle that is presently being fought is obviously about principle, not money (experience suggests that each side has spent more than the dollar amount of the sanctions in briefing and arguing this appeal). As a matter of mutual interest, the time may have come for the protagonists to call it quits. On the one hand, Phillips prevailed in the district court and can credibly claim a moral victory. On the other hand, SE &amp; D has prevailed in large part on this appeal and, at this point, has erased the stain on its escutcheon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. All parties shall bear their own costs.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n<p>The sanction in this case rested, it appears, not upon a single act but on a cumulative course of conduct: the successive proffer and then abandonment of four successive lead plaintiffs; an inference of inadequate and arguably careless investigation in most or all of these four instances; and the suspicious failure to explain at all why the fourth plaintiff was withdrawn. That the resulta defunct law suitwasted court time and imposed litigation costs on the defense can scarcely be doubted.</p>\n<p>The record permits a finding of recurring negligence. The first plaintiff had settled before the case was brought; the second, even if he originally consented to proceed, does not seem to have had any serious commitment to the case; the third had not used Phillips screws; and the fourth was pulled without explanationthe fair inference being that problems had again been belatedly identified. True, the firm later offered new exculpatory affidavits, but the district court permissibly declined to consider them.</p>\n<p>The law is thin as to whether the vexatious litigation statute is violated by successive acts of negligence, doubtlessly prolonging the litigation but aimed (however fumbling the efforts) at success on the merits rather than harassment. The cases say that simple negligence is not enough<sup>[6]</sup> but, where the facts involve successive acts of negligence, the courts sometimes uphold sanctions, using the phrase \"bad faith\" but without any indication that it rests on more than repeated error.<sup>[7]</sup> Here, the district court's comment on the firm's affidavit about the deck inspection suggests that the judge thought it worse than mere negligence.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, strictly speaking it is possible (if unlikely) that the second plaintiff (VanLandingham)was originally on board with qualification and then simply reversed course; and while the firm's initial affidavit on the suitability of Cox as the third lead plaintiff is no model of clarity (<i>e.g.,</i> as to who supposedly did the deck inspection), it is hard to tell without more facts whether it was also disingenuousas the district judge impliedor just what inquiries the firm had made.</p>\n<p>There is a good deal of carelessness in litigation and, where the trial judge thinks the situation is serious enough to take the time for sanctions, the judge on the scene is entitled to a healthy latitude in making the ultimate judgment. Still, the stakes are high when a law firm is sanctioned for improper behavior, <i>Obert v. Republic Western Ins. Co.,</i> 398 F.3d 138, 143 (1st Cir.2005), and the risk remains that sanctions may be sought for tactical reasons-for example, to discourage litigation. There having been no evidentiary hearing, the lack of clarity in the record can justify a remand, especially as our precedents on fault-based lawyer sanctions have been fairly strict. <i>Obert,</i> 398 F.3d at 146-47; <i>Young v. City of Providence,</i> 404 F.3d 33, 40-41 (1st Cir.2005). It would be a different matter if, after Cox had been withdrawn, the district court had held that three strikes were enough and simply declined to allow any further amendment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See</i> Robert Burns, <i>To a Mouse</i> (1785) (\"The best-laid schemes o' mice and men [g]ang aft a-gley; [a]n' leave us nought but grief an' pain [f]or promised joy.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  SE &amp; D's version derived from a telephone call between an SE &amp; D attorney, Robert M.

Lawyers who overstep it do so at their peril. In the case before us, the district court found that a law firm had crossed the line by unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings in a class action. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Accordingly, the court imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p>The law firm appeals from the sanctions order. It argues, first, that the record fails to disclose any sanctionable conduct and that, in all events, the district court made mistakes both in finding the facts and in gauging their import. As a fallback, the firm maintains that, even if its principal argument does not carry the day, the district court nonetheless abused its discretion in refusing to reconsider the sanctions order on a supplemented record. The defendants, who moved for the imposition of sanctions in the first place, offer rejoinders to each and every aspect of this asseverational array.</p>\n<p>On the record at hand, we well understand the district court's frustration with the law firm's apparent carelessness. Still, we do not think that it can be said, as a matter of law, that sanctions either are or are not appropriate. In attempting to proceed past that point, we find ourselves largely stymied by gaps in the record. Consequently, we decide only one of the further questions presented, vacate the sanctions order, and remand for a new round of proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION</h2>\n<p>The genesis of this case seemed ordinary enough; it began with the filing of a class-action complaint by the law firm of Stewart, Estes &amp; Donnell, P.L.C. (\"SE &amp; D\") on behalf of Thomas R. Jensen and (unnamed) others similarly situated. The complaint designated two related corporations, Phillips Screw Company and Phillips Fastener Products, Inc. (collectively, \"Phillips\") as defendants and alleged that screws manufactured and marketed by them for use with pressure-treated wood suffered from an undisclosed propensity for premature failure in certain relatively commonplace circumstances.</p>\n<p>As matters turned out, Jensen had previously contacted Phillips about his claims and had received at least partial satisfaction for them (the record is opaque as to whether SE &amp; D knew or should have known as much before filing suit). Given this circumstance, Phillips raised an affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction in its answer to the complaint. Along the same line, it argued at an early scheduling conference with the district court that Jensen's vulnerability to this defense rendered him an inappropriate class representative.</p>\n<p>The district court agreed; it gave SE &amp; D six weeks (i.e., until January 30, 2007) to amend the complaint to add a new named plaintiff. The court subsequently granted SE &amp; D's request for a short extension of that deadline.</p>\n<p>Within the allotted time, the law firm moved to file an amended complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> adding a second plaintiff, Larry Vanlandingham. SE &amp; D implied that Vanlandingham would make a superior class representative because he not only had encountered problems when he used Phillips screws in the construction of a deck but also (unlike Jensen) had eschewed a private settlement.</p>\n<p>As a Scottish poet once warned, even the most carefully contrived plans may sometimes implode.<sup>[2]</sup> Six weeks after moving to add Vanlandingham as its new champion and before the district court ruled on that motion, SE &amp; D abruptly retreated. This time, it moved to forgo Vanlandingham's entry into the lists because, in the law firm's words, \"circumstances have arisen ... which may compromise the ability of [Vanlandingham] to act on behalf of the class.\" Phillips opposed this motion and sought dismissal of the action. It explained in an attached affidavit the nature of the \"circumstances\" to which SE &amp; D had alluded. The affiant, Gary M. Sable, a Phillips executive, recounted that Vanlandingham's wife, Gayle, had told him (Sable) that she and her husband did not wish to sue but, rather, preferred to reach a private accommodation with the company. According to Sable, Gayle Vanlandingham expressed surprise that her husband's name had been put forward in the class action, noting that neither she nor he had engaged counsel. Neither of them, she added, harbored any desire to become involved in litigation. Sable went on to quote Gayle Vanlandingham as saying that when she and her husband expressed their concerns to SE &amp; D, they were told that Phillips would not honor a warranty claim in the absence of legal action.</p>\n<p>At that juncture SE &amp; D did not directly dispute Phillips's allegations. In a responsive pleading, it argued instead that the Sable affidavit constituted hearsay and attributed any change of heart on the part of the Vanlandinghams to Phillips's influence.</p>\n<p>In this exchange of pleadings, SE &amp; D gave top billing to the new candidate whom it had recruited to fill the named plaintiff position: Emmett Cox. SE &amp; D asserted that Cox would be an appropriate class representative because an inspection of his deck had \"indicated substantial premature corrosion of fasteners manufactured by [Phillips].\" Although expressing some skepticism about SE &amp; D's methods, the district court allowed the motiona ruling that had the effect of shelving Vanlandingham and inserting Cox as a named plaintiff and putative class representative.</p>\n<p>Over the next several months, it became apparent that, notwithstanding SE &amp; D's prior assurances, Cox had used a brand of screws not manufactured by Phillips in constructing his deck. When that conclusion became irresistible, SE &amp; D moved to drop Cox as a plaintiff and to amend the complaint yet again. This proposed amendment sought to substitute Timothy Scott Damm in Cox's place and stead.</p>\n<p>Once burned is twice shy. This time the district court gave SE &amp; D two weeks (i.e., until September 13, 2007) within which to file a detailed written statement describing Damm's qualifications as a class-action plaintiff and putative class representative. SE &amp; D never proffered such a statement. At the end of the two-week grace period, it withdrew its motion to amend and terminated the class action in the federal court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. SANCTIONS</h2>\n<p>Throwing in the sponge on the class action did not end the matter. Invoking 28 U.S.C. § 1927, Phillips moved for an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> award of sanctions in the form of attorneys' fees and expenses. In support of its motion, Phillips argued that SE &amp; D had never undertaken a reasonably thorough investigation into the bona fides of any of its four proposed class representatives but had simply plunged ahead with devil-may-care abandon.</p>\n<p>SE &amp; D demurred. The law firm posited that sanctions under section 1927 were inappropriate vis-à-vis the initial filing of a complaint; that two of the putative class representatives, Vanlandingham and Damm, were withdrawn before any excess costs accrued; and that if any shortcomings characterized its performanceand it conceded nonethose shortcomings were not of the magnitude required for the imposition of sanctions. In framing its opposition, SE &amp; D for the first time directly contradicted Phillips's account of Vanlandingham's appearance on the scene.<sup>[3]</sup> As to Cox, SE &amp; D pointed to his reputed statement that he had purchased Phillips screws to justify its initial assertion that he was an appropriate plaintiff.</p>\n<p>Although SE &amp; D had requested oral argument, the district court rejected that request. Then, eschewing an evidentiary hearing, it filed a written decision. <i>See Jensen v. Phillips Screw Co.,</i> Civ. No. 05-12117, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3104625</span></span> (D.Mass. Sept. 26, 2007) (<i>\"D.Ct.Op.\"</i>). In that rescript, the court agreed with SE &amp; D that section 1927 does not authorize sanctions for the filing of an initial complaint, even if that complaint is groundless. <i>Id.</i> at *2-3. It determined, however, that SE &amp; D had engaged in sanctionable conduct vis-à-vis each of the other three erstwhile plaintiffs. <i>Id.</i> at *3-4. To consummate this determination, the court directed Phillips to file an itemized account of counsel fees and expenses incident to those phases of the litigation. <i>Id.</i> at *5.</p>\n<p>SE &amp; D moved for reconsideration, accompanying its motion with copious if belated evidentiary submissions. Among other things, it proffered affidavits from two SE &amp; D attorneys, Robert C. Bigelow and M. Reid Estes, Jr., explaining SE &amp; D's general professionalism and the particular procedures followed by the firm in recruiting Vanlandingham and Cox; an affidavit from Vanlandingham vouchsafing that he had given SE &amp; D permission to name him as a plaintiff; and an affidavit from Cox asserting that he repeatedly, though mistakenly, had told SE &amp; D that he had used Phillips screws to build his deck. Phillips opposed the motion for reconsideration as too late and too little. The district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n<p>In due course, Phillips filed its account. The district court, as a sanction, awarded attorneys' fees and expenses totaling $8,775. This timely appeal followed. In it, SE &amp; D challenges the appropriateness of sanctions and certain procedural aspects of the district court proceedings. SE &amp; D does not challenge the amount of the award.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We subdivide our analysis into seven short segments. Our starting point is a synopsis of the legal and evidentiary principles attendant to appellate review of sanctions orders imposed under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. We then briefly address a procedural complaint advanced by SE &amp; D. From there, we proceed to consider the various phases of the litigation in chronological order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> A. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In awarding sanctions, the district court acted under 28 U.S.C. § 1927. The statute permits sanctions to be imposed against lawyers who \"multipl[y] the proceedings... unreasonably and vexatiously.\"</p>\n<p>In this circuit, courts use a mainly objective standard for the purpose of determining when a lawyer's actions are unreasonable or vexatious. <i>See </i><i>Cruz v. Savage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536974\"><a href=\"/opinion/536974/juan-e-cruz-v-robert-savage-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 632 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"[b]ehavior is vexatious when it is harassing or annoying, <i>regardless of whether it is intended to be so</i>\" (emphasis supplied)). This focus on objective measurement comports with the majority view across the circuits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny's, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77813\"><a href=\"/opinion/77813/amlong-amlong-pa-v-dennys-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span>, 1241 (11th Cir.2007); <i>Salkil v. Mt. Sterling Tp. Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795282\"><a href=\"/opinion/795282/jeffrey-alan-salkil-kimberly-m-skaggs-equal-justice-foundation-v-mount/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 532 (6th Cir.2006); <i>Jolly Group, Ltd. v. Medline Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793060\"><a href=\"/opinion/793060/the-jolly-group-ltd-and-michael-j-rovell-cross-appellee-v-medline/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 720 (7th Cir.2006); <i>Julien v. Zeringue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516490\"><a href=\"/opinion/516490/leonard-julien-v-henry-zeringue-zeringues-farm-equipment-service-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1572</span></a></span>, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>Garden-variety carelessness or even incompetence, without more, will not suffice to ground the imposition of sanctions under section 1927. Rather, an attorney's actions must evince a studied disregard of the need for an orderly judicial process, <i>see </i><i>Jolly Group,</i> 435 F.3d at 720, or add up to a reckless breach of the lawyer's obligations as an officer of the court, <i>see </i><i>Salkil,</i> 458 F.3d at 532; <i>Braley v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497006\"><a href=\"/opinion/497006/jack-a-braley-do-v-garland-campbell-md-bruce-g-smith-md-stephen/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>, 1512 (10th Cir.1987). Bad faith is not an essential element, but a finding of bad faith is usually a telltale indicium of sanctionable conduct. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FDIC v. Conner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667161\"><a href=\"/opinion/667161/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-of-capital-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1376</span></a></span>, 1385 (5th Cir.1994); <i>Cruz,</i> 896 F.2d at 631.</p>\n<p>Our standard of review is familiar. We review a district court's imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Cruz,</i> 896 F.2d at 632. This standard is not appellant-friendly, and \"a sanctioned litigant bears a weighty burden in attempting to show that an abuse occurred.\" <i>Young v. Gordon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200491\"><a href=\"/opinion/200491/young-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2003). To shoulder that burden, the sanctioned litigant must establish that the sanctioning court ignored \"a material factor deserving significant weight,\" or that its decision rested upon \"an improper factor,\" or that it considered all the appropriate factors but made \"a serious mistake in weighing them.\" <i>Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201113\"><a href=\"/opinion/201113/velez-cortes-v-awning-windows-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2004). Of course, if a discretionary decision rests on an error of law, that is perforce an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rivera v. O'Neill-Cancel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203277\"><a href=\"/opinion/203277/torres-rivera-v-oneill-cancel/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 336 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>Before attempting to evaluate the district court's sanctions order, we pause to clarify an evidentiary issue that is pertinent here. A sanctions order must be evaluated on appeal in light of the record that was before the district court at the time the order issued. <i>Cf. </i><i>McMillan v. Mass. SPCA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752960\"><a href=\"/opinion/752960/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-589-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45354-dr-marjorie/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir. 1998) (limiting appellate review of summary judgment decision to \"only those facts that were available at the summary judgment stage\"). In defiance of this principle, SE &amp; D has premised many of its appellate arguments on an array of facts mined from attachments to its motion for reconsideration. But those facts were not before the district court when it issued the sanctions order. Because a court's factual findings must be tested in light of the information available to the court when it ruled, we reject SE &amp; D's back-door attempt to reconfigure the record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Entitlement to Oral Argument.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Citing our decision in <i>Media Duplication Services, Inc., v. HDG Software, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557987\"><a href=\"/opinion/557987/media-duplication-services-ltd-v-hdg-software-inc-joseph-wine/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991), SE &amp; D <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> contends that the district court made an error that tainted every aspect of its order when it declined to hear oral argument before imposing sanctions. That contention is groundless.</p>\n<p>In the first place, the case that SE &amp; D cites holds only that, as a matter of due process, a trial court ordinarily may not impose sanctions on a party without giving that party notice and an opportunity to be heard. <i>See id.</i> at 1238. Here, however, SE &amp; D was given ample notice; indeed, Phillips filed an aposematic motion. As a result, SE &amp; D had a full opportunity to set out its side of the matter in a written response. Had it opted to do so, it could have submitted additional affidavits or evidentiary materials as part of that response. In the usual course, matters can adequately be heard on the papers. <i>See </i><i>EEOC v. S.S. Clerks Union, Local 1066,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195936\"><a href=\"/opinion/195936/eeoc-v-local-1066/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 609 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that dispositive motions may be \"heard\" on the papers because due process does not require \"any particular kind of hearing\"); <i>Domegan v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513189\"><a href=\"/opinion/513189/dennis-j-domegan-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>, 1065 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that \"district courts have considerable discretion in deciding whether or not to allow oral argument on a dispositive motion\"). So it is here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Naming Jensen as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We begin our march through the ranks of the putative class representatives with Thomas Jensen. SE &amp; D's enlistment of Jensen as the initial class representative proved to be improvident. Nevertheless, the district court declined to impose sanctions with respect to that phase of litigation. Reading the unvarnished text of section 1927, the court determined that sanctions were not available under that statute for activity associated with the initial filing of a complaint. <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3104626</span></span>, at *2.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court's reasoning. The touchstone of all statutory construction is the wording of the statute under review. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immig. &amp; Customs Enf.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200761\"><a href=\"/opinion/200761/federal-refinance-v-romano/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the plain language of the statute restricts its operation to acts that \"multipl[y]\" the proceedings. 28 U.S.C. § 1927. Commencing a proceeding is not the same as multiplying a proceeding. In our view, then, Congress's use of the verb \"multipl[y]\" in the text of the statute clearly contemplates that, to be sanctionable thereunder, conduct must have an effect on an already initiated proceeding. Consequently, we join an unbroken band of cases across the courts of appeals holding that a lawyer cannot violate section 1927 in the course of commencing an action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Steinert v. Winn Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167175\"><a href=\"/opinion/167175/steinert-v-winn-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span>, 1224 (10th Cir.2006); <i>MEMC Elec. Mat'ls, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Mat'ls Silicone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791657\"><a href=\"/opinion/791657/memc-electronic-materials-inc-v-mitsubishi-materials-silicon/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1369</span></a></span>, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2005); <i>DeBauche v. Trani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766129\"><a href=\"/opinion/766129/sue-harris-debauche-v-eugene-trani-lawrence-douglas-wilder-clear-channel/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 511 (4th Cir.1999); <i>Zuk v. E. Pa. Psych. Inst.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732315\"><a href=\"/opinion/732315/gerald-zuk-v-eastern-pennsylvania-psychiatric-institute-of-the-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 297 (3d Cir.1996); <i>In re Keegan Mgmt. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714196\"><a href=\"/opinion/714196/in-re-keegan-management-co-securities-litigation-michael-moore-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 435 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore affirm the district court's decision that sanctions under section 1927 were not available for any alleged failure on SE &amp; D's part to vet Jensen or investigate the bona fides of his claim.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear about two related points. First, we limit this holding to section 1927. Shoddy work related to the commencement of an action may be sanctionable under other approaches. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. Second, to the extent that SE &amp; D knew or should have known of Jensen's weaknesses as a lead plaintiff, those weaknesses may inform the question of whether SE &amp; D was guilty down the line of unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> <i>Bowler v. U.S. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529937\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529937/bowler-v-usins/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 605 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (noting that section 1927 exists to punish a course of conduct, not merely individual acts).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Naming Vanlandingham as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When it ruled on the motion for sanctions, the district court had before it the parties' legal memoranda. It also had before it four main sources of raw factual information anent Vanlandingham: (i) its own observations concerning what had taken place; (ii) the Sable affidavit; (iii) SE &amp; D's response to the Sable affidavit, which contained among other things a recitation of a telephone conversation that supposedly had taken place with Vanlandingham, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and (iv) the bare fact that Vanlandingham's name was withdrawn six weeks after it was proffered. The district court explicitly refused to accept \"either party's hearsay version of Mr. VanLandingham's statements,\" <i>D.Ct.Op.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3104625</span></span>, at *3, which seemingly eliminated everything except the first and fourth sources of information.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On this slender predicate, the court concluded that SE &amp; D was either \"unaware\" of Vanlandingham's reluctance to litigate or \"persisted in naming him ... regardless.\" <i>Id.</i> Either way, the court believed that the naming of Vanlandingham was an act deserving of sanctions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>If the lower court had relied simply on Vanlandingham's seeming unwillingness to proceed and reasonable inferences drawn from the sequencing of the pleadings, that would have been too little to underpin a sanctions order. From that exiguous showing, the court had no reliable way of knowing whether SE &amp; D had disregarded Vanlandingham's wishes from the start or, alternatively, had been taken by surprise when he performed an about-face. Furthermore, such an about-face, unexplained, could not support a finding of sanctionable conduct. <i>See </i><i>McLane, Graf, Raulerson &amp; Middleton, P.A. v. Rechberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199831\"><a href=\"/opinion/199831/mclane-graf-v-rechberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that sanctions under section 1927 require a showing that the conduct \"be more severe than mere negligence, inadvertence, or incompetence\"). After all, a party can turn on a dime, change his mind, and decide to pursue settlement rather than litigation without any fault attaching to his counsel.</p>\n<p>Presumably recognizing the need to fill this gap, the district court appears (albeit implicitly) to have credited the hearsay allegations limned in the Sable affidavit. The court did so notwithstanding its avowed unwillingness to rely upon hearsay accounts. While credibility determinations ordinarily are grist for the district court's millthe court, as trier of the facts, can choose to believe one version of events and disbelieve the other, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 352 F.3d at 27the court must apply its methodology uniformly. Thus, it cannot reject one side's evidence on hearsay grounds while overlooking the same defect in the other side's proffer.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We need not belabor the point. The short of it is that the district court abused its discretion in reaching the sanctions determination with respect to this phase of the litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> E. <i>Naming Cox as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In an affidavit submitted prior to the sanctions determination, an SE &amp; D attorney, Robert Gore, swore that a pre-suit inspection of Cox's deck showed corrosion of fasteners made by Phillips. Notwithstanding this affidavit, the district court declared that SE &amp; D had conceded that it moved to name Cox as a plaintiff without any such inspection having taken place. The record contains no proof of such a concession.</p>\n<p>The closest thing in the record is the following. In opposing sanctions SE &amp; D relied primarily on Cox's statements rather than its own inspection. But the effect of this strategic choice is tempered by the fact that SE &amp; D was responding to Phillips's motionand Phillips had not challenged SE &amp; D's performance of an inspection but only the reasonableness of its overall inquiry. Under the circumstances, we hardly think that this can be termed a \"concession\" by SE &amp; D that its earlier statement was false.</p>\n<p>That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Where, as here, a court relies explicitly on a non-fact to make a factual determination, that reliance constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Vélez,</i> 375 F.3d at 42. It follows that, insofar as the sanctions order relates to SE &amp; D's efforts in connection with introducing Cox as the lead plaintiff, the order must be revisited.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Naming Damm as a Plaintiff.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court determined that SE &amp; D had committed sanctionable acts in connection with the abortive filing of the motion to substitute Damm as the named plaintiff and putative class representative. SE &amp; D contends that this determination lacks any factual or legal basis.</p>\n<p>The unique position occupied by a trial judge gives her an intimate familiarity with the ebb and flow of the cases on her docket. Appellate courts recognize, therefore, that they must defer in large measure to a trial judge's \"first-line authority for case-management decisions.\" <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202693\"><a href=\"/opinion/202693/torres-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2007). Orders granting or denying sanctions fall within that taxonomy. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Diaz v. González,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 314 (1st Cir.1998). Consequently, appellate courts \"step softly\" when reviewing the imposition of sanctions. <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600264\"><a href=\"/opinion/600264/no-92-1827/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>Given the trial judge's special coign of vantage, common sense suggests that she must be accorded wide latitude in drawing inferences as to when multiplication of the proceedings crosses the line between what is acceptable if tedious and what is unreasonable and vexatious. The case law so indicates. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315; <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603794\"><a href=\"/opinion/603794/catherine-m-jones-v-winnepesaukee-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993). Distinguishing between what is a vigorous but reasonable attempt to salvage a case that is going badly and a stubbornly capricious attempt to gain advantage by prolonging matters is not easy. There will be a certain class of cases in which the facts may support either characterization. In that middle ground, the abuse of discretion standard tips the balance in favor of the trial court's view. <i>See </i><i>Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539792\"><a href=\"/opinion/539792/anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 393-94 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513182\"><a href=\"/opinion/513182/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-petition-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1019 (1st Cir.1988). It may well be that the proposed substitution of Damm and the subsequent dismissal without explanation of the action under the circumstances could support an imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p>Here, however, there is a rub. As we understand it, the district court premised its finding of sanctionable conduct vis-à-vis Damm at least in part on its findings <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> that SE &amp; D had engaged in sanctionable conduct with respect to two other plaintiffs. <i>See D.Ct.Op.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3104625</span></span>, at *4; <i>cf. </i><i>Obert v. Repub. W. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201460\"><a href=\"/opinion/201460/obert-v-sherman/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 146 (1st Cir.2005) (acknowledging that sanctions might be appropriate for a series of \"hopeless motions,\" but warning that imposing sanctions \"routinely\" for easy filing of such a motion \"would tie courts and counsel in knots\"). Because we have set aside those precursor findings (at least for now), <i>see supra</i> Parts III(D)-(E), we must set aside this cumulative finding as well. <i>See </i><i>Local Div. 589, Amalg. Transit Union v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398005\"><a href=\"/opinion/398005/local-division-589-amalgamated-transit-union-afl-cio-clc-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 645 (1st Cir.1981) (remanding preliminary injunction order for reconsideration where order was predicated on \"uncontradicted affidavit\" that appellate court found to be disputed). The district court can, of course, revisit this aspect of the matter on remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. <i>The Motion for Reconsideration.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SE &amp; D's final plaint is that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion for reconsideration of the sanctions order. Because we have determined that the order must be vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings, this assignment of error has become moot.</p>\n<p>In the interest of good practice, we add a coda. When a motion for sanctions is made, the target has an obligation to put its best foot forward. It cannot hang back and withhold evidence helpful to its position merely because it hopes (or even anticipates) that the district court will hold an evidentiary hearing. Such hearings are matters of discretion, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697253\"><a href=\"/opinion/697253/in-re-thirteen-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span>, 301-02 (1st Cir.1995), and it will be rare that a court of appeals will meddle with a district court's decision to forgo an evidentiary hearing on a motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, we affirm the district court's ruling as to the inapplicability of 28 U.S.C. § 1927 to the initial pleading herein. <i>See supra</i> Part III(C). But although the able district judge had ample reasons to chafe at the way in which SE &amp; D conducted the plaintiffs' side of this litigation, we are constrained, for the reasons elucidated above, to vacate the remainder of the sanctions order. We remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>We envision that the district court, on remand, will afford the parties a further opportunity to submit materials in support of their respective positions. Whether to entertain oral argument and/or convene an evidentiary hearing remains within the informed discretion of the district court. Nothing that we have seen in the record thus far convinces us that SE &amp; D's actions are or are not sanctionable. Consequently, we take no view on the appropriate outcome of those incremental proceedings.</p>\n<p>Although we need go no further, we think it advisable to mention another possibility. The battle that is presently being fought is obviously about principle, not money (experience suggests that each side has spent more than the dollar amount of the sanctions in briefing and arguing this appeal). As a matter of mutual interest, the time may have come for the protagonists to call it quits. On the one hand, Phillips prevailed in the district court and can credibly claim a moral victory. On the other hand, SE &amp; D has prevailed in large part on this appeal and, at this point, has erased the stain on its escutcheon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. All parties shall bear their own costs.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n<p>The sanction in this case rested, it appears, not upon a single act but on a cumulative course of conduct: the successive proffer and then abandonment of four successive lead plaintiffs; an inference of inadequate and arguably careless investigation in most or all of these four instances; and the suspicious failure to explain at all why the fourth plaintiff was withdrawn. That the resulta defunct law suitwasted court time and imposed litigation costs on the defense can scarcely be doubted.</p>\n<p>The record permits a finding of recurring negligence. The first plaintiff had settled before the case was brought; the second, even if he originally consented to proceed, does not seem to have had any serious commitment to the case; the third had not used Phillips screws; and the fourth was pulled without explanationthe fair inference being that problems had again been belatedly identified. True, the firm later offered new exculpatory affidavits, but the district court permissibly declined to consider them.</p>\n<p>The law is thin as to whether the vexatious litigation statute is violated by successive acts of negligence, doubtlessly prolonging the litigation but aimed (however fumbling the efforts) at success on the merits rather than harassment. The cases say that simple negligence is not enough<sup>[6]</sup> but, where the facts involve successive acts of negligence, the courts sometimes uphold sanctions, using the phrase \"bad faith\" but without any indication that it rests on more than repeated error.<sup>[7]</sup> Here, the district court's comment on the firm's affidavit about the deck inspection suggests that the judge thought it worse than mere negligence.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, strictly speaking it is possible (if unlikely) that the second plaintiff (VanLandingham)was originally on board with qualification and then simply reversed course; and while the firm's initial affidavit on the suitability of Cox as the third lead plaintiff is no model of clarity (<i>e.g.,</i> as to who supposedly did the deck inspection), it is hard to tell without more facts whether it was also disingenuousas the district judge impliedor just what inquiries the firm had made.</p>\n<p>There is a good deal of carelessness in litigation and, where the trial judge thinks the situation is serious enough to take the time for sanctions, the judge on the scene is entitled to a healthy latitude in making the ultimate judgment. Still, the stakes are high when a law firm is sanctioned for improper behavior, <i>Obert v. Republic Western Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201460\"><a href=\"/opinion/201460/obert-v-sherman/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir.2005), and the risk remains that sanctions may be sought for tactical reasons-for example, to discourage litigation. There having been no evidentiary hearing, the lack of clarity in the record can justify a remand, especially as our precedents on fault-based lawyer sanctions have been fairly strict. <i>Obert,</i> 398 F.3d at 146-47; <i>Young v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.2005). It would be a different matter if, after Cox had been withdrawn, the district court had held that three strikes were enough and simply declined to allow any further amendment.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See</i> Robert Burns, <i>To a Mouse</i> (1785) (\"The best-laid schemes o' mice and men [g]ang aft a-gley; [a]n' leave us nought but grief an' pain [f]or promised joy.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  SE &amp; D's version derived from a telephone call between an SE &amp; D attorney, Robert M. Kirkpatrick, and Vanlandingham himself, in which the latter reportedly recalled having given SE &amp; D permission to name him as a plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court declined to bolster its conclusion anent SE &amp; D's carelessness by referring to SE &amp; D's \"course of conduct\" vis-à-vis Jensen.</p>\n<p>[5]  We do not suggest that the rules of evidence necessarily apply to factfinding in the context of sanctions.
