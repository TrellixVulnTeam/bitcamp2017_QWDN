Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Papu Sandhu, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                          July 28, 2005\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         The petitioner, Petro Dhima, a\n\nnative and citizen of Albania, seeks review of the denial of his\n\napplication for asylum.       The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that\n\nDhima was not credible, and that he failed to establish past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, so that\n\nhe was ineligible for asylum.        The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) summarily affirmed the IJ's decision.         We affirm the BIA and\n\ndeny the petition for review.1\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Dhima entered the United States on November 16, 2001\n\nwithout proper entry documents.           Immigration officials took him\n\ninto custody.      In his interview with an officer of the (then)\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS),2 he claimed to be a\n\nmember of no political organization but that he sympathized with\n\nthe   Democratic   Party   (the   opposition    party   to   the   Socialist\n\ngovernment) in Albania.     He also said that he was involved at a May\n\n27, 2001 demonstration during which \"a group of police started to\n\nkick us.\"     The police were \"trying to bring us to the police\n\nstation but we escaped.\"\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United\nStates on February 3, 2005.     We have substituted him for John\nAshcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent. See\nFed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n2\n   The functions of the INS were subsequently subsumed in the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            On November 26, 2001, the INS served Dhima with a Notice\n\nto Appear, charging him with being removable pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n\nÂ§ 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Dhima admitted removability and applied for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT), and voluntary departure, on the basis of\n\nalleged persecution for his political opinions and activities.\n\n            In his asylum application, contrary to what he told the\n\ninterviewing INS officer, Dhima claimed to be a longstanding member\n\nof the Democratic Party, and gave a different account of his\n\ninvolvement in the demonstration of May 27, 2001.       This time, he\n\nstated that he suffered \"severe injuries\" to his head and went into\n\na \"coma\" when the police attempted to arrest him.       The crowd, he\n\nstated, prevented the arrest, and he woke from his coma in a\n\nhospital.\n\n            In his sworn affidavit accompanying the application,\n\nDhima gave roughly the same account of the events of May 27, 2001,\n\nbut added a new and also contrary fact: \"I, along with many of my\n\nfriends, were arrested following that event.\"\n\n            At his merits hearing before an IJ on July 8, 2003, Dhima\n\ntestified that he became a member of the Albanian Democratic Party\n\nin December 1990.    Dhima gave yet another inconsistent account of\n\nthe events of May 27, 2001.       This time, he stated that he was\n\nbeaten by \"people of the security\" who \"didn't look like the\n\npolice.\"    He was not arrested or dragged to a car.   But he received\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa head wound, became unconscious, and woke up in a hospital.            In\n\nthis version, Dhima also explained that he left the hospital after\n\none hour.\n\n            Dhima   testified   that   about   five   months   later,   on\n\nSeptember 24, 2001, he received a notice slipped under his door for\n\nhim to report to the police station on that same day.               Dhima\n\nexplained that he was afraid for his life and two of his friends\n\nwho participated in the May demonstration had been arrested and\n\ntortured.   He did not go to the police station, but instead escaped\n\nto his father's village.        He said that the police came to his\n\nparents' house and asked them where he was, but his father told the\n\npolice nothing.     Dhima then left Albania for Greece with a false\n\npassport, and ultimately came to the United States by way of France\n\nand Mexico.\n\n            Dhima also testified that during his participation in\n\nanother demonstration in 1997, \"[t]he people of the security\"\n\n\"assaulted me and especially in me legs, both of them.\"                 He\n\nexplained that as a result of being beaten with a stick, he\n\nreceived wounds in his nose, elbow, arms, and legs.            This 1997\n\ndemonstration and the associated beating were not mentioned in the\n\ninterview, the asylum application, or the supporting documentation\n\nhe submitted to the IJ.\n\n            Dhima testified that after the May 2001 demonstration, at\n\nwhich he was purportedly injured, he went to the U.S. Embassy in\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fGreece in July 2001.    He told the Embassy officers only that he\n\nwanted to obtain a visa for the United States for a vacation.    He\n\ndid not discuss asylum.      Having failed to obtain a visa, he\n\nvoluntarily returned to Albania.\n\n           Another witness, Frank Camaj, president of the Albanian-\n\nAmerican   International   Institute,   a   \"bicultural    education\n\ninstitution . . . that facilitates . . . the causes of . . .\n\nAlbanian-Americans,\" testified on behalf of Dhima. Camaj testified\n\nthat Dhima's family has one of the \"thickest files\" in Albania and\n\nhas been \"marked for persecution\" by the authorities.     Camaj also\n\nexplained that the current Albanian government is run by the \"same\n\npeople\" as the previous Communist regime and that the current\n\ngovernment \"commit[s] far worse atrocities\" than before.\n\n           Dhima also submitted a certificate allegedly from the\n\nChairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, which described Dhima\n\nas a \"supporter\" of the party and stated that Dhima was \"maltreated\n\nphysically\" on May 27, 2001, and also on another occasion in June\n\nof that year.   Dhima himself never mentioned a June incident.   As\n\nwell, Dhima submitted the notice that he supposedly received\n\nordering him to report to the police on September 24, 2001, and a\n\ndocument from an Albanian hospital stating that he was treated on\n\nMay 27, 2001 for \"contusion of the head and body\" and \"fracture of\n\nrib.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           The IJ denied Dhima's application in an oral decision on\n\nJuly 8, 2003.     The IJ determined that Dhima had failed to show a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution, and also failed to show that it\n\nis more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured if\n\nreturned to Albania.    The IJ found Dhima not credible, pointing to\n\nDhima's failure to \"provide a cogent and consistent account of the\n\nevents surrounding\" the May 27, 2001 demonstration, which went \"to\n\nthe very heart of [Dhima's] claim.\"         The IJ also explained other\n\nfactors   which   contributed   to   his   finding   that   Dhima   was   not\n\ncredible: 1) Dhima was inconsistent in what he said concerning his\n\nmembership in the Democratic Party; 2) Dhima did not report the\n\n1997 demonstration at which he was supposedly badly beaten in any\n\nof his written submissions; 3) the circumstances surrounding the\n\npolice summons and the inability of the police to locate him in his\n\nfather's village were inexplicable given Camaj's assertion that\n\nDhima's family is a prominent dissident family closely tracked by\n\nthe government; 4) Dhima had tried to come to the United States by\n\napplying for a visitor's visa without mentioning any persecution,\n\nindicating that he had formed an intent to come to the United\n\nStates even before the notice to report to the police, which he\n\nclaimed was the triggering event; and 5) Camaj's and Dhima's\n\ntestimony of the repressiveness of the Albanian government is at\n\nodds with the U.S. State Department Profile of Asylum Claims and\n\nCountry Conditions, released in May 2001, which described the 1997\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\felections as \"adequately reflect[ing] the will of the people\" and\n\nstated that \"[b]oth major political parties trace their roots to\n\nthe communist regime and repudiate it throughly.\"\n\n           The IJ also found the documentation submitted by Dhima to\n\nbe insufficient to salvage his credibility.         The IJ questioned the\n\ncertificate   that    purportedly   came   from     the   chairman      of   the\n\nDemocratic    Party     because     the    certificate          consisted     of\n\n\"unsubstantiated rhetoric, unsupported by any evidence of how the\n\nmaker came into possession of the facts set forth.\"                As for the\n\nhospital document, the IJ noted that the U.S. State Department\n\nProfile   explained   that   \"documents    issued    by   Albanian      medical\n\npractitioners are rarely reliable.\"         The IJ also found Camaj's\n\ntestimony to be more \"passionate\" than reliable.\n\n           Dhima appealed to the BIA, which summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ pursuant to 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.1(e)(4), making the IJ's decision\n\nthe final agency decision for purposes of appellate review.                  See\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).               Dhima then\n\npetitioned this court for review solely as to the IJ's denial of\n\nDhima's   asylum   claim.3    Dhima   argues      that    the    IJ's   adverse\n\ncredibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n3\n   Dhima's petition comes to us after the passage of the REAL ID\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, which alters, among\nother things, the standards governing credibility determinations\nand the need for corroboration of testimony in asylum cases. The\nnew provisions of the Act are not applicable to this case since\nDhima's application for asylum was filed prior to the effective\ndate of the amendments.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fHe also argues that the BIA erred by summarily affirming the IJ's\n\ndecision.\n\n                                     II.\n\nDenial of Asylum\n\n            We review factual findings and credibility determinations\n\nof the IJ under the deferential substantial evidence standard. INS\n\nv. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Akinwande v. Ashcroft,\n\n380 F.3d 517, 522 (1st Cir. 2004).           The IJ's determination must\n\nstand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude    to   the    contrary.\"   8     U.S.C.    Â§    1252(b)(4)(B);      see\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nAs to issues of credibility, we will give great deference to an\n\nIJ's determinations so long as the IJ provides \"specific reasons\n\nfor those determinations.\" Akinwande, 380 F.3d at 522; see Syed v.\n\nAshcroft, 389 F.3d 248, 251-52 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The petitioner for asylum has the burden of proof for\n\nestablishing eligibility for asylum.          Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d\n\n35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1208.13(a).                Applicants can meet\n\nthis burden by proving either past persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear   of   future     persecution   on    account       of    \"race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    8 U.S.C Â§ 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1208.13(b).                 An\n\napplicant's testimony, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain\n\nthe burden of proof without corroboration,\" 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1208.13(a),\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fbut   if   the    applicant     is   found    not   to    be    entirely   credible,\n\ncorroborating evidence \"may be used to bolster an applicant's\n\ncredibility.\"      Diab, 397 F.3d at 39.            Dhima's argument that he is\n\neligible for asylum requires, as a threshold matter, that the IJ's\n\ncredibility finding be unsupported by the record.\n\n            The IJ's determination that Dhima was not credible is\n\nunassailable.        The IJ identified numerous inconsistencies and\n\nomissions in Dhima's testimony and application for asylum, and\n\noffered specific reasons for his adverse credibility determination,\n\neach of which is amply supported by the record.\n\n            Dhima offers no arguments to address most of these\n\nreasons; he addresses only the IJ's determination that there were\n\ncrucial discrepancies concerning his multiple accounts of the May\n\n27, 2001 incident.4        Dhima argues to us that the multiple versions\n\nare not necessarily inconsistent if one resolves all apparent\n\ncontradictions and ambiguities in the various accounts in favor of\n\nDhima.      But    there   is   no   requirement         that   the   IJ   favor   the\n\npetitioner in this way. Dhima provides no coherent explanation for\n\nwhy, in his accounts of the May 27, 2001 incident, he sometimes\n\nclaimed to have been arrested and sometimes to have escaped arrest,\n\nor why the details of his maltreatment kept on changing.                           The\n\n\n4\n   Even if Dhima were right that the IJ erred in his finding on\nthis one factor, the combination of the other factors cited by the\nIJ would still lead us to conclude that the IJ's adverse\ncredibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.      But\nDhima does not even get that far.\n\n                                        -9-\n\frecord does not suggest, much less compel, a conclusion that the\n\nmultiple accounts were cogent and coherent.\n\n            Dhima next argues that the IJ improperly disregarded the\n\nadditional corroborating documentary evidence and testimony from\n\nCamaj. In actuality, the IJ evaluated the documents and determined\n\nthat they were insufficient to compensate for Dhima's lack of\n\ncredibility; indeed, they were suspect in themselves.           The IJ's\n\nconclusions are amply supported.      Dhima offers no explanation for\n\nhow   the   Chairman   of   the   Democratic   Party   of   Albania,   who\n\npurportedly authored the certificate he submitted, would have\n\nknowledge of the specific facts concerning Dhima (indeed, the\n\ncertificate talks of Dhima being maltreated in June of 2001, which\n\nDhima does not say happened).      As for the hospital record, it was\n\ndated August 17, 2002 (obtained after the start of his asylum\n\nproceedings), and thus was not made contemporaneous with his visit.\n\nThe hospital document also described Dhima as having suffered a\n\nbroken rib, which Dhima does not mention in his testimony.         The IJ\n\nnoted the State Department's conclusion that \"[d]ocuments issued by\n\nAlbanian medical practitioners are rarely reliable.\"\n\n            As for Camaj's testimony, Camaj did not have personal\n\nknowledge of the events described by Dhima, and his assessment of\n\nAlbania's country conditions and the prominence of Dhima's family\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fas dissidents were at odds with the State Department Profile and\n\nDhima's own account of his success at eluding capture.5\n\nBIA's Summary Affirmance\n\n              Dhima's argument attacking the BIA's summary affirmance\n\nbecause it does not state the BIA's own reasons is foreclosed by\n\nour decision in Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 377-78 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). There, we rejected a similar challenge to the BIA's summary\n\naffirmance procedure: although the summary affirmance does not give\n\nthe BIA's reasons, \"[t]he courts will continue to have the IJ's\n\ndecision and the record upon which it is based available for\n\nreview.\"      Id. at 378.\n\n              Dhima's argument that his case falls outside the bounds\n\nof 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.1(e)(4) is also without merit.         Dhima appears to\n\nargue,   in    cursory   fashion,   that   existing   precedent   does   not\n\n\"squarely\"     control   his   case,   which   involves   a   \"novel\"    fact\n\nsituation. See 8 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.1(e)(4)(i)(A). However, Dhima does\n\nnot explain (and we think he cannot) what makes the IJ's routine\n\ncredibility finding in this case \"novel\" or in what way the IJ's\n\ndecision extended existing precedent.\n\n\n\n5\n  Finally, Dhima selectively quotes from the U.S. State Department\nCountry Conditions Report for Albania to suggest that the Report\nclosely corroborates Dhima's claims. It does not. For example,\nDhima quotes the Report as saying, \"[T]he Democratic Party alleged\nthat the Government was responsible for the killing of one of its\nmembers in police custody. . . .\"      The elided portion of the\noriginal quote was \"although a government medical team confirmed\nthat the death was a suicide.\"\n\n                                    -11-\n\f                              III.\n\n          The BIA's order is affirmed and the petition for review\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

The IJ's determination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see Rodriguez-Ramirez v.

Applicants can meet this burden by proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b). An applicant's testimony, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration,\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a), but if the applicant is found not to be entirely credible, corroborating evidence \"may be used to bolster an applicant's credibility.\" <i>Diab,</i> 397 F.3d at 39. Dhima's argument that he is eligible for asylum requires, as a threshold matter, that the IJ's credibility finding be unsupported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's determination that Dhima was not credible is unassailable. The IJ identified numerous inconsistencies and omissions in Dhima's testimony and application for asylum, and offered specific reasons for his adverse credibility determination, each of which is amply supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima offers no arguments to address most of these reasons; he addresses only the IJ's determination that there were crucial discrepancies concerning his multiple accounts of the May 27, 2001 incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Dhima argues to us that the multiple versions are not necessarily inconsistent if one resolves all apparent contradictions and ambiguities in the various accounts in favor of Dhima. But there is no requirement that the IJ favor the petitioner in this way. Dhima provides no coherent explanation for why, in his accounts of the May 27, 2001 incident, he sometimes claimed to have been arrested and sometimes to have escaped arrest, or why the details of his maltreatment kept on changing. The record does not suggest, much less compel, a conclusion that the multiple accounts were cogent and coherent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima next argues that the IJ improperly disregarded the additional corroborating documentary evidence and testimony from Camaj. In actuality, the IJ evaluated the documents and determined that they were insufficient to compensate for Dhima's lack of credibility; indeed, they were suspect in themselves. The IJ's conclusions are amply supported. Dhima offers no explanation for how the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, who purportedly authored the certificate he submitted, would have knowledge of the specific facts concerning Dhima (indeed, the certificate talks of Dhima being maltreated in June of 2001, which Dhima does not say happened). As for the hospital record, it was dated August 17, 2002 (obtained after the start of his asylum proceedings), and thus was not made contemporaneous with his visit. The hospital document also described Dhima as having suffered a broken rib, which Dhima does not mention in his testimony. The IJ noted the State Department's conclusion that \"[d]ocuments issued by Albanian medical practitioners are rarely reliable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Camaj's testimony, Camaj did not have personal knowledge of the events described by Dhima, and his assessment of Albania's country conditions and the prominence of Dhima's family as dissidents were at odds with the State Department Profile and Dhima's own account of his success at eluding capture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>BIA's Summary Affirmance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima's argument attacking the BIA's summary affirmance because it does not state the BIA's own reasons is foreclosed by our decision in <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 377-78 (1st Cir.2003). There, we rejected a similar challenge to the BIA's summary affirmance procedure: although the summary affirmance does not give the BIA's reasons, \"[t]he courts will continue to have the IJ's decision and the record upon which it is based available for review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 378.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima's argument that his case falls outside the bounds of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) is also without merit. Dhima appears to argue, in cursory fashion, that existing precedent does not \"squarely\" control his case, which involves a \"novel\" fact situation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4)(i)(A).

Dhima's argument that he is eligible for asylum requires, as a threshold matter, that the IJ's credibility finding be unsupported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's determination that Dhima was not credible is unassailable. The IJ identified numerous inconsistencies and omissions in Dhima's testimony and application for asylum, and offered specific reasons for his adverse credibility determination, each of which is amply supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima offers no arguments to address most of these reasons; he addresses only the IJ's determination that there were crucial discrepancies concerning his multiple accounts of the May 27, 2001 incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Dhima argues to us that the multiple versions are not necessarily inconsistent if one resolves all apparent contradictions and ambiguities in the various accounts in favor of Dhima. But there is no requirement that the IJ favor the petitioner in this way. Dhima provides no coherent explanation for why, in his accounts of the May 27, 2001 incident, he sometimes claimed to have been arrested and sometimes to have escaped arrest, or why the details of his maltreatment kept on changing. The record does not suggest, much less compel, a conclusion that the multiple accounts were cogent and coherent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima next argues that the IJ improperly disregarded the additional corroborating documentary evidence and testimony from Camaj. In actuality, the IJ evaluated the documents and determined that they were insufficient to compensate for Dhima's lack of credibility; indeed, they were suspect in themselves. The IJ's conclusions are amply supported. Dhima offers no explanation for how the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, who purportedly authored the certificate he submitted, would have knowledge of the specific facts concerning Dhima (indeed, the certificate talks of Dhima being maltreated in June of 2001, which Dhima does not say happened). As for the hospital record, it was dated August 17, 2002 (obtained after the start of his asylum proceedings), and thus was not made contemporaneous with his visit. The hospital document also described Dhima as having suffered a broken rib, which Dhima does not mention in his testimony. The IJ noted the State Department's conclusion that \"[d]ocuments issued by Albanian medical practitioners are rarely reliable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Camaj's testimony, Camaj did not have personal knowledge of the events described by Dhima, and his assessment of Albania's country conditions and the prominence of Dhima's family as dissidents were at odds with the State Department Profile and Dhima's own account of his success at eluding capture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>BIA's Summary Affirmance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima's argument attacking the BIA's summary affirmance because it does not state the BIA's own reasons is foreclosed by our decision in <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 377-78 (1st Cir.2003). There, we rejected a similar challenge to the BIA's summary affirmance procedure: although the summary affirmance does not give the BIA's reasons, \"[t]he courts will continue to have the IJ's decision and the record upon which it is based available for review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 378.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dhima's argument that his case falls outside the bounds of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) is also without merit. Dhima appears to argue, in cursory fashion, that existing precedent does not \"squarely\" control his case, which involves a \"novel\" fact situation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4)(i)(A). However, Dhima does not explain (and we think he cannot) what makes the IJ's routine credibility finding in this case \"novel\" or in what way the IJ's decision extended existing precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's order is <i>affirmed</i> and the petition for review <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States on February 3, 2005.

The new provisions of the Act are not applicable to this case since Dhima's application for asylum was filed prior to the effective date of the amendments</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even if Dhima were right that the IJ erred in his finding on this one factor, the combination of the other factors cited by the IJ would still lead us to conclude that the IJ's adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.

It does not. For example, Dhima quotes the Report as saying, \"[T]he Democratic Party alleged that the Government was responsible for the killing of one of its members in police custody....\" The elided portion of the original quote was \"although a government medical team confirmed that the death was a suicide.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
