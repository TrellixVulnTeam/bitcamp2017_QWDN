Acosta    appeals      from   the\n\ndistrict court's judgment affirming the denial of Social Security\n\nbenefits.1    The Commissioner of Social Security found that claimant\n\nsuffered from the following severe impairments (or combination of\n\nimpairments): herniated disc, high blood pressure, and adjustment\n\ndisorder.     In denying     benefits, the Commissioner first determined\n\nthat although claimant could not return to his past work as a truck\n\ndriver     and     ship    unloader    (medium,         semi-skilled),          claimant\n\nnonetheless had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform\n\nlight,    unskilled       work.     Then,     using      the     Medical     Vocational\n\nGuidelines (the \"Grid\"), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App.2, as\n\na framework, the Commissioner concluded that claimant was not\n\ndisabled.\n\n     On appeal, claimant argues that the administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ) 1) failed adequately to consider his allegations of pain in\n\nassessing his RFC, and 2) erred in relying on the Grid rather than\n\nobtaining the testimony of a vocational expert                   because claimant's\n\nnonexertional       limitations     (caused     by      pain     and   an    adjustment\n\ndisorder)     significantly        eroded   the     occupational         base    at   the\n\nrelevant exertional level.\n\n     I.      Consideration of Pain in Assessing RFC\n\n     The     ALJ   found    that    claimant      had    a     medical      condition   -\n\n\n     1\n        Upon consent of the parties, the case was referred to a\nmagistrate judge for all proceedings and judgment. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(c).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fherniated disc at L4-L5 and L5-S1 - that reasonably could be\n\nexpected to cause some discomfort and pain, but not to the extent\n\nalleged.     In    reaching    that   conclusion,   the   ALJ   relied   upon\n\nexamining physicians' records of claimant's medical condition,\n\nincluding claimant's descriptions of the location and intensity of\n\nhis pain.    Claimant waived his right to appear at the hearing\n\nbefore the ALJ, which would have provided an opportunity for\n\nclaimant to explain and demonstrate the functional impact of his\n\npain.    Two RFCs were prepared, one by an examining physician and\n\nthe other by a non-examining physician, both of which noted that\n\nthey had taken claimant's allegations of pain into account.               The\n\nALJ's approach was consistent with the policy described in Avery v.\n\nSec'y of HHS, 797 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n     The    only    specific    exertional   limitation     that   claimant\n\nidentifies as support for the argument that his pain precluded him\n\nfrom performing the full range of light work is            an inability to\n\nlift/carry more than 10 pounds, even occasionally.2                 Even if\n\n\n     2\n        Limitations of functions are classified as exertional or\nnonexertional. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1569a. Impairments, including\npain, can cause exertional and/or nonexertional limitations of\nfunctions. Id. Exertional limitations are those that affect a\nclaimant's \"ability to meet strength demands of jobs (sitting,\nstanding, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling).\" Id.\nNonexertional limitations are those that affect a claimant's\n\"ability to meet the demands of jobs other than the strength\ndemands.\" Id. Examples of non-strength demands of jobs are the\nability to concentrate, or to perform \"the manipulative or\npostural functions of some work such as reaching, handling,\nstooping, climbing, crawling, or crouching.\" Id.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fclaimant's pain so limited him, however, the Grid would still\n\ndictate a finding of not disabled.                The Commissioner found that\n\nclaimant was not disabled based on section 202.18 of the Grid,\n\ninvolving the subsidiary finding that claimant could perform light\n\nwork (involving occasional lifting/carrying of up to 20 pounds).\n\nIf   the    capacity     to    perform       sedentary   work    (involving     the\n\nlifting/carrying of no more than 10 pounds) is substituted for the\n\ncapacity to perform light work, section 201.19 of the Grid would\n\napply    and    would   also   direct    a     finding   that   claimant   is   not\n\ndisabled.       Either way, substantial evidence sustains the ALJ's\n\ndetermination of not disabled under the Grid. See Gordils v. Sec'y\n\nof HHS, 921 F.2d 327 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     II.       Impact of Nonexertional Limitations on Occupational Base\n\n     Claimant's main argument on appeal is that the ALJ erred in\n\nrelying exclusively on the Grid to determine whether there were a\n\nsignificant number of jobs in the national economy that he could\n\nperform.       \"The Grid is based on a claimant's exertional capacity\n\nand can only be applied when claimant's nonexertional limitations\n\ndo not significantly impair claimant's ability to perform at a\n\ngiven exertional level.\" Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).     \"If a non-strength impairment, even though considered\n\nsignificant, has the effect only of reducing that occupational base\n\nmarginally, the Grid remains highly relevant and can be relied on\n\nexclusively to yield a finding as to disability.\" Ortiz v. Sec'y of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fHHS, 890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n       A. Pain\n\n       \"Pain may be a nonexertional factor to be considered in\n\ncombination with exertional limitations as well as a separate or\n\nindependent ground for disability.\" Gagnon v. Sec'y of HHS, 666\n\nF.2d       662,   666    n.8   (1st    Cir.   1981).            Claimant   suggests    that\n\nlimitations         in     his        postural      and         manipulative       functions\n\n(specifically, bending and reaching) caused by his pain symptoms\n\nsignificantly eroded the relevant occupational base.                           Substantial\n\nevidence supports the ALJ's determination that claimant's pain did\n\nnot amount to a significant nonexertional impairment.3\n\n       The two RFCs reached different conclusions regarding how the\n\nmedical       findings         translated         into        functional     nonexertional\n\nlimitations.            The RFC prepared by the non-examining physician\n\n(\"non-examining           RFC\")       reported          that    claimant     could     stoop\n\n\"occasionally,\" and that there were no limitations in claimant's\n\nreaching ability.                The other RFC, prepared by an examining\n\nphysician (\"examining RFC\"), reported that claimant could \"never\"\n\nstoop and that he could reach only \"occasionally.\"\n\n       \"A     bending      restriction        .     .     .    constitutes     a   distinct\n\nnonexertional           limitation.\"       Ortiz,         890    F.2d   at     525.     The\n\n\n       3\n        In reaching this conclusion, we have not considered the\nmedical report of treating physician Dr. Pagán, which was\nsubmitted to the Appeals Council, but not the ALJ. We \"may\nreview the ALJ decision solely on the evidence presented to the\nALJ.\" Mills v. Apfel, 244 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                              -5-\n\fCommissioner has stated that \"[i]f a person can stoop occasionally\n\n.   .   .   in    order    to   lift   objects,    the   sedentary   and    light\n\noccupational base is virtually intact.\" Social Security Ruling 85-\n\n15, 1985 WL 56857, *7.          Reaching is an activity \"required in almost\n\nall jobs. Significant limitations of reaching . . . may eliminate\n\na large number of occupations a person could otherwise do.\" Id.\n\n        The non-examining RFC was based on a review of the medical\n\nevidence and took claimant's allegations of pain into account. Its\n\nconclusion        that    claimant     could   bend   \"occasionally\"   is     not\n\ninconsistent with the examining physicians' findings that he could\n\nbend forward only 30 or 45 degrees.               See Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 525\n\n(upholding an ALJ's finding that Ortiz's bending restriction did\n\nnot significantly reduce his potential occupational base where\n\nbending range was limited to 30 to 40 degrees and RFC indicated\n\nthat Ortiz was capable of \"occasional\" bending). The non-examining\n\nRFC's conclusion that claimant's reaching ability was not limited\n\nis supported by Dr. Babilonia's examination report, which indicated\n\nthat claimant's joint movements in his shoulders were normal, that\n\nthere was no significant inflammation or swelling of the joints,\n\nand that (other than in the dorsal spine area) his joints were\n\nnormal.\n\n        The examining RFC noted that its assessments were based on the\n\n\"patient's own reports\" that certain activities exacerbated his\n\nsymptoms.        Therefore, the ALJ was justified in giving less weight\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fto that RFC. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(3) (\"The more a medical\n\nsource      presents    relevant     evidence       to   support   an     opinion,\n\nparticularly medical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight\n\nwill   we    give    that    opinion.\").       Although    the   two    RFCs    were\n\ninconsistent in certain respects, the medical evidence was largely\n\nconsistent.         Both consulting physicians found that claimant's\n\nability to bend was limited (varying only from 30 degrees to 40\n\ndegrees).     Conflicts in the evidence regarding the range of motion\n\nin claimant's left shoulder were for the Commissioner to resolve.\n\nSee Rodriguez Pagan v. Sec'y of HHS, 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n       We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support\n\nfindings (i) that claimant was capable of at least occasional\n\nbending,      and    (ii)     that   his    reaching      abilities     were     not\n\nsignificantly       limited     by   his    pain.        Therefore,     there    was\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the Commissioner's decision that\n\nthese nonexertional limitations did not so significantly erode the\n\noccupational base as to require the testimony of a vocational\n\nexpert.\n\n       B. Adjustment Disorder\n\n       The issue concerning claimant's mental impairment is governed\n\nby our decision in Ortiz, in which we approved the use of the Grid\n\nin circumstances similar to the present case.               There, we held that\n\nexclusive reliance upon the Grid is appropriate so long as the\n\nclaimant's     mental       impairment     does   not    \"interfere     more    than\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmarginally with the performance of the full range of unskilled\n\nwork.\" Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 526.            This determination involves the\n\nfollowing two lines of inquiry: \"1) whether a claimant can perform\n\nclose to the full range of unskilled work, and 2) whether he can\n\nconform to the demands of a work setting, regardless of the skill\n\nlevel involved.\" Id.        The Commissioner has described the mental\n\ndemands of unskilled work as follows:\n\n     the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry\n     out, and remember simple instructions; to respond\n     appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and usual work\n     situations; and to deal with changes in a routine work\n     setting.\n\nSSR 85-15, 1985 WL 56857, at *4.              Conforming to the demands of a\n\nwork setting involve \"getting to work regularly . . . and remaining\n\nin the workplace for a full day.\" Id. at *6.\n\n      There is substantial evidence to support the ALJ's findings\n\nthat claimant was \"alert, coherent, relevant, logical and oriented\n\nin   the   three    spheres,\"     able    to    understand       and    carry    out\n\ninstructions, had sustained attention and concentration, and could\n\ncomplete    a   normal     work   day     and    work     week    without       undue\n\ninterruptions.      The only contrary evidence is the treating health\n\ncenter's   report     of   \"diminished\"       attention    and    concentration.\n\nHowever, the       examining   psychiatrist       concluded      that   claimant's\n\nconcentration was \"intact.\" \"[R]esolution of such conflicts in the\n\nevidence is for the [Commissioner].\" Rodriguez Pagan, 819 F.2d at\n\n3.   Although the examining psychiatrist did not complete a mental\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fRFC form, that failure did not preclude the Commissioner \"from\n\nrendering common-sense judgments about functional capacity based on\n\nmedical findings.\" Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329.                   On these facts,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the conclusion that claimant's mental\n\nimpairment does not \"interfere more than marginally with the\n\nperformance of the full range of unskilled work.\" Ortiz, 890 F.2d\n\nat 526.\n\n      Based    on    the     foregoing,     and   according   the     appropriate\n\ndeference to the Commissioner's decision, we find no error in the\n\nALJ's treatment of claimant's subjective complaints of pain.                  The\n\nALJ   partially          credited    claimant's   allegations    of    pain   and\n\ndiscomfort related to his herniated disc, and determined that he\n\ncould perform only light work.              There is substantial evidence in\n\nthe   record        to     support    the    Commissioner's     decision      that\n\nnonexertional limitations imposed by claimant's pain and mental\n\ncondition did not so significantly erode the occupational base that\n\ntestimony of a vocational expert was required.                Consequently, the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f",

Examples of non-strength demands of jobs are the\nability to concentrate, or to perform \"the manipulative or\npostural functions of some work such as reaching, handling,\nstooping, climbing, crawling, or crouching.\" Id.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fclaimant's pain so limited him, however, the Grid would still\n\ndictate a finding of not disabled.                The Commissioner found that\n\nclaimant was not disabled based on section 202.18 of the Grid,\n\ninvolving the subsidiary finding that claimant could perform light\n\nwork (involving occasional lifting/carrying of up to 20 pounds).\n\nIf   the    capacity     to    perform       sedentary   work    (involving     the\n\nlifting/carrying of no more than 10 pounds) is substituted for the\n\ncapacity to perform light work, section 201.19 of the Grid would\n\napply    and    would   also   direct    a     finding   that   claimant   is   not\n\ndisabled.       Either way, substantial evidence sustains the ALJ's\n\ndetermination of not disabled under the Grid. See Gordils v.

Reaching is an activity \"required in almost\n\nall jobs. Significant limitations of reaching . . . may eliminate\n\na large number of occupations a person could otherwise do.\" Id.\n\n        The non-examining RFC was based on a review of the medical\n\nevidence and took claimant's allegations of pain into account. Its\n\nconclusion        that    claimant     could   bend   \"occasionally\"   is     not\n\ninconsistent with the examining physicians' findings that he could\n\nbend forward only 30 or 45 degrees.               See Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 525\n\n(upholding an ALJ's finding that Ortiz's bending restriction did\n\nnot significantly reduce his potential occupational base where\n\nbending range was limited to 30 to 40 degrees and RFC indicated\n\nthat Ortiz was capable of \"occasional\" bending). The non-examining\n\nRFC's conclusion that claimant's reaching ability was not limited\n\nis supported by Dr. Babilonia's examination report, which indicated\n\nthat claimant's joint movements in his shoulders were normal, that\n\nthere was no significant inflammation or swelling of the joints,\n\nand that (other than in the dorsal spine area) his joints were\n\nnormal.\n\n        The examining RFC noted that its assessments were based on the\n\n\"patient's own reports\" that certain activities exacerbated his\n\nsymptoms.        Therefore, the ALJ was justified in giving less weight\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fto that RFC. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(3) (\"The more a medical\n\nsource      presents    relevant     evidence       to   support   an     opinion,\n\nparticularly medical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight\n\nwill   we    give    that    opinion.\").       Although    the   two    RFCs    were\n\ninconsistent in certain respects, the medical evidence was largely\n\nconsistent.         Both consulting physicians found that claimant's\n\nability to bend was limited (varying only from 30 degrees to 40\n\ndegrees).     Conflicts in the evidence regarding the range of motion\n\nin claimant's left shoulder were for the Commissioner to resolve.\n\nSee Rodriguez Pagan v. Sec'y of HHS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488579\"><a href=\"/opinion/488579/17-socsecrepser-783-unemplinsrep-cch-17374-nicasio-rodriguez-pagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n       We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support\n\nfindings (i) that claimant was capable of at least occasional\n\nbending,      and    (ii)     that   his    reaching      abilities     were     not\n\nsignificantly       limited     by   his    pain.        Therefore,     there    was\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the Commissioner's decision that\n\nthese nonexertional limitations did not so significantly erode the\n\noccupational base as to require the testimony of a vocational\n\nexpert.\n\n       B. Adjustment Disorder\n\n       The issue concerning claimant's mental impairment is governed\n\nby our decision in Ortiz, in which we approved the use of the Grid\n\nin circumstances similar to the present case.               There, we held that\n\nexclusive reliance upon the Grid is appropriate so long as the\n\nclaimant's     mental       impairment     does   not    \"interfere     more    than\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmarginally with the performance of the full range of unskilled\n\nwork.\" Ortiz, 890 F.2d at 526.            This determination involves the\n\nfollowing two lines of inquiry: \"1) whether a claimant can perform\n\nclose to the full range of unskilled work, and 2) whether he can\n\nconform to the demands of a work setting, regardless of the skill\n\nlevel involved.\" Id.        The Commissioner has described the mental\n\ndemands of unskilled work as follows:\n\n     the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry\n     out, and remember simple instructions; to respond\n     appropriately to supervision, coworkers, and usual work\n     situations; and to deal with changes in a routine work\n     setting.\n\nSSR 85-15, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">56857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.              Conforming to the demands of a\n\nwork setting involve \"getting to work regularly . . . and remaining\n\nin the workplace for a full day.\" Id. at *6.\n\n      There is substantial evidence to support the ALJ's findings\n\nthat claimant was \"alert, coherent, relevant, logical and oriented\n\nin   the   three    spheres,\"     able    to    understand       and    carry    out\n\ninstructions, had sustained attention and concentration, and could\n\ncomplete    a   normal     work   day     and    work     week    without       undue\n\ninterruptions.      The only contrary evidence is the treating health\n\ncenter's   report     of   \"diminished\"       attention    and    concentration.\n\nHowever, the       examining   psychiatrist       concluded      that   claimant's\n\nconcentration was \"intact.\" \"[R]esolution of such conflicts in the\n\nevidence is for the [Commissioner].\" Rodriguez Pagan, 819 F.2d at\n\n3.   Although the examining psychiatrist did not complete a mental\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fRFC form, that failure did not preclude the Commissioner \"from\n\nrendering common-sense judgments about functional capacity based on\n\nmedical findings.\" Gordils, 921 F.2d at 329.                   On these facts,\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the conclusion that claimant's mental\n\nimpairment does not \"interfere more than marginally with the\n\nperformance of the full range of unskilled work.\" Ortiz, 890 F.2d\n\nat 526.\n\n      Based    on    the     foregoing,     and   according   the     appropriate\n\ndeference to the Commissioner's decision, we find no error in the\n\nALJ's treatment of claimant's subjective complaints of pain.                  The\n\nALJ   partially          credited    claimant's   allegations    of    pain   and\n\ndiscomfort related to his herniated disc, and determined that he\n\ncould perform only light work.              There is substantial evidence in\n\nthe   record        to     support    the    Commissioner's     decision      that\n\nnonexertional limitations imposed by claimant's pain and mental\n\ncondition did not so significantly erode the occupational base that\n\ntestimony of a vocational expert was required.                Consequently, the\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f</pre>",
