Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Gibson, John R.,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Leticia Casalduc-Rabell, Assistant Solicitor General, with\nwhom Salvador J. Antonnetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, were on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Alfredo Fernández-Martínez, with whom Delgado & Fernández,\nLLP, was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                            December 21, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per    Curiam.     This   appeal   concerns    the   appropriate\n\neducational placement for Arianna M. Zayas-Frontera, a 14-year-old\n\nwho suffers from a number of learning and emotional disabilities.\n\nOn June 4, 2004, Arianna's parents filed a claim against the\n\nDepartment   of   Education    of    the   Commonwealth   of    Puerto   Rico\n\n(\"Department of Education\"), contesting the Department's refusal to\n\nenroll Arianna at a private school called Instituto Modelo de\n\nEnseñanza Individualizada (\"IMEI\"). IMEI, the parents claimed, was\n\nthe   appropriate   placement   for    Arianna,   given   her    particular\n\ndisabilities. The Department of Education, however, responded that\n\nthe Antonio S. Pedreira School (\"Pedreira School\"), a public\n\ninstitution, was fully capable of meeting Arianna's needs and was\n\nsufficient to satisfy the mandate that disabled children receive a\n\n\"free appropriate public education,\" as outlined in the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)\n\n(A); § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n\n           After a bench trial and on-site inspections of both IMEI\n\nand the Pedreira School, the district court held that IMEI was the\n\nproper placement for Arianna for a transitional period of one year.\n\nThe court found dispositive the following factors: 1) Arianna's\n\nemotional needs; 2) the unusual circumstance that Arianna had been\n\nout of school for nearly four years; 3) Arianna's need for constant\n\nsupervision and an in-school psychologist; 4) her adverse reaction\n\nto an exploratory placement at the Pedreira School; and 5) the fact\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthat Arianna had communicated thoughts of hurting herself.       In\n\nlight of these factors, the court held that it would be impossible\n\nfor Arianna to benefit from the opportunities available to students\n\nat the Pedreira School.    The court stated that \"[o]nce Arianna's\n\npsychological needs are addressed at IMEI, Arianna should be able\n\nto attend a less restrictive school such as the Pedreira School.\"\n\n          The Department of Education here asks us to overturn the\n\ndecision of the district court.        It again argues that placing\n\nArianna at the Pedreira School satisfies federal law.    This issue\n\nof placement is a mixed question of fact and law, i.e., one\n\nrequiring the application of \"a legal standard to a particular set\n\nof facts.\"    TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450\n\n(1976); Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).     \"Absent a showing that the wrong legal rule was\n\nemployed . . . the district court's answer to a mixed fact/law\n\nquestion is reviewable only for clear error.\"    Roland M., 910 F.2d\n\nat 990.      In explaining the \"clearly erroneous\" standard, the\n\nSupreme Court has stated that \"[i]f the district court's account of\n\nthe evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its\n\nentirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though\n\nconvinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would\n\nhave weighed the evidence differently.\"        Anderson v. City of\n\nBessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           We have reviewed the parties' briefs and the record on\n\nappeal and considered the parties' arguments presented at the oral\n\nargument, and we affirm, essentially for the reasons stated by the\n\ndistrict court in its opinion.        We stress, as the district court\n\ndid, that Arianna's placement at IMEI is only temporary.              It is\n\ndesigned so that she might \"catch up\" with her fellow students and\n\nso that she might receive an education that is tailored to her\n\nsocial, psychological, and educational needs. Since the Department\n\nof   Education   cannot   at   the   present   time   provide   the   \"free\n\nappropriate public education\" that Arianna requires, we agree with\n\nthe district court and hold that the Department of Education is\n\nresponsible for all costs associated with Arianna's provisional\n\nplacement at IMEI.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
