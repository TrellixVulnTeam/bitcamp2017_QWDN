Vladimir Grigous seeks review of\n\nthe order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his\n\nmotion to reopen his removal proceedings.    After Grigous missed a\n\nrescheduled hearing on his removability and asylum claim, the\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") ordered him removed in absentia.       The\n\npetitioner then filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings,\n\nexplaining that his attorney had a scheduling conflict.      Noting\n\nthat the petitioner had not given any explanation for his own\n\nfailure to appear before the court and that his attorney's failure\n\nto notify the immigration court of the attorney's inability to\n\nappear was inexcusable, the IJ denied his motion. Grigous appealed\n\nto the BIA, claiming that the government had failed to provide him\n\nwith notice of his hearing date in violation of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a\n\nand that he had not been advised in his native language of the\n\nconsequences of not appearing at his hearing pursuant to In re M-S,\n\n22 I. & N. Dec 349 (BIA 1998) (en banc).         The BIA summarily\n\naffirmed the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen.     We deny\n\nGrigous's petition for review.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Grigous, a citizen of Ukraine, entered the United States\n\non or about September 3, 1990, as a nonimmigrant visitor for\n\npleasure with authorization to remain in the United States until\n\nMarch 2, 1991.   He remained in the United States past that date and\n\napplied for asylum on February 12, 1993.     On June 26, 1997, the\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fgovernment served him with a Notice to Appear, charging him with\n\ninadmissibility as a nonimmigrant visitor who remained in the\n\nUnited States longer than permitted, pursuant to ยง 237(a)(1)(B) of\n\nthe     Immigration    and   Nationality   Act   (\"INA\"),   8   U.S.C.\n\nยง 1227(a)(1)(B).      We describe the proceedings before the IJ, BIA,\n\nand the district court below.\n\nA.    The IJ and BIA decisions\n\n            A hearing with the IJ was scheduled for February 11,\n\n1998.    Grigous missed the hearing, and the IJ ordered him removed\n\nin absentia.    On February 21, 1998, an attorney, Michael G. Moore,\n\nentered an appearance for Grigous and moved to reopen on the ground\n\nthat Grigous had been too ill to attend the February 11, 1998,\n\nhearing.    The IJ granted the motion to reopen and continued the\n\nhearing until May 17, 1998.      For reasons that are not clear from\n\nthe record, that hearing was rescheduled to August 5, 1998.      Moore\n\nthen requested another continuance to accommodate his vacation\n\nschedule, and the hearing was rescheduled to August 26, 1998.       A\n\nnotice of that August 26, 1998 hearing date was mailed to Moore.\n\n            Neither Grigous nor Moore appeared at the August 26, 1998\n\nhearing, and the IJ again ordered Grigous removed in absentia.      On\n\nSeptember 6, 1998, Grigous, through Moore, filed a second motion to\n\nreopen the proceedings, explaining that Moore was in immigration\n\ncourt in Hartford, Connecticut, on August 26, 1998, and thus was\n\nunable to attend the hearing.     The motion to reopen also noted that\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe IJ had ordered removal to the United Kingdom, rather than\n\nUkraine.\n\n            On September 29, 1998, the IJ denied Grigous's motion to\n\nreopen.    The IJ found that Grigous had failed to explain Grigous's\n\nfailure to appear for the hearing on August 26, 1998, concluding\n\nthat \"[t]o the extent that counsel's excuse for his non appearance\n\nis   justifiable,   it   does   not    relieve   the   respondent   of   his\n\nobligation to appear.\"      The IJ also noted that \"the fact that\n\ncounsel for the respondent did not notify the Boston Immigration\n\nCourt of the conflict is inexcusable for he was duly notified of\n\nthe hearing date and had sufficient time to protect the interest of\n\nboth his clients by requesting permission not to appear from either\n\nCourt.\" For these reasons, the IJ denied the motion.         However, the\n\nIJ issued an amended removal order correcting the country of\n\nremoval to Ukraine.\n\n            Grigous appealed to the BIA, arguing that he had not\n\nreceived notice of the hearing and that he was never warned of the\n\nconsequences of his failure to appear in his native language.            The\n\nBIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision on May 12, 2002.\n\nB.   Grigous's habeas petition\n\n            On August 19, 2002, the petitioner filed a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus in federal district court in Connecticut, again\n\nchallenging his in absentia removal order for lack of notice and\n\nappropriate warnings. On March 28, 2003, the district court stayed\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe petitioner's deportation until further notice.                Because the\n\npetitioner was still represented by Moore, the attorney who had\n\nreceived notice but did not appear at Grigous's hearing, the\n\ngovernment petitioned the court for a conflict hearing to ascertain\n\nwhether the petitioner wanted to continue to be represented by\n\nMoore and whether he wished to waive any ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim against Moore.            The district court scheduled a\n\nconflict hearing, but continued it because Grigous lacked an\n\ninterpreter.        Moore then filed a motion for a change of venue,\n\nexplaining that Grigous had moved to Massachusetts.\n\n            Before the rescheduled conflict hearing took place and\n\nbefore the court ruled on the venue motion, the government filed a\n\nmotion for a stay of proceedings, informing the court that Moore\n\nhad been disbarred from the Massachusetts bar on August 8, 2003,\n\nfor lying on his bar application.           The government also noted that\n\nMoore had previously been a member of the Connecticut bar, but he\n\nhad resigned in conjunction with grievance and criminal proceedings\n\nin 1971.     Although Moore had retained his admission to practice in\n\nthe federal district court in Connecticut, civil proceedings were\n\nabout to commence on that admission as well.           Because Moore was no\n\nlonger licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction, the government\n\nsought to stay proceedings until Moore either withdrew from the\n\ncase   or   until    the   civil   proceedings   on   his    authorization   to\n\npractice in the district court had concluded.               The government did\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fnot object to continuing the stay of deportation until the issue\n\nwas resolved.\n\n          On October 2, 2003, the district court granted the motion\n\nfor the stay of proceedings and continued the stay of deportation.\n\nOn October 14, 2003, a new attorney, Robert Lucheme, appeared on\n\nbehalf of Grigous, claiming to replace Moore.        Lucheme filed a\n\n\"motion for decision,\" explaining that \"there is no claim for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel\" and that any such claim would be\n\nprocedurally barred in any event.     The motion stated that the only\n\nissue in this case was whether Grigous had received the proper\n\nnotice of his missed hearing.   The government opposed the motion,\n\narguing that \"[t]o the contrary, the record, as it stands now,\n\ncould be subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\"\n\nand that, based on the facts of this case, such a claim might not\n\nbe procedurally barred. The government also expressed concern that\n\nGrigous's new attorney may be working with Moore, that Moore had\n\nnot formally withdrawn from the case, and that on the eve of the\n\nlast hearing, Moore had offered the government a signed stipulation\n\ndismissing Grigous's habeas petition with prejudice, an offer that\n\nthe government \"did not feel comfortable\" accepting.         Lucheme\n\nresponded with a motion for sanctions, claiming that the government\n\nwas improperly attempting to discredit him in the proceedings.    On\n\nJanuary 16, 2004, Moore filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f            On January 29, 2004, the district court granted the\n\npetitioner's motion for a change of venue to the federal district\n\ncourt in Massachusetts.    Because of the change in venue, the court\n\ndenied as moot Lucheme's motions for a decision and sanctions and\n\nMoore's motion to withdraw.\n\n            Grigous obtained a new attorney for his proceedings in\n\nMassachusetts.    However, before any decision was reached by the\n\ndistrict court in Massachusetts, the government moved to transfer\n\nthe case to the court of appeals pursuant to section 106(c) of the\n\nREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231,\n\nwhich Congress had recently enacted.1    The district court granted\n\nthe motion and transferred the case to us.      Pursuant to section\n\n\n\n1\n    REAL ID Act ยง 106(c) states:\n\n            If an alien's case, brought under [habeas],\n            and challenging a final administrative order\n            of removal, deportation, or exclusion, is\n            pending in a district court on the date of the\n            enactment of this division, then the district\n            court shall transfer the case (or the part of\n            the case that challenges the order of removal,\n            deportation, or exclusion) to the court of\n            appeals for the circuit in which a petition\n            for review could have been properly filed\n            under section 242(b)(2) of the Immigration and\n            Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), as amended by\n            this section, or under section 309(c)(4)(D) of\n            the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n            Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1101\n            note). The court of appeals shall treat the\n            transferred case as if it had been filed\n            pursuant to a petition for review under such\n            section 242, except that subsection (b)(1) of\n            such section shall not apply.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f106(c) of the REAL ID Act, we treat the transferred habeas petition\n\nas a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(2).\n\n                                II.\n\n          We review the BIA's denial of the petitioner's motion to\n\nreopen for abuse of discretion.   See Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289,\n\n292 (1st Cir. 2003).    Abuse of discretion exists \"where the BIA\n\nmisinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n\nMaindrond v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).   \"Where, as here, the BIA\n\nsummarily affirms an IJ's [decision], we review directly the IJ's\n\ndecision as if it were the decision of the BIA.\" Olujoke v.\n\nGonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          The IJ in this case treated Grigous's motion to reopen as\n\na request to rescind the in absentia removal order.   Under the INA,\n\n\"[a]ny alien who, after written notice . . . has been provided to\n\nthe alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a\n\nproceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in absentia\n\nif the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing\n\nevidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien\n\nis removable . . . .\"   8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(5)(A).    An in absentia\n\nremoval order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen \"filed\n\nwithin 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien\n\ndemonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional\n\ncircumstances\" or \"filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fthe alien did not receive notice.\" 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(5)(C).\n\nThese procedures differ from the procedures that apply to motions\n\nto   reopen    before       the   IJ   or    BIA    in    general.        Cf.    8   C.F.R.\n\nยงยง 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b).               Concluding that the government had\n\nprovided notice of the hearing to Grigous through his attorney and\n\nthat Grigous offered no explanation for his failure to appear, the\n\nIJ rejected the motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order.\n\n              In his petition for review, Grigous argues that he seeks\n\na motion to reopen his proceedings to apply for asylum under the\n\ngeneral   motion       to    reopen    procedures         set     forth   in    8    C.F.R.\n\nยง 1003.23(b), not a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia\n\nremoval order under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229(b)(5)(C).                      See Wu v. INS, 436\n\nF.3d 157, 163 (2d Cir. 2006) (explaining that, under certain\n\ncircumstances,     a    petitioner          who    has    been    ordered      removed   in\n\nabsentia may seek reopening to apply for discretionary relief under\n\nthe general reopening regulations without seeking rescission of the\n\nin   absentia    removal       order    under      8     U.S.C.   ยง   1229a(b)(5)(C)).\n\nGrigous does not raise his previous argument that the in abstentia\n\norder should be rescinded because the government failed to provide\n\nhim with notice of the date of the hearing.2                     Nor does he argue, in\n\n\n2\n  In any event, there was no merit to Grigous's claim that the\ngovernment failed to provide him with proper notice of the hearing\nunder the INA.    All of the applicable provisions of the INA\nexplicitly state that the government must provide notice to the\npetitioner or his or her counsel of record, if any. See 8 U.S.C.\nยงยง 1229a(b)(5)(A), 1229(a)(1), 1229(a)(2)(A).          The record\ndemonstrates that the government sent a Notice of Hearing form to\n\n                                            -9-\n\fthis petition, that his failure to appear was due to extraordinary\n\ncircumstances,       such   as   ineffective         assistance      by   his   former\n\ncounsel.3   Instead, Grigous argues only that his motion to reopen\n\nto apply for asylum should have been granted because \"the failure\n\nto inform petitioner of the consequences of [his] failure to appear\n\nfor subsequent hearings in a language that he could understand\n\nviolated due process protections and the BIA's past precedent.\"\n\nThus, we focus on this argument.                    We begin by addressing the\n\ngovernment's argument that Grigous lacks a factual basis for his\n\nclaim, and then turn to the merits of Grigous's argument.\n\nA.   Evidentiary basis for Grigous's claim\n\n            We note at the outset the government's contention that\n\nGrigous lacks a factual basis for his argument that the government\n\nfailed to provide him oral warnings, in a language he could\n\nunderstand,     of   the    consequences       of    failing    to    appear    at   his\n\nhearing.    The written Notice to Appear, which Grigous signed,\n\nstates   that   Grigous      received    oral       notice     in    English    of   the\n\nconsequences of failing to appear at his hearing before the IJ.\n\n\nGrigous's attorney, and Grigous does not claim that his attorney\ndid not receive it. Thus, the government met its obligation to\nprovide notice of the hearing date under the INA.\n3\n  See Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398, 408 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting\nthat \"ineffective assistance of counsel may support a motion to\nreopen [an in absentia removal order] based on exceptional\ncircumstances\"); Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 11 n.4 (1st Cir.\n2004) (noting that \"[t]he BIA has found that ineffective assistance\nof counsel may qualify as an exceptional circumstance\" for the\npurposes of rescinding an in absentia removal order).\n\n                                        -10-\n\fGrigous contends in his brief that he does not understand English,\n\nbut he failed to offer evidence below in support of this assertion.\n\nFor example, Grigous's affidavit in support of his motion to reopen\n\nsays   nothing   regarding   his   English   proficiency   and   makes    no\n\nassertion that he was not given the proper oral warnings.\n\n            To make up for this absence of evidence, Grigous's\n\nattorney notes that the district court granted a continuance in\n\nGrigous's conflict hearing in order to secure an interpreter.\n\nAlthough this fact may provide some support for Grigous's claim, it\n\ndoes not, in and of itself, demonstrate that he does not understand\n\nEnglish. Moreover, as we explain below, even assuming that Grigous\n\ndoes not understand English and was not given oral warnings in his\n\nnative language of the consequences of his failure to appear at his\n\nhearing, he nonetheless fails to establish that the BIA abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his motion to reopen to apply for asylum.\n\nB. Requirements for filing a motion to reopen to apply for relief\nfollowing an in absentia removal order\n\n            Grigous relies heavily on In re M-S-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 349\n\n(BIA 1998) (en banc), for the proposition that the BIA should have\n\ngranted his motion to reopen due to the lack of appropriate oral\n\nwarnings.    In that case, the BIA explained that a petitioner may\n\nseek reopening to apply for certain forms of previously unavailable\n\ndiscretionary    relief,     without   meeting   the   requirements      for\n\nrescinding an in absentia removal order, where the government\n\nfailed to give oral warnings of the consequences of failing to\n\n                                   -11-\n\fappear in a language that the petitioner understands.                   See In re M-\n\nS-, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 352-57; see also Wu, 436 F.3d at 163\n\n(discussing the BIA's decision in In re M-S-).                As we explain in\n\nfurther   detail    below,   however,       the    question   of    whether      oral\n\nwarnings were given prior to an in absentia removal order is\n\nimportant under the INA only in narrow circumstances.\n\n            The   petitioner   in     In   re     M-S-   sought    to   reopen   her\n\nproceedings to file for adjustment of status, discretionary relief\n\nthat was not available to her at the time of her hearing when she\n\nwas ordered deported in absentia.           See id. at 356-57.          She did not\n\nseek to challenge her removability through a motion for reopening\n\nto rescind the in absentia order, and instead filed a motion to\n\nreopen    under    the   regulations       permitting     reopening       in   cases\n\ngenerally.    However, the INA explicitly bars petitioners with in\n\nabsentia removal orders from reopening their cases to apply for\n\ncertain forms of discretionary relief within 10 years from the date\n\nof the final order of removal:\n\n            Any alien against whom a final order of\n            removal is entered in absentia under this\n            subsection and who . . . was provided oral\n            notice, either in the alien's native language\n            or in another language the alien understands,\n            of the time and place of the proceedings and\n            of the consequences . . . of failing, other\n            than because of exceptional circumstances . .\n            . to attend a proceeding under this section,\n            shall not be eligible for relief under [8\n            U.S.C. ยงยง 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259]\n            for a period of 10 years after the date of the\n            entry of the final order of removal.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(7).4   The BIA noted that adjustment of status was\n\none of the forms of discretionary relief specifically mentioned in\n\nthis provision and thus, if the petitioner was provided with the\n\nproper oral notice, she would not be eligible for adjustment of\n\nstatus.   See In re M-S-, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 355.   However, because\n\nthe petitioner was not provided with appropriate oral warnings, the\n\nBIA reasoned that this failure meant that the petitioner was not\n\nineligible for adjustment of status under the INA:\n\n           [S]ection [1229a(b)(7)] specifies that if an\n           alien fails to appear at a deportation hearing\n           after receiving oral notice, in a language the\n           alien understands, of the consequences of\n           failing to appear, the alien is ineligible\n           . . . for the forms of relief from deportation\n           listed in [ยง 1229a(b)(7)]. Conversely, if the\n           oral warnings are not provided, relief is not\n           precluded.   To rule otherwise would render\n           surplusage the requirement of [8 U.S.C.\n           ยง 1229a(b)(7)] that the oral warnings be given\n           before the consequences ensue.\n\nId.   Because relief was not precluded, the BIA could consider\n\nwhether the petitioner had established a prima facie case for\n\nadjustment of status, warranting reopening under the applicable\n\nregulations.   Id.\n\n           Grigous relies solely on this case and the language of 8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7) to support his argument that he is entitled to\n\nreopening due to the government's alleged failure to provide him\n\n\n4\n  At the time of the IJ's decision in In re M-S-, the predecessor\nstatute to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(7) applied, barring relief for a period\nof 5 years. See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252b(c)(3)(1994) (repealed 1996).\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fwith oral warnings, in his native language, of the consequences of\n\nhis failure to appear.        However, In re M-S- and the statute do not\n\nhelp him.    First, asylum is not one of the forms of relief listed\n\nin 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7), and thus Grigous's eligibility for\n\nasylum is unaffected by this provision.              In other words, Grigous\n\ncan apply for reopening under the regulations governing motions to\n\nreopen in general, and the IJ or the BIA can exercise discretion to\n\ngrant or deny his motion, without regard to any bar in 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1229a(b)(7).     Second, even if 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7) applied and\n\nthe government was required to provide oral warnings in Grigous's\n\nlanguage pursuant to that provision, the government's failure to do\n\nso   would   not   mean    that   Grigous    is   automatically   entitled   to\n\nreopening.     It only means that \"relief is not precluded\" under 8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7) and that he must still meet the requirements\n\nfor motions to reopen under the general regulations.               In re M-S-,\n\n22 I. & N. at 355.        Thus, in any event, Grigous's motion to reopen\n\ncould have been denied if it failed to meet the requirements of the\n\napplicable regulation governing his motion to reopen.\n\n             Grigous's motion does not meet the requirements of the\n\napplicable regulation. See 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.23 (setting the general\n\nstandards for granting motions to reopen before the IJ).              Grigous,\n\nunlike the petitioner in In re M-S-, is not seeking previously\n\nunavailable relief.        He applied for asylum in 1993 and it is this\n\napplication for which he seeks an adjudication.                   Typically, a\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fmotion to reopen to apply for relief may only be granted if the\n\npetitioner offers evidence that is \"material and was not available\n\nand could not have been discovered or presented at the former\n\nhearing.\" 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.23(b)(3); see also 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.2(c).\n\nGrigous fails to address these requirements or even discuss the\n\nmerits of his asylum claim in his petition for review.         Thus, his\n\ncase differs from In re M-S- and other cases where the petitioner\n\nwas able to show a basis for reopening to apply for discretionary\n\nrelief.    See In re M-S-, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 357 (finding that the\n\npetitioner \"has met the general motions requirements and has\n\nprovided sufficient evidence to indicate a reasonable likelihood\n\nthat her application [for adjustment of status] may succeed on the\n\nmerits\"); Wu, 436 F.3d at 164 (remanding where the BIA failed to\n\nconsider   the   petitioner's   argument   that   he   was   entitled   to\n\nreopening to apply for asylum based on a change of law arising\n\nafter his in absentia removal order).      Thus, the BIA did not abuse\n\nits discretion, under the INA and its regulations, in affirming the\n\nIJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen.\n\nC.   Due process\n\n           Finally, we note that insofar as Grigous argues that the\n\nright to receive oral warning in his native language arises from\n\nthe due process right to adequate notice, as opposed to any\n\nstatutory requirement in 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7), that contention\n\nsuffers from at least three serious flaws.\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f          First,    Grigous   has    utterly      failed    to   develop   that\n\nargument in his briefs.     See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\").    Second, as we have previously discussed, he has not\n\nestablished   a   factual   basis   for    this   argument.       Third,   even\n\nassuming that his argument is not waived and has an adequate\n\nfactual basis, Grigous has failed to demonstrate any prejudice as\n\na result of the lack of appropriate oral warnings.               See Lattab v.\n\nAshcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[B]efore a petitioner in\n\nan immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he\n\nmust allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the\n\nchallenged process.\").      This was not the first time that Grigous\n\nhad been ordered deported in absentia.             He was able to get his\n\nfirst in absentia deportation order rescinded through a motion to\n\nreopen, providing a letter from his doctor explaining that he had\n\nbeen too ill to attend that hearing.           Under these circumstances,\n\nGrigous is hard pressed to explain why the alleged failure of the\n\ngovernment to provide him with oral warnings in his native language\n\nof the consequences of his failure to appear prejudiced him with\n\nrespect to missing this subsequent hearing.                Furthermore, as we\n\nhave noted, Grigous has not even addressed the merits of his asylum\n\nclaim and whether there is a likelihood that he would have been\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fgranted relief.   Having failed to establish prejudice, Grigous may\n\nnot advance this due process claim here.5\n\n                                III.\n\n          The petition for review of the BIA's affirmance of the\n\nIJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen his proceedings is\n\ndenied.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Although we do not reach the question of whether, regardless of\nthe applicability of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(b)(7), due process requires\nthe provision of oral warnings in a language that the petitioner\nunderstands, it is clearly the better practice for the IJ to\nprovide these warnings to ensure that petitioners with limited\nEnglish proficiency -- some of whom may lack representation or\nadequate representation -- are aware of the consequences of their\nfailure to attend future hearings.\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

After Grigous missed a rescheduled hearing on his removability and asylum claim, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") ordered him removed <i>in absentia.</i> The petitioner then filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings, explaining that his attorney had a scheduling conflict. Noting that the petitioner had not given any explanation for his own failure to appear before the court and that his attorney's failure to notify the immigration court of the attorney's inability to appear was inexcusable, the IJ denied his motion. Grigous appealed to the BIA, claiming that the government had failed to provide him with notice of his hearing date in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a and that he had not been advised in his native language of the consequences of not appearing at his hearing pursuant to <i>In re M-S,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec 349 (BIA 1998) (en banc). The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen. We deny Grigous's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous, a citizen of Ukraine, entered the United States on or about September 3, 1990, as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain in the United States until March 2, 1991. He remained in the United States past that date and applied for asylum on February 12, 1993. On June 26, 1997, the government served him with a Notice to Appear, charging him with inadmissibility as a nonimmigrant visitor who remained in the United States longer than permitted, pursuant to &#167; 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). We describe the proceedings before the IJ, BIA, and the district court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The IJ and BIA decisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hearing with the IJ was scheduled for February 11, 1998. Grigous missed the hearing, and the IJ ordered him removed <i>in absentia.</i> On February 21, 1998, an attorney, Michael G. Moore, entered an appearance for Grigous and moved to reopen on the ground that Grigous had been too ill to attend the February 11, 1998, hearing. The IJ granted the motion to reopen and continued the hearing until May 17, 1998. For reasons that are not clear from the record, that hearing was rescheduled to August 5, 1998. Moore then requested another continuance to accommodate his vacation schedule, and the hearing was rescheduled to August 26, 1998. A notice of that August 26, 1998 hearing date was mailed to Moore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Grigous nor Moore appeared at the August 26, 1998 hearing, and the IJ again ordered Grigous removed <i>in absentia.</i> On September 6, 1998, Grigous, through Moore, filed a second motion to reopen the proceedings, explaining that Moore was in immigration court in Hartford, Connecticut, on August 26, 1998, and thus was unable to attend the hearing. The motion to reopen also noted that the IJ had ordered removal to the United Kingdom, rather than Ukraine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1998, the IJ denied Grigous's motion to reopen. The IJ found that Grigous had failed to explain Grigous's failure to appear for the hearing on August 26, 1998, concluding that \"[t]o the extent that counsel's excuse for his non appearance is justifiable, it does not relieve the respondent of his obligation to appear.\" The IJ also noted that \"the fact that counsel for the respondent did not notify the Boston Immigration Court of the conflict is inexcusable for he was duly notified of the hearing date and had sufficient time to protect the interest of both his clients by requesting permission not to appear from either Court.\" For these reasons, the IJ denied the motion. However, the IJ issued an amended removal order correcting the country of removal to Ukraine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous appealed to the BIA, arguing that he had not received notice of the hearing and that he was never warned of the consequences of his failure to appear in his native language. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision on May 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Grigous's habeas petition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 2002, the petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in Connecticut, again challenging his <i>in absentia</i> removal order for lack of notice and appropriate warnings. On March 28, 2003, the district court stayed the petitioner's deportation until further notice. Because the petitioner was still represented by Moore, the attorney who had received notice but did not appear at Grigous's hearing, the government petitioned the court for a conflict hearing to ascertain whether the petitioner wanted to continue to be represented by Moore and whether he wished to waive any ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Moore. The district court scheduled a conflict hearing, but continued it because Grigous lacked an interpreter. Moore then filed a motion for a change of venue, explaining that Grigous had moved to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the rescheduled conflict hearing took place and before the court ruled on the venue motion, the government filed a motion for a stay of proceedings, informing the court that Moore had been disbarred from the Massachusetts bar on August 8, 2003, for lying on his bar application. The government also noted that Moore had previously been a member of the Connecticut bar, but he had resigned in conjunction with grievance and criminal proceedings in 1971. Although Moore had retained his admission to practice in the federal district court in Connecticut, civil proceedings were about to commence on that admission as well. Because Moore was no longer licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction, the government sought to stay proceedings until Moore either withdrew from the case or until the civil proceedings on his authorization to practice in the district court had concluded. The government did not object to continuing the stay of deportation until the issue was resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 2003, the district court granted the motion for the stay of proceedings and continued the stay of deportation. On October 14, 2003, a new attorney, Robert Lucheme, appeared on behalf of Grigous, claiming to replace Moore. Lucheme filed a \"motion for decision,\" explaining that \"there is no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel\" and that any such claim would be procedurally barred in any event. The motion stated that the only issue in this case was whether Grigous had received the proper notice of his missed hearing. The government opposed the motion, arguing that \"[t]o the contrary, the record, as it stands now, could be subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\" and that, based on the facts of this case, such a claim might not be procedurally barred. The government also expressed concern that Grigous's new attorney may be working with Moore, that Moore had not formally withdrawn from the case, and that on the eve of the last hearing, Moore had offered the government a signed stipulation dismissing Grigous's habeas petition with prejudice, an offer that the government \"did not feel comfortable\" accepting. Lucheme responded with a motion for sanctions, claiming that the government was improperly attempting to discredit him in the proceedings. On January 16, 2004, Moore filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 29, 2004, the district court granted the petitioner's motion for a change of venue to the federal district court in Massachusetts. Because of the change in venue, the court denied as moot Lucheme's motions for a decision and sanctions and Moore's motion to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous obtained a new attorney for his proceedings in Massachusetts. However, before any decision was reached by the district court in Massachusetts, the government moved to transfer the case to the court of appeals pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, which Congress had recently enacted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court granted the motion and transferred the case to us. Pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act, we treat the transferred habeas petition as a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's denial of the petitioner's motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <i>See Zhang v. INS,</i> 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir.2003). Abuse of discretion exists \"where the BIA misinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\" <i>Maindrond v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's [decision], we review directly the IJ's decision as if it were the decision of the BIA.\" <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ in this case treated Grigous's motion to reopen as a request to rescind the <i>in absentia</i> removal order. Under the INA, \"[a]ny alien who, after written notice . . . has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed <i>in absentia</i> if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable. . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(A). An <i>in absentia</i> removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen \"filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances\" or \"filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(C). These procedures differ from the procedures that apply to motions to reopen before the IJ or BIA in general. <i>Cf.</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b). Concluding that the government had provided notice of the hearing to Grigous through his attorney and that Grigous offered no explanation for his failure to appear, the IJ rejected the motion to reopen to rescind the <i>in absentia</i> order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his petition for review, Grigous argues that he seeks a motion to reopen his proceedings to apply for asylum under the general motion to reopen procedures set forth in 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b), not a motion to reopen to rescind his <i>in absentia</i> removal order under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229(b)(5)(C). <i>See Wu v. INS,</i> 436 F.3d 157, 163 (2d Cir.2006) (explaining that, under certain circumstances, a petitioner who has been ordered removed <i>in absentia</i> may seek reopening to apply for discretionary relief under the general reopening regulations without seeking rescission of the <i>in absentia</i> removal order under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(C)). Grigous does not raise his previous argument that the <i>in abstentia</i> order should be rescinded because the government failed to provide him with notice of the date of the hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nor does he argue, in this petition, that his failure to appear was due to extraordinary circumstances, such as ineffective assistance by his former counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Instead, Grigous argues only that his motion to reopen to apply for asylum should have been granted because \"the failure to inform petitioner of the consequences of [his] failure to appear for subsequent hearings in a language that he could understand violated due process protections and the BIA's past precedent.\" Thus, we focus on this argument. We begin by addressing the government's argument that Grigous lacks a factual basis for his claim, and then turn to the merits of Grigous's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidentiary basis for Grigous's claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset the government's contention that Grigous lacks a factual basis for his argument that the government failed to provide him oral warnings, in a language he could understand, of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing. The written Notice to Appear, which Grigous signed, states that Grigous received oral notice in English of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing before the IJ. Grigous contends in his brief that he does not understand English, but he failed to offer evidence below in support of this assertion. For example, Grigous's affidavit in support of his motion to reopen says nothing regarding his English proficiency and makes no assertion that he was not given the proper oral warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make up for this absence of evidence, Grigous's attorney notes that the district court granted a continuance in Grigous's conflict hearing in order to secure an interpreter. Although this fact may provide some support for Grigous's claim, it does not, in and of itself, demonstrate that he does not understand English. Moreover, as we explain below, even assuming that Grigous does not understand English and was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of his failure to appear at his hearing, he nonetheless fails to establish that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen to apply for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Requirements for filing a motion to reopen to apply for relief following an <i>in absentia</i> removal order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous relies heavily on <i>In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (en banc), for the proposition that the BIA should have granted his motion to reopen due to the lack of appropriate oral warnings. In that case, the BIA explained that a petitioner may seek reopening to apply for certain forms of previously unavailable discretionary relief, without meeting the requirements for rescinding an <i>in absentia</i> removal order, where the government failed to give oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear in a language that the petitioner understands. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 352-57; <i>see also Wu,</i> 436 F.3d at 163 (discussing the BIA's decision in <i>In re M-S-</i>). As we explain in further detail below, however, the question of whether oral warnings were given prior to an <i>in absentia</i> removal order is important under the INA only in narrow circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner in <i>In re M-S-</i> sought to reopen her proceedings to file for adjustment of status, discretionary relief that was not available to her at the time of her hearing when she was ordered deported <i>in absentia. See id.</i> at 356-57. She did not seek to challenge her removability through a motion for reopening to rescind the <i>in absentia</i> order, and instead filed a motion to reopen under the regulations permitting reopening in cases generally. However, the INA explicitly bars petitioners with <i>in absentia</i> removal orders from reopening their cases to apply for certain forms of discretionary relief within 10 years from the date of the final order of removal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered <i>in absentia</i> under this subsection and who . . . was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences . . . of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances . . . to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under [8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259] for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The BIA noted that adjustment of status was one of the forms of discretionary relief specifically mentioned in this provision and thus, if the petitioner was provided with the proper oral notice, she would not be eligible for adjustment of status. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 355. However, because the petitioner was <i>not</i> provided with appropriate oral warnings, the BIA reasoned that this failure meant that the petitioner was <i>not</i> ineligible for adjustment of status under the INA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]ection [1229a(b)(7)] specifies that if an alien fails to appear at a deportation hearing after receiving oral notice, in a language the alien understands, of the consequences of failing to appear, the alien is ineligible . . . for the forms of relief from deportation listed in [&#167; 1229a(b)(7)]. Conversely, if the oral warnings are not provided, relief is not precluded. To rule otherwise would render surplusage the requirement of [8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7)] that the oral warnings be given before the consequences ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Because relief was not precluded, the BIA could consider whether the petitioner had established a prima facie case for adjustment of status, warranting reopening under the applicable regulations. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous relies solely on this case and the language of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) to support his argument that he is entitled to reopening due to the government's alleged failure to provide him with oral warnings, in his native language, of the consequences of his failure to appear. However, <i>In re M-S-</i> and the statute do not help him. First, asylum is not one of the forms of relief listed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7), and thus Grigous's eligibility for asylum is unaffected by this provision. In other words, Grigous can apply for reopening under the regulations governing motions to reopen in general, and the IJ or the BIA can exercise discretion to grant or deny his motion, without regard to any bar in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7). Second, even if 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) applied and the government was required to provide oral warnings in Grigous's language pursuant to that provision, the government's failure to do so would not mean that Grigous is <i>automatically</i> entitled to reopening. It only means that \"relief is not precluded\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) and that he must still meet the requirements for motions to reopen under the general regulations. <i>In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. at 355. Thus, in any event, Grigous's motion to reopen could have been denied if it failed to meet the requirements of the applicable regulation governing his motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous's motion does not meet the requirements of the applicable regulation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23 (setting the general standards for granting motions to reopen before the IJ). Grigous, unlike the petitioner in <i>In re M-S-,</i> is not seeking previously unavailable relief. He applied for asylum in 1993 and it is this application for which he seeks an adjudication. Typically, a motion to reopen to apply for relief may only be granted if the petitioner offers evidence that is \"material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(3); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c). Grigous fails to address these requirements or even discuss the merits of his asylum claim in his petition for review. Thus, his case differs from <i>In re M-S-</i> and other cases where the petitioner was able to show a basis for reopening to apply for discretionary relief. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 357 (finding that the petitioner \"has met the general motions requirements and has provided sufficient evidence to indicate a reasonable likelihood that her application [for adjustment of status] may succeed on the merits\"); <i>Wu,</i> 436 F.3d at 164 (remanding where the BIA failed to consider the petitioner's argument that he was entitled to reopening to apply for asylum based on a change of law arising after his <i>in absentia</i> removal order). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion, under the INA and its regulations, in affirming the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Due process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that insofar as Grigous argues that the right to receive oral warning in his native language arises from the due process right to adequate notice, as opposed to any statutory requirement in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7), that contention suffers from at least three serious flaws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Grigous has utterly failed to develop that argument in his briefs. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Second, as we have previously discussed, he has not established a factual basis for this argument. Third, even assuming that his argument is not waived and has an adequate factual basis, Grigous has failed to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the lack of appropriate oral warnings. <i>See Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[B]efore a petitioner in an immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\"). This was not the first time that Grigous had been ordered deported <i>in absentia.</i> He was able to get his first <i>in absentia</i> deportation order rescinded through a motion to reopen, providing a letter from his doctor explaining that he had been too ill to attend that hearing. Under these circumstances, Grigous is hard pressed to explain why the alleged failure of the government to provide him with oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of his failure to appear prejudiced him with respect to missing this subsequent hearing. Furthermore, as we have noted, Grigous has not even addressed the merits of his asylum claim and whether there is a likelihood that he would have been granted relief. Having failed to establish prejudice, Grigous may not advance this due process claim here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review of the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen his proceedings is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> REAL ID Act &#167; 106(c) states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If an alien's case, brought under [habeas], and challenging a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of this division, then the district court shall transfer the case (or the part of the case that challenges the order of removal, deportation, or exclusion) to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under section 242(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), as amended by this section, or under section 309(c)(4)(D) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note).

After Grigous missed a rescheduled hearing on his removability and asylum claim, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") ordered him removed <i>in absentia.</i> The petitioner then filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings, explaining that his attorney had a scheduling conflict. Noting that the petitioner had not given any explanation for his own failure to appear before the court and that his attorney's failure to notify the immigration court of the attorney's inability to appear was inexcusable, the IJ denied his motion. Grigous appealed to the BIA, claiming that the government had failed to provide him with notice of his hearing date in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a and that he had not been advised in his native language of the consequences of not appearing at his hearing pursuant to <i>In re M-S,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec 349 (BIA 1998) (en banc). The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen. We deny Grigous's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous, a citizen of Ukraine, entered the United States on or about September 3, 1990, as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain in the United States until March 2, 1991. He remained in the United States past that date and applied for asylum on February 12, 1993. On June 26, 1997, the government served him with a Notice to Appear, charging him with inadmissibility as a nonimmigrant visitor who remained in the United States longer than permitted, pursuant to &#167; 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). We describe the proceedings before the IJ, BIA, and the district court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The IJ and BIA decisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hearing with the IJ was scheduled for February 11, 1998. Grigous missed the hearing, and the IJ ordered him removed <i>in absentia.</i> On February 21, 1998, an attorney, Michael G. Moore, entered an appearance for Grigous and moved to reopen on the ground that Grigous had been too ill to attend the February 11, 1998, hearing. The IJ granted the motion to reopen and continued the hearing until May 17, 1998. For reasons that are not clear from the record, that hearing was rescheduled to August 5, 1998. Moore then requested another continuance to accommodate his vacation schedule, and the hearing was rescheduled to August 26, 1998. A notice of that August 26, 1998 hearing date was mailed to Moore.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Grigous nor Moore appeared at the August 26, 1998 hearing, and the IJ again ordered Grigous removed <i>in absentia.</i> On September 6, 1998, Grigous, through Moore, filed a second motion to reopen the proceedings, explaining that Moore was in immigration court in Hartford, Connecticut, on August 26, 1998, and thus was unable to attend the hearing. The motion to reopen also noted that the IJ had ordered removal to the United Kingdom, rather than Ukraine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1998, the IJ denied Grigous's motion to reopen. The IJ found that Grigous had failed to explain Grigous's failure to appear for the hearing on August 26, 1998, concluding that \"[t]o the extent that counsel's excuse for his non appearance is justifiable, it does not relieve the respondent of his obligation to appear.\" The IJ also noted that \"the fact that counsel for the respondent did not notify the Boston Immigration Court of the conflict is inexcusable for he was duly notified of the hearing date and had sufficient time to protect the interest of both his clients by requesting permission not to appear from either Court.\" For these reasons, the IJ denied the motion. However, the IJ issued an amended removal order correcting the country of removal to Ukraine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous appealed to the BIA, arguing that he had not received notice of the hearing and that he was never warned of the consequences of his failure to appear in his native language. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision on May 12, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Grigous's habeas petition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 2002, the petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in Connecticut, again challenging his <i>in absentia</i> removal order for lack of notice and appropriate warnings. On March 28, 2003, the district court stayed the petitioner's deportation until further notice. Because the petitioner was still represented by Moore, the attorney who had received notice but did not appear at Grigous's hearing, the government petitioned the court for a conflict hearing to ascertain whether the petitioner wanted to continue to be represented by Moore and whether he wished to waive any ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Moore. The district court scheduled a conflict hearing, but continued it because Grigous lacked an interpreter. Moore then filed a motion for a change of venue, explaining that Grigous had moved to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the rescheduled conflict hearing took place and before the court ruled on the venue motion, the government filed a motion for a stay of proceedings, informing the court that Moore had been disbarred from the Massachusetts bar on August 8, 2003, for lying on his bar application. The government also noted that Moore had previously been a member of the Connecticut bar, but he had resigned in conjunction with grievance and criminal proceedings in 1971. Although Moore had retained his admission to practice in the federal district court in Connecticut, civil proceedings were about to commence on that admission as well. Because Moore was no longer licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction, the government sought to stay proceedings until Moore either withdrew from the case or until the civil proceedings on his authorization to practice in the district court had concluded. The government did not object to continuing the stay of deportation until the issue was resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 2003, the district court granted the motion for the stay of proceedings and continued the stay of deportation. On October 14, 2003, a new attorney, Robert Lucheme, appeared on behalf of Grigous, claiming to replace Moore. Lucheme filed a \"motion for decision,\" explaining that \"there is no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel\" and that any such claim would be procedurally barred in any event. The motion stated that the only issue in this case was whether Grigous had received the proper notice of his missed hearing. The government opposed the motion, arguing that \"[t]o the contrary, the record, as it stands now, could be subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\" and that, based on the facts of this case, such a claim might not be procedurally barred. The government also expressed concern that Grigous's new attorney may be working with Moore, that Moore had not formally withdrawn from the case, and that on the eve of the last hearing, Moore had offered the government a signed stipulation dismissing Grigous's habeas petition with prejudice, an offer that the government \"did not feel comfortable\" accepting. Lucheme responded with a motion for sanctions, claiming that the government was improperly attempting to discredit him in the proceedings. On January 16, 2004, Moore filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 29, 2004, the district court granted the petitioner's motion for a change of venue to the federal district court in Massachusetts. Because of the change in venue, the court denied as moot Lucheme's motions for a decision and sanctions and Moore's motion to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous obtained a new attorney for his proceedings in Massachusetts. However, before any decision was reached by the district court in Massachusetts, the government moved to transfer the case to the court of appeals pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231, which Congress had recently enacted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court granted the motion and transferred the case to us.

Under the INA, \"[a]ny alien who, after written notice . . . has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed <i>in absentia</i> if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable. . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(A). An <i>in absentia</i> removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen \"filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances\" or \"filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(C). These procedures differ from the procedures that apply to motions to reopen before the IJ or BIA in general. <i>Cf.</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b). Concluding that the government had provided notice of the hearing to Grigous through his attorney and that Grigous offered no explanation for his failure to appear, the IJ rejected the motion to reopen to rescind the <i>in absentia</i> order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his petition for review, Grigous argues that he seeks a motion to reopen his proceedings to apply for asylum under the general motion to reopen procedures set forth in 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b), not a motion to reopen to rescind his <i>in absentia</i> removal order under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229(b)(5)(C). <i>See Wu v.

Grigous does not raise his previous argument that the <i>in abstentia</i> order should be rescinded because the government failed to provide him with notice of the date of the hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nor does he argue, in this petition, that his failure to appear was due to extraordinary circumstances, such as ineffective assistance by his former counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Instead, Grigous argues only that his motion to reopen to apply for asylum should have been granted because \"the failure to inform petitioner of the consequences of [his] failure to appear for subsequent hearings in a language that he could understand violated due process protections and the BIA's past precedent.\" Thus, we focus on this argument. We begin by addressing the government's argument that Grigous lacks a factual basis for his claim, and then turn to the merits of Grigous's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidentiary basis for Grigous's claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset the government's contention that Grigous lacks a factual basis for his argument that the government failed to provide him oral warnings, in a language he could understand, of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing. The written Notice to Appear, which Grigous signed, states that Grigous received oral notice in English of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing before the IJ. Grigous contends in his brief that he does not understand English, but he failed to offer evidence below in support of this assertion. For example, Grigous's affidavit in support of his motion to reopen says nothing regarding his English proficiency and makes no assertion that he was not given the proper oral warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make up for this absence of evidence, Grigous's attorney notes that the district court granted a continuance in Grigous's conflict hearing in order to secure an interpreter. Although this fact may provide some support for Grigous's claim, it does not, in and of itself, demonstrate that he does not understand English. Moreover, as we explain below, even assuming that Grigous does not understand English and was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of his failure to appear at his hearing, he nonetheless fails to establish that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen to apply for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Requirements for filing a motion to reopen to apply for relief following an <i>in absentia</i> removal order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous relies heavily on <i>In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (en banc), for the proposition that the BIA should have granted his motion to reopen due to the lack of appropriate oral warnings. In that case, the BIA explained that a petitioner may seek reopening to apply for certain forms of previously unavailable discretionary relief, without meeting the requirements for rescinding an <i>in absentia</i> removal order, where the government failed to give oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear in a language that the petitioner understands. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 352-57; <i>see also Wu,</i> 436 F.3d at 163 (discussing the BIA's decision in <i>In re M-S-</i>). As we explain in further detail below, however, the question of whether oral warnings were given prior to an <i>in absentia</i> removal order is important under the INA only in narrow circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner in <i>In re M-S-</i> sought to reopen her proceedings to file for adjustment of status, discretionary relief that was not available to her at the time of her hearing when she was ordered deported <i>in absentia. See id.</i> at 356-57. She did not seek to challenge her removability through a motion for reopening to rescind the <i>in absentia</i> order, and instead filed a motion to reopen under the regulations permitting reopening in cases generally. However, the INA explicitly bars petitioners with <i>in absentia</i> removal orders from reopening their cases to apply for certain forms of discretionary relief within 10 years from the date of the final order of removal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered <i>in absentia</i> under this subsection and who . . . was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences . . . of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances . . . to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under [8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259] for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The BIA noted that adjustment of status was one of the forms of discretionary relief specifically mentioned in this provision and thus, if the petitioner was provided with the proper oral notice, she would not be eligible for adjustment of status. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 355. However, because the petitioner was <i>not</i> provided with appropriate oral warnings, the BIA reasoned that this failure meant that the petitioner was <i>not</i> ineligible for adjustment of status under the INA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]ection [1229a(b)(7)] specifies that if an alien fails to appear at a deportation hearing after receiving oral notice, in a language the alien understands, of the consequences of failing to appear, the alien is ineligible . . . for the forms of relief from deportation listed in [&#167; 1229a(b)(7)]. Conversely, if the oral warnings are not provided, relief is not precluded. To rule otherwise would render surplusage the requirement of [8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7)] that the oral warnings be given before the consequences ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Because relief was not precluded, the BIA could consider whether the petitioner had established a prima facie case for adjustment of status, warranting reopening under the applicable regulations. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous relies solely on this case and the language of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) to support his argument that he is entitled to reopening due to the government's alleged failure to provide him with oral warnings, in his native language, of the consequences of his failure to appear. However, <i>In re M-S-</i> and the statute do not help him. First, asylum is not one of the forms of relief listed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7), and thus Grigous's eligibility for asylum is unaffected by this provision. In other words, Grigous can apply for reopening under the regulations governing motions to reopen in general, and the IJ or the BIA can exercise discretion to grant or deny his motion, without regard to any bar in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7). Second, even if 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) applied and the government was required to provide oral warnings in Grigous's language pursuant to that provision, the government's failure to do so would not mean that Grigous is <i>automatically</i> entitled to reopening. It only means that \"relief is not precluded\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7) and that he must still meet the requirements for motions to reopen under the general regulations. <i>In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. at 355. Thus, in any event, Grigous's motion to reopen could have been denied if it failed to meet the requirements of the applicable regulation governing his motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grigous's motion does not meet the requirements of the applicable regulation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23 (setting the general standards for granting motions to reopen before the IJ). Grigous, unlike the petitioner in <i>In re M-S-,</i> is not seeking previously unavailable relief. He applied for asylum in 1993 and it is this application for which he seeks an adjudication. Typically, a motion to reopen to apply for relief may only be granted if the petitioner offers evidence that is \"material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(3); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c). Grigous fails to address these requirements or even discuss the merits of his asylum claim in his petition for review. Thus, his case differs from <i>In re M-S-</i> and other cases where the petitioner was able to show a basis for reopening to apply for discretionary relief. <i>See In re M-S-,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 357 (finding that the petitioner \"has met the general motions requirements and has provided sufficient evidence to indicate a reasonable likelihood that her application [for adjustment of status] may succeed on the merits\"); <i>Wu,</i> 436 F.3d at 164 (remanding where the BIA failed to consider the petitioner's argument that he was entitled to reopening to apply for asylum based on a change of law arising after his <i>in absentia</i> removal order). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion, under the INA and its regulations, in affirming the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Due process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that insofar as Grigous argues that the right to receive oral warning in his native language arises from the due process right to adequate notice, as opposed to any statutory requirement in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(7), that contention suffers from at least three serious flaws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Grigous has utterly failed to develop that argument in his briefs. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Second, as we have previously discussed, he has not established a factual basis for this argument. Third, even assuming that his argument is not waived and has an adequate factual basis, Grigous has failed to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the lack of appropriate oral warnings. <i>See Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[B]efore a petitioner in an immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\"). This was not the first time that Grigous had been ordered deported <i>in absentia.</i> He was able to get his first <i>in absentia</i> deportation order rescinded through a motion to reopen, providing a letter from his doctor explaining that he had been too ill to attend that hearing. Under these circumstances, Grigous is hard pressed to explain why the alleged failure of the government to provide him with oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of his failure to appear prejudiced him with respect to missing this subsequent hearing. Furthermore, as we have noted, Grigous has not even addressed the merits of his asylum claim and whether there is a likelihood that he would have been granted relief. Having failed to establish prejudice, Grigous may not advance this due process claim here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review of the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's denial of Grigous's motion to reopen his proceedings is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> REAL ID Act &#167; 106(c) states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If an alien's case, brought under [habeas], and challenging a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of this division, then the district court shall transfer the case (or the part of the case that challenges the order of removal, deportation, or exclusion) to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under section 242(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), as amended by this section, or under section 309(c)(4)(D) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note). The court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section 242, except that subsection (b)(1) of such section shall not apply.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In any event, there was no merit to Grigous's claim that the government failed to provide him with proper notice of the hearing under the INA.
