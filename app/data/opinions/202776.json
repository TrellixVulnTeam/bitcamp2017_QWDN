Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                      Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and DiClerico, Jr.,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Luis A. Guzmán Dupont for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                             June 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f          DICLERICO, District Judge.    Following a six-day trial,\n\nOrlando Malpica-García was found guilty of conspiring to possess\n\nand distribute drugs and of conspiring to possess and use firearms\n\nin furtherance of drug trafficking.    He appeals both convictions,\n\narguing that the district court allowed hearsay testimony in\n\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and\n\nallowed testimony about his possession of a weapon that was not\n\ncharged in the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nMalpica-García contends that without the challenged testimony, the\n\nevidence is insufficient to support the conviction on either\n\ncount.1\n\n                                I.\n\n          A federal grand jury returned an indictment on March 13,\n\n2003, charging Malpica-García and twenty-six others with conspiracy\n\nto commit drug-related offenses beginning in June of 2001.   Later\n\nin the evening of March 13, a Puerto Rico police officer stopped a\n\ncar on the Diego Expressway because it lacked a license plate.\n\nMalpica-García was the driver of the car and told the officer that\n\nhe did not have a driver's license.    The officer ordered Malpica-\n\nGarcía out of the car.   The police found a .38 caliber gun in the\n\ncourse of their inventory search of the car.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      At oral argument, Malpica-García's counsel conceded that the\nevidence would be sufficient if the challenged testimony were\nadmissible.\n\n                                -2-\n\f          Malpica-García was arrested on March 20, 2003.        On July\n\n17, 2003, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment, again\n\ncharging Malpica-García and his co-defendants with drug-related\n\noffenses beginning in June of 2001.         Malpica-García was tried\n\nseparately from his co-defendants, some of whom pled guilty before\n\nhis trial. Two of Malpica-García's alleged co-conspirators, Leonor\n\nCuadrado-Figueroa and Edna Díaz-Pastrana, testified as government\n\nwitnesses against him.      They described drug operations and use of\n\nfirearms by Malpica-García and others.\n\n          On July 1, 2005, the jury found Malpica-García guilty of\n\nconspiring   to   possess    with   the   intent   to   distribute   and\n\ndistributing \"five (5) kilograms or more of cocaine, and/or fifty\n\n(50) kilograms of cocaine base (crack), and/or one (1) kilogram or\n\nmore, of heroin, within one thousand (1,000) feet of a public\n\nschool\" and of conspiring \"to carry a firearm in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking offense.\"    The jury found him not guilty on the third\n\ncharge, which was possessing a firearm in a school zone.         He was\n\nsentenced to 385 months of imprisonment on the first count and 240\n\nmonths on the second count, to be served concurrently.\n\n                                    II.\n\n          Malpica-García contends that parts of the testimony given\n\nby Edna Díaz-Pastrana and Leonor Cuadrado-Figuero were admitted at\n\ntrial in violation of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause,\n\nas interpreted in Washington v. Crawford, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).        He\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\falso contends that admitting evidence of the gun found in the car\n\nhe was driving on March 13, 2003, constituted a constructive\n\namendment of the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nHe asserts that without the challenged evidence, the evidence at\n\ntrial would have been insufficient to support his conviction on\n\neither count.\n\nA.   Confrontation Clause\n\n             In general, a district court's evidentiary rulings are\n\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion.               When an essentially legal\n\nissue arises as to whether evidence has been admitted in violation\n\nof   the   Confrontation      Clause,    however,    we    review     a    properly\n\npreserved constitutional challenge de novo.                  United States v.\n\nWalter, 434 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2006).                  In addition, we may\n\naffirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the\n\nrecord.    United States v. Ossai, --- F.3d ---, 2007 WL 1191139, *4\n\n(1st Cir. Apr. 24, 2007).\n\n             In Crawford, the Court held \"that the Confrontation\n\nClause     'commands,   not    that     evidence    be    reliable,       but   that\n\nreliability be assessed in a particular manner:              by testing in the\n\ncrucible of cross-examination.'\"          United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,\n\n126 S. Ct. 2557, 2562 (2006) (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 61).\n\nTherefore, \"a declarant's 'testimonial' out-of-court statement is\n\nnot admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless (1) the\n\ndeclarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\ffor cross-examination and the declarant is unavailable, or (3) the\n\nevidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth\n\nof the matter asserted.\"      United States v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 19-\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). The Confrontation\n\nClause,   as   interpreted    in   Crawford,    prohibits   evidence    of\n\nstatements that are both hearsay and testimonial.            See United\n\nStates v. Brito, 427 F.3d 53, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          1.   Díaz-Pastrana\n\n          At trial, the prosecutor asked Edna Díaz-Pastrana how she\n\nbegan using or trafficking in drugs.        She testified that she began\n\nto sell drugs through \"Jaime\" and that \"[h]e was the one who would\n\nsupply me with the drugs, and Jaime would get in touch with . . .\"\n\nAt that point, defense counsel interrupted her testimony with an\n\nobjection, and a bench conference ensued.          The court ruled that\n\nDíaz-Pastrana's statement was not hearsay.\n\n          The prosecutor then asked Díaz-Pastrana:          \"How do you\n\nknow that Jaime got in contact with Orlando Malpica?\"            Defense\n\ncounsel objected.      A second bench conference was called, and\n\ndefense   counsel    argued    that     Díaz-Pastrana's   testimony    was\n\ninadmissible under Crawford.       The court instructed the prosecutor\n\nto begin with questions about information the witness had from\n\nMalpica-García.     The prosecutor followed those instructions, and\n\nDíaz-Pastrana testified only about her personal knowledge of and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcontact with Malpica-García.                  The defense did not object to that\n\ntestimony nor is that testimony challenged on appeal.\n\n             To    come    within       the    parameters    of    the    Confrontation\n\nClause, the testimony first must be hearsay.                      Brito, 427 F.3d at\n\n61.   Broadly stated, hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is\n\noffered as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted.                         Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801.       In the challenged part of her testimony, Díaz-Pastrana\n\ntestified about her own actions that involved Jaime.                       She did not\n\ntestify     as    to   any      out-of-court        statements      made    by    Jaime.\n\nTherefore, the challenged testimony was not hearsay.\n\n             Malpica-García         also        contends     that     Díaz-Pastrana's\n\ntestimony     about       his    drug    activities        was    inadmissible     under\n\nCrawford. She testified that \"drug point\" operators, meaning those\n\nwho sold drugs at the public housing project where she lived and\n\nworked,   had     to   pay      Malpica-García       money,      called    \"prote,\"   as\n\nprotection from having the drug point closed down.                        She named the\n\ndrug point operators, including Carlitos Way, who paid Malpica-\n\nGarcía \"prote.\"\n\n             Defense counsel objected.               At sidebar, defense counsel\n\nrepresented that Díaz-Pastrana's testimony that Carlitos Way was a\n\ndrug point operator who paid prote to Malpica-García was hearsay\n\nbecause she only knew that information from Carlitos Way's wife.2\n\n\n      2\n      In his appellate brief, Malpica-García states: \"This witness\nmentioned . . . a co-conspirator named Carlos D. Cruz Rodriguez\na/k/a \"Carlitos Way\" and his wife that were not available for the\n\n                                              -6-\n\fDefense counsel objected that Díaz-Pastrana's testimony violated\n\nthe Confrontation Clause under Crawford because Carlitos Way was\n\nnot available to testify.     The district court ruled that the\n\ntestimony was admissible as a statement of a co-conspirator.     On\n\nappeal, Malpica-García argues that Díaz-Pastrana's testimony about\n\nCarlitos Way was inadmissible under Crawford.3\n\n          Díaz-Pastrana's testimony did not expressly include an\n\nout-of-court statement made by another declarant.   If, as defense\n\ncounsel asserted, her challenged testimony were based on an out-of-\n\ncourt statement by either Carlitos Way or his wife, rather than on\n\nDíaz-Pastrana's personal knowledge, the out-of-court statement must\n\nalso be testimonial to render it inadmissible under Crawford.   See\n\nUnited States v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          In Crawford, the Court gave examples of the kinds of\n\nstatements that would be testimonial: \"ex-parte in-court testimony\n\n\n\ndefense . . . .\" Contrary to that representation, Díaz-Pastrana\ndid not mention Carlitos Way's wife.      Defense counsel said at\nsidebar that Carlitos Way's wife was the source of Díaz-Pastrana's\nknowledge about him.     Therefore, the jury never heard about\nCarlitos Way's wife.\n     3\n      Although Malpica-García states that the challenged testimony\ndid not qualify as co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 801(d)(2)(E), he provides no argument to support that\nassertion. In fact, Malpica-García refers to Carlitos Way as a co-\nconspirator in his brief. The defense's objection at trial and the\nissue raised on appeal is whether the testimony was inadmissible\nunder Crawford. We need not and will not delve into the separate\nissue of whether the challenged testimony was admissible under Rule\n801(d)(2)(E), in the absence of a developed argument on that issue.\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                               -7-\n\f(or its equivalent); statements contained in formalized documents\n\n(such as affidavits and depositions); and statements made as part\n\nof a confession resulting from custodial interrogation.\"                 Hansen,\n\n434 F.3d at 100.    Statements made during and in furtherance of a\n\nconspiracy are not testimonial.           Crawford, 541 U.S. at 56; Hansen,\n\n434 F.3d at 100; United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 75\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Crawford, however, did not provide a comprehensive\n\nformulation or definition of what statements would be deemed to be\n\ntestimonial.    United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).   Following Crawford, we have held that statements\n\nare   not   testimonial    when        they    are   made   during   a   private\n\nconversation, when they are not included in formalized documents or\n\nmade in response to interrogation or examination, and when they are\n\nnot made \"under circumstances in which an objective person would\n\nreasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at\n\na later trial.\"    Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\naccord   Hansen,   434    F.3d    at    100.    Testimonial    statements    are\n\ngenerally the product of a declarant's responses to official\n\nquestioning and are made in a context in which the declarant should\n\nknow that they will be preserved for prosecutorial use. See United\n\nStates v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 2006); Brito, 427 F.3d\n\nat 60.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Assuming,        but   not    deciding,     that   Díaz-Pastrana's\n\ntestimony that Carlitos Way paid \"prote\" to Malpica-García was\n\nhearsay, the out-of-court statements were not testimonial within\n\nthe meaning of Crawford.           The record includes no indication that\n\nDíaz-Pastrana was repeating statements that Carlitos Way or his\n\nwife made to police, in an investigative context, or in a courtroom\n\nsetting.    Instead, such statements would have been made in the\n\ncourse of private conversations or in casual remarks that no one\n\nexpected would be preserved or used later at trial.                   Therefore,\n\neven if Díaz-Pastrana's testimony were based on statements made by\n\nCarlitos    Way   or   his    wife,   because   those    statements    were   not\n\ntestimonial, the challenged testimony was not prohibited under\n\nCrawford.\n\n            2. Leonor Cuadrado\n\n            Malpica-García also challenges testimony given by Leonor\n\nCuadrado about a meeting that occurred at the public housing\n\nproject in early 2003 and about Malpica-García's dealings with\n\nanother co-defendant known as \"Motito.\"                 At trial, the defense\n\nobjected to Cuadrado's testimony about the meeting and Malpica-\n\nGarcía's dealings with Motito based on Crawford.                 The district\n\ncourt denied the defense's objections to that testimony.\n\n            In the first challenged statement, Cuadrado testified\n\nthat Malpica-García and several of his co-defendants attended a\n\nmeeting in front of building seven at the housing project.                    She\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fsaid that some of those attending the meeting wanted \"drug points\"\n\nin the project to be closed but Malpica-García opposed closing\n\nthem.       She further testified that although she saw the people who\n\nhad congregated for the meeting, she did not attend and that her\n\nhusband, who was there, told her what was discussed.4                    Cuadrado's\n\nchallenged testimony about Motito was that he was a friend of hers\n\nwho complained about Malpica-García asking him for \"material\"\n\n(meaning drugs) and money.\n\n                 Neither the conversation about the meeting nor Motito's\n\ncomplaints about Malpica-García were testimonial statements within\n\nthe meaning of Crawford.               Instead, both were part of private\n\nconversations or were casual remarks made without any expectation\n\nthat       the    information    would   be   saved   and   used    at    a   trial.\n\nTherefore, Crawford does not apply.\n\nB.   Constructive Amendment of the Indictment\n\n                 Based on the March 13, 2003, indictment, Malpica-García\n\ncontends         that   the   police   officer's   testimony   at    trial    about\n\nstopping his car on the evening of March 13 and finding a gun in\n\nthe car constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment.\n\nMalpica-García argues that because the grand jury returned the\n\nindictment at 5:09 p.m. on March 13, the stop and search of the car\n\nhe was driving at 10:30 p.m. were not included in the offenses\n\n\n\n       4\n      The person Cuadrado referred to as her husband is Jesus\nEncarnación Medina, known as \"Chuchú,\" another co-defendant.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fcharged in the indictment.        Based on that sequence of events, he\n\nasserts that the police officer's testimony about finding the gun\n\nwas evidence of an offense not charged in the indictment, entitling\n\nhim to a reversal of his conviction on the charge of conspiracy to\n\ncarry a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense.\n\n            \"A   constructive     amendment   (fatal    without   regard    to\n\nprejudice) occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\n\naltered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court\n\nafter the grand jury has last passed on them . . . .\"                   United\n\nStates v. Mueffelman, 470 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2006) (internal\n\nquotation   marks     omitted).     Therefore,   \"[a]     defendant     cannot\n\ncomplain of an improper constructive amendment if the indictment is\n\nactually amended by resubmission to the grand jury.\" United States\n\nv. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            In this case, Malpica-García's constructive amendment\n\nargument is based entirely upon the indictment returned on March\n\n13, 2003.   A superseding indictment, however, was submitted to the\n\ngrand jury and was returned on July 17, 2003.              The superseding\n\nindictment,      in   pertinent   part,    charged     Malpica-García     with\n\nconspiring to use, carry, or possess a firearm in furtherance of a\n\ndrug trafficking crime from September 12, 2001, to March 13, 2003.\n\nBecause the superseding indictment was returned months after March\n\n13 and includes material events that occurred at any time during\n\nMarch 13, Malpica-García's argument based on the timing of the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fprevious indictment is unavailing.      Therefore, the prosecution did\n\nnot constructively amend the indictment.\n\nC.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            As is noted above (see footnote one), Malpica-García's\n\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that if the challenged testimony\n\nwere properly admitted at trial, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's verdict.      That being the case, we need not\n\nconsider    Malpica-García's   argument    on   insufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

Later in the evening of March 13, a Puerto Rico police officer stopped a car on the Diego Expressway because it lacked a license plate. Malpica-Garc&#237;a was the driver of the car and told the officer that he did not have a driver's license. The officer ordered Malpica-Garc&#237;a out of the car.

Malpica-Garc&#237;a was tried separately from his co-defendants, some of whom pled guilty before his trial. Two of Malpica-Garc&#237;a's alleged co-conspirators, Leonor Cuadrado-Figueroa and Edna D&#237;az-Pastrana, testified as government witnesses against him.

Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). He also contends that admitting evidence of the gun found in the car he was driving on March 13, 2003, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He asserts that without the challenged evidence, the evidence at trial would have been insufficient to support his conviction on either count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Confrontation Clause</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, a district court's evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. When an essentially legal issue arises as to whether evidence has been admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause, however, we review a properly preserved constitutional challenge de novo. <i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2006). In addition, we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record. <i>United States v. Ossai,</i> 485 F.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford,</i> the Court held \"that the Confrontation Clause `commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.'\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2562, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (quoting <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354). Therefore, \"a declarant's `testimonial' out-of-court statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless (1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" <i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). The Confrontation Clause, as interpreted in <i>Crawford,</i> prohibits evidence of statements that are both hearsay and testimonial. <i>See United States v. Brito,</i> 427 F.3d 53, 61-62 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>D&#237;az-Pastrana</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecutor asked Edna D&#237;az-Pastrana how she began using or trafficking in drugs. She testified that she began to sell drugs through \"Jaime\" and that \"[h]e was the one who would supply me with the drugs, and Jaime would get in touch with . . .\" At that point, defense counsel interrupted her testimony with an objection, and a bench conference ensued. The court ruled that D&#237;az-Pastrana's statement was not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor then asked D&#237;az-Pastrana: \"How do you know that Jaime got in contact with Orlando Malpica?\" Defense counsel objected. A second bench conference was called, and defense counsel argued that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i> The court instructed the prosecutor to begin with questions about information the witness had from Malpica-Garc&#237;a. The prosecutor followed those instructions, and D&#237;az-Pastrana testified only about her personal knowledge of and contact with Malpica-Garc&#237;a. The defense did not object to that testimony nor is that testimony challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To come within the parameters of the Confrontation Clause, the testimony first must be hearsay. <i>Brito,</i> 427 F.3d at 61. Broadly stated, hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is offered as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted. Fed.R.Evid. 801. In the challenged part of her testimony, D&#237;az-Pastrana testified about her own actions that involved Jaime. She did not testify as to any out-of-court statements made by Jaime. Therefore, the challenged testimony was not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malpica-Garc&#237;a also contends that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony about his drug activities was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i> She testified that \"drug point\" operators, meaning those who sold drugs at the public housing project where she lived and worked, had to pay Malpica-Garc&#237;a money, called \"prote,\" as protection from having the drug point closed down. She named the drug point operators, including Carlitos Way, who paid Malpica-Garc&#237;a \"prote.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected. At sidebar, defense counsel represented that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony that Carlitos Way was a drug point operator who paid prote to Malpica-Garc&#237;a was hearsay because she only knew that information from Carlitos Way's wife.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Defense counsel objected that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony violated the Confrontation Clause under <i>Crawford</i> because Carlitos Way was not available to testify. The district court ruled that the testimony was admissible as a statement of a co-conspirator. On appeal, Malpica-Garc&#237;a argues that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony about Carlitos Way was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony did not expressly include an out-of-court statement made by another declarant. If, as defense counsel asserted, her challenged testimony were based on an out-of-court statement by either Carlitos Way or his wife, rather than on D&#237;az-Pastrana's personal knowledge, the out-of-court statement must also be testimonial to render it inadmissible under <i>Crawford. See United States v. Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford,</i> the Court gave examples of the kinds of statements that would be testimonial: \"ex-parte in-court testimony (or its equivalent); statements contained in formalized documents (such as affidavits and depositions); and statements made as part of a confession resulting from custodial interrogation.\" <i>Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d at 100. Statements made during and in furtherance of a conspiracy are not testimonial. <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d at 100; <i>United States v. Sanchez-Berrios,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 75 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Crawford,</i> however, did not provide a comprehensive formulation or definition of what statements would be deemed to be testimonial. <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir.2004). Following <i>Crawford,</i> we have held that statements are not testimonial when they are made during a private conversation, when they are not included in formalized documents or made in response to interrogation or examination, and when they are not made \"under circumstances in which an objective person would reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir.2004); <i>accord Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d at 100. Testimonial statements are generally the product of a declarant's responses to official questioning and are made in a context in which the declarant should know that they will be preserved for prosecutorial use. <i>See United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Brito,</i> 427 F.3d at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, but not deciding, that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony that Carlitos Way paid \"prote\" to Malpica-Garc&#237;a was hearsay, the out-of-court statements were not testimonial within the meaning of <i>Crawford.</i> The record includes no indication that D&#237;az-Pastrana was repeating statements that Carlitos Way or his wife made to police, in an investigative context, or in a courtroom setting. Instead, such statements would have been made in the course of private conversations or in casual remarks that no one expected would be preserved or used later at trial. Therefore, even if D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony were based on statements made by Carlitos Way or his wife, because those statements were not testimonial, the challenged testimony was not prohibited under <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Leonor Cuadrado</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malpica-Garc&#237;a also challenges testimony given by Leonor Cuadrado about a meeting that occurred at the public housing project in early 2003 and about Malpica-Garc&#237;a's dealings with another co-defendant known as \"Motito.\" At trial, the defense objected to Cuadrado's testimony about the meeting and Malpica-Garc&#237;a's dealings with Motito based on <i>Crawford.</i> The district court denied the defense's objections to that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first challenged statement, Cuadrado testified that Malpica-Garc&#237;a and several of his co-defendants attended a meeting in front of building seven at the housing project. She said that some of those attending the meeting wanted \"drug points\" in the project to be closed but Malpica-Garc&#237;a opposed closing them. She further testified that although she saw the people who had congregated for the meeting, she did not attend and that her husband, who was there, told her what was discussed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cuadrado's challenged testimony about Motito was that he was a friend of hers who complained about Malpica-Garc&#237;a asking him for \"material\" (meaning drugs) and money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the conversation about the meeting nor Motito's complaints about Malpica-Garc&#237;a were testimonial statements within the meaning of <i>Crawford.</i> Instead, both were part of private conversations or were casual remarks made without any expectation that the information would be saved and used at a trial. Therefore, <i>Crawford</i> does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the March 13, 2003, indictment, Malpica-Garc&#237;a contends that the police officer's testimony at trial about stopping his car on the evening of March 13 and finding a gun in the car constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment. Malpica-Garc&#237;a argues that because the grand jury returned the indictment at 5:09 p.m. on March 13, the stop and search of the car he was driving at 10:30 p.m. were not included in the offenses charged in the indictment. Based on that sequence of events, he asserts that the police officer's testimony about finding the gun was evidence of an offense not charged in the indictment, entitling him to a reversal of his conviction on the charge of conspiracy to carry a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A constructive amendment (fatal without regard to prejudice) occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed on them....\" <i>United States v. Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, \"[a] defendant cannot complain of an improper constructive amendment if the indictment is <i>actually</i> amended by resubmission to the grand jury.\" <i>United States v. Calderon,</i> 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's constructive amendment argument is based entirely upon the indictment returned on March 13, 2003. A superseding indictment, however, was submitted to the grand jury and was returned on July 17, 2003. The superseding indictment, in pertinent part, charged Malpica-Garc&#237;a with conspiring to use, carry, or possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime from September 12, 2001, to March 13, 2003. Because the superseding indictment was returned months after March 13 and includes material events that occurred at any time during March 13, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's argument based on the timing of the previous indictment is unavailing. Therefore, the prosecution did not constructively amend the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is noted above (see footnote one), Malpica-Garc&#237;a's counsel conceded at oral argument that if the challenged testimony were properly admitted at trial, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. That being the case, we need not consider Malpica-Garc&#237;a's argument on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's counsel conceded that the evidence would be sufficient if the challenged testimony were admissible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In his appellate brief, Malpica-Garc&#237;a states: \"This witness mentioned ... a co-conspirator named Carlos D. Cruz Rodriguez a/k/a `Carlitos Way' and his wife that were not available for the defense....\" Contrary to that representation, D&#237;az-Pastrana did not mention Carlitos Way's wife. Defense counsel said at sidebar that Carlitos Way's wife was the source of D&#237;az-Pastrana's knowledge about him. Therefore, the jury never heard about Carlitos Way's wife</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although Malpica-Garc&#237;a states that the challenged testimony did not qualify as co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), he provides no argument to support that assertion. In fact, Malpica-Garc&#237;a refers to Carlitos Way as a co-conspirator in his brief. The defense's objection at trial and the issue raised on appeal is whether the testimony was inadmissible under<i>Crawford.</i> We need not and will not delve into the separate issue of whether the challenged testimony was admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), in the absence of a developed argument on that issue. <i>See United States v.

He also contends that admitting evidence of the gun found in the car he was driving on March 13, 2003, constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

When an essentially legal issue arises as to whether evidence has been admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause, however, we review a properly preserved constitutional challenge de novo. <i>United States v.

Therefore, \"a declarant's `testimonial' out-of-court statement is not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless (1) the declarant testifies, or (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination and the declarant is unavailable, or (3) the evidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" <i>United States v.

The Confrontation Clause, as interpreted in <i>Crawford,</i> prohibits evidence of statements that are both hearsay and testimonial. <i>See United States v.

A second bench conference was called, and defense counsel argued that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i> The court instructed the prosecutor to begin with questions about information the witness had from Malpica-Garc&#237;a. The prosecutor followed those instructions, and D&#237;az-Pastrana testified only about her personal knowledge of and contact with Malpica-Garc&#237;a. The defense did not object to that testimony nor is that testimony challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To come within the parameters of the Confrontation Clause, the testimony first must be hearsay. <i>Brito,</i> 427 F.3d at 61. Broadly stated, hearsay is an out-of-court statement that is offered as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted. Fed.R.Evid. 801. In the challenged part of her testimony, D&#237;az-Pastrana testified about her own actions that involved Jaime. She did not testify as to any out-of-court statements made by Jaime. Therefore, the challenged testimony was not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malpica-Garc&#237;a also contends that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony about his drug activities was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i> She testified that \"drug point\" operators, meaning those who sold drugs at the public housing project where she lived and worked, had to pay Malpica-Garc&#237;a money, called \"prote,\" as protection from having the drug point closed down. She named the drug point operators, including Carlitos Way, who paid Malpica-Garc&#237;a \"prote.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected. At sidebar, defense counsel represented that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony that Carlitos Way was a drug point operator who paid prote to Malpica-Garc&#237;a was hearsay because she only knew that information from Carlitos Way's wife.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Defense counsel objected that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony violated the Confrontation Clause under <i>Crawford</i> because Carlitos Way was not available to testify. The district court ruled that the testimony was admissible as a statement of a co-conspirator. On appeal, Malpica-Garc&#237;a argues that D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony about Carlitos Way was inadmissible under <i>Crawford.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony did not expressly include an out-of-court statement made by another declarant. If, as defense counsel asserted, her challenged testimony were based on an out-of-court statement by either Carlitos Way or his wife, rather than on D&#237;az-Pastrana's personal knowledge, the out-of-court statement must also be testimonial to render it inadmissible under <i>Crawford. See United States v.

Following <i>Crawford,</i> we have held that statements are not testimonial when they are made during a private conversation, when they are not included in formalized documents or made in response to interrogation or examination, and when they are not made \"under circumstances in which an objective person would reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Horton v.

Testimonial statements are generally the product of a declarant's responses to official questioning and are made in a context in which the declarant should know that they will be preserved for prosecutorial use. <i>See United States v.

Instead, such statements would have been made in the course of private conversations or in casual remarks that no one expected would be preserved or used later at trial. Therefore, even if D&#237;az-Pastrana's testimony were based on statements made by Carlitos Way or his wife, because those statements were not testimonial, the challenged testimony was not prohibited under <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Leonor Cuadrado</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malpica-Garc&#237;a also challenges testimony given by Leonor Cuadrado about a meeting that occurred at the public housing project in early 2003 and about Malpica-Garc&#237;a's dealings with another co-defendant known as \"Motito.\" At trial, the defense objected to Cuadrado's testimony about the meeting and Malpica-Garc&#237;a's dealings with Motito based on <i>Crawford.</i> The district court denied the defense's objections to that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first challenged statement, Cuadrado testified that Malpica-Garc&#237;a and several of his co-defendants attended a meeting in front of building seven at the housing project. She said that some of those attending the meeting wanted \"drug points\" in the project to be closed but Malpica-Garc&#237;a opposed closing them. She further testified that although she saw the people who had congregated for the meeting, she did not attend and that her husband, who was there, told her what was discussed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cuadrado's challenged testimony about Motito was that he was a friend of hers who complained about Malpica-Garc&#237;a asking him for \"material\" (meaning drugs) and money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the conversation about the meeting nor Motito's complaints about Malpica-Garc&#237;a were testimonial statements within the meaning of <i>Crawford.</i> Instead, both were part of private conversations or were casual remarks made without any expectation that the information would be saved and used at a trial. Therefore, <i>Crawford</i> does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the March 13, 2003, indictment, Malpica-Garc&#237;a contends that the police officer's testimony at trial about stopping his car on the evening of March 13 and finding a gun in the car constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment. Malpica-Garc&#237;a argues that because the grand jury returned the indictment at 5:09 p.m. on March 13, the stop and search of the car he was driving at 10:30 p.m. were not included in the offenses charged in the indictment. Based on that sequence of events, he asserts that the police officer's testimony about finding the gun was evidence of an offense not charged in the indictment, entitling him to a reversal of his conviction on the charge of conspiracy to carry a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A constructive amendment (fatal without regard to prejudice) occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed on them....\" <i>United States v. Mueffelman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202534\"><a href=\"/opinion/202534/united-states-v-mueffelman/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, \"[a] defendant cannot complain of an improper constructive amendment if the indictment is <i>actually</i> amended by resubmission to the grand jury.\" <i>United States v. Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196602\"><a href=\"/opinion/196602/united-states-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's constructive amendment argument is based entirely upon the indictment returned on March 13, 2003. A superseding indictment, however, was submitted to the grand jury and was returned on July 17, 2003. The superseding indictment, in pertinent part, charged Malpica-Garc&#237;a with conspiring to use, carry, or possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime from September 12, 2001, to March 13, 2003. Because the superseding indictment was returned months after March 13 and includes material events that occurred at any time during March 13, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's argument based on the timing of the previous indictment is unavailing. Therefore, the prosecution did not constructively amend the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is noted above (see footnote one), Malpica-Garc&#237;a's counsel conceded at oral argument that if the challenged testimony were properly admitted at trial, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. That being the case, we need not consider Malpica-Garc&#237;a's argument on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, Malpica-Garc&#237;a's counsel conceded that the evidence would be sufficient if the challenged testimony were admissible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In his appellate brief, Malpica-Garc&#237;a states: \"This witness mentioned ... a co-conspirator named Carlos D. Cruz Rodriguez a/k/a `Carlitos Way' and his wife that were not available for the defense....\" Contrary to that representation, D&#237;az-Pastrana did not mention Carlitos Way's wife. Defense counsel said at sidebar that Carlitos Way's wife was the source of D&#237;az-Pastrana's knowledge about him. Therefore, the jury never heard about Carlitos Way's wife</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although Malpica-Garc&#237;a states that the challenged testimony did not qualify as co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), he provides no argument to support that assertion. In fact, Malpica-Garc&#237;a refers to Carlitos Way as a co-conspirator in his brief. The defense's objection at trial and the issue raised on appeal is whether the testimony was inadmissible under<i>Crawford.</i> We need not and will not delve into the separate issue of whether the challenged testimony was admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), in the absence of a developed argument on that issue. <i>See United States v.
