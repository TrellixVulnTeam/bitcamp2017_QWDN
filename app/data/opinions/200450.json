Claimant-appellant Dennis Cohen appeals\n\nfrom a judgment of the district court affirming an order of the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security that Cohen was not entitled to\n\ndisability benefits.            The disputed issue in this case is\n\nwhether, as of June 30, 1994, the date he was last insured\n\n(\"DLI\"), appellant suffered from a disabling mental impairment\n\nor combination of mental impairments.\n\n           Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties'\n\nbriefs, we reject each of appellant's assignments of error and\n\nagree   with   the     district    court     that      there    is   substantial\n\nevidence in the record supporting the Commissioner's finding\n\nthat appellant suffered from a progressively worsening mental\n\nimpairment     that,    as    of   the     date   of   his     application     for\n\ndisability     benefits, had not yet reached a level of severity\n\nthat would in itself preclude him from performing his past\n\nrelevant work as a cook, and that, accordingly, appellant's\n\nmental impairment        was    not   in    itself     severe    enough   to    be\n\ndisabling as of the much earlier DLI.                   See Social Security\n\nRuling 83-20, Titles II and XVI: Onset of Disability (S.S.A.\n\n1983) (requiring the ALJ to call             a medical advisor when there\n\nis ambiguity as to how long an impairment \"ha[s] existed at a\n\ndisabling level of severity\").\n\n           Affirmed.
