José A. López-López\n\npled guilty to two counts of delivering adulterated milk into\n\ninterstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and\n\nCosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 333(a)2), and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\nThe district court sentenced him to eighteen months' imprisonment\n\nfollowed by two years supervised release, and ordered him to pay a\n\n$200 special assessment.     We have jurisdiction of his appeal\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. 3742(a), and affirm.\n\n                        FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant was a dairy farmer in Arecibo, Puerto Rico,\nengaged in the commercial production of milk.      On at least five\noccasions over a seven-month period, defendant, together with\ndelivery truck drivers, participated in a scheme to add water and\n\nsalt to the milk produced at his farm.   The adulterated milk was\nthen delivered to a processing plant.        The water was added to\nincrease the amount of milk sold and salt was added to mask the\n\naddition of water and avoid detection of the adulterated milk at\nthe processing plant.   Defendant furnished the water and salt and\npaid the truck drivers.    Defendant and the truck drivers used\ncontaminated water and filthy hoses.   The drivers transported the\n\nmilk to the processing plant's silos, where it became mixed with\n\nother milk delivered to the plant and where it was processed for\n\ndistribution in Puerto Rico and the continental United States.    As\n\na result of the scheme defendant was paid for the increased amount\n\nof milk delivered. Had the adulteration been discovered, however,\n\nit would have been considered worthless and been discarded.      The\n\n                                -2-\n\faddition of the adulterated milk to the contents of the silos,\n\nmoreover, created a clear health risk to consumers.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\nI.    FAILURE TO CONTINUE THE SENTENCING HEARING\n\n             Defendant contends that he was denied due process because\n\nthe district court failed to continue the sentencing hearing, even\n\nthough the Presentence Report (PSR) and the addendum were not\ntimely delivered to counsel. Rule 32(b)(6)(A) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Criminal Procedure requires the probation officer to furnish the\n\nPSR   to    defendant   not   less    than    thirty-five   days   before   the\nsentencing hearing, unless defendant waives this minimum period;\nthere is no record of defendant having waived.1             Here, the PSR was\ndelivered approximately fourteen days before the hearing. Rule\n\n32(b)(6)(B) requires that the parties within fourteen days after\nreceiving the PSR communicate any objections to each other in\nwriting.2    Here, the government submitted its objections to the PSR\n\napproximately one week before the hearing, and it failed to deliver\na    copy   to   defendant    until   the    commencement   of   the   hearing.\n\n\n\n       1\n      \"Not less than 35 days before the sentencing hearing--unless\ndefendant waives this minimum period--the probation officer must\nfurnish the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's\ncounsel, and the attorney for the Government.\" FED . R. CRIM . PRO .\n32(b)(6)(A).\n       2\n      \"Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the\nparties shall communicate in writing to the probation officer, and\nto each other, any objections to any material information,\nsentencing classifications, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy\nstatements contained in or omitted from the presentence report.\"\nFED. R. CRIM . PRO . 32(b)(6)(B).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fFinally, Rule 32(b)(6)(C) requires the probation officer to submit\n\nthe PSR with an addendum setting forth unresolved objections not\n\nlater than seven days before the hearing.3   Here, defendant did not\nreceive the addendum until four days before the hearing and appears\n\nnot to have received the government's objections to the PSR until\n\nimmediately before the hearing.\n          We ordinarily review the district court's failure to\n\ncontinue the sentencing hearing for abuse of discretion.        See\n\nUnited States v. Marrero-Ortíz, 160 F.3d 768, 777 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nDefense counsel, after complaining about the late receipt of the\n\ngovernment's objection, did not claim surprise and voiced no\n\nobjection to the court's going forward with sentencing, much less\n\nmove for a continuance.   See id. (stating that untimely receipt of\nthe addendum to the PSR although in violation of Rule 32(b)(6)(C)\n\nis insufficient standing alone to establish undue surprise).     To\n\nthe contrary, counsel acceded to the court's wish to proceed and\ngave no indication of lack of preparation.\n\n          While we perceive no abuse of discretion in the court's\n\nproceeding with the sentencing hearing in these circumstances, we\n\ndo not mean to minimize the importance of the time limits specified\n\nin Rule 32 or turn a blind eye to the indifference to them shown by\n\nthe government and the probation officer in this case.   Those time\n\n\n     3\n      \"Not later than 7 days before the sentencing hearing, the\nprobation officer must submit the presentence report to the court,\ntogether with an addendum. . . . At the same time, the probation\nofficer must furnish [copies] to the defendant, the defendant's\ncounsel, and the attorney for the Government.\" FED . R. CRIM . PRO .\n32(b)(6)(C).\n\n                                -4-\n\flimits are no mere technicalities; they are integral to the fair\n\nand orderly process of imposing sentence.                   They are mandatory and\n\nwe expect compliance with them.\n            Defendant also contends that the failure to continue the\n\nhearing and afford him more time to respond to the addendum\n\nviolated his due-process rights.           Absent plain error, an issue not\npresented to the district court cannot be raised for the first time\n\non appeal.      United States v. Chaklader, 987 F.2d 75, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    Even if there were error in the proceedings, the error\n\nclaimed by defendant certainly did not \"seriously affect[ ] the\n\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited    States   v.    Olano,    507    U.S.       725,    736   (1993)(internal\n\nquotations omitted).\n            Defendant     argues    that       had    he    timely      received    the\n\naddendum, he would have been prepared at sentencing to discuss the\n\ndisagreement between the government and the probation officer\nregarding the appropriate enhancement for his leadership role.                       In\n\nits objections, the government argued for a four-level enhancement\n\nfor his role in the offense. Rejecting this argument, the addendum\n\nstated that a four-level enhancement would be inappropriate because\n\nthere    were   only    four   participants,         not    five   as    required    by\n\nSentencing Guideline § 3B1.1(a).                U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL\n\n§ 3B1.1(A).     At sentencing, as discussed below, the court applied\n\na four-level enhancement but it did so based not on the number of\n\nparticipants but on defendant's \"otherwise extensive\" conduct, a\n\ntheory not addressed by the government or the addendum.                     Since the\n\n                                         -5-\n\farguments in the addendum turned out to be irrelevant to the\n\ncourt's application of the enhancement, defendant's failure to\n\nreceive it earlier did not adversely affect counsel's ability to\nprepare.      Hence,    the   delay   did   not   affect   the   sentencing\n\nproceeding's fairness, integrity or public reputation.\n\nII.    ENHANCEMENT FOR MORE THAN MINIMAL PLANNING PURSUANT TO\n       SENTENCING GUIDELINES § 2F1.1(b)(2)(a)\n\n            Defendant contends that the court erred in determining\n\nthat the offense involved more than minimal planning, resulting in\na     two-level   enhancement    pursuant    to   Sentencing     Guidelines\n\n§ 2F1.1(b)(2)(a).      We review for clear error.    See United States v.\n\nChapman, 241 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2001).             \"More than minimal\n\nplanning\" exists \"if significant affirmative steps were taken to\n\nconceal the offense\" or in \"any case involving repeated acts over\n\na period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely\n\nopportune.\"       U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 1B1.1, cmt. 1(f)\n\n(1998).\n\n            The court found that defendant engaged in more than\nminimal planning based on his affirmative steps to conceal the\n\noffense.     As defendant admitted, the sole purpose of adding the\nsalt was to conceal the milk adulteration.          Moreover, defendant's\nrepeated acts, occurring over a period of seven months, cannot be\n\ncharacterized as \"purely opportune.\"        Defendant had the salt ready\n\nand had prefilled the milk vats with water in preparation for the\n\nadulteration.     See United States v. Rust, 976 F.2d 55, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (\"conduct is 'purely opportune' only if it is spur of the\n\n                                      -6-\n\fmoment   conduct,           intended    to        take   advantage       of   a   sudden\n\nopportunity\").         His actions did not \"occur unexpectedly\" and\n\n\"without previous notice.\"             Chapman, 241 F.3d at 62.               We find no\n\nclear error.\n\nIII. ENHANCEMENT FOR BEING A LEADER/ORGANIZER PURSUANT TO\n     SENTENCING GUIDELINES § 3B1.1(a)\n\n            Defendant contends that the court erred in imposing a\n\nfour-level enhancement for being \"an organizer or leader of a\n\ncriminal activity . . . that was otherwise extensive\" pursuant to\n\nGuideline       §   3B1.1(a).          We       review   a   role   in    the     offense\n\ndetermination for clear error.                   See United States v. Cadavid, 192\n\nF.3d 230, 237 (1st Cir. 1999).\n            A       court     making        a     four-level    role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment under Guideline § 3B1.1(a) must first determine whether\nthe defendant acted as an organizer/leader of a specific criminal\nactivity.       If so, the court asks the separate question of whether\n\nthat criminal activity involved five or more participants or was\n\n\"otherwise extensive.\"           United States v. D'Andrea, 107 F.3d 949,\n\n957 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            In determining whether a defendant acted as organizer or\nleader, the court considers, inter alia:\n\n            the exercise of decision making authority, the\n            nature of the participation in the commission\n            of the offense, . . . the degree of\n            participation in planning or organizing the\n            offense, [and] the nature and scope of the\n            illegal activity.\n\nU.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 3B1.1, cmt. 4.\n\nThe district court's finding that defendant was \"the owner of the\n\n                                                -7-\n\ffarm and without his participation there can be no adulterated\n\nmilk\" supports its determination that he was an organizer/leader of\n\nthe criminal activity.\n\n           In determining whether a criminal activity is \"otherwise\n\nextensive,\" the court considers the totality of the circumstances,\n\n\"including not only the number of participants, but also the width,\n\nbreadth, scope, complexity and duration of the scheme.\"               United\n\nStates v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1991).               Participants\n\ninclude those who unknowingly participated in the activity.             U.S.\n\nSENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 3B1.1,   CMT .   3; D'Andrea, 107 F.3d at 957.\n\nThe district court found that \"the fraud . . . allowed [the]\n\nunknowing services of many to be utilized in putting this milk in\n\nthe chain of commerce. . . . There were chemists, the employees,\n\nthe milk industry people, who relied on this and unknowingly gave\n\ntheir services in order to put this milk in the chain of commerce.\"\n\nThe court did not clearly err in concluding that the activity was\n\n\"otherwise extensive.\"\n\n           We find no clear error in the court's application of the\nenhancement.\n\nIV.   ALLOCUTION\n\n           Finally, defendant contends that the district court erred\n\nwhen it announced its sentencing findings before giving him an\nopportunity for allocution.       Rule 32(c)(3)(C) requires the court,\n\nbefore imposing sentence, to give the defendant an opportunity \"to\n\nmake a statement and to present any information in mitigation of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthe sentence.\" FED . R. CRIM . P. 32(c)(3)(C).    Here, after the court\n\nannounced its sentencing findings, government counsel advised the\n\ncourt that it had not yet heard defendant's allocution.       The court\n\nimmediately responded: \"You are absolutely correct.       I never heard\n\nhim.   I have to backtrack here and ask him whether he has anything\n\nto say.     And if he does, I will consider it, even if I have to\n\nchange the sentence that I imposed.\"     The defendant then made his\n\nstatement expressing remorse and the court, after hearing it,\n\neliminated the fine it had previously announced. \"When a judge\n\nannounces a sentence before hearing an allocution, it is fair to\nassume that such a sentence is tentative and that the judge will\n\nconsider the defendant's statement before imposing a sentence.\"\n\nUnited States v. Burgos-Andujar, 275 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nHere, the facts validate that assumption.        Where the record shows\n\nthat the sentencing judge has properly considered defendant's\n\nallocution when imposing sentence, even if the judge had previously\n\nannounced a tentative sentence, Rule 32(c)(3)(C) is satisfied. Id.\n\nAccordingly, we find no error.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

And if he does, I will consider it, even if I have to change the sentence that I imposed.\" The defendant then made his statement expressing remorse and the court, after hearing it, eliminated the fine it had previously announced. \"When a judge announces a sentence before hearing an allocution, it is fair to assume that such a sentence is tentative and that the judge will consider the defendant's statement before imposing a sentence.\" <i>United States v.

L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez pled guilty to two counts of delivering adulterated milk into interstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 331(a), 333(a)(2), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The district court sentenced him to eighteen months' imprisonment followed by two years supervised release, and ordered him to pay a $200 special assessment. We have jurisdiction of his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and 18 U.S.C. 3742(a), and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was a dairy farmer in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, engaged in the commercial production of milk. On at least five occasions over a seven-month period, defendant, together with delivery truck drivers, participated in a scheme to add water and salt to the milk produced at his farm. The adulterated milk was then delivered to a processing plant. The water was added to increase the amount of milk sold and salt was added to mask the addition of water and avoid detection of the adulterated milk at the processing plant. Defendant furnished the water and salt and paid the truck drivers. Defendant and the truck drivers used contaminated water and filthy hoses. The drivers transported the milk to the processing plant's silos, where it became mixed with other milk delivered to the plant and where it was processed for distribution in Puerto Rico and the continental United States. As a result of the scheme defendant was paid for the increased amount of milk delivered. Had the adulteration been discovered, however, it would have been considered worthless and been discarded. The addition of the adulterated milk to the contents of the silos, moreover, created a clear health risk to consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. FAILURE TO CONTINUE THE SENTENCING HEARING</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that he was denied due process because the district court failed to continue the sentencing hearing, even though the Presentence Report (PSR) and the addendum were not timely delivered to counsel. Rule 32(b)(6)(A) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the probation officer to furnish the PSR to defendant not less than thirty-five days before the sentencing hearing, unless defendant waives this minimum period; there is no record of defendant having waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Here, the PSR was delivered approximately fourteen days before the hearing. Rule 32(b)(6)(B) requires that the parties within fourteen days after receiving the PSR communicate any objections to each other in writing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Here, the government submitted its objections to the PSR approximately one week before the hearing, and it failed to deliver a copy to defendant until the commencement of the hearing. Finally, Rule 32(b)(6)(C) requires the probation officer to submit the PSR with an addendum setting forth unresolved objections not later than seven days before the hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Here, defendant did not receive the addendum until four days before the hearing and appears not to have received the government's objections to the PSR until immediately before the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We ordinarily review the district court's failure to continue the sentencing hearing for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Marrero-Ort&#237;z,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198207\"><a href=\"/opinion/198207/united-states-v-marrero-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 777 (1st Cir.1998). Defense counsel, after complaining about the late receipt of the government's objection, did not claim surprise and voiced no objection to the court's going forward with sentencing, much less move for a continuance. <i>See id.</i> (stating that untimely receipt of the addendum to the PSR although in violation of Rule 32(b)(6)(C) is insufficient standing alone to establish undue surprise). To the contrary, counsel acceded to the court's wish to proceed and gave no indication of lack of preparation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we perceive no abuse of discretion in the court's proceeding with the sentencing hearing in these circumstances, we do not mean to minimize the importance of the time limits specified in Rule 32 or turn a blind eye to the indifference to them shown by the government and the probation officer in this case. Those time limits are no mere technicalities; they are integral to the fair and orderly process of imposing sentence. They are mandatory and we expect compliance with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also contends that the failure to continue the hearing and afford him more time to respond to the addendum violated his due-process rights.

And if he does, I will consider it, even if I have to change the sentence that I imposed.\" The defendant then made his statement expressing remorse and the court, after hearing it, eliminated the fine it had previously announced. \"When a judge announces a sentence before hearing an allocution, it is fair to assume that such a sentence is tentative and that the judge will consider the defendant's statement before imposing a sentence.\" <i>United States v. Burgos-Andujar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775958\"><a href=\"/opinion/775958/united-states-v-norma-burgos-andjar/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2001). Here, the facts validate that assumption. Where the record shows that the sentencing judge has properly considered defendant's allocution when imposing sentence, even if the judge had previously announced a tentative sentence, Rule 32(c)(3)(C) is satisfied. <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable William W Schwarzer, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of California sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Not less than 35 days before the sentencing hearing &#8212; unless defendant waives this minimum period &#8212; the probation officer must furnish the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's counsel, and the attorney for the Government.\" FED.
