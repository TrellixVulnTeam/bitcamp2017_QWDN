Barnett, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, Appeals Division, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney\nGeneral, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          February 16, 2010\n\f              BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      Scott Forsyth, appealing after a\n\ndenial of his petition for habeas corpus, is serving eight to ten\n\nyears in state prison for assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon, malicious destruction of property, and attempted arson.\n\nHis conviction stemmed from an incident at his mother's home in the\n\npre-dawn hours of September 10, 2000.          During an argument, Forsyth\n\ntook a nearby can of gasoline and chased his mother into the\n\nkitchen with it; spilled gasoline all over the kitchen floor and\n\nsplashed it onto her head and shoulders; and threatened to set fire\n\nto his mother, himself, and the house.\n\n              When Forsyth's mother attempted a 911 call, Forsyth\n\npulled the phone from the wall, but police responded to the\n\ninterrupted      call.        Forsyth   was   thereafter    charged      in   the\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court with assault with intent to murder and\n\nthe three lesser offenses listed above.           Just prior to proceedings\n\non December 19, 2000, an unrecorded lobby conference with the\n\npresiding judge occurred to discuss a possible guilty plea and\n\nsentence.      What was said in the conference is evidenced by later\n\naffidavits submitted by the three individuals who attended it (in\n\naddition to the judge): the prosecutor, Forsyth's plea counsel, and\n\na probation officer.\n\n              From these affidavits and the later proceedings, it is\n\nclear   the    parties   at    the   conference   could    not   agree   upon   a\n\nrecommended sentence; but they agreed that Forsyth would aim to\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fplead guilty to the three less serious charges in exchange for the\n\nCommonwealth's dismissal of the assault with intent to murder\n\ncharge; and they discussed obtaining for his sentencing a mental\n\nhealth evaluation based on Forsyth's history of mental illness,\n\nincluding bipolar disorder. None of the three affiants claims that\n\na specific sentence recommendation was promised by the prosecutor,\n\nbut recollections differ on what if anything was said as to\n\npossible numbers.\n\n                In her affidavit, Forsyth's plea counsel said that her\n\n\"memory [was] that the Commonwealth was willing to request a three\n\nto five year term if the defendant was in agreement\"; that absent\n\nsuch       an   agreement   the   prosecutor   did   not   commit   to   any\n\nrecommendation; but that plea counsel thought the Commonwealth\n\nwould still recommend and the judge would accept a term in that\n\nrange.       The prosecutor and probation officer had no memory that a\n\nthree to five year term was mentioned, and the probation officer\n\nremembered only that the prosecutor had said in the conference that\n\nshe \"was going to recommend a lengthy period of incarceration.\"1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The prosecutor said the following:\n\n       Although I have no specific memory of ever mentioning\n       three to five years as a possible sentence, during\n       preliminary negotiations I may have offered to try to get\n       a three to five year sentence on an agreed plea. I never\n       secured this recommendation by my office because the\n       defendant made clear that he would not join in a\n       sentencing recommendation.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            After   the    lobby    conference,   Forsyth's    plea   counsel\n\nconferred with Forsyth. Forsyth averred (in a 2003 affidavit) that\n\nhis plea counsel told him that \"the lawyer for the government said\n\nshe would ask for three to five years of incarceration in the House\n\nof Correction,\" but his plea counsel's affidavit states that she\n\n\"never told Mr. Forsyth that the Commonwealth would recommend at\n\nmost three to five years.\"         Instead, her affidavit says, she told\n\nhim only that a \"three to five year term had been discussed, [but]\n\nthe Commonwealth had not guaranteed what its recommendation was\n\ngoing to be.\"\n\n            Forsyth then pled guilty to the three lesser charges\n\nalready listed and the Commonwealth dismissed the assault with\n\nintent to murder charge.           The court made the usual inquiries to\n\nassure that the plea was being entered voluntarily and with a basis\n\nin fact.    The court also invited the prosecutor to list the maximum\n\npenalties for each of the charges to which Forsyth was pleading\n\nguilty and confirmed that Forsyth understood that the court could\n\nimpose     the   maximum    sentence     for   each   charge    and   do   so\n\nconsecutively.      Both in a signed, written waiver of rights and in\n\ncourt, Forsyth confirmed that no promises had been made to induce\n\nhis plea.\n\n            After a psychiatric evaluation, a sentencing hearing was\n\nheld on June 4, 2001. The Commonwealth recommended that Forsyth be\n\nsentenced to eight to ten years in prison for assault and battery\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwith a dangerous weapon.            The court accepted the Commonwealth's\n\nrecommendation, taking note of the seriousness of Forsyth's prior\n\ncriminal history, which included a previous attempt on his mother's\n\nlife in which he had stabbed her with a screwdriver.                       Forsyth\n\nreacted angrily to the sentence but, at the time, did not assert\n\nthat       he   had   been   promised   or   assured   of   either   a   different\n\nrecommendation by the prosecutor or a different sentence.\n\n                In July 2001, Forsyth filed motions to revise and revoke\n\nhis sentence.         That fall, he filed pro se a motion to withdraw his\n\nplea, asserting in an affidavit that he \"had a deal and copped out\n\nto house time split with probation.\"             Thereafter, in 2003, Forsyth\n\n(now aided by successor counsel) claimed in a new motion to\n\nwithdraw the plea that his plea counsel either \"misunderstood the\n\nCommonwealth's proposed recommendation or . . . misinformed Mr.\n\nForsyth of what that recommendation would be,\" and that Forsyth\n\n\"acted in reliance upon [his] attorney's representation of the\n\ngovernment's position.\"           It was at this point that Forsyth filed\n\nthe 2003 affidavit earlier quoted.2\n\n                In response, the Commonwealth submitted the affidavits\n\n(discussed above) of the prosecutor, Forsyth's plea counsel, and\n\n\n\n       2\n      Forsyth's new counsel had no personal knowledge of what\nhappened incident to the guilty plea but she stated, in an\naccompanying affidavit of her own, that Forsyth's plea counsel had\ntold her that in the December 19 lobby conference \"the Commonwealth\nrecommended a three to five year term and that the Court appeared\namenable to a House of Correction term followed by probation.\"\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe probation officer regarding the December 19 lobby conference\n\nand Forsyth's conversation with plea counsel prior to entering his\n\nguilty plea.   The trial judge denied the motions to revise the\n\nsentence and to withdraw the guilty plea and denied a request for\n\nan evidentiary hearing, saying that Forsyth's affidavit was \"self-\n\nserving,\" that he (the judge) \"credit[ed] the affidavits\" of the\n\nprosecutor and Forsyth's plea counsel, and that the Commonwealth\n\nhad in fact told Forsyth's counsel that it intended to recommend \"a\n\nlengthy sentence.\"    The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed,\n\nCommonwealth v. Forsyth, 868 N.E.2d 953, 2007 WL 1775200 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2007), and further review was denied, Commonwealth v.\n\nForsyth, 873 N.E.2d 247 (Mass. 2007).\n\n          Forsyth then filed a federal habeas corpus petition,\n\narguing that his plea was based upon inaccurate and incomplete\n\ninformation and therefore involuntary and that he had received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.      A flawed plea may sometimes\n\ncomprise a due process violation, Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238,\n\n243 & n.5 (1969); inadequate counseling can also undermine due\n\nprocess and Sixth Amendment rights where counsel's efforts do not\n\nmeet minimum standards and where the outcome was thereby affected.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684-85, 687-96 (1984).\n\n          Adopting a magistrate judge's report and recommendation,\n\nthe district court dismissed the petition.    Granted a certificate\n\nof appealability, Forsyth has now renewed his constitutional claims\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fin this court: mainly he contends that his plea counsel misled him\n\ninto thinking that the prosecutor had promised to recommend a three\n\nto five year prison sentence or at least predicted ineptly that the\n\nCommonwealth would make such a recommendation.\n\n          Our review of the district court's decision is de novo.\n\nPina v. Maloney, 565 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2009).    The governing\n\nfederal habeas statute provides that a state decision may be\n\noverturned--so far as it resolves factual issues--only if it is\n\n\"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"3   28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(2) (2006).   As for federal legal issues decided by the\n\nstate court, they may be set aside only if the decision \"was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\"   Id.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).\n\n          The state courts credited the affidavit of Forsyth's plea\n\ncounsel; the key pertinent content amounted to this: that plea\n\ncounsel had told Forsyth that the prosecutor had not promised a\n\n\n     3\n      The petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"). Rashad v. Walsh, 300 F.3d 27,\n34 (1st Cir. 2002). A different provision of the statute requires\nclear and convincing evidence from the petitioner in order to\ndefeat a state court factual finding, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1), but\nwe need not consider whether this standard applies because we find\nthat Forsyth cannot prevail even under the arguably less\ndeferential section 2254(d)(2) standard. Wood v. Allen, No. 08-\n9156, 2010 WL 173369, at *6 & n.2 (U.S. Jan. 20, 2010); see John v.\nRusso, 561 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir. 2009); Teti v. Bender, 507 F.3d\n50, 56-60 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1719 (2008).\n\n                               -7-\n\fspecific recommendation and that plea counsel had never told him\n\nthat the recommended sentence would not exceed three to five years.\n\nThere is ample independent support in the record for plea counsel's\n\nsworn statements and, while no single element is conclusive, the\n\ncollective evidence is powerfully supportive:\n\n                 Cthe prosecutor swore that no such\n          recommendation or commitment had been made to\n          plea counsel;\n\n                 Cthe probation officer recalled only\n          that the prosecutor had said in the lobby\n          conference that she was going to recommend a\n          lengthy period of incarceration;\n\n                 Cpetitioner represented both in the\n          written waiver of rights and in open court\n          that no promises had been made to secure his\n          guilty plea;\n\n                 Cwhen the prosecutor at sentencing later\n          recommended the eight to ten year term,\n          neither plea counsel nor petitioner responded\n          that this was contrary to a commitment; and\n\n                 Con pronouncement of the sentence,\n          petitioner became quite angry, but did not say\n          that he had been told of any commitment by the\n          prosecutor to recommend a shorter sentence.\n\n          True, Forsyth later asserted that he was told that the\n\nprosecutor would recommend the three to five year sentence, but\n\nsuch professions are not uncommon when a tough sentence is imposed,\n\nand in this case they were belated.   True, his successor defense\n\ncounsel attested to a supposed admission by plea counsel (see note\n\n2, above); but assuming plea counsel said what is recounted, it\n\nlooks to be little more than a reference to a possible proposed\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fdeal--a joint recommendation for three to five years--that was\n\nnever pursued.\n\n            In all events, the state court credited plea counsel and\n\nthe prosecutor and declined to credit Forsyth.                     Certainly Forsyth\n\nfails to establish that the state court erred in finding no promise\n\nor commitment by the prosecutor existed and in finding plea counsel\n\ndid not lead Forsyth to believe the contrary, still less that the\n\nstate court's decision was \"based on an unreasonable determination\n\nof the facts.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).          His due process claim thus\n\nfails insofar as it rests on the premise that plea counsel provided\n\nfalse information about the prosecutor's commitments or intentions.\n\n            Nor     was    the   district        court     required    to    hold   an\n\nindependent       evidentiary        hearing    to   try     the    issues    already\n\ndetermined by the state courts.                Pina, 565 F.3d at 54; Teti, 507\n\nF.3d at 60-63.       Forsyth has offered no reason to believe that,\n\n\"with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, [he could] develop a\n\nfactual record that would entitle him to habeas relief.\"                      Schriro\n\nv. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 475 (2007).              The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\n            Forsyth presses on appeal a separate claim that plea\n\ncounsel advised Forsyth that a three to five year sentence was the\n\nmaximum likely sentence that would be recommended or that the judge\n\nwould impose, thereby offering advice that was incompetent and\n\ndepriving   Forsyth       of   the    constitutionally        required       effective\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fassistance of counsel.    The factual premise for this claim is not\n\nwell developed and the claim itself may not have been preserved.\n\nBut the short answer is that if plea counsel did prophesy that the\n\nterm of three to five years would likely be recommended, imposed or\n\nboth, it was hardly an incompetent conjecture.\n\n             A defense counsel is entitled to offer to a client\n\npondering a plea counsel's reasonable best guess as to a likely\n\nsentence.4    Here, the possibility of a joint three to five year\n\nrecommendation as part of the plea package may well have been\n\ndiscussed between counsel; Forsyth's medical history offered some\n\nprospect that the judge might be sympathetic; his mother, the\n\nvictim, opposed incarceration; and the Commonwealth's non-binding\n\nproposed sentencing guidelines were favorable to Forsyth.        If\n\ncounsel offered such a prediction, she was not incompetent in doing\n\nso.   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-91.\n\n             Forsyth separately argues that his plea counsel should\n\nhave alerted the court to the pre-plea negotiations as a mitigation\n\nfactor at sentencing, but he offers no legal analysis or reason why\n\nthis would have affected his sentence; indeed, the judge was already\n\n\n\n      4\n      See Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 775 (1st Cir. 1994)\n(\"[A]n inaccurate prediction about sentencing will generally not\nalone be sufficient to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\"); United States v. Pallotta, 433 F.2d 594, 595 (1st Cir.\n1970) (\"[A] mere prediction by counsel of the court's likely\nattitude on sentence, short of some implication of an agreement or\nunderstanding, is not ground for attacking a plea.\" (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                -10-\n\faware of negotiations, having attended the lobby conference at which\n\nthey occurred. Forsyth has also moved to supplement the record, but\n\nthe documents to which he refers are already in the record and have\n\nbeen considered.    We affirm the district court's judgment and\n\ndismiss the motion to supplement as moot.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Forsyth averred (in a 2003 affidavit) that\n\nhis plea counsel told him that \"the lawyer for the government said\n\nshe would ask for three to five years of incarceration in the House\n\nof Correction,\" but his plea counsel's affidavit states that she\n\n\"never told Mr. Forsyth that the Commonwealth would recommend at\n\nmost three to five years.\"         Instead, her affidavit says, she told\n\nhim only that a \"three to five year term had been discussed, [but]\n\nthe Commonwealth had not guaranteed what its recommendation was\n\ngoing to be.\"\n\n            Forsyth then pled guilty to the three lesser charges\n\nalready listed and the Commonwealth dismissed the assault with\n\nintent to murder charge.           The court made the usual inquiries to\n\nassure that the plea was being entered voluntarily and with a basis\n\nin fact.    The court also invited the prosecutor to list the maximum\n\npenalties for each of the charges to which Forsyth was pleading\n\nguilty and confirmed that Forsyth understood that the court could\n\nimpose     the   maximum    sentence     for   each   charge    and   do   so\n\nconsecutively.      Both in a signed, written waiver of rights and in\n\ncourt, Forsyth confirmed that no promises had been made to induce\n\nhis plea.\n\n            After a psychiatric evaluation, a sentencing hearing was\n\nheld on June 4, 2001. The Commonwealth recommended that Forsyth be\n\nsentenced to eight to ten years in prison for assault and battery\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwith a dangerous weapon.            The court accepted the Commonwealth's\n\nrecommendation, taking note of the seriousness of Forsyth's prior\n\ncriminal history, which included a previous attempt on his mother's\n\nlife in which he had stabbed her with a screwdriver.                       Forsyth\n\nreacted angrily to the sentence but, at the time, did not assert\n\nthat       he   had   been   promised   or   assured   of   either   a   different\n\nrecommendation by the prosecutor or a different sentence.\n\n                In July 2001, Forsyth filed motions to revise and revoke\n\nhis sentence.         That fall, he filed pro se a motion to withdraw his\n\nplea, asserting in an affidavit that he \"had a deal and copped out\n\nto house time split with probation.\"             Thereafter, in 2003, Forsyth\n\n(now aided by successor counsel) claimed in a new motion to\n\nwithdraw the plea that his plea counsel either \"misunderstood the\n\nCommonwealth's proposed recommendation or . . . misinformed Mr.\n\nForsyth of what that recommendation would be,\" and that Forsyth\n\n\"acted in reliance upon [his] attorney's representation of the\n\ngovernment's position.\"           It was at this point that Forsyth filed\n\nthe 2003 affidavit earlier quoted.2\n\n                In response, the Commonwealth submitted the affidavits\n\n(discussed above) of the prosecutor, Forsyth's plea counsel, and\n\n\n\n       2\n      Forsyth's new counsel had no personal knowledge of what\nhappened incident to the guilty plea but she stated, in an\naccompanying affidavit of her own, that Forsyth's plea counsel had\ntold her that in the December 19 lobby conference \"the Commonwealth\nrecommended a three to five year term and that the Court appeared\namenable to a House of Correction term followed by probation.\"\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe probation officer regarding the December 19 lobby conference\n\nand Forsyth's conversation with plea counsel prior to entering his\n\nguilty plea.   The trial judge denied the motions to revise the\n\nsentence and to withdraw the guilty plea and denied a request for\n\nan evidentiary hearing, saying that Forsyth's affidavit was \"self-\n\nserving,\" that he (the judge) \"credit[ed] the affidavits\" of the\n\nprosecutor and Forsyth's plea counsel, and that the Commonwealth\n\nhad in fact told Forsyth's counsel that it intended to recommend \"a\n\nlengthy sentence.\"    The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed,\n\nCommonwealth v.

True, his successor defense\n\ncounsel attested to a supposed admission by plea counsel (see note\n\n2, above); but assuming plea counsel said what is recounted, it\n\nlooks to be little more than a reference to a possible proposed\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fdeal--a joint recommendation for three to five years--that was\n\nnever pursued.\n\n            In all events, the state court credited plea counsel and\n\nthe prosecutor and declined to credit Forsyth.                     Certainly Forsyth\n\nfails to establish that the state court erred in finding no promise\n\nor commitment by the prosecutor existed and in finding plea counsel\n\ndid not lead Forsyth to believe the contrary, still less that the\n\nstate court's decision was \"based on an unreasonable determination\n\nof the facts.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).          His due process claim thus\n\nfails insofar as it rests on the premise that plea counsel provided\n\nfalse information about the prosecutor's commitments or intentions.\n\n            Nor     was    the   district        court     required    to    hold   an\n\nindependent       evidentiary        hearing    to   try     the    issues    already\n\ndetermined by the state courts.                Pina, 565 F.3d at 54; Teti, 507\n\nF.3d at 60-63.

The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n\n            Forsyth presses on appeal a separate claim that plea\n\ncounsel advised Forsyth that a three to five year sentence was the\n\nmaximum likely sentence that would be recommended or that the judge\n\nwould impose, thereby offering advice that was incompetent and\n\ndepriving   Forsyth       of   the    constitutionally        required       effective\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fassistance of counsel.    The factual premise for this claim is not\n\nwell developed and the claim itself may not have been preserved.\n\nBut the short answer is that if plea counsel did prophesy that the\n\nterm of three to five years would likely be recommended, imposed or\n\nboth, it was hardly an incompetent conjecture.\n\n             A defense counsel is entitled to offer to a client\n\npondering a plea counsel's reasonable best guess as to a likely\n\nsentence.4    Here, the possibility of a joint three to five year\n\nrecommendation as part of the plea package may well have been\n\ndiscussed between counsel; Forsyth's medical history offered some\n\nprospect that the judge might be sympathetic; his mother, the\n\nvictim, opposed incarceration; and the Commonwealth's non-binding\n\nproposed sentencing guidelines were favorable to Forsyth.        If\n\ncounsel offered such a prediction, she was not incompetent in doing\n\nso.   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-91.\n\n             Forsyth separately argues that his plea counsel should\n\nhave alerted the court to the pre-plea negotiations as a mitigation\n\nfactor at sentencing, but he offers no legal analysis or reason why\n\nthis would have affected his sentence; indeed, the judge was already\n\n\n\n      4\n      See Knight v.
