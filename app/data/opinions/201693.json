Appellant   Centro   de   Recaudaciones    de\n\nIngresos Municipales (CRIM) appeals from a summary judgment denying\n\nits claim under a surety contract, issued by appellee Universal\n\nInsurance Company, on which it was a named obligee. The procedural\n\nhistory of the case is complicated, but we will confine ourselves\n\nto the essentials, which are relatively straightforward.\n\n           On August 18, 1995, Universal agreed to act as a surety\n\nto ENTEC Corporation, the general contractor hired by CRIM to\n\ndesign, furnish, and install a Land Information Management System.\n\nAccordingly, Universal simultaneously issued a Performance Bond,\n\nwhich guaranteed to CRIM the general performance of the contract\n\n(up to the penalty specified in the bond), and a Labor and Material\n\nPayment   Bond,   which     guaranteed   the   payment   of   subcontractors\n\n(again, up to the penalty specified in the bond).              Each bond was\n\ngiven the number 000-41867, named ENTEC as the principal and CRIM\n\nas the obligee, and was issued with a bond penalty sum in the\n\namount of $501,750.00 -- apparently, a small fraction of the value\n\nof the project.     Effective October 16, 1996, ENTEC and Universal\n\nexecuted an endorsement \"[t]o be attached to and form part of bond\n\nno. 000-41867 issued on behalf of [ENTEC] as Principal and in favor\n\nof [CRIM] as Obligee in the amount of ONE MILLION THREE THOUSANDS\n\nFIVE HUNDRED AND 00/100 Dollars ($1,003,500.00).\"             The endorsement\n\nadded Chicorp Financial Services \"AS ADDITIONAL OBLIGEE UNDER\n\nCAPTIONED BOND.\"\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f             In May 2000, a number of subcontractors brought the\n\nunderlying lawsuit alleging, inter alia, breach of contract.           CRIM\n\nand Universal were named defendants.          On May 31, 2002, Universal\n\nfiled a motion for consent and/or declaratory judgment asking the\n\ndistrict court to decree its liability on bond no. 000-41867 to be\n\nthe penalty sum of $501,750.00 and to dismiss all claims against it\n\nwith prejudice, subject to it paying the judgment amount to the\n\ncourt.   On September 17, 2002, the court entered the requested\n\njudgment and, on October 1, 2002, Universal deposited $501,750.00\n\nwith the court.\n\n             Shortly thereafter, however, CRIM cross-claimed against\n\nUniversal under the Performance Bond in the amount of $501,750.00.\n\nUniversal moved to dismiss the cross-claim, CRIM opposed, and\n\nseveral additional filings ensued.          The parties' dispute centered\n\naround whether the $501.750.00 penalty set forth on the Performance\n\nBond and on the Labor and Material Payment Bond was Universal's\n\ntotal liability as surety, or whether Universal was separately\n\nobligated in the amount of $501,750 under each bond, in which case\n\nthe amount deposited with the court would not reflect Universal's\n\ntotal liability.\n\n             Universal pointed to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's\n\ndecision in Caguas Plumbing, Inc. v. Continental Constr. Corp.,\n\n2001   JTS   169   (2001),    where   the   Court   in   dicta   evinced   an\n\nunderstanding      that   a    surety's      liability    under    similar,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsimultaneously issued Performance and Labor and Material Bonds was\n\nthe single amount listed on each bond.                        CRIM countered that the\n\nsurety    contract    at    issue      here    materially           differed    from       that\n\nconsidered in Caguas Plumbing by pointing to the endorsement, which\n\nstated    that     Universal's      liability           was    twice     the   $501,750.00\n\nspecified in each bond, or $1,003,500.00.                      Along these same lines,\n\nCRIM also mentioned, without elaborating why it should matter, the\n\nfact that the project cost far more than Universal's potential\n\nliability    under     either     reading          of   the     contract.        Universal\n\nresponded with a sworn statement from Iris M. Rivera-Menéndez,\n\nUniversal's Surety Department Manager, which averred that the sole\n\npurpose of the endorsement was to name Chicorp Financial Services\n\nas   an   additional    obligee        under       bond       no.   000-41867,       that    no\n\nadditional premium was charged for the issuance of the endorsement,\n\nand that the endorsement did not alter the amount of Universal's\n\nmonetary liability in any way.\n\n             Treating      the   motion       to    dismiss         as   one   for   summary\n\njudgment     and    finding      the     Caguas         Plumbing         decision     to    be\n\ndispositive, the district court entered judgment in favor of\n\nUniversal.    The court's brief opinion explaining the judgment made\n\nno mention of the endorsement or the fact that the contract covered\n\nonly a fraction of the project's cost.\n\n             On appeal, CRIM makes intertwined arguments, which may be\n\naddressed together, that the district court improperly resolved on\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fsummary judgment a material factual issue -- the intent of the\n\nparties to the surety contract with respect to the total liability\n\nissue. In developing its position, CRIM relies on the endorsement,\n\nwhich, it says, constitutes trialworthy evidence that the parties\n\nintended Universal's total liability to be $1,003,500.00.               (CRIM\n\nalso again adverts to the fact that the project's cost far exceeded\n\nUniversal's liability, but fails to explain why this is relevant).\n\n          Universal responds by pointing out that Rivera's sworn\n\nstatement,    the   upshot   of   which   is   that    the   total   liability\n\nspecified in the endorsement was a mistake, is uncontradicted. And\n\nwith the endorsement out of the picture, Universal says, we should\n\nproceed on the same assumption as did the Caguas Plumbing court --\n\nthat the surety contract contemplated that Universal would be\n\nliable only for the single penalty listed in each of the two bonds\n\n(which together form a single agreement).             Without disputing that\n\nsurety contracts involving the simultaneous issuance of Performance\n\nand Labor and Material Payment Bonds usually give rise only to the\n\nsingle penalty specified in each bond, CRIM replies that we should\n\nnot treat the Rivera sworn statement as dispositive on the issue of\n\nthe parties' intentions because Universal still controls, and has\n\nnot made available, the relevant documents regarding the parties'\n\nintentions and the premiums paid.\n\n             We start with CRIM's last point -- that Universal is in\n\ncontrol of the documentation that might permit it to dispute\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fRivera's sworn statement.            Perhaps this is so, but CRIM did not\n\nobject to (and does not now complain of) the district court's\n\ndecision to treat Universal's motion to dismiss as one for summary\n\njudgment.    Nor did CRIM seek to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) to\n\nconduct the relevant discovery.               Thus, CRIM lacks a basis to\n\ncomplain about the state of the record, and we are constrained to\n\naccept    what    Rivera     says:       that   the   gratuitously   provided\n\nendorsement merely added Chicorp as an additional obligee under the\n\nsurety contract and worked no change in Universal's underlying\n\nliability.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).\n\n            This leads us swiftly to conclude that the district court\n\ndid not err in concluding that Universal met its summary judgment\n\nburden.     While we think that the court read too much into the\n\nCaguas Plumbing decision -- the issue presented here was not joined\n\nin that case -- CRIM has provided us with no basis for questioning\n\nthe   Caguas      Plumbing     court's     premise    that   a   surety   who\n\nsimultaneously issues Performance and Labor and Material Payment\n\nBonds as part of a single surety contract is only liable for the\n\nsingle penalty amount specified in each bond. See Caguas Plumbing,\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. at 4.        In any event, the premise strikes us as\n\nquite sensible.      On a $1,000,000 project, it is easy to see how a\n\ncontractor (and thus a surety, see 10 Appleman, Insurance Law &\n\nPractice, § 5856 (1981) (making clear that the obligations of a\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsurety on a public contractor's bond is commensurate with that of\n\nthe contractor)) could be liable for up to $1,000,000 to various\n\nsubcontractors, or up to $1,000,000 to the obligee.         But it is more\n\ndifficult to see how, absent unforeseen circumstances such as cost\n\noverruns (which are circumstances against which a surety agreement\n\ndoes not insure), the contractor could end up being liable in the\n\namount of $1,000,000 to both.         After all, the value of any work\n\ndone by the subcontractors towards completion of the project (and\n\nwithin the project's specifications) would reduce the contractor's\n\nultimate liability to the project's owner by that same amount.\n\nThus, $500,000    worth   of   work    by   the   subcontractors   would   be\n\n$500,000 worth of work not owed to the project's owner.\n\n          In closing, we acknowledge that, unlike the situation in\n\nCaguas Plumbing, the penalty specified in the Performance and Labor\n\nand Material Payment Bonds constituted only a fraction of the\n\nproject's cost.   But CRIM has failed to explain, and we do not see,\n\nwhy that fact should matter.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f",

Catrett,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322-23 (1986).\n\n            This leads us swiftly to conclude that the district court\n\ndid not err in concluding that Universal met its summary judgment\n\nburden.     While we think that the court read too much into the\n\nCaguas Plumbing decision -- the issue presented here was not joined\n\nin that case -- CRIM has provided us with no basis for questioning\n\nthe   Caguas      Plumbing     court's     premise    that   a   surety   who\n\nsimultaneously issues Performance and Labor and Material Payment\n\nBonds as part of a single surety contract is only liable for the\n\nsingle penalty amount specified in each bond. See Caguas Plumbing,\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. at 4.        In any event, the premise strikes us as\n\nquite sensible.      On a $1,000,000 project, it is easy to see how a\n\ncontractor (and thus a surety, see 10 Appleman, Insurance Law &\n\nPractice, § 5856 (1981) (making clear that the obligations of a\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsurety on a public contractor's bond is commensurate with that of\n\nthe contractor)) could be liable for up to $1,000,000 to various\n\nsubcontractors, or up to $1,000,000 to the obligee.         But it is more\n\ndifficult to see how, absent unforeseen circumstances such as cost\n\noverruns (which are circumstances against which a surety agreement\n\ndoes not insure), the contractor could end up being liable in the\n\namount of $1,000,000 to both.         After all, the value of any work\n\ndone by the subcontractors towards completion of the project (and\n\nwithin the project's specifications) would reduce the contractor's\n\nultimate liability to the project's owner by that same amount.\n\nThus, $500,000    worth   of   work    by   the   subcontractors   would   be\n\n$500,000 worth of work not owed to the project's owner.\n\n          In closing, we acknowledge that, unlike the situation in\n\nCaguas Plumbing, the penalty specified in the Performance and Labor\n\nand Material Payment Bonds constituted only a fraction of the\n\nproject's cost.   But CRIM has failed to explain, and we do not see,\n\nwhy that fact should matter.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f</pre>",
