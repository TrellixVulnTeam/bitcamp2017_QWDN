Bhatia-Gautier, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom H.S.

On behalf of herself, her husband,\n\nand their conjugal partnership, Dr. Nereida Feliciano-Hill, a\n\npsychiatrist    formerly     employed    by    the   Department    of   Veterans\n\nAffairs (the department), brought suit in the district court,\n\nalleging    that   the    department     had    failed   to    accommodate   her\n\ndisability, as required by the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 701, 794 (1999).        The case went to trial, and a jury found for\n\nthe department.          Dr. Feliciano-Hill now appeals the district\n\ncourt's denial of her motion for a new trial.             We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             We review the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.     Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera, 431 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     Dr. Feliciano-Hill worked at the department's San Juan\n\nMedical Center from 1990 until 2000.             Her tenure at the hospital\n\nwas uneventful until 1999, when the University of Puerto Rico\n\nMedical School stopped sending psychiatry residents to work at the\n\nMedical Center.       In November 1999, the department reached an\n\nagreement with Dr. Feliciano-Hill's union, pursuant to which senior\n\nphysicians    would   be    required     to    perform   the   tasks    formerly\n\ndelegated to residents.       Under the agreement, a staff psychiatrist\n\nwould be available for patient care at all times.                 Consequently,\n\nDr. Feliciano-Hill would be required to work one night or weekend\n\nshift a month, and occasionally (about once a month) to see\n\npatients at their bedsides.             Previously, she had worked only\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fTuesday through Friday and had seen patients only in her office.\n\nDr. Feliciano-Hill expressed unhappiness -- to her union steward\n\nand to officials in Washington D.C. -- about the new arrangement.\n\n             After her complaints failed to produce results, Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill        wrote      a       letter    to    the    Medical     Center's    human\n\nresources staff, explaining that she suffered from arthritis and\n\nhad difficulty walking, and requesting a \"reasonable accommodation\n\n.   .   .   under    the    ADA      .    .   .    for   a     qualified    person     with   a\n\ndisability.\"1        The department sought medical certification of Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill's condition.                   Dr. Feliciano-Hill's rheumatologist,\n\nDr.     Rafael      Gonzalez-Alcover,              produced       first     a   \"diagnostic\n\nimpression,\" and later a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, among\n\nother conditions. When the department asked him to clarify how Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill's medical condition affected her, Dr. Gonzalez-\n\nAlcover opined that she was \"unable to cover the different areas as\n\nrequired     in     her    new    responsibilities.\"               Dr.     Gonzalez-Alcover\n\ndeclined the department's request for more specific information\n\nabout Dr. Feliciano-Hill's limitations.\n\n             On the basis of Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's diagnosis, the\n\ndepartment        offered    to      provide       Dr.   Feliciano-Hill         a   motorized\n\n\n\n1\n  Although Feliciano-Hill initially cited the Americans with\nDisabilities Act as grounds for relief, the ADA does not provide\nfor suits against the federal government.           However, the\nRehabilitation Act, which predated the ADA, does and generally is\nanalogous in its prohibition of employment discrimination.    See\nCalero-Cerezo v. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (2004).\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fwheelchair to use when, on occasion, she had to travel around the\n\nhospital. She refused to be so accommodated, averring that she was\n\n\"not crippled or otherwise in need of a wheelchair\" and did not\n\nwant to appear disabled to her patients and colleagues.                         She\n\nrequested, instead, that she be allowed to see all of her patients\n\nin her office, during her customary working hours.\n\n            Dr. Feliciano-Hill refused to come to work during her\n\nnegotiations      with    the   hospital    because,     she    said,    she   felt\n\nharassed.     She asked at least twice for leave.                The department\n\ngranted her two weeks of sick leave but denied her request for a\n\nlonger term of unpaid leave. The department offered Dr. Feliciano-\n\nHill an opportunity to return to work.             Instead, she resigned her\n\nposition at the hospital.\n\n            Dr.   Feliciano-Hill,     her    husband,     and    their   conjugal\n\npartnership    then      brought   suit    under   the   Rehabilitation        Act,\n\nalleging that the department had failed reasonably to accommodate\n\nher disability, and that her supervisors had treated her \"in an\n\naggressive and hostile manner\" in retaliation for her request for\n\naccommodation. The plaintiffs complained of lost income, emotional\n\ndistress, and loss of consortium.\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment on the claims\n\nbrought by Mr. Hill and the conjugal partnership, after concluding\n\nthat their claims were not cognizable under the Rehabilitation\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fAct.2     The district court rejected the department's motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to Dr. Feliciano-Hill. The case went to trial,\n\nfocused on whether the department had denied Dr. Feliciano-Hill a\n\nreasonable accommodation for a disability.                 Dr. Feliciano-Hill\n\nattempted to prove that she was disabled by rheumatoid arthritis\n\nand     that   the    department's      offer   to   provide   her   a   motorized\n\nwheelchair did not constitute a reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability.         The department sought to convince the jury that Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill actually was not disabled, and that if she was, the\n\ndepartment's offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair was a\n\nreasonable accommodation.         Dr. Feliciano-Hill also contended that\n\nthe department took adverse employment action against her in\n\nretaliation for her disability discrimination complaint.                      The\n\ndepartment denied that allegation as well.\n\n               On    the   reasonable    accommodation     issue,    both   sides\n\npresented rheumatologists, who gave conflicting opinions as to\n\nwhether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled. Dr. Feliciano-Hill relied\n\non testimony from Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, from whom she had sought\n\ntreatment.3 Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover testified that Dr. Feliciano-Hill\n\n\n2\n The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations\nas to resolution of the summary judgment motion. The magistrate\njudge had concluded that the Rehabilitation Act does not provide\nrelief to employees' spouses or conjugal partnerships on employment\ndiscrimination claims. Dr. Feliciano Hill has not appealed from\nthat ruling.\n3\n Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover testified on the first day of the trial, the\nonly day for which we do not have a transcript. Apparently, the\n\n                                         -5-\n\fmay have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, but that he could not\n\nso conclude for certain.      Although he recalled that Dr. Feliciano-\n\nHill had complained of pain in her joints, he admitted that his\n\nrecords did not contain any reference to a complaint by Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill that she was having difficulty walking.               However,\n\nDr. Gonzalez-Alcover reaffirmed his judgment, first expressed in\n\nletters to the department around the time of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's\n\nrequest for an accommodation, that she was capable only of \"limited\n\nambulation.\"    He agreed that a motorized wheelchair would have\n\naided Dr. Feliciano-Hill.\n\n           Dr. Ramadés Sierra-Zorita, testifying for the department,\n\nopined that \"there was nothing to suggest that [Dr. Feliciano-Hill]\n\nhad rheumatoid arthritis\" at the time she made her complaints. Dr.\n\nSierra-Zorita    testified    that   he    had   performed   four    physical\n\nexaminations    of   Dr.   Feliciano-Hill    and   inspected   her    medical\n\nrecords.   In his view, she did not have \"much of a difficulty in\n\n\ntranscript of his testimony was not produced, and Dr. Feliciano-\nHill has not submitted to us any statement summarizing Dr.\nGonzalez-Alcover's testimony.    See Fed. R. App. P. 10(c).     We\nrecount Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's testimony as it has been summarized\nin the briefs and other record materials. Although the available\nrecord allows us to decide this case with confidence, we note that\nDr. Feliciano-Hill was obligated to produce the transcript or a\nstatement of the evidence and that she must \"'bear the brunt of an\ninsufficient record on appeal.'\" Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5,\n15 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60 (1st\nCir. 1987)); see also Fed. R. App. P. 10(b)(2) (\"If the appellant\nintends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is\nunsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the\nappellant must include a transcript of all evidence relevant to\nthat finding or conclusion.\").\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwalking.\"      Indeed, he said, he had found no evidence that Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill was disabled at all in \"her history and from what\n\nwas seen on the available record.\"                Dr. Sierra-Zorita testified\n\nthat he had no opinion regarding the suitability of a motorized\n\nwheelchair as an accommodation for a disabled psychiatrist.\n\n            Dr. Feliciano-Hill twice asked the district court to\n\nlimit the impact of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony.             Though she had\n\nnot challenged Dr. Sierra-Zorita's qualifications before trial (as\n\nthe district court required), Dr. Feliciano-Hill objected to the\n\nadmission of his testimony at trial on the ground that his report\n\nand testimony did not meet the standards for expert evidence\n\nimposed by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S.\n\n579 (1993), and Fed. R. Evid. 702.          The district court admitted the\n\ntestimony over the objection.         Dr. Feliciano-Hill also asked the\n\ndistrict court to augment its charge to the jury (taken from Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill's written proposed instructions) with an additional\n\nlater-proposed       instruction    that    Dr.    Sierra-Zorita's   testimony\n\nshould   not    be     considered    on     the     question   of    reasonable\n\naccommodation.       The district court declined this request as well.\n\n            On the retaliation issue, Dr. Feliciano-Hill sought to\n\nprove that her supervisors had reacted to her complaints about the\n\nnew union agreement by subjecting her to harassment, by requiring\n\nher to comply with unnecessary bureaucratic requests, and by\n\ndenying her leave.       She pointed particularly to two interactions\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fwith her supervisor, Dr. Luis Iguina.        One concerned a veteran who\n\nwas Dr. Feliciano-Hill's patient.          Dr. Iguina complained to Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill    that,   despite    the   patient's    urgent   need    for\n\npsychiatric services, Dr. Feliciano-Hill had cancelled three of her\n\nappointments, resulting in a delay that Dr. Iguina feared could\n\nverge on \"patient abuse.\"       Dr. Feliciano-Hill averred that the\n\npatient was difficult and that she would need support from other\n\nprofessionals to care for the patient.          Dr. Iguina arranged for\n\nsuch support.     Dr. Felicano-Hill contended at trial that Dr.\n\nIguina's reference to \"patient abuse\" helped create a hostile\n\nworking   environment.     On   another     occasion,   Dr.   Iguina    said\n\nsomething to the effect that \"women are always complaining about\n\ntheir illnesses,\" a remark that Dr. Feliciano-Hill contended was\n\nharassment.\n\n           Dr.   Feliciano-Hill     also   argued   that   the   department\n\ncreated a hostile work environment and prompted her resignation by\n\nasking repeatedly for more specific medical documentation about her\n\ndisability, and that the department retaliated against her by\n\nrefusing to grant all of her requests for leave.\n\n           After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill moved for a new trial.         She argued that the court\n\nshould not have allowed the department's medical expert to testify,\n\nand should have given the limiting instruction she had requested.\n\nAdditionally, she contended that the jury's verdict was against the\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fweight of the evidence. The district court rejected both arguments\n\nin a written order, Feliciano-Hill, et al. v. Principi, et al., Cv.\n\nNo. 00-2439(SEC) (D.P.R. 2004), and this appeal followed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           Dr. Feliciano-Hill enumerates ten issues for review.\n\nThese fall into three categories -- one is her contention that Dr.\n\nSierra-Zorita should not have been allowed to testify, two are\n\narguments that the judge should have given a limiting instruction\n\nas to that doctor's testimony, and seven are objections to the\n\njury's view of the evidence.    We address first the issues relating\n\nto Dr. Sierra-Zorita and second the arguments about the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.\n\nA.   Defense Expert Testimony\n\n           1. Admission of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's Testimony and Report\n\n           Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that, pursuant to Daubert and\n\nRule 702, the district court should have refused to admit Dr.\n\nSierra-Zorita's testimony as evidence.    The district court denied\n\nDr. Feliciano-Hill's motion both because it was untimely -- Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill waited until the moments before Dr. Sierra-Zorita's\n\ntestimony to object, even though she had received the doctor's\n\nreport five months earlier -- and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's\n\nreport and proposed testimony met the applicable standard.      The\n\ndistrict court was correct on both grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           Parties have an obligation to object to an expert's\n\ntestimony in a timely fashion, so that the expert's proposed\n\ntestimony can be evaluated with care.         Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not\n\nmake a timely motion here and has not offered any reason for her\n\ndelay.    The district court was on firm ground in refusing her\n\nmotion as untimely.     See Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc., 262 F.3d\n\n1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"because Daubert\n\ngenerally contemplates a 'gatekeeping' function, not a 'gotcha'\n\njunction,\" untimely Daubert motions should be considered \"only in\n\nrare circumstances\"); see also Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec)\n\nImport, Inc. 362 F.3d 775, 780 (11th Cir. 2004) (\"A Daubert\n\nobjection not raised before trial may be rejected as untimely.\").\n\n           In any case, Dr. Feliciano-Hill's Daubert motion lacked\n\nmerit.     Dr.   Feliciano-Hill    argues     that   Dr.   Sierra-Zorita's\n\ntestimony should have been excluded because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's\n\nopinion   differed   from   that   of   Dr.   Feliciano-Hill's   treating\n\nphysician, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, a \"very well respected and beloved\n\nrheumatologist,\" and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's report did not\n\n\"cite[] medical authorities and w[as] based on 'experience' and\n\ngeneral knowledge.\" The mere fact that two experts disagree is not\n\ngrounds for excluding one's testimony.        Even if we were to assume\n\nthat Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover was somehow more qualified than Dr.\n\nSierra-Zorita -- and there is no reason in the record for us to do\n\nso -- the district court could not have excluded Dr. Sierra-\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fZorita's testimony on that ground alone.               See Holbrook v. Lykes\n\nBros. S.S. Co., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"[W]itnesses may\n\nbe competent to testify as experts even though they may not, in the\n\ncourt's eyes, be the 'best' qualified.             Who is 'best' qualified is\n\na matter of weight upon which reasonable jurors may disagree.\").\n\n              We also reject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's assertion that Dr.\n\nSierra-Zorita's testimony did not meet the standard of Daubert and\n\nRule 702 because the doctor failed to support his diagnosis with\n\ncitations to published authorities.            As the district court noted,\n\nthe underlying medical question -- whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill's\n\nmedical condition prevented her from walking around the hospital --\n\nwas    \"not   a    complex   medical    situation.\"        Dr.   Sierra-Zorita's\n\ntestimony and report did not involve novel medical theories.                The\n\ndoctor was called upon only to offer a routine diagnosis, on a\n\npatient he had examined, pertaining to a common condition well\n\nwithin his particular expertise.               In this case, the doctor's\n\ntraining and experience placed his report and testimony well above\n\nthe Rule 702/Daubert bar.        Indeed, even in more complicated cases\n\nwhen an examining physician calls upon training and experience to\n\noffer a differential diagnosis (a determination of which of two or\n\nmore diseases, presenting with similar symptoms, has caused a\n\npatient's ailments), most courts have found no Daubert problem.\n\nSee, e.g.,        Bitler v. A.O. Smith Corp., 391 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th\n\nCir.   2004)      (collecting   cases    holding    that    qualified   doctor's\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fdifferential diagnosis of patient was sufficiently reliable for\n\nRule 702 and Daubert purposes); Mattis v. Carlon Elec. Products,\n\n295 F.3d 856, 861 (8th Cir. 2002) (\"A medical opinion based upon a\n\nproper differential diagnosis is sufficiently reliable to satisfy\n\nDaubert.\").\n\n          2.   Limiting Instruction\n\n          Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that the district court should\n\nhave instructed the jury that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should\n\nonly be considered on the question of whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill\n\nwas disabled, not on the issue of reasonable accommodation.         The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion both because it was untimely --\n\nFeliciano-Hill had not requested the instruction in her written\n\nproposed jury instructions, which the court had adopted -- and\n\nbecause it was unnecessary.       Again, the district court ruled\n\ncorrectly.\n\n          The instruction Dr. Feliciano-Hill requested was plainly\n\nunnecessary.    The   district   court   noted,   and   the   transcript\n\nconfirms, that \"[t]he witness was . . . crystal clear\" that he had\n\nno opinion regarding the reasonableness of a motorized wheelchair\n\nas an accommodation for a person with rheumatoid arthritis. As the\n\ndistrict court concluded, \"The jury ha[d] that message.\"            The\n\ndistrict court did not err in refusing to offer an unnecessary\n\ninstruction about the scope of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony. See,\n\ne.g., Elliot v. S.D. Warren Co., 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f(finding no error in district court's refusal to give requested\n\ninstruction that was unnecessary to explain the applicable law to\n\nthe jury).\n\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            We will reverse the district court's refusal to order a\n\nnew trial on the ground of insufficient evidence only where \"the\n\njury's verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as\n\nto constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"                    Wagenmann v.\n\nAdams, 829 F.2d 196, 201 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    This is not such a case.\n\n            1.    Reasonable Accommodation\n\n            To    succeed      on     her   Rehabilitation     Act     reasonable\n\naccommodation claim Dr. Feliciano-Hill had to convince the jury:\n\n            (1) that she suffered from a 'disability'\n            within the meaning of the statute; (2) that\n            she was a qualified individual in that she was\n            able to perform the essential functions of her\n            job, either with or without a reasonable\n            accommodation; and (3) that, despite her\n            employer's knowledge of her disability, the\n            employer   did   not    offer   a   reasonable\n            accommodation for the disability.\n\nCalero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.              The jury could have rejected Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill's case either because Dr. Feliciano-Hill was not\n\ndisabled    or   because      the   department     had   offered   a   reasonable\n\naccommodation      in   the    form    of   a   motorized   wheelchair.      (The\n\ndepartment       agreed    that       Dr.    Feliciano-Hill    possessed      the\n\nqualifications for her job.)                Because we have focused on the\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fdueling   expert     testimony   on     whether    Dr.    Feliciano-Hill     was\n\ndisabled, we will review the sufficiency of the evidence on that\n\nissue.\n\n           Dr. Sierra-Zorita, a qualified expert, gave compelling\n\ntestimony that Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not actually have rheumatoid\n\narthritis.      He   also   testified    that     the   plaintiff   had    little\n\ndifficulty walking.         Moreover, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's contrary\n\ntestimony was not emphatic.      He revealed that Dr. Feliciano-Hill's\n\nlab tests were negative for rheumatoid arthritis and that Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill had no swelling in her joints. Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover\n\nadmitted that he had examined Dr. Feliciano-Hill only four times\n\nover the six-year period leading up to her complaint. He indicated\n\nthat he had no knowledge of how far Dr. Feliciano-Hill would have\n\nbeen required to walk at her job and that he was not familiar with\n\nthe layout of the Medical Center.         On this evidence the jury could\n\nreject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's claim that she was disabled.\n\n           2.   Retaliation\n\n           This leaves only Dr. Feliciano-Hill's argument that the\n\ndepartment retaliated against her for her disability discrimination\n\ncomplaint, a claim she is entitled to press even though the jury\n\nreasonably rejected her case on outright discrimination.                     See\n\nSoileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(recognizing    that    retaliation      claim    may    succeed    even   where\n\ndisability discrimination claim fails).             To make out a case for\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fretaliation,      \"a    plaintiff      must     show    that    (i)    she    undertook\n\nprotected conduct, (ii) she suffered an adverse employment action,\n\nand (iii) the two were causally linked.\"                       Noviello v. City of\n\nBoston, 398 F.3d 76, 88 (1st Cir. 2005); see also                              Weber v.\n\nCranston Sch. Comm., 212 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\n\nRehabilitation         Act   prohibits     retaliation).              At    trial,     Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill argued that she suffered an \"adverse employment\n\naction\" through the creation of a hostile work environment and a\n\nconstructive termination. To prove that a hostile work environment\n\nconstituted \"adverse employment action,\" the plaintiff must show\n\nthat the harassment she complains of was \"so severe or pervasive\n\nthat it alters the conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\"\n\nMarrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 26 (1st Cir\n\n2002).      Similarly,       to    establish     a   constructive          discharge,    a\n\nplaintiff must show \"that her working conditions were so difficult\n\nor unpleasant that a reasonable person in her shoes would have felt\n\ncompelled    to   resign,\"        an   objective       standard   that       \"cannot    be\n\ntriggered solely by the employee's subjective beliefs, no matter\n\nhow sincerely held.\"              Id. at 28 (internal quotation marks and\n\nbrackets omitted).           The question whether a work environment is\n\nsufficiently hostile to create liability is best left to a jury.\n\nChe v. Mass. Bay Trans. Auth., 342 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Here, the evidence allowed the jury to find that Dr.\n\nFeliciano-Hill's treatment by the department was not \"objectively\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fintolerable.\"     Marrero, 304 F.3d at 28.         On the record, the jury\n\ncould have found that Dr. Iguina's concerns about the treatment of\n\nthe female veteran were properly expressed and unobjectionable.\n\nAnd the jury could have found, after listening to testimony on the\n\npoint, that Dr. Iguina's remark \"about women complaining a lot\" and\n\nany other isolated comments from her peers did not constitute\n\nsevere or pervasive harassment, or a course of conduct that would\n\nhave led a reasonable person to resign.\n\n             As for the department's insistence that Dr. Feliciano-\n\nHill provide medical documentation supporting her insistence that\n\nshe could not walk around the hospital, the jury could have found,\n\nin reliance on the evidence, that the hospital reasonably needed\n\nmore specific guidance from Dr. Alcover-Gonzalez and that its\n\nprocedures were not harassing or unreasonable.           Finally, the jury\n\ncould have found that the department's denial of Dr. Feliciano-\n\nHill's request for additional leave did not, in the circumstances,\n\ncreate   a   hostile     work   environment   or   constitute   an   \"adverse\n\nemployment action.\"\n\n             In short, on examination of the record we cannot conclude\n\nthat the verdict represented a \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nWagenmann, 829 F.2d at 201.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

The case went to trial, and a jury found for the department. Dr. Feliciano-Hill now appeals the district court's denial of her motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2005). Dr. Feliciano-Hill worked at the department's San Juan Medical Center from 1990 until 2000. Her tenure at the hospital was uneventful until 1999, when the University of Puerto Rico Medical School stopped sending psychiatry residents to work at the Medical Center. In November 1999, the department reached an agreement with Dr. Feliciano-Hill's union, pursuant to which senior physicians would be required to perform the tasks formerly delegated to residents. Under the agreement, a staff psychiatrist would be available for patient care at all times. Consequently, Dr. Feliciano-Hill would be required to work one night or weekend shift a month, and occasionally (about once a month) to see patients at their bedsides. Previously, she had worked only Tuesday through Friday and had seen patients only in her office. Dr. Feliciano-Hill expressed unhappiness &#8212; to her union steward and to officials in Washington D.C. &#8212; about the new arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her complaints failed to produce results, Dr. Feliciano-Hill wrote a letter to the Medical Center's human resources staff, explaining that she suffered from arthritis and had difficulty walking, and requesting a \"reasonable accommodation. . . under the ADA . . . for a qualified person with a disability.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The department sought medical certification of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's condition. Dr. Feliciano-Hill's rheumatologist, Dr. Rafael Gonzalez-Alcover, produced first a \"diagnostic impression,\" and later a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions. When the department asked him to clarify how Dr. Feliciano-Hill's medical condition affected her, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover opined that she was \"unable to cover the different areas as required in her new responsibilities.\" Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover declined the department's request for more specific information about Dr. Feliciano-Hill's limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's diagnosis, the department offered to provide Dr. Feliciano-Hill a motorized wheelchair to use when, on occasion, she had to travel around the hospital. She refused to be so accommodated, averring that she was \"not crippled or otherwise in need of a wheelchair\" and did not want to appear disabled to her patients and colleagues. She requested, instead, that she be allowed to see all of her patients in her office, during her customary working hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill refused to come to work during her negotiations with the hospital because, she said, she felt harassed. She asked at least twice for leave. The department granted her two weeks of sick leave but denied her request for a longer term of unpaid leave. The department offered Dr. Feliciano-Hill an opportunity to return to work. Instead, she resigned her position at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill, her husband, and their conjugal partnership then brought suit under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that the department had failed reasonably to accommodate her disability, and that her supervisors had treated her \"in an aggressive and hostile manner\" in retaliation for her request for accommodation. The plaintiffs complained of lost income, emotional distress, and loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on the claims brought by Mr. Hill and the conjugal partnership, after concluding that their claims were not cognizable under the Rehabilitation Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court rejected the department's motion for summary judgment as to Dr. Feliciano-Hill. The case went to trial, focused on whether the department had denied Dr. Feliciano-Hill a reasonable accommodation for a disability. Dr. Feliciano-Hill attempted to prove that she was disabled by rheumatoid arthritis and that the department's offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair did not constitute a reasonable accommodation for her disability. The department sought to convince the jury that Dr. Feliciano-Hill actually was not disabled, and that if she was, the department's offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair was a reasonable accommodation. Dr. Feliciano-Hill also contended that the department took adverse employment action against her in retaliation for her disability discrimination complaint. The department denied that allegation as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the reasonable accommodation issue, both sides presented rheumatologists, who gave conflicting opinions as to whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled. Dr. Feliciano-Hill relied on testimony from Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, from whom she had sought treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover testified that Dr. Feliciano-Hill may have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, but that he could not so conclude for certain. Although he recalled that Dr. Feliciano-Hill had complained of pain in her joints, he admitted that his records did not contain any reference to a complaint by Dr. Feliciano-Hill that she was having difficulty walking. However, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover reaffirmed his judgment, first expressed in letters to the department around the time of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's request for an accommodation, that she was capable only of \"limited ambulation.\" He agreed that a motorized wheelchair would have aided Dr. Feliciano-Hill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Ramad&#233;s Sierra-Zorita, testifying for the department, opined that \"there was nothing to suggest that [Dr. Feliciano-Hill] had rheumatoid arthritis\" at the time she made her complaints. Dr. Sierra-Zorita testified that he had performed four physical examinations of Dr. Feliciano-Hill and inspected her medical records. In his view, she did not have \"much of a difficulty in walking.\" Indeed, he said, he had found no evidence that Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled at all in \"her history and from what was seen on the available record.\" Dr. Sierra-Zorita testified that he had no opinion regarding the suitability of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a disabled psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill twice asked the district court to limit the impact of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony. Though she had not challenged Dr. Sierra-Zorita's qualifications before trial (as the district court required), Dr. Feliciano-Hill objected to the admission of his testimony at trial on the ground that his report and testimony did not meet the standards for expert evidence imposed by <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and Fed.R.Evid. 702. The district court admitted the testimony over the objection. Dr. Feliciano-Hill also asked the district court to augment its charge to the jury (taken from Dr. Feliciano-Hill's written proposed instructions) with an additional later-proposed instruction that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should not be considered on the question of reasonable accommodation. The district court declined this request as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the retaliation issue, Dr. Feliciano-Hill sought to prove that her supervisors had reacted to her complaints about the new union agreement by subjecting her to harassment, by requiring her to comply with unnecessary bureaucratic requests, and by denying her leave. She pointed particularly to two interactions with her supervisor, Dr. Luis Iguina. One concerned a veteran who was Dr. Feliciano-Hill's patient. Dr. Iguina complained to Dr. Feliciano-Hill that, despite the patient's urgent need for psychiatric services, Dr. Feliciano-Hill had cancelled three of her appointments, resulting in a delay that Dr. Iguina feared could verge on \"patient abuse.\" Dr. Feliciano-Hill averred that the patient was difficult and that she would need support from other professionals to care for the patient. Dr. Iguina arranged for such support. Dr. Felicano-Hill contended at trial that Dr. Iguina's reference to \"patient abuse\" helped create a hostile working environment. On another occasion, Dr. Iguina said something to the effect that \"women are always complaining about their illnesses,\" a remark that Dr. Feliciano-Hill contended was harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill also argued that the department created a hostile work environment and prompted her resignation by asking repeatedly for more specific medical documentation about her disability, and that the department retaliated against her by refusing to grant all of her requests for leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, Dr. Feliciano-Hill moved for a new trial. She argued that the court should not have allowed the department's medical expert to testify, and should have given the limiting instruction she had requested. Additionally, she contended that the jury's verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The district court rejected both arguments in a written order, <i>Feliciano-Hill, et al. v. Principi, et al.,</i> Cv. No. 00-2439(SEC) (D.P.R.2004), and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill enumerates ten issues for review. These fall into three categories &#8212; one is her contention that Dr. Sierra-Zorita should not have been allowed to testify, two are arguments that the judge should have given a limiting instruction as to that doctor's testimony, and seven are objections to the jury's view of the evidence. We address first the issues relating to Dr. Sierra-Zorita and second the arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Defense Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Admission of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's Testimony and Report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that, pursuant to <i>Daubert</i> and Rule 702, the district court should have refused to admit Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony as evidence. The district court denied Dr. Feliciano-Hill's motion both because it was untimely &#8212; Dr. Feliciano-Hill waited until the moments before Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony to object, even though she had received the doctor's report five months earlier &#8212; and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's report and proposed testimony met the applicable standard. The district court was correct on both grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties have an obligation to object to an expert's testimony in a timely fashion, so that the expert's proposed testimony can be evaluated with care. Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not make a timely motion here and has not offered any reason for her delay. The district court was on firm ground in refusing her motion as untimely. <i>See Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> 262 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir.2003) (explaining that \"because <i>Daubert</i> generally contemplates a `gatekeeping' function, not a `gotcha' junction,\" untimely <i>Daubert</i> motions should be considered \"only in rare circumstances\"); <i>see also Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec) Import, Inc.</i> 362 F.3d 775, 780 (11th Cir.2004) (\"A <i>Daubert</i> objection not raised before trial may be rejected as untimely.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, Dr. Feliciano-Hill's <i>Daubert</i> motion lacked merit. Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should have been excluded because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's opinion differed from that of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's treating physician, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, a \"very well respected and beloved rheumatologist,\" and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's report did not \"cite[] medical authorities and w[as] based on `experience' and general knowledge.\" The mere fact that two experts disagree is not grounds for excluding one's testimony. Even if we were to assume that Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover was somehow more qualified than Dr. Sierra-Zorita &#8212; and there is no reason in the record for us to do so &#8212; the district court could not have excluded Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony on that ground alone. <i>See Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (\"[W]itnesses may be competent to testify as experts even though they may not, in the court's eyes, be the `best' qualified. Who is `best' qualified is a matter of weight upon which reasonable jurors may disagree.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's assertion that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony did not meet the standard of <i>Daubert</i> and Rule 702 because the doctor failed to support his diagnosis with citations to published authorities. As the district court noted, the underlying medical question &#8212; whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill's medical condition prevented her from walking around the hospital &#8212; was \"not a complex medical situation.\" Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony and report did not involve novel medical theories. The doctor was called upon only to offer a routine diagnosis, on a patient he had examined, pertaining to a common condition well within his particular expertise. In this case, the doctor's training and experience placed his report and testimony well above the Rule <i>702/Daubert</i> bar. Indeed, even in more complicated cases when an examining physician calls upon training and experience to offer a differential diagnosis (a determination of which of two or more diseases, presenting with similar symptoms, has caused a patient's ailments), most courts have found no <i>Daubert</i> problem. <i>See, e.g., Bitler v. A.O. Smith Corp.,</i> 391 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th Cir.2004) (collecting cases holding that qualified doctor's differential diagnosis of patient was sufficiently reliable for Rule 702 and <i>Daubert</i> purposes); <i>Mattis v. Carlon Elec. Products,</i> 295 F.3d 856, 861 (8th Cir.2002) (\"A medical opinion based upon a proper differential diagnosis is sufficiently reliable to satisfy <i>Daubert.</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Limiting Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should only be considered on the question of whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled, not on the issue of reasonable accommodation. The district court denied the motion both because it was untimely &#8212; Feliciano-Hill had not requested the instruction in her written proposed jury instructions, which the court had adopted &#8212; and because it was unnecessary. Again, the district court ruled correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction Dr. Feliciano-Hill requested was plainly unnecessary. The district court noted, and the transcript confirms, that \"[t]he witness was . . . crystal clear\" that he had no opinion regarding the reasonableness of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a person with rheumatoid arthritis. As the district court concluded, \"The jury ha[d] that message.\" The district court did not err in refusing to offer an unnecessary instruction about the scope of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony. <i>See, e.g., Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1998) (finding no error in district court's refusal to give requested instruction that was unnecessary to explain the applicable law to the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will reverse the district court's refusal to order a new trial on the ground of insufficient evidence only where \"the jury's verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 201 (1st Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on her Rehabilitation Act reasonable accommodation claim Dr. Feliciano-Hill had to convince the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that she suffered from a `disability' within the meaning of the statute; (2) that she was a qualified individual in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that, despite her employer's knowledge of her disability, the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation for the disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 20. The jury could have rejected Dr. Feliciano-Hill's case either because Dr. Feliciano-Hill was not disabled or because the department had offered a reasonable accommodation in the form of a motorized wheelchair. (The department agreed that Dr. Feliciano-Hill possessed the qualifications for her job.) Because we have focused on the dueling expert testimony on whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled, we will review the sufficiency of the evidence on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Sierra-Zorita, a qualified expert, gave compelling testimony that Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not actually have rheumatoid arthritis. He also testified that the plaintiff had little difficulty walking. Moreover, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's contrary testimony was not emphatic. He revealed that Dr. Feliciano-Hill's lab tests were negative for rheumatoid arthritis and that Dr. Feliciano-Hill had no swelling in her joints. Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover admitted that he had examined Dr. Feliciano-Hill only four times over the six-year period leading up to her complaint. He indicated that he had no knowledge of how far Dr. Feliciano-Hill would have been required to walk at her job and that he was not familiar with the layout of the Medical Center. On this evidence the jury could reject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's claim that she was disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only Dr. Feliciano-Hill's argument that the department retaliated against her for her disability discrimination complaint, a claim she is entitled to press even though the jury reasonably rejected her case on outright discrimination. <i>See Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1997) (recognizing that retaliation claim may succeed even where disability discrimination claim fails). To make out a case for retaliation, \"a plaintiff must show that (i) she undertook protected conduct, (ii) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (iii) the two were causally linked.\" <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> 398 F.3d 76, 88 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also Weber v. Cranston Sch. Comm.,</i> 212 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that Rehabilitation Act prohibits retaliation). At trial, Dr. Feliciano-Hill argued that she suffered an \"adverse employment action\" through the creation of a hostile work environment and a constructive termination. To prove that a hostile work environment constituted \"adverse employment action,\" the plaintiff must show that the harassment she complains of was \"so severe or pervasive that it alters the conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 26 (1st Cir.2002). Similarly, to establish a constructive discharge, a plaintiff must show \"that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her shoes would have felt compelled to resign,\" an objective standard that \"cannot be triggered solely by the employee's subjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\" <i>Id.</i> at 28 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The question whether a work environment is sufficiently hostile to create liability is best left to a jury. <i>Che v. Mass. Bay Trans. Auth.,</i> 342 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence allowed the jury to find that Dr. Feliciano-Hill's treatment by the department was not \"objectively intolerable.\" <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 28. On the record, the jury could have found that Dr. Iguina's concerns about the treatment of the female veteran were properly expressed and unobjectionable. And the jury could have found, after listening to testimony on the point, that Dr. Iguina's remark \"about women complaining a lot\" and any other isolated comments from her peers did not constitute severe or pervasive harassment, or a course of conduct that would have led a reasonable person to resign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the department's insistence that Dr. Feliciano-Hill provide medical documentation supporting her insistence that she could not walk around the hospital, the jury could have found, in reliance on the evidence, that the hospital reasonably needed more specific guidance from Dr. Alcover-Gonzalez and that its procedures were not harassing or unreasonable. Finally, the jury could have found that the department's denial of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's request for additional leave did not, in the circumstances, create a hostile work environment or constitute an \"adverse employment action.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, on examination of the record we cannot conclude that the verdict represented a \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Feliciano-Hill initially cited the Americans with Disabilities Act as grounds for relief, the ADA does not provide for suits against the federal government.

The case went to trial, and a jury found for the department. Dr. Feliciano-Hill now appeals the district court's denial of her motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201947\"><a href=\"/opinion/201947/whitfield-v-melendez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 2005). Dr. Feliciano-Hill worked at the department's San Juan Medical Center from 1990 until 2000. Her tenure at the hospital was uneventful until 1999, when the University of Puerto Rico Medical School stopped sending psychiatry residents to work at the Medical Center. In November 1999, the department reached an agreement with Dr. Feliciano-Hill's union, pursuant to which senior physicians would be required to perform the tasks formerly delegated to residents. Under the agreement, a staff psychiatrist would be available for patient care at all times. Consequently, Dr. Feliciano-Hill would be required to work one night or weekend shift a month, and occasionally (about once a month) to see patients at their bedsides. Previously, she had worked only Tuesday through Friday and had seen patients only in her office. Dr. Feliciano-Hill expressed unhappiness &#8212; to her union steward and to officials in Washington D.C. &#8212; about the new arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her complaints failed to produce results, Dr. Feliciano-Hill wrote a letter to the Medical Center's human resources staff, explaining that she suffered from arthritis and had difficulty walking, and requesting a \"reasonable accommodation. . . under the ADA . . . for a qualified person with a disability.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The department sought medical certification of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's condition. Dr. Feliciano-Hill's rheumatologist, Dr. Rafael Gonzalez-Alcover, produced first a \"diagnostic impression,\" and later a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions. When the department asked him to clarify how Dr. Feliciano-Hill's medical condition affected her, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover opined that she was \"unable to cover the different areas as required in her new responsibilities.\" Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover declined the department's request for more specific information about Dr. Feliciano-Hill's limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's diagnosis, the department offered to provide Dr. Feliciano-Hill a motorized wheelchair to use when, on occasion, she had to travel around the hospital. She refused to be so accommodated, averring that she was \"not crippled or otherwise in need of a wheelchair\" and did not want to appear disabled to her patients and colleagues. She requested, instead, that she be allowed to see all of her patients in her office, during her customary working hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill refused to come to work during her negotiations with the hospital because, she said, she felt harassed. She asked at least twice for leave. The department granted her two weeks of sick leave but denied her request for a longer term of unpaid leave. The department offered Dr. Feliciano-Hill an opportunity to return to work. Instead, she resigned her position at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill, her husband, and their conjugal partnership then brought suit under the Rehabilitation Act, alleging that the department had failed reasonably to accommodate her disability, and that her supervisors had treated her \"in an aggressive and hostile manner\" in retaliation for her request for accommodation. The plaintiffs complained of lost income, emotional distress, and loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on the claims brought by Mr. Hill and the conjugal partnership, after concluding that their claims were not cognizable under the Rehabilitation Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court rejected the department's motion for summary judgment as to Dr. Feliciano-Hill. The case went to trial, focused on whether the department had denied Dr. Feliciano-Hill a reasonable accommodation for a disability. Dr. Feliciano-Hill attempted to prove that she was disabled by rheumatoid arthritis and that the department's offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair did not constitute a reasonable accommodation for her disability. The department sought to convince the jury that Dr. Feliciano-Hill actually was not disabled, and that if she was, the department's offer to provide her a motorized wheelchair was a reasonable accommodation. Dr. Feliciano-Hill also contended that the department took adverse employment action against her in retaliation for her disability discrimination complaint. The department denied that allegation as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the reasonable accommodation issue, both sides presented rheumatologists, who gave conflicting opinions as to whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled. Dr. Feliciano-Hill relied on testimony from Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, from whom she had sought treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover testified that Dr. Feliciano-Hill may have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, but that he could not so conclude for certain. Although he recalled that Dr. Feliciano-Hill had complained of pain in her joints, he admitted that his records did not contain any reference to a complaint by Dr. Feliciano-Hill that she was having difficulty walking. However, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover reaffirmed his judgment, first expressed in letters to the department around the time of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's request for an accommodation, that she was capable only of \"limited ambulation.\" He agreed that a motorized wheelchair would have aided Dr. Feliciano-Hill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Ramad&#233;s Sierra-Zorita, testifying for the department, opined that \"there was nothing to suggest that [Dr. Feliciano-Hill] had rheumatoid arthritis\" at the time she made her complaints. Dr. Sierra-Zorita testified that he had performed four physical examinations of Dr. Feliciano-Hill and inspected her medical records. In his view, she did not have \"much of a difficulty in walking.\" Indeed, he said, he had found no evidence that Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled at all in \"her history and from what was seen on the available record.\" Dr. Sierra-Zorita testified that he had no opinion regarding the suitability of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a disabled psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill twice asked the district court to limit the impact of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony. Though she had not challenged Dr. Sierra-Zorita's qualifications before trial (as the district court required), Dr. Feliciano-Hill objected to the admission of his testimony at trial on the ground that his report and testimony did not meet the standards for expert evidence imposed by <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1993), and Fed.R.Evid. 702. The district court admitted the testimony over the objection. Dr. Feliciano-Hill also asked the district court to augment its charge to the jury (taken from Dr. Feliciano-Hill's written proposed instructions) with an additional later-proposed instruction that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should not be considered on the question of reasonable accommodation. The district court declined this request as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the retaliation issue, Dr. Feliciano-Hill sought to prove that her supervisors had reacted to her complaints about the new union agreement by subjecting her to harassment, by requiring her to comply with unnecessary bureaucratic requests, and by denying her leave. She pointed particularly to two interactions with her supervisor, Dr. Luis Iguina. One concerned a veteran who was Dr. Feliciano-Hill's patient. Dr. Iguina complained to Dr. Feliciano-Hill that, despite the patient's urgent need for psychiatric services, Dr. Feliciano-Hill had cancelled three of her appointments, resulting in a delay that Dr. Iguina feared could verge on \"patient abuse.\" Dr. Feliciano-Hill averred that the patient was difficult and that she would need support from other professionals to care for the patient. Dr. Iguina arranged for such support. Dr. Felicano-Hill contended at trial that Dr. Iguina's reference to \"patient abuse\" helped create a hostile working environment. On another occasion, Dr. Iguina said something to the effect that \"women are always complaining about their illnesses,\" a remark that Dr. Feliciano-Hill contended was harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill also argued that the department created a hostile work environment and prompted her resignation by asking repeatedly for more specific medical documentation about her disability, and that the department retaliated against her by refusing to grant all of her requests for leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, Dr. Feliciano-Hill moved for a new trial. She argued that the court should not have allowed the department's medical expert to testify, and should have given the limiting instruction she had requested. Additionally, she contended that the jury's verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The district court rejected both arguments in a written order, <i>Feliciano-Hill, et al. v. Principi, et al.,</i> Cv. No. 00-2439(SEC) (D.P.R.2004), and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill enumerates ten issues for review. These fall into three categories &#8212; one is her contention that Dr. Sierra-Zorita should not have been allowed to testify, two are arguments that the judge should have given a limiting instruction as to that doctor's testimony, and seven are objections to the jury's view of the evidence. We address first the issues relating to Dr. Sierra-Zorita and second the arguments about the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Defense Expert Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Admission of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's Testimony and Report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that, pursuant to <i>Daubert</i> and Rule 702, the district court should have refused to admit Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony as evidence. The district court denied Dr. Feliciano-Hill's motion both because it was untimely &#8212; Dr. Feliciano-Hill waited until the moments before Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony to object, even though she had received the doctor's report five months earlier &#8212; and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's report and proposed testimony met the applicable standard. The district court was correct on both grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties have an obligation to object to an expert's testimony in a timely fashion, so that the expert's proposed testimony can be evaluated with care. Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not make a timely motion here and has not offered any reason for her delay. The district court was on firm ground in refusing her motion as untimely. <i>See Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161493\"><a href=\"/opinion/161493/alfred-v-caterpillar-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1087 (10th Cir.2003) (explaining that \"because <i>Daubert</i> generally contemplates a `gatekeeping' function, not a `gotcha' junction,\" untimely <i>Daubert</i> motions should be considered \"only in rare circumstances\"); <i>see also Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec) Import, Inc.</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76522\"><a href=\"/opinion/76522/club-car-inc-v-club-car-quebec/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 780 (11th Cir.2004) (\"A <i>Daubert</i> objection not raised before trial may be rejected as untimely.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, Dr. Feliciano-Hill's <i>Daubert</i> motion lacked merit. Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should have been excluded because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's opinion differed from that of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's treating physician, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover, a \"very well respected and beloved rheumatologist,\" and because Dr. Sierra-Zorita's report did not \"cite[] medical authorities and w[as] based on `experience' and general knowledge.\" The mere fact that two experts disagree is not grounds for excluding one's testimony. Even if we were to assume that Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover was somehow more qualified than Dr. Sierra-Zorita &#8212; and there is no reason in the record for us to do so &#8212; the district court could not have excluded Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony on that ground alone. <i>See Holbrook v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715786\"><a href=\"/opinion/715786/grace-a-holbrook-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-john-p-holbrook-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 782 (3d Cir.1996) (\"[W]itnesses may be competent to testify as experts even though they may not, in the court's eyes, be the `best' qualified. Who is `best' qualified is a matter of weight upon which reasonable jurors may disagree.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's assertion that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony did not meet the standard of <i>Daubert</i> and Rule 702 because the doctor failed to support his diagnosis with citations to published authorities. As the district court noted, the underlying medical question &#8212; whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill's medical condition prevented her from walking around the hospital &#8212; was \"not a complex medical situation.\" Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony and report did not involve novel medical theories. The doctor was called upon only to offer a routine diagnosis, on a patient he had examined, pertaining to a common condition well within his particular expertise. In this case, the doctor's training and experience placed his report and testimony well above the Rule <i>702/Daubert</i> bar. Indeed, even in more complicated cases when an examining physician calls upon training and experience to offer a differential diagnosis (a determination of which of two or more diseases, presenting with similar symptoms, has caused a patient's ailments), most courts have found no <i>Daubert</i> problem. <i>See, e.g., Bitler v. A.O.

Limiting Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Feliciano-Hill argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony should only be considered on the question of whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled, not on the issue of reasonable accommodation. The district court denied the motion both because it was untimely &#8212; Feliciano-Hill had not requested the instruction in her written proposed jury instructions, which the court had adopted &#8212; and because it was unnecessary. Again, the district court ruled correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction Dr. Feliciano-Hill requested was plainly unnecessary. The district court noted, and the transcript confirms, that \"[t]he witness was . . . crystal clear\" that he had no opinion regarding the reasonableness of a motorized wheelchair as an accommodation for a person with rheumatoid arthritis. As the district court concluded, \"The jury ha[d] that message.\" The district court did not err in refusing to offer an unnecessary instruction about the scope of Dr. Sierra-Zorita's testimony. <i>See, e.g., Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750688\"><a href=\"/opinion/750688/darryl-w-elliott-v-sd-warren-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1998) (finding no error in district court's refusal to give requested instruction that was unnecessary to explain the applicable law to the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will reverse the district court's refusal to order a new trial on the ground of insufficient evidence only where \"the jury's verdict was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 201 (1st Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on her Rehabilitation Act reasonable accommodation claim Dr. Feliciano-Hill had to convince the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that she suffered from a `disability' within the meaning of the statute; (2) that she was a qualified individual in that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that, despite her employer's knowledge of her disability, the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation for the disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 20. The jury could have rejected Dr. Feliciano-Hill's case either because Dr. Feliciano-Hill was not disabled or because the department had offered a reasonable accommodation in the form of a motorized wheelchair. (The department agreed that Dr. Feliciano-Hill possessed the qualifications for her job.) Because we have focused on the dueling expert testimony on whether Dr. Feliciano-Hill was disabled, we will review the sufficiency of the evidence on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Sierra-Zorita, a qualified expert, gave compelling testimony that Dr. Feliciano-Hill did not actually have rheumatoid arthritis. He also testified that the plaintiff had little difficulty walking. Moreover, Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover's contrary testimony was not emphatic. He revealed that Dr. Feliciano-Hill's lab tests were negative for rheumatoid arthritis and that Dr. Feliciano-Hill had no swelling in her joints. Dr. Gonzalez-Alcover admitted that he had examined Dr. Feliciano-Hill only four times over the six-year period leading up to her complaint. He indicated that he had no knowledge of how far Dr. Feliciano-Hill would have been required to walk at her job and that he was not familiar with the layout of the Medical Center. On this evidence the jury could reject Dr. Feliciano-Hill's claim that she was disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only Dr. Feliciano-Hill's argument that the department retaliated against her for her disability discrimination complaint, a claim she is entitled to press even though the jury reasonably rejected her case on outright discrimination. <i>See Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197175\"><a href=\"/opinion/197175/soileau-v-guilford-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1997) (recognizing that retaliation claim may succeed even where disability discrimination claim fails). To make out a case for retaliation, \"a plaintiff must show that (i) she undertook protected conduct, (ii) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (iii) the two were causally linked.\" <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201453\"><a href=\"/opinion/201453/noviello-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also Weber v. Cranston Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198911\"><a href=\"/opinion/198911/weber-v-cranston-school-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that Rehabilitation Act prohibits retaliation). At trial, Dr. Feliciano-Hill argued that she suffered an \"adverse employment action\" through the creation of a hostile work environment and a constructive termination. To prove that a hostile work environment constituted \"adverse employment action,\" the plaintiff must show that the harassment she complains of was \"so severe or pervasive that it alters the conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\" <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200103\"><a href=\"/opinion/200103/marrero-v-goya-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2002). Similarly, to establish a constructive discharge, a plaintiff must show \"that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her shoes would have felt compelled to resign,\" an objective standard that \"cannot be triggered solely by the employee's subjective beliefs, no matter how sincerely held.\" <i>Id.</i> at 28 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The question whether a work environment is sufficiently hostile to create liability is best left to a jury. <i>Che v. Mass. Bay Trans. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200615\"><a href=\"/opinion/200615/che-v-mbta/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence allowed the jury to find that Dr. Feliciano-Hill's treatment by the department was not \"objectively intolerable.\" <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 28. On the record, the jury could have found that Dr. Iguina's concerns about the treatment of the female veteran were properly expressed and unobjectionable. And the jury could have found, after listening to testimony on the point, that Dr. Iguina's remark \"about women complaining a lot\" and any other isolated comments from her peers did not constitute severe or pervasive harassment, or a course of conduct that would have led a reasonable person to resign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the department's insistence that Dr. Feliciano-Hill provide medical documentation supporting her insistence that she could not walk around the hospital, the jury could have found, in reliance on the evidence, that the hospital reasonably needed more specific guidance from Dr. Alcover-Gonzalez and that its procedures were not harassing or unreasonable. Finally, the jury could have found that the department's denial of Dr. Feliciano-Hill's request for additional leave did not, in the circumstances, create a hostile work environment or constitute an \"adverse employment action.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, on examination of the record we cannot conclude that the verdict represented a \"manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Feliciano-Hill initially cited the Americans with Disabilities Act as grounds for relief, the ADA does not provide for suits against the federal government.
