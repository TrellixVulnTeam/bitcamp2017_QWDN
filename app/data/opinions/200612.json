Giorgiy Nishnianidze raises a\n\nhost of challenges to his extortion conviction.                  After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                               I.    Facts\n\n           A.   Adoption\n\n           Lewis Finfer and Judith Shea, a married couple, adopted\n\nan infant son, Alexander, from the country of Georgia in March\n\n1996.   They consulted with a Massachusetts adoption agency called\n\nWide Horizons    for   Children,    Inc.,    which   in   turn    worked   with\n\nNishnianidze    (pronounced   nish-nee-ah-NID-zuh),        an     attorney   in\n\nGeorgia.   Finfer and Shea paid $10,000 for the adoption -- half to\n\nWide Horizons and half to Nishnianidze for his legal services.\n\n           Finfer and Shea traveled to Georgia to pick up their son,\n\nstaying with Nishnianidze at his home.          Finfer and Shea asked to\n\nmeet the birth mother but Nishnianidze told her that he did not\n\nknow how to locate her.         The adoption was without incident.\n\nNishnianidze provided the couple with Georgian legal documentation\n\nof the adoption, including a document in which Alexander’s birth\n\nmother relinquished all parental rights.             These documents were\n\nrecognized by a Massachusetts court that finalized the adoption\n\nafter Finfer, Shea, and Alexander returned home.\n\n           B.   Nishnianidze Contacts Parents\n\n           Nishnianidze emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in October,\n\n1998, seeking permanent residency from the Legacy Immigration and\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fNaturalization    Service.    Finfer     and   Shea   heard   nothing   from\n\nNishnianidze until January 26, 1999, when he called their home and\n\nspoke to Shea.     He said he was in Boston and asked to see the\n\nfamily.    Shea told Nishnianidze to call Finfer, who then invited\n\nNishnianidze to their home for dinner.\n\n           Finfer picked up Nishnianidze in downtown Boston and\n\ndrove him to the family’s home in Dorchester.         That evening, on the\n\npretense   of   documenting   a   successful    international    adoption,\n\nNishnianidze filmed the family with a video camera he brought.\n\nIntimating that the birth mother was having \"a rough time,\" he\n\nasked if the couple would provide financial support to the birth\n\nmother and her two children in Georgia.         The couple refused.\n\n           At the end of the evening, Finfer drove Nishnianidze back\n\nto downtown Boston.   During the car ride, Nishnianidze told Finfer\n\nthat Alexander’s birth mother was upset, might challenge the\n\nlegality of the adoption, had made threats to Nishnianidze and\n\nNishnianidze’s family, and wanted $50,000 from Finfer and Shea.\n\nFinfer was upset by the conversation and told Nishnianidze it\n\n\"sounded like blackmail.\"\n\n           Finfer relayed the conversation to Shea.             The couple\n\ncontacted an attorney the next day and met with the                 FBI on\n\nJanuary 28, 1999.     At this meeting, Finfer and Shea agreed to\n\nrecord their subsequent conversations with Nishnianidze. They also\n\nreceived advice from the agents about how to gather information\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffrom Nishnianidze.      After this initial meeting, Finfer and Shea\n\noccasionally    spoke    with   a   single    FBI   agent   about    their\n\nconversations with Nishnianidze and received suggestions as to how\n\nto handle the discussions.\n\n           C.   Telephone Calls\n\n           On the morning of January 29, 1999, Nishnianidze called\n\nShea at home, and she recorded the conversation.            Nishnianidze\n\nbegan by describing recent events in Georgia, including opposition\n\nand   challenges   to   international     adoptions.   He   stated    that\n\nAlexander’s biological mother was upset the boy had been adopted by\n\nan American family and had threatened harm to Nishnianidze and\n\nNishnianidze’s son if Alexander was not returned.           Nishnianidze\n\nstated that he came to the United States because of the threats,\n\nand that the birthmother requested \"from me to take the child\n\nback.\"   He told Shea that if she paid him $50,000 (to be given to\n\nthe biological mother), the biological mother would guarantee not\n\nto pursue the child.\n\n           Nishnianidze stressed that he had been threatened and\n\nabused by Alexander’s biological family, whom he described as\n\n\"hungry,\" \"homeless,\" and \"crazy people,\" who were connected to the\n\nGeorgian police.    Shea stated that it was \"[s]cary to think about\n\n. . . people wanting Alexander back.\"           Nishnianidze responded,\n\n\"[I]t’s very hard for, for you, okay?\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f               Near the end of the conversation, Nishnianidze told Shea\n\nthat if the biological mother \"don’t receive money I don’t know\n\nwhat will be happened.\"         He told Shea to \"be silence\" and \"not to\n\nmake noisy.\"        Nishnianidze advised her to borrow the $50,000 from\n\na bank or from friends.        The call ended when Shea told Nishnianidze\n\nshe would discuss the matter with Finfer.\n\n               Later that day, Nishnianidze called again and spoke to\n\nFinfer, who recorded the call.               Nishnianidze repeated that the\n\nbiological family wanted $50,000 and encouraged Finfer to promptly\n\npay whatever he could.         Nishnianidze first said that his family in\n\nGeorgia was in danger, then stated \"maybe they will call you or\n\ncome here I don’t know what they can do.\"\n\n               Finfer told Nishnianidze that he was worried and asked,\n\n\"Are     you    telling   me    that   you’re      gonna    take   our    child?\"\n\nNishnianidze responded, \"Ah, I don’t know what will be happen.\"\n\nFinfer concluded the call by telling Nishnianidze he would call him\n\nin New York the following week.\n\n               On   February   3,   Nishnianidze     left   a   message   at   the\n\ncouple’s home asking them to call him at his Brooklyn residence.\n\nFinfer    returned      the    call.    In    this    recorded     conversation,\n\nNishnianidze asked, \"What you decide?\"               Finfer told him that they\n\nhad decided not to pay.         Nishnianidze responded, \"I think it would\n\nbe . . . worse for me and ah, also for your family.\"                Nishnianidze\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ftold Finfer that the biological family knew Finfer and Shea’s\n\naddress and could send someone to the home.    He continued:\n\n          They can take the child from yard or and\n          they’ll ah, request ah, twice more money. Or\n          they can I don’t know what they can do,\n          everything they can do. . . .\n          They can find ah, another people which can\n          come not to make photos but to take child.\n          And then you, you, you, you will, you will not\n          ah, know what we do when it would be happen\n          because they don’t warn you. . . .\n          They know address they will take ah, after one\n          month, two months, five months, ah, one year I\n          don’t know, which time it would be happen\n          . . . . [They told me to] warn them, that we\n          will take the child ah, or something we will\n          do it then.\n\n          Finfer stated he was concerned for his son’s safety, and\n\nNishnianidze again advised against going to the police or telling\n\nanyone about the situation.    He stated, \"If you are afraid for\n\n[Alexander] and his life in this case you must do right for son;\n\nyou must pay.\" Nishnianidze concluded by saying Finfer should call\n\nhim within one week if he decided to pay.\n\n          Finfer called Nishnianidze the next day and stated that\n\nhe was afraid for himself and his family and had decided to pay.\n\nOver the next two weeks, Finfer and Nishnianidze spoke five times\n\nregarding the exchange of money.     They agreed to meet at Boston's\n\nSouth Station to exchange $38,000.\n\n          In his final phone call on the evening of February 17,\n\n1999, Nishnianidze told Finfer that he was sick and could not go to\n\nBoston to pick up the money.   He said Finfer could send the money\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fdirectly to the birth mother, but stated that he believed he could\n\nbe arrested and did not want to touch the money.\n\n            D.    FBI Questioning\n\n            On the morning of April 6, 1999, two New York FBI agents\n\nand a New York City Police Department detective went to the\n\nManhattan apartment where Nishnianidze was staying.                FBI agents in\n\nBoston had requested that they locate Nishnianidze, interview him\n\nand obtain any photographs or videotapes in his possession of\n\nchildren whose adoptions he had processed.\n\n            When they arrived at the apartment between 8:00 and 8:30\n\na.m., the agents knocked and identified themselves.                 Nishnianidze\n\nopened the door and they entered into a one-room apartment with a\n\nbed and two additional mattresses on the floor.                     Nishnianidze\n\nappeared to have been sleeping when he answered the door, and the\n\nagents observed Nishnianidze’s son on a mattress on the floor where\n\nhe   had   been    sleeping   and    where     he    remained    throughout    the\n\ninterview.\n\n            The    agents   (including       one    Russian    speaker)   informed\n\nNishnianidze that they were investigating his contacts with a\n\nMassachusetts family and interviewed him for thirty to forty-five\n\nminutes.          Nishnianidze      talked     about     his     involvement    in\n\ninternational adoptions and his contacts with Finfer and Shea, and\n\nthen answered follow-up questions.             The agents asked Nishnianidze\n\nif he had any photographs or videotapes of the adopted children.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fAn agent accompanied Nishnianidze as he searched the apartment and\n\nproduced the video of Alexander. The agents and detective were all\n\narmed, and while Nishnianidze searched for the video, the detective\n\nremoved his snub-nosed handgun from its holster and held it behind\n\nhis back, reholstering it when the search was complete.\n\n          At    some   point   during    the   interview,   Nishnianidze’s\n\nroommate arrived at the apartment. The detective asked him to wait\n\nin the hallway while the interview was completed and he agreed to\n\ndo so.   After giving Nishnianidze a receipt for the videotape and\n\na birth announcement relating to another adoption, the interview\n\nended.\n\n           E.   Arrest and Pre-trial\n\n           Nishnianidze was arrested on May 17, 1999.              He was\n\ncharged with four counts: (1) transmitting an interstate threat\n\nwith the intent of extorting $50,000 in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 875(b); (2) transmitting an interstate threat in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 875(c); (3) traveling in interstate commerce to perform\n\nacts of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952; and (4) using\n\nan interstate facility to perform acts of extortion in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1952.\n\n           Before trial, Nishnianidze made a motion to suppress his\n\nApril 6, 1999 statements to the FBI agents.         After an evidentiary\n\nhearing, the district court denied the motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           F.     Trial\n\n           The government’s case at trial included the recorded\n\ntelephone conversations between Nishnianidze and Shea and Finfer.\n\nFinfer    and     Shea    testified    about    their    conversations       with\n\nNishnianidze as well as their subjective fear that their son was in\n\ndanger.   An FBI agent described her interview of Nishnianidze in\n\nManhattan,      including    his    statement   that    he   believed   he    was\n\ncommitting extortion.\n\n           Nishnianidze testified in his defense.             He said he never\n\nintended to extort money, but was trying to make Finfer and Shea\n\naware of the danger he was facing from Alexander's biological\n\nfamily in Georgia.          Nishnianidze suggested that he wanted the\n\ncouple to help him demonstrate fear of persecution so he could\n\nreceive political asylum. Nishnianidze also stated that Finfer was\n\nplaying \"games\" with Nishnianidze, and Nishnianidze simply joined\n\nthe game, although he never actually intended a kidnapping.\n\n             The jury found Nishnianidze guilty on all four counts.\n\nHe was sentenced to fifty-seven months imprisonment followed by two\n\nyears of supervised release.          He was also ordered to pay a special\n\nassessment of $400.         This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\n             A.   Motion to Suppress\n\n             Nishnianidze challenges the district court's denial of\n\nhis motion to suppress.            We review the district court's factual\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdeterminations for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               \"[A] person questioned by law enforcement officers after\n\nbeing 'taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of\n\naction    in    any    significant     way'    must    first\"     receive   Miranda\n\nwarnings.        Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994)\n\n(quoting Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966)).                            In\n\ndetermining whether a defendant was in \"custody\" when interrogated,\n\n\"a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the\n\ninterrogation, but the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there was\n\na formal arrest or restraint on the freedom of movement of the\n\ndegree associated with a formal arrest.\"               Id. (quotation omitted);\n\naccord United States v. Fernández-Ventura, 132 F.3d 844, 846 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n               The    officer's    subjective       belief   is   irrelevant;     the\n\ninquiry is \"how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would\n\nhave understood his situation.\"               Stansbury, 511 U.S. at 323-24.\n\nAmong    the    factors    to     consider    are    \"whether     the   suspect   was\n\nquestioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, the number\n\nof law enforcement officers present at the scene, the degree of\n\nphysical restraint placed upon the suspect, and the duration and\n\ncharacter of the interrogation.\"              United States v. Masse, 816 F.2d\n\n805, 809 (1st Cir. 1987) (quotation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f             Considering all the circumstances, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in denying Nishnianidze’s motion to\n\nsuppress.       Admittedly,     there      are   some   factors       in    favor   of\n\nsuppression, including the fact that the interview took place early\n\nin the morning and was administered by three agents in a small\n\narea.      Additionally, Nishnianidze was never told he was free to\n\nleave.      On the other hand, Nishnianidze was interviewed at the\n\nplace where he was staying; he was therefore familiar with the\n\nsurroundings.       The interview was forty-five minutes or less -- not\n\nexceptionally       long.     Cf.   Fernández-Ventura,         132    F.3d    at    848\n\n(finding that the duration of the interrogation, on its own, is not\n\na determinative factor).\n\n             The     agents   did    not     make    physical        contact       with\n\nNishnianidze        or   restrain   his     movement.          At     the    hearing,\n\nNishnianidze’s son testified that he saw one of the detective's gun\n\nwhen it was briefly unholstered.             However, there is no evidence\n\nthat Nishnianidze saw the weapon or felt it restrained his movement\n\nin   any     way.        Finally,   Nishnianidze's       son        testified      that\n\nNishnianidze was told by the Russian-speaking agent that if he\n\ncooperated and agreed with the agents he would not be arrested.\n\nNishnianidze asserts that he was confused and felt pressured to\n\nspeak.     This argument fails because the district court heard the\n\nson’s testimony regarding the agent’s behavior, and was in the best\n\nposition to judge its credibility.               The district court's factual\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ffinding   that   the   son's   story   was    implausible   is   not   clearly\n\nerroneous.   In all, there was not the \"restraint on movement of the\n\ndegree associated with a formal arrest,\" and Nishnianidze's motion\n\nto suppress his statements was properly denied. See Stansbury, 511\n\nU. S. at 322; cf. United States v. Lanni, 951 F.2d 440, 443 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (finding no clear error in determining that defendant\n\nwas not in custody where she was interviewed and asked to provide\n\nhandwriting samples by two agents for four hours in a \"tense\n\natmosphere\").\n\n           B.    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Nishnianidze    asserts     that    the   government   failed   to\n\npresent sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 875(b)1 and (c)2 and 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (the \"Travel Act\").                 In\n\nassessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we\n\n\"review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable\n\n\n1\n     Whoever, with intent to extort from any person . . ., any\n     money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or\n     foreign commerce any communication containing any threat\n     to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person\n     of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n     not more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 875(b) (2003).\n2\n     Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any\n     communication containing any threat to kidnap any person\n     or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be\n     fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five\n     years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 875(c).\n\n                                   -12-\n\finferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to\n\ndetermine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [was] guilty\n\nas charged.\"    United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (quotation omitted).        \"An appellate court plays a very\n\ncircumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary\n\nfoundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.\"     United States\n\nv. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998).     We are mindful that\n\nthe jury's duty is to assess credibility, and it may accept or\n\nreject, in whole or in part, any testimony.     United States v. Mena-\n\nRobles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               1.   Threats Transmitted Via Interstate Communication\n\n          To convict under § 875, the government had to prove that\n\nthe defendant intended to transmit the interstate communication and\n\nthat the communication contained a true threat. See United States\n\nv. Whiffen, 121 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting United States\n\nv. Darby, 37 F.3d 1059, 1066 (4th Cir. 1994)).       A true threat is\n\none that a reasonable recipient familiar with the context of the\n\ncommunication would find threatening.     Id.   For a conviction under\n\n§ 875(b), the government also had to prove that the threat was\n\ntransmitted with the specific intent to extort money or a thing of\n\nvalue. See United States v. Himelwright, 42 F.3d 777, 783 (3d Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            A     reasonable    jury    could      find    that    Nishnianidze\n\ntransmitted a threat in interstate commerce with the intent of\n\nextorting       money.    The   jury     heard     Nishnianidze’s      telephone\n\nconversations,      specifically   the        interstate   telephone    call   of\n\nFebruary 3 in which Nishnianidze stated that not paying the money\n\nwould be \"worse for me and ah, also for your family.\"                   He told\n\nFinfer that \"[t]hey can take the child from yard,\" and warned that\n\nFinfer could never be safe because \"they\" could act at any time in\n\nthe future.       Nishnianidze finished by saying, \"If you are afraid\n\nfor [your son] and his life in this case you must do right for your\n\nson, you must pay.\"\n\n            The jury also considered the circumstances leading up to\n\nthis conversation: Nishnianidze appeared in Boston out of the blue\n\nafter nearly three years; went to the family’s home and videotaped\n\nthe child; and began a series of phone calls to the family\n\ndiscussing the danger posed by the biological family (who were\n\nreferred to as \"crazy people\") and the need to pay $50,000 to avoid\n\nharm to either Nishnianidze’s family or Alexander.\n\n            Nishnianidze asserts that he was simply warning the\n\nfamily and cannot be convicted because he never threatened to\n\npersonally kidnap Alexander.           His argument fails.         Nishnianidze\n\ntold Finfer and Shea that the only way to ensure their son's safety\n\nwas to pay him $50,000.         Thus, Nishnianidze acknowledged that he\n\nalone could prevent harm from befalling Alexander.                His statements\n\n                                       -14-\n\fin the final phone call that Finfer could send the money directly\n\nto the birth mother came after the threats had already been made.\n\nA jury could have found that Nishnianidze either controlled the\n\nbiological family's actions or, more likely, that the story of the\n\nbiological family was fabricated and the real danger was posed by\n\nNishnianidze himself.            There was ample evidence to support a\n\nfinding that Nishnianidze’s comments placed Finfer and Shea in\n\nimmediate fear for their son’s safety.\n\n                      2.    Criminal Conduct and Interstate Travel\n\n           To convict under the Travel Act, the government must show\n\n\"(1) interstate travel or the use of an interstate facility; (2)\n\nwith the     intent    to   promote,    manage,   establish,    carry   on,   or\n\nfacilitate     an     unlawful     activity\"   (here,      violation    of    the\n\nMassachusetts extortion statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 25\n\n(2003)); and (3) \"performance or attempted performance of acts in\n\nfurtherance of the unlawful activity.\"            Woodward, 149 F.3d at 65.\n\n           A reasonable jury could have found that Nishnianidze\n\ntraveled     from   his     home   in    Brooklyn,   New    York   to   Boston,\n\nMassachusetts in January 1999 and made interstate telephone calls\n\nin February 1999 intending to promote and facilitate extortion.\n\nNishnianidze established contact with Finfer and Shea, came to\n\ntheir house and made a video of the family, and asked the couple\n\nfor money for the biological mother.           He continued to pressure the\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\ffamily after he returned to New York.        There was ample evidence to\n\nsupport his conviction under the Travel Act.\n\n          C.    Jury Instructions\n\n                     1.   \"True\" Threat\n\n          Nishnianidze argues that the district court erred in\n\ninstructing    the   jury   to   consider   whether   the   recipient   felt\n\nthreatened, rather than whether an objective speaker making the\n\nstatements would believe a recipient would feel threatened.             Since\n\nno objection was made at trial, we review only for plain error.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).          We evaluate the error in light of the\n\nrecord as a whole.        United States v. Smith, 278 F.3d 33, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2002). Nishnianidze must demonstrate that the error was plain\n\nand that it affected his substantial rights.            United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993); accord United States v. Tom, 330\n\nF.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir. 2003).           This court will not correct a\n\nforfeited error unless the error \"seriously affects the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"            Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 732 (quotation omitted).\n\n          \"True threats\" are not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nUnited States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1492-93 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nA defendant may be convicted for making a threat if \"he should have\n\nreasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as\n\na threat by those to whom it is made.\"         Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491;\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fsee also United States v. Whiffen, 121 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(applying Fulmer to § 875(c)).    While the fact-finder may consider\n\nother evidence, including the effect of the statement on the\n\nrecipient, the ultimate standard is an objective one -- whether a\n\nreasonable person would understand the statement to be threatening.\n\nFulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491.     Nishnianidze asserts that the judge\n\nimproperly instructed the jury to consider the recipient's state of\n\nmind when determining whether a threat was made.\n\n           Although the district court first (incorrectly) stated\n\nthat the threat was determined by the recipient's reaction, the\n\ninstruction later clarified that the burden is on the government to\n\nshow that a reasonable speaker would have understood the statement\n\nto be threatening.3   We find no plain error in the district court's\n\n\n3\n    The district court charged:\n\n      A communication contains a threat to kidnap another\n      person if it is made under circumstances such that an\n      ordinary reasonable recipient of the communication would\n      interpret it as a true threat of injury or kidnapping.\n      With respect to this element you may consider the\n      circumstance under which the statement was made,\n      including the kind of statement made, the place where it\n      was made, how it was spoken, and its context with respect\n      to the surrounding circumstances. You may also consider\n      the language the defendant used and the reaction of the\n      person to whom the communication was addressed.       The\n      government is not required to prove that the defendant\n      subjectively intended the recipient to understand the\n      communication as a threat, nor that the defendant\n      intended or was able to actually carry out the threat\n      contained in the communication. But the government must\n      prove that the defendant could reasonably have foreseen\n      that the communication would be taken as a threat by the\n      listener.\n\n                                  -17-\n\finstruction. At most, the district court misspoke at the beginning\n\nof the instruction.         The misdescription or omission of an element\n\nof a crime does not necessarily constitute plain error.                Neder v.\n\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1999).\n\n               The evidence was overwhelming that Nishnianidze should\n\nhave known that the threats would frighten the victims. Finfer and\n\nShea   told     Nishnianidze    they   were     frightened   and   Nishnianidze\n\nacknowledged that it was hard for them to hear what he said.\n\nNishnianidze told them that someone could take their child at any\n\ntime and told them not to go to the police.              A reasonable person\n\nwho made these statements would understand them to be threatening.\n\nAny    error    in   the    instruction   did    not   affect   Nishnianidze's\n\nsubstantial rights.\n\n                      2.    Entrapment\n\n               Nishnianidze challenges the district court's denial of\n\nhis request for an entrapment instruction. We apply plenary review\n\nto that decision.          United States v. Rodríguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).       \"[A]n accused is entitled to an instruction on\n\nhis theory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and\n\nthere is evidence in the record to support it.\"                 Id.   In making\n\nthis determination, a court may not weigh the evidence, make\n\ncredibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof.\n\n\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                                       -18-\n\fUnited States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).               Rather,\n\nwe consider whether \"there is record evidence which fairly supports\n\nthe   claims    of    both   government   inducement    of   the     crime   and\n\ndefendant's lack of predisposition to engage in it.\"               Rodríguez,\n\n858 F.2d at 814.\n\n             An improper \"inducement\" consists of the opportunity plus\n\nsomething else like excessive pressure, dogged persistence, or the\n\ngovernment's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type\n\nof motive.      Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961; United States v. Joost, 92\n\nF.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).          \"[I]t is not enough simply that the\n\ngovernment afforded the defendant the opportunity for commission of\n\nthe offense.\"        Rodríguez, 858 F.2d at 813.\n\n             Nishnianidze argues improper inducement resulted when the\n\nFBI suggested questions for Finfer and Shea to pose to Nishnianidze\n\nand monitored the case.        We think this is a prime example of the\n\ngovernment simply giving a suspect the opportunity to commit a\n\ncrime: the FBI did not design or initiate the plan, Finfer and Shea\n\nsimply asked open-ended questions and Nishnianidze provided the\n\nincriminatory details. Nishnianidze mentioned the possible harm to\n\nAlexander and the need to pay $50,000 to ensure his safety.             Finfer\n\nand   Shea     (as    governmental   agents)    did   nothing   to    pressure\n\nNishnianidze -- indeed, the most serious threats came when Finfer\n\nstated that they would not pay.              Cf. id. at 815 (finding that\n\ndefendant made a sufficient showing of government inducement where\n\n                                      -19-\n\fthe government actor \"designed the plan, created the opportunity\n\nfor defendant's participation, made the initial approach, solicited\n\ndefendant    forcefully,   and    displayed   dogged     insistence     until\n\n[defendant] capitulated\").\n\n            As to predisposition, we remove the government's improper\n\ninducement and \"ask how the defendant likely would have reacted to\n\nan ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.\"           Gendron, 18 F.3d at\n\n962.   Factors to consider in assessing whether the defendant was\n\npredisposed to commit to crime charged are:\n\n            (1) the character or reputation of the\n            defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion\n            of   criminal  activity   was   made  by   the\n            Government; (3) whether the defendant was\n            engaged in the criminal activity for profit;\n            (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to\n            commit the offense, which was overcome by the\n            governmental persuasion; and (5) the nature of\n            the inducement of persuasion offered by the\n            Government.\n\nGamache, 156 F.3d at 9-10.\n\n            Nishnianidze has not shown a lack of predisposition.          He\n\ninitiated contact with Finfer and Shea, sought to profit from his\n\nthreats, showed no reluctance to the crime (his hesitancy in\n\ncollecting the money at the end came too late -- the threats had\n\nalready   been   communicated),    and    there   was    little,   if   any,\n\ninducement by the government. As Nishnianidze has not shown either\n\ngovernment inducement or lack of predisposition, the district\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fcourt's refusal to instruct the jury on an entrapment defense was\n\nproper.\n\n              D.   Pro Se Motions\n\n              In a pro se brief, Nishnianidze maintains that he was\n\ndenied effective assistance of counsel.                  This claim requires\n\nresolution of factual issues, as appellant must demonstrate that\n\ncounsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and that the\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense.                 See Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).                We have held that \"fact-\n\nspecific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut\n\non   direct    review    of   criminal   convictions,        but,   rather,   must\n\noriginally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"\n\nUnited    States    v.   Mala,   7   F.3d    1058,    1062   (1st   Cir.   1993).\n\nNishnianidze's claim of ineffective counsel is therefore dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice to appellant's right to litigate the claim in an\n\napplication for post-conviction relief.              See id. at 1063.\n\n              Nishnianidze also filed a pro se motion to dismiss based\n\non the Vienna Convention, an issue raised for the first time on\n\nappeal.       His argument is not developed and therefore waived.\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").               His allusion to\n\nprosecutorial misconduct fails for the same reason.                 Id.\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f                        III.   Conclusion\n\n         Finding no merit in Nishnianidze's appeals, we affirm the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

Adoption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis Finfer and Judith Shea, a married couple, adopted an infant son, Alexander, from the country of Georgia in March 1996. They consulted with a Massachusetts adoption agency called Wide Horizons for Children, Inc., which in turn worked with Nishnianidze (pronounced nish-nee-ah-NID-zuh), an attorney in Georgia. Finfer and Shea paid $10,000 for the adoption &#8212; half to Wide Horizons and half to Nishnianidze for his legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer and Shea traveled to Georgia to pick up their son, staying with Nishnianidze at his home. Finfer and Shea asked to meet the birth mother but Nishnianidze told her that he did not know how to locate her. The adoption was without incident. Nishnianidze provided the couple with Georgian legal documentation of the adoption, including a document in which Alexander's birth mother relinquished all parental rights. These documents were recognized by a Massachusetts court that finalized the adoption after Finfer, Shea, and Alexander returned home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Nishnianidze Contacts Parents</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in October, 1998, seeking permanent residency from the Legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service. Finfer and Shea heard nothing from Nishnianidze until January 26, 1999, when he called their home and spoke to Shea. He said he was in Boston and asked to see the family. Shea told Nishnianidze to call Finfer, who then invited Nishnianidze to their home for dinner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer picked up Nishnianidze in downtown Boston and drove him to the family's home in Dorchester. That evening, on the pretense of documenting a successful international adoption, Nishnianidze filmed the family with a video camera he brought. Intimating that the birth mother was having \"a rough time,\" he asked if the couple would provide financial support to the birth mother and her two children in Georgia. The couple refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the evening, Finfer drove Nishnianidze back to downtown Boston. During the car ride, Nishnianidze told Finfer that Alexander's birth mother was upset, might challenge the legality of the adoption, had made threats to Nishnianidze and Nishnianidze's family, and wanted $50,000 from Finfer and Shea. Finfer was upset by the conversation and told Nishnianidze it \"sounded like blackmail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer relayed the conversation to Shea. The couple contacted an attorney the next day and met with the FBI on January 28, 1999. At this meeting, Finfer and Shea agreed to record their subsequent conversations with Nishnianidze. They also received advice from the agents about how to gather information from Nishnianidze. After this initial meeting, Finfer and Shea occasionally spoke with a single FBI agent about their conversations with Nishnianidze and received suggestions as to how to handle the discussions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Telephone Calls</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 29, 1999, Nishnianidze called Shea at home, and she recorded the conversation. Nishnianidze began by describing recent events in Georgia, including opposition and challenges to international adoptions. He stated that Alexander's biological mother was upset the boy had been adopted by an American family and had threatened harm to Nishnianidze and Nishnianidze's son if Alexander was not returned. Nishnianidze stated that he came to the United States because of the threats, and that the birth-mother requested \"from me to take the child back.\" He told Shea that if she paid him $50,000 (to be given to the biological mother), the biological mother would guarantee not to pursue the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze stressed that he had been threatened and abused by Alexander's biological family, whom he described as \"hungry,\" \"homeless,\" and \"crazy people,\" who were connected to the Georgian police. Shea stated that it was \"[s]cary to think about ... people wanting Alexander back.\" Nishnianidze responded, \"[I]t's very hard for, for you, okay?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the end of the conversation, Nishnianidze told Shea that if the biological mother \"don't receive money I don't know what will be happened.\" He told Shea to \"be silence\" and \"not to make noisy.\" Nishnianidze advised her to borrow the $50,000 from a bank or from friends. The call ended when Shea told Nishnianidze she would discuss the matter with Finfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Nishnianidze called again and spoke to Finfer, who recorded the call. Nishnianidze repeated that the biological family wanted $50,000 and encouraged Finfer to promptly pay whatever he could. Nishnianidze first said that his family in Georgia was in danger, then stated \"maybe they will call you or come here I don't know what they can do.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer told Nishnianidze that he was worried and asked, \"Are you telling me that you're gonna take our child?\" Nishnianidze responded, \"Ah, I don't know what will be happen.\" Finfer concluded the call by telling Nishnianidze he would call him in New York the following week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 3, Nishnianidze left a message at the couple's home asking them to call him at his Brooklyn residence. Finfer returned the call. In this recorded conversation, Nishnianidze asked, \"What you decide?\" Finfer told him that they had decided not to pay. Nishnianidze responded, \"I think it would be ... worse for me and ah, also for your family.\" Nishnianidze told Finfer that the biological family knew Finfer and Shea's address and could send someone to the home. He continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They can take the child from yard or and they'll ah, request ah, twice more money.

He stated, \"If you are afraid for [Alexander] and his life in this case you must do right for son; you must pay.\" Nishnianidze concluded by saying Finfer should call him within one week if he decided to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer called Nishnianidze the next day and stated that he was afraid for himself and his family and had decided to pay. Over the next two weeks, Finfer and Nishnianidze spoke five times regarding the exchange of money. They agreed to meet at Boston's South Station to exchange $38,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his final phone call on the evening of February 17, 1999, Nishnianidze told Finfer that he was sick and could not go to Boston to pick up the money. He said Finfer could send the money directly to the birth mother, but stated that he believed he could be arrested and did not want to touch the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. FBI Questioning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of April 6, 1999, two New York FBI agents and a New York City Police Department detective went to the Manhattan apartment where Nishnianidze was staying. FBI agents in Boston had requested that they locate Nishnianidze, interview him and obtain any photographs or videotapes in his possession of children whose adoptions he had processed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When they arrived at the apartment between 8:00 and 8:30 a.m., the agents knocked and identified themselves. Nishnianidze opened the door and they entered into a one-room apartment with a bed and two additional mattresses on the floor. Nishnianidze appeared to have been sleeping when he answered the door, and the agents observed Nishnianidze's son on a mattress on the floor where he had been sleeping and where he remained throughout the interview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents (including one Russian speaker) informed Nishnianidze that they were investigating his contacts with a Massachusetts family and interviewed him for thirty to forty-five minutes. Nishnianidze talked about his involvement in international adoptions and his contacts with Finfer and Shea, and then answered follow-up questions. The agents asked Nishnianidze if he had any photographs or videotapes of the adopted children. An agent accompanied Nishnianidze as he searched the apartment and produced the video of Alexander. The agents and detective were all armed, and while Nishnianidze searched for the video, the detective removed his snub-nosed handgun from its holster and held it behind his back, reholstering it when the search was complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the interview, Nishnianidze's roommate arrived at the apartment. The detective asked him to wait in the hallway while the interview was completed and he agreed to do so. After giving Nishnianidze a receipt for the videotape and a birth announcement relating to another adoption, the interview ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Arrest and Pre-trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze was arrested on May 17, 1999. He was charged with four counts: (1) transmitting an interstate threat with the intent of extorting $50,000 in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(b); (2) transmitting an interstate threat in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c); (3) traveling in interstate commerce to perform acts of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952; and (4) using an interstate facility to perform acts of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Nishnianidze made a motion to suppress his April 6, 1999 statements to the FBI agents. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case at trial included the recorded telephone conversations between Nishnianidze and Shea and Finfer. Finfer and Shea testified about their conversations with Nishnianidze as well as their subjective fear that their son was in danger. An FBI agent described her interview of Nishnianidze in Manhattan, including his statement that he believed he was committing extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze testified in his defense. He said he never intended to extort money, but was trying to make Finfer and Shea aware of the danger he was facing from Alexander's biological family in Georgia. Nishnianidze suggested that he wanted the couple to help him demonstrate fear of persecution so he could receive political asylum. Nishnianidze also stated that Finfer was playing \"games\" with Nishnianidze, and Nishnianidze simply joined the game, although he never actually intended a kidnapping.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Nishnianidze guilty on all four counts. He was sentenced to fifty-seven months imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay a special assessment of $400. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress. We review the district court's factual determinations for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 203 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] person questioned by law enforcement officers after being `taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way' must first\" receive <i>Miranda</i> warnings. <i>Stansbury v. California,</i> 511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (quoting <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)). In determining whether a defendant was in \"custody\" when interrogated, \"a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, but the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there was a formal arrest or restraint on the freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted); <i>accord United States v. Fern&#225;ndez-Ventura,</i> 132 F.3d 844, 846 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officer's subjective belief is irrelevant; the inquiry is \"how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation.\" <i>Stansbury,</i> 511 U.S. at 323-24, 114 S.Ct. 1526. Among the factors to consider are \"whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene, the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect, and the duration and character of the interrogation.\" <i>United States v. Masse,</i> 816 F.2d 805, 809 (1st Cir.1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering all the circumstances, we hold that the district court did not err in denying Nishnianidze's motion to suppress. Admittedly, there are some factors in favor of suppression, including the fact that the interview took place early in the morning and was administered by three agents in a small area. Additionally, Nishnianidze was never told he was free to leave. On the other hand, Nishnianidze was interviewed at the place where he was staying; he was therefore familiar with the surroundings. The interview was forty-five minutes or less &#8212; not exceptionally long. <i>Cf. Fern&#225;ndez-Ventura,</i> 132 F.3d at 848 (finding that the duration of the interrogation, on its own, is not a determinative factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents did not make physical contact with Nishnianidze or restrain his movement. At the hearing, Nishnianidze's son testified that he saw one of the detective's gun when it was briefly unholstered. However, there is no evidence that Nishnianidze saw the weapon or felt it restrained his movement in any way. Finally, Nishnianidze's son testified that Nishnianidze was told by the Russian-speaking agent that if he cooperated and agreed with the agents he would not be arrested. Nishnianidze asserts that he was confused and felt pressured to speak. This argument fails because the district court heard the son's testimony regarding the agent's behavior, and was in the best position to judge its credibility. The district court's factual finding that the son's story was implausible is not clearly erroneous. In all, there was not the \"restraint on movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest,\" and Nishnianidze's motion to suppress his statements was properly denied. <i>See Stansbury,</i> 511 U.S. at 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526; <i>cf. United States v. Lanni,</i> 951 F.2d 440, 443 (1st Cir.1991) (finding no clear error in determining that defendant was not in custody where she was interviewed and asked to provide handwriting samples by two agents for four hours in a \"tense atmosphere\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze asserts that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and (c)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952 (the \"Travel Act\"). In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [was] guilty as charged.\" <i>United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). \"An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.\" <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.1998). We are mindful that the jury's duty is to assess credibility, and it may accept or reject, in whole or in part, any testimony. <i>United States v. Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>1. Threats Transmitted Via Interstate Communication</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict under &#167; 875, the government had to prove that the defendant intended to transmit the interstate communication and that the communication contained a true threat. <i>See United States v. Whiffen,</i> 121 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>United States v. Darby,</i> 37 F.3d 1059, 1066 (4th Cir.1994)). A true threat is one that a reasonable recipient familiar with the context of the communication would find threatening. <i>Id.</i> For a conviction under &#167; 875(b), the government also had to prove that the threat was transmitted with the specific intent to extort money or a thing of value. <i>See United States v. Himelwright,</i> 42 F.3d 777, 783 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could find that Nishnianidze transmitted a threat in interstate commerce with the intent of extorting money. The jury heard Nishnianidze's telephone conversations, specifically the interstate telephone call of February 3 in which Nishnianidze stated that not paying the money would be \"worse for me and ah, also for your family.\" He told Finfer that \"[t]hey can take the child from yard,\" and warned that Finfer could never be safe because \"they\" could act at any time in the future. Nishnianidze finished by saying, \"If you are afraid for [your son] and his life in this case you must do right for your son, you must pay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also considered the circumstances leading up to this conversation: Nishnianidze appeared in Boston out of the blue after nearly three years; went to the family's home and videotaped the child; and began a series of phone calls to the family discussing the danger posed by the biological family (who were referred to as \"crazy people\") and the need to pay $50,000 to avoid harm to either Nishnianidze's family or Alexander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze asserts that he was simply warning the family and cannot be convicted because he never threatened to personally kidnap Alexander. His argument fails. Nishnianidze told Finfer and Shea that the only way to ensure their son's safety was to pay him $50,000. Thus, Nishnianidze acknowledged that he alone could prevent harm from befalling Alexander. His statements in the final phone call that Finfer could send the money directly to the birth mother came after the threats had already been made. A jury could have found that Nishnianidze either controlled the biological family's actions or, more likely, that the story of the biological family was fabricated and the real danger was posed by Nishnianidze himself. There was ample evidence to support a finding that Nishnianidze's comments placed Finfer and Shea in immediate fear for their son's safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Criminal Conduct and Interstate Travel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict under the Travel Act, the government must show \"(1) interstate travel or the use of an interstate facility; (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity\" (here, violation of the Massachusetts extortion statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 25 (2003)); and (3) \"performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.\" <i>Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have found that Nishnianidze traveled from his home in Brooklyn, New York to Boston, Massachusetts in January 1999 and made interstate telephone calls in February 1999 intending to promote and facilitate extortion. Nishnianidze established contact with Finfer and Shea, came to their house and made a video of the family, and asked the couple for money for the biological mother. He continued to pressure the family after he returned to New York. There was ample evidence to support his conviction under the Travel Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <p>1. \"True\" Threat</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury to consider whether the recipient felt threatened, rather than whether an objective speaker making the statements would believe a recipient would feel threatened. Since no objection was made at trial, we review only for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). We evaluate the error in light of the record as a whole. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 278 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2002). Nishnianidze must demonstrate that the error was plain and that it affected his substantial rights. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>accord United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir. 2003). This court will not correct a forfeited error unless the error \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"True threats\" are not protected by the First Amendment. <i>United States v. Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d 1486, 1492-93 (1st Cir.1997). A defendant may be convicted for making a threat if \"he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\" <i>Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d at 1491; <i>see also United States v. Whiffen,</i> 121 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1997) (applying <i>Fulmer</i> to &#167; 875(c)). While the fact-finder may consider other evidence, including the effect of the statement on the recipient, the ultimate standard is an objective one &#8212; whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be threatening. <i>Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d at 1491. Nishnianidze asserts that the judge improperly instructed the jury to consider the recipient's state of mind when determining whether a threat was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court first (incorrectly) stated that the threat was determined by the recipient's reaction, the instruction later clarified that the burden is on the government to show that a reasonable speaker would have understood the statement to be threatening.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We find no plain error in the district court's instruction. At most, the district court misspoke at the beginning of the instruction. The misdescription or omission of an element of a crime does not necessarily constitute plain error. <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 9-10, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was overwhelming that Nishnianidze should have known that the threats would frighten the victims. Finfer and Shea told Nishnianidze they were frightened and Nishnianidze acknowledged that it was hard for them to hear what he said. Nishnianidze told them that someone could take their child at any time and told them not to go to the police. A reasonable person who made these statements would understand them to be threatening. Any error in the instruction did not affect Nishnianidze's substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Entrapment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze challenges the district court's denial of his request for an entrapment instruction. We apply plenary review to that decision. <i>United States v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988). \"[A]n accused is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and there is evidence in the record to support it.\" <i>Id.</i> In making this determination, a court may not weigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof. <i>United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998). Rather, we consider whether \"there is record evidence which fairly supports the claims of both government inducement of the crime and defendant's lack of predisposition to engage in it.\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 858 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An improper \"inducement\" consists of the opportunity plus something else like excessive pressure, dogged persistence, or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive. <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 961; <i>United States v. Joost,</i> 92 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1996). \"[I]t is not enough simply that the government afforded the defendant the opportunity for commission of the offense.\" <i>Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 858 F.2d at 813.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze argues improper inducement resulted when the FBI suggested questions for Finfer and Shea to pose to Nishnianidze and monitored the case. We think this is a prime example of the government simply giving a suspect the opportunity to commit a crime: the FBI did not design or initiate the plan, Finfer and Shea simply asked open-ended questions and Nishnianidze provided the incriminatory details. Nishnianidze mentioned the possible harm to Alexander and the need to pay $50,000 to ensure his safety. Finfer and Shea (as governmental agents) did nothing to pressure Nishnianidze &#8212; indeed, the most serious threats came when Finfer stated that they would not pay. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 815 (finding that defendant made a sufficient showing of government inducement where the government actor \"designed the plan, created the opportunity for defendant's participation, made the initial approach, solicited defendant forcefully, and displayed dogged insistence until [defendant] capitulated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to predisposition, we remove the government's improper inducement and \"ask how the defendant likely would have reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.\" <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962. Factors to consider in assessing whether the defendant was predisposed to commit to crime charged are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the Government; (3) whether the defendant was engaged in the criminal activity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense, which was overcome by the governmental persuasion; and (5) the nature of the inducement of persuasion offered by the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze has not shown a lack of predisposition. He initiated contact with Finfer and Shea, sought to profit from his threats, showed no reluctance to the crime (his hesitancy in collecting the money at the end came too late &#8212; the threats had already been communicated), and there was little, if any, inducement by the government. As Nishnianidze has not shown either government inducement or lack of predisposition, the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on an entrapment defense was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Pro Se Motions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pro se brief, Nishnianidze maintains that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. This claim requires resolution of factual issues, as appellant must demonstrate that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We have held that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1062 (1st Cir.1993). Nishnianidze's claim of ineffective counsel is therefore dismissed without prejudice to appellant's right to litigate the claim in an application for post-conviction relief. <i>See id.</i> at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze also filed a pro se motion to dismiss based on the Vienna Convention, an issue raised for the first time on appeal. His argument is not developed and therefore waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").

Adoption</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis Finfer and Judith Shea, a married couple, adopted an infant son, Alexander, from the country of Georgia in March 1996. They consulted with a Massachusetts adoption agency called Wide Horizons for Children, Inc., which in turn worked with Nishnianidze (pronounced nish-nee-ah-NID-zuh), an attorney in Georgia. Finfer and Shea paid $10,000 for the adoption &#8212; half to Wide Horizons and half to Nishnianidze for his legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer and Shea traveled to Georgia to pick up their son, staying with Nishnianidze at his home. Finfer and Shea asked to meet the birth mother but Nishnianidze told her that he did not know how to locate her. The adoption was without incident. Nishnianidze provided the couple with Georgian legal documentation of the adoption, including a document in which Alexander's birth mother relinquished all parental rights. These documents were recognized by a Massachusetts court that finalized the adoption after Finfer, Shea, and Alexander returned home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Nishnianidze Contacts Parents</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in October, 1998, seeking permanent residency from the Legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service. Finfer and Shea heard nothing from Nishnianidze until January 26, 1999, when he called their home and spoke to Shea. He said he was in Boston and asked to see the family. Shea told Nishnianidze to call Finfer, who then invited Nishnianidze to their home for dinner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer picked up Nishnianidze in downtown Boston and drove him to the family's home in Dorchester. That evening, on the pretense of documenting a successful international adoption, Nishnianidze filmed the family with a video camera he brought. Intimating that the birth mother was having \"a rough time,\" he asked if the couple would provide financial support to the birth mother and her two children in Georgia. The couple refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the evening, Finfer drove Nishnianidze back to downtown Boston. During the car ride, Nishnianidze told Finfer that Alexander's birth mother was upset, might challenge the legality of the adoption, had made threats to Nishnianidze and Nishnianidze's family, and wanted $50,000 from Finfer and Shea. Finfer was upset by the conversation and told Nishnianidze it \"sounded like blackmail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer relayed the conversation to Shea. The couple contacted an attorney the next day and met with the FBI on January 28, 1999. At this meeting, Finfer and Shea agreed to record their subsequent conversations with Nishnianidze. They also received advice from the agents about how to gather information from Nishnianidze. After this initial meeting, Finfer and Shea occasionally spoke with a single FBI agent about their conversations with Nishnianidze and received suggestions as to how to handle the discussions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Telephone Calls</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of January 29, 1999, Nishnianidze called Shea at home, and she recorded the conversation. Nishnianidze began by describing recent events in Georgia, including opposition and challenges to international adoptions. He stated that Alexander's biological mother was upset the boy had been adopted by an American family and had threatened harm to Nishnianidze and Nishnianidze's son if Alexander was not returned. Nishnianidze stated that he came to the United States because of the threats, and that the birth-mother requested \"from me to take the child back.\" He told Shea that if she paid him $50,000 (to be given to the biological mother), the biological mother would guarantee not to pursue the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze stressed that he had been threatened and abused by Alexander's biological family, whom he described as \"hungry,\" \"homeless,\" and \"crazy people,\" who were connected to the Georgian police. Shea stated that it was \"[s]cary to think about ... people wanting Alexander back.\" Nishnianidze responded, \"[I]t's very hard for, for you, okay?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the end of the conversation, Nishnianidze told Shea that if the biological mother \"don't receive money I don't know what will be happened.\" He told Shea to \"be silence\" and \"not to make noisy.\" Nishnianidze advised her to borrow the $50,000 from a bank or from friends. The call ended when Shea told Nishnianidze she would discuss the matter with Finfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Nishnianidze called again and spoke to Finfer, who recorded the call. Nishnianidze repeated that the biological family wanted $50,000 and encouraged Finfer to promptly pay whatever he could. Nishnianidze first said that his family in Georgia was in danger, then stated \"maybe they will call you or come here I don't know what they can do.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer told Nishnianidze that he was worried and asked, \"Are you telling me that you're gonna take our child?\" Nishnianidze responded, \"Ah, I don't know what will be happen.\" Finfer concluded the call by telling Nishnianidze he would call him in New York the following week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 3, Nishnianidze left a message at the couple's home asking them to call him at his Brooklyn residence. Finfer returned the call. In this recorded conversation, Nishnianidze asked, \"What you decide?\" Finfer told him that they had decided not to pay. Nishnianidze responded, \"I think it would be ... worse for me and ah, also for your family.\" Nishnianidze told Finfer that the biological family knew Finfer and Shea's address and could send someone to the home. He continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They can take the child from yard or and they'll ah, request ah, twice more money. Or they can I don't know what they can do, everything they can do....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They can find ah, another people which can come not to make photos but to take child. And then you, you, you, you will, you will not ah, know what we do when it would be happen because they don't warn you....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They know address they will take ah, after one month, two months, five months, ah, one year I don't know, which time it would be happen.... [They told me to] warn them, that we will take the child ah, or something we will do it then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer stated he was concerned for his son's safety, and Nishnianidze again advised against going to the police or telling anyone about the situation. He stated, \"If you are afraid for [Alexander] and his life in this case you must do right for son; you must pay.\" Nishnianidze concluded by saying Finfer should call him within one week if he decided to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finfer called Nishnianidze the next day and stated that he was afraid for himself and his family and had decided to pay. Over the next two weeks, Finfer and Nishnianidze spoke five times regarding the exchange of money. They agreed to meet at Boston's South Station to exchange $38,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his final phone call on the evening of February 17, 1999, Nishnianidze told Finfer that he was sick and could not go to Boston to pick up the money. He said Finfer could send the money directly to the birth mother, but stated that he believed he could be arrested and did not want to touch the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. FBI Questioning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of April 6, 1999, two New York FBI agents and a New York City Police Department detective went to the Manhattan apartment where Nishnianidze was staying. FBI agents in Boston had requested that they locate Nishnianidze, interview him and obtain any photographs or videotapes in his possession of children whose adoptions he had processed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When they arrived at the apartment between 8:00 and 8:30 a.m., the agents knocked and identified themselves. Nishnianidze opened the door and they entered into a one-room apartment with a bed and two additional mattresses on the floor. Nishnianidze appeared to have been sleeping when he answered the door, and the agents observed Nishnianidze's son on a mattress on the floor where he had been sleeping and where he remained throughout the interview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents (including one Russian speaker) informed Nishnianidze that they were investigating his contacts with a Massachusetts family and interviewed him for thirty to forty-five minutes. Nishnianidze talked about his involvement in international adoptions and his contacts with Finfer and Shea, and then answered follow-up questions. The agents asked Nishnianidze if he had any photographs or videotapes of the adopted children. An agent accompanied Nishnianidze as he searched the apartment and produced the video of Alexander. The agents and detective were all armed, and while Nishnianidze searched for the video, the detective removed his snub-nosed handgun from its holster and held it behind his back, reholstering it when the search was complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the interview, Nishnianidze's roommate arrived at the apartment. The detective asked him to wait in the hallway while the interview was completed and he agreed to do so. After giving Nishnianidze a receipt for the videotape and a birth announcement relating to another adoption, the interview ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Arrest and Pre-trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze was arrested on May 17, 1999. He was charged with four counts: (1) transmitting an interstate threat with the intent of extorting $50,000 in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(b); (2) transmitting an interstate threat in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c); (3) traveling in interstate commerce to perform acts of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952; and (4) using an interstate facility to perform acts of extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Nishnianidze made a motion to suppress his April 6, 1999 statements to the FBI agents. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case at trial included the recorded telephone conversations between Nishnianidze and Shea and Finfer. Finfer and Shea testified about their conversations with Nishnianidze as well as their subjective fear that their son was in danger. An FBI agent described her interview of Nishnianidze in Manhattan, including his statement that he believed he was committing extortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze testified in his defense. He said he never intended to extort money, but was trying to make Finfer and Shea aware of the danger he was facing from Alexander's biological family in Georgia. Nishnianidze suggested that he wanted the couple to help him demonstrate fear of persecution so he could receive political asylum. Nishnianidze also stated that Finfer was playing \"games\" with Nishnianidze, and Nishnianidze simply joined the game, although he never actually intended a kidnapping.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Nishnianidze guilty on all four counts. He was sentenced to fifty-seven months imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay a special assessment of $400. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.

Among the factors to consider are \"whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene, the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect, and the duration and character of the interrogation.\" <i>United States v. Masse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487126\"><a href=\"/opinion/487126/united-states-v-stephen-o-masse/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 809 (1st Cir.1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering all the circumstances, we hold that the district court did not err in denying Nishnianidze's motion to suppress. Admittedly, there are some factors in favor of suppression, including the fact that the interview took place early in the morning and was administered by three agents in a small area. Additionally, Nishnianidze was never told he was free to leave. On the other hand, Nishnianidze was interviewed at the place where he was staying; he was therefore familiar with the surroundings. The interview was forty-five minutes or less &#8212; not exceptionally long. <i>Cf. Fern&#225;ndez-Ventura,</i> 132 F.3d at 848 (finding that the duration of the interrogation, on its own, is not a determinative factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents did not make physical contact with Nishnianidze or restrain his movement. At the hearing, Nishnianidze's son testified that he saw one of the detective's gun when it was briefly unholstered. However, there is no evidence that Nishnianidze saw the weapon or felt it restrained his movement in any way. Finally, Nishnianidze's son testified that Nishnianidze was told by the Russian-speaking agent that if he cooperated and agreed with the agents he would not be arrested. Nishnianidze asserts that he was confused and felt pressured to speak. This argument fails because the district court heard the son's testimony regarding the agent's behavior, and was in the best position to judge its credibility. The district court's factual finding that the son's story was implausible is not clearly erroneous. In all, there was not the \"restraint on movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest,\" and Nishnianidze's motion to suppress his statements was properly denied. <i>See Stansbury,</i> 511 U.S. at 322, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117843\"><a href=\"/opinion/117843/stansbury-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whiffen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197526\"><a href=\"/opinion/197526/united-states-v-whiffen/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>United States v.

A true threat is one that a reasonable recipient familiar with the context of the communication would find threatening. <i>Id.</i> For a conviction under &#167; 875(b), the government also had to prove that the threat was transmitted with the specific intent to extort money or a thing of value. <i>See United States v. Himelwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684352\"><a href=\"/opinion/684352/united-states-v-richard-c-himelwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 783 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could find that Nishnianidze transmitted a threat in interstate commerce with the intent of extorting money. The jury heard Nishnianidze's telephone conversations, specifically the interstate telephone call of February 3 in which Nishnianidze stated that not paying the money would be \"worse for me and ah, also for your family.\" He told Finfer that \"[t]hey can take the child from yard,\" and warned that Finfer could never be safe because \"they\" could act at any time in the future. Nishnianidze finished by saying, \"If you are afraid for [your son] and his life in this case you must do right for your son, you must pay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also considered the circumstances leading up to this conversation: Nishnianidze appeared in Boston out of the blue after nearly three years; went to the family's home and videotaped the child; and began a series of phone calls to the family discussing the danger posed by the biological family (who were referred to as \"crazy people\") and the need to pay $50,000 to avoid harm to either Nishnianidze's family or Alexander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze asserts that he was simply warning the family and cannot be convicted because he never threatened to personally kidnap Alexander. His argument fails. Nishnianidze told Finfer and Shea that the only way to ensure their son's safety was to pay him $50,000. Thus, Nishnianidze acknowledged that he alone could prevent harm from befalling Alexander. His statements in the final phone call that Finfer could send the money directly to the birth mother came after the threats had already been made. A jury could have found that Nishnianidze either controlled the biological family's actions or, more likely, that the story of the biological family was fabricated and the real danger was posed by Nishnianidze himself. There was ample evidence to support a finding that Nishnianidze's comments placed Finfer and Shea in immediate fear for their son's safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Criminal Conduct and Interstate Travel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict under the Travel Act, the government must show \"(1) interstate travel or the use of an interstate facility; (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity\" (here, violation of the Massachusetts extortion statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 25 (2003)); and (3) \"performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.\" <i>Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have found that Nishnianidze traveled from his home in Brooklyn, New York to Boston, Massachusetts in January 1999 and made interstate telephone calls in February 1999 intending to promote and facilitate extortion. Nishnianidze established contact with Finfer and Shea, came to their house and made a video of the family, and asked the couple for money for the biological mother. He continued to pressure the family after he returned to New York. There was ample evidence to support his conviction under the Travel Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Since no objection was made at trial, we review only for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). We evaluate the error in light of the record as a whole. <i>United States v.

A defendant may be convicted for making a threat if \"he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\" <i>Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d at 1491; <i>see also United States v.

While the fact-finder may consider other evidence, including the effect of the statement on the recipient, the ultimate standard is an objective one &#8212; whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be threatening. <i>Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d at 1491. Nishnianidze asserts that the judge improperly instructed the jury to consider the recipient's state of mind when determining whether a threat was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court first (incorrectly) stated that the threat was determined by the recipient's reaction, the instruction later clarified that the burden is on the government to show that a reasonable speaker would have understood the statement to be threatening.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We find no plain error in the district court's instruction. At most, the district court misspoke at the beginning of the instruction. The misdescription or omission of an element of a crime does not necessarily constitute plain error. <i>Neder v.

Finfer and Shea told Nishnianidze they were frightened and Nishnianidze acknowledged that it was hard for them to hear what he said. Nishnianidze told them that someone could take their child at any time and told them not to go to the police. A reasonable person who made these statements would understand them to be threatening. Any error in the instruction did not affect Nishnianidze's substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.

We think this is a prime example of the government simply giving a suspect the opportunity to commit a crime: the FBI did not design or initiate the plan, Finfer and Shea simply asked open-ended questions and Nishnianidze provided the incriminatory details. Nishnianidze mentioned the possible harm to Alexander and the need to pay $50,000 to ensure his safety. Finfer and Shea (as governmental agents) did nothing to pressure Nishnianidze &#8212; indeed, the most serious threats came when Finfer stated that they would not pay. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 815 (finding that defendant made a sufficient showing of government inducement where the government actor \"designed the plan, created the opportunity for defendant's participation, made the initial approach, solicited defendant forcefully, and displayed dogged insistence until [defendant] capitulated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to predisposition, we remove the government's improper inducement and \"ask how the defendant likely would have reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.\" <i>Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d at 962. Factors to consider in assessing whether the defendant was predisposed to commit to crime charged are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the Government; (3) whether the defendant was engaged in the criminal activity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense, which was overcome by the governmental persuasion; and (5) the nature of the inducement of persuasion offered by the Government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze has not shown a lack of predisposition. He initiated contact with Finfer and Shea, sought to profit from his threats, showed no reluctance to the crime (his hesitancy in collecting the money at the end came too late &#8212; the threats had already been communicated), and there was little, if any, inducement by the government. As Nishnianidze has not shown either government inducement or lack of predisposition, the district court's refusal to instruct the jury on an entrapment defense was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Pro Se Motions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pro se brief, Nishnianidze maintains that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. This claim requires resolution of factual issues, as appellant must demonstrate that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). We have held that \"fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1062 (1st Cir.1993). Nishnianidze's claim of ineffective counsel is therefore dismissed without prejudice to appellant's right to litigate the claim in an application for post-conviction relief. <i>See id.</i> at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nishnianidze also filed a pro se motion to dismiss based on the Vienna Convention, an issue raised for the first time on appeal. His argument is not developed and therefore waived. <i>United States v.
