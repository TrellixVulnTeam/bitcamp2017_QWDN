Rya W. Zobel,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          Walter H. Underhill, by Appointment of the Court, for\nappellant.\n          Samnang Am on brief pro se.\n          Lisa M. Asiaf, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            April 21, 2009\n\f               STAHL, Circuit Judge.       Defendant-appellant Samnang Am\n\nappeals both his conviction and sentence under the felon-in-\n\npossession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).          Am's primary argument\n\nis that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress\n\na firearm and ammunition seized incident to a Terry stop.1                 He\n\nadditionally claims that the court was in error when it found that\n\none of his prior convictions qualified as a predicate under the\n\nArmed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Finding\n\nno error, we affirm both the conviction and subsequent sentence.\n\n                                     I.\n\n               We relate the facts \"as the trial court found them,\n\nconsistent with record support.\"           United States v. Ruidíaz, 529\n\nF.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d\n\n26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003)).         On May 26, 2005, Sergeant Michael Vail\n\nand Officer Michael Kmiec of the Lynn Police Department were\n\npatrolling in a marked police cruiser a high-crime area of Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts, where there were frequent shootings and where the\n\nDepartment was conducting increased patrols as part of its ongoing\n\ngang       suppression   strategy.   At    approximately   7:00   p.m.,   the\n\nuniformed officers observed Am, who Vail recognized, walking alone\n\n\n\n       1\n       Am also seeks to suppress statements he allegedly made to\nthe officers during the stop. The district court found as fact\nthat the statements were not actually made and that, in the\nalternative, the statements were not subject to suppression because\nAm was not the subject of a custodial interrogation when the\nstatements were claimed to have been made.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdown Essex Street.   Am then on probation, a fact Vail knew, was on\n\nhis way to a mandatory anger management course, a term of his\n\nprobation.     Upon seeing Am, Vail turned the cruiser around and\n\nwithout using the take down lights or siren, pulled up behind Am.\n\n          Just minutes before the officers observed Am, Detective\n\nRobert Hogan of the Lynn Police Gang Unit had informed Vail that Am\n\nwas a suspect in a recent shooting. Vail had previously interacted\n\nwith Am roughly twenty to thirty times, the encounters varying in\n\nnature with twenty percent resulting in a pat-frisk. Although none\n\nof Vail's prior searches had yielded a weapon, Vail had interviewed\n\nAm in 2003 after Am was arrested with a rifle on his person, and\n\nVail knew that Am had been a suspect in several prior shootings.\n\nVail also was aware that Am was a leader of the Oriental Street\n\nBoys, a Massachusetts gang affiliate of the Los Angeles-based\n\nCrypts.      Further, Vail was familiar with Am's reputation for\n\ncarrying a weapon and knew that Am was prohibited from doing so by\n\nthe terms of his probation.    Importantly, Vail never before had\n\nseen Am walking alone and surmised that he would not do so, in\n\nrival gang territory, without being armed.2\n\n          After pulling approximately five to fifteen feet behind\n\nAm, both officers exited the vehicle.     Am did an \"about face,\"\n\n\n     2\n       Indeed, at the suppression hearing, Vail testified that he\nsaid to Kmiec, \"There’s no way he would be walking down Essex\nStreet without a gun on him,\" and Am conceded that during his\nprevious encounters with Vail, \"It's never me walking like this by\nmyself.\"\n\n                                -3-\n\fbegan walking toward the officers, and in a quick motion, put his\n\nright hand into his right-hand pants pocket.      Vail immediately\n\nordered Am to take his hand out of his pocket, and Am complied.3\n\nVail and Kmiec put Am against the hood of the police cruiser, pat-\n\nfrisked him, found a gun in his left front pocket, and then\n\narrested him.   Am filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from\n\nthe Terry stop on the basis that the stop was not supported by\n\nreasonable suspicion and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. After\n\nthe district court denied Am’s motion, Am filed a conditional\n\nguilty plea.\n\n          Prior to and during the sentencing hearing, Am objected\n\nto his Presentence Report which concluded that he was an armed\n\ncareer criminal because he had been convicted for a violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g) and because he had at least three prior convictions\n\nfor violent felonies. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4.\n\nSpecifically, Am argued that a 1997 juvenile conviction for assault\n\nwith a dangerous weapon, a knife, did not qualify as an ACCA\n\npredicate because the court documents from the 1997 conviction did\n\n\n     3\n       At the suppression hearing, the parties disputed whether Am\nmade certain statements, such as \"I'm strapped,\" after the officers\ntold him to take his hand out of his pocket. The district court\nheard testimony from Vail, Kmiec, and Am and examined both Kmiec's\npolice report, transcribed some hours after the incident had\noccurred, and Am's deposition, signed more than a year after the\nencounter. The court concluded that time had clouded the minds of\nthe parties and ultimately determined that the statements were not\nmade. For purposes of deciding whether the court properly admitted\nthe firearm and ammunition, it is not necessary to determine\nwhether the statements were or were not made.\n\n                                -4-\n\fnot make clear whether Am had pled guilty to assault by means of a\n\ndangerous weapon or, more specifically, to assault by means of a\n\ndangerous weapon, a knife.   The court rejected Am's argument and\n\nsentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment with three years of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n                               II.\n\nA. The Motion to Suppress\n\n          Am challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the\n\nevidence seized during the pat-frisk.      Am first argues that the\n\ndistrict court's denial was improper because the Lynn officers\n\nlacked reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop.       Terry v.\n\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1968).   Alternatively, he contends that\n\nthe officers exceeded the bounds of a permissible Terry stop,\n\nconstituting a de facto arrest in the absence of probable cause.\n\n          We review the district court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror and its legal conclusions de novo.    Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 28.\n\n\"A clear error exists only if, after considering all the evidence,\n\nwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\n\nbeen made.\"   United States v. Barnes, 506 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (quoting United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st\n\nCir. 1996)). This \"[d]eference to the district court's findings of\n\nfact reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the\n\ntestimony, observes the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\ffirst hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually\n\nhappened.\"   United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the\n\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\"\n\nU.S. Const., amend. IV.         Its primary purpose is to protect against\n\n\"arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials\n\nwith the privacy and personal security of individuals.\"               I.N.S. v.\n\nDelgado,   466   U.S.    210,    215   (1984)   (quoting   United    States    v.\n\nMartinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554 (1976)).\n\n           In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court counseled that \"a\n\npolice   officer   may     in    appropriate    circumstances       and   in   an\n\nappropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating\n\npossibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause\n\nto make an arrest.\"       392 U.S. at 21.        Thus, a police officer is\n\npermitted to make a brief investigatory stop of an individual if\n\nthe officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be\n\nafoot, United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002), and to\n\nfrisk an individual if the officer has reasonable suspicion that\n\nthe person is armed and dangerous, Terry, 392 U.S. at 27.                 See id.\n\nat 30 (permitting a limited search to discover weapons \"where a\n\npolice officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably\n\nto conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may\n\nbe afoot.\").     The so-called Terry stop \"lies somewhere between a\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fconsensual encounter and a full-blown custodial arrest,\"    United\n\nStates v. Harris, 218 Fed. Appx. 525, 527 (7th Cir. 2007), such\n\nthat reasonable suspicion \"requires more than a mere hunch but less\n\nthan probable cause,\" Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 29.\n\n          Under our \"familiar two-pronged inquiry,\" we evaluate\n\n\"whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and\n\nwhether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the\n\ncircumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\"\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 162 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting\n\nTerry, 329 U.S. at 20).    To satisfy the first prong, we decide\n\nwhether the police officer can \"point to specific and articulable\n\nfacts which, taken together with rational inferences from those\n\nfacts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\"       United States v.\n\nKimball, 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at\n\n21); see also Terry, 392 U.S. at 27 (\"[I]n determining whether the\n\nofficer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be\n\ngiven, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or\n\n'hunch,' but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is\n\nentitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\").   To\n\ndetermine whether a pat-frisk is justified under the second prong\n\nof our analysis, we consider the totality of the circumstances.\n\nUnited States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981); see United\n\nStates v. Bayless, 201 F.3d 116, 133 (2d Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he court\n\nmust evaluate those circumstances 'through the eyes of a reasonable\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fand cautious police officer on the scene, guided by his experience\n\nand training.'\") (quoting United States v. Oates, 560 F.2d 45, 61\n\n(2d Cir. 1977)).\n\n           We turn first to the inception of the Lynn officers' stop\n\nand note that even innocuous facts, which when taken alone may not\n\nbe \"sufficient to create reasonable suspicion[,] . . . may in\n\ncombination with other innocuous facts take on added significance.\"\n\nRuidíaz, 529 F.3d at 30 (citation omitted).         Here, the officers\n\narticulated six factors that led them to believe Am might be\n\nengaged   in   criminal   activity.     We   find   that   five   factors\n\narticulated by the officers, even excluding the tip from Hogan,\n\nwere sufficient to show that the officers possessed the reasonable\n\nsuspicion necessary to conduct a Terry stop of Am.\n\n           Among the factors taken into account by Vail and Kmiec\n\nwas Am's presence in a high-crime area.      While location on its own\n\nis insufficient to create reasonable suspicion, it \"is clearly a\n\nconsideration that a police officer may use to decide to make a\n\nTerry stop.\"   Kimball, 25 F.3d at 7; see also Illinois v. Wardlow,\n\n528 U.S. 119, 124 (2000) (\"[O]fficers are not required to ignore\n\nthe relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether\n\nthe circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further\n\ninvestigation. Accordingly, we have previously noted the fact that\n\nthe stop occurred in a 'high crime area' among the relevant\n\ncontextual considerations in a Terry analysis.\"); United States v.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fStroman, 500 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir. 2007).                 Am argues that location\n\nwas not a permissible consideration because the area in which he\n\nwas stopped had no connection with the type of criminal activity in\n\nwhich    he    was    engaged.      We      disagree    that   there    was   no   such\n\nconnection.         Given his familiarity with Am, Vail believed that it\n\nwas uncharacteristic for Am to walk unaccompanied in the area. The\n\nstop occurred in a location of known gang violence based on\n\nsuspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity related to his\n\ngang membership, namely carrying a weapon for protection from rival\n\ngangs.    Compare Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6-7 (holding that reasonable\n\nsuspicion existed to justify the inception of the search where the\n\nofficer       was    aware   of   the       defendant's   criminal      history,   the\n\ndefendant was spotted in a school parking lot, and the officer knew\n\nthat a number of schools had been burglarized in the area) with\n\nUnited States v. Monteiro, 447 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding\n\nsearch unconstitutional where a co-defendant's gang involvement and\n\nprior arrest were not linked to reliable information about the\n\npotential criminal activity which the officers were investigating).\n\n               The officers also were aware of and considered Am's known\n\ngang affiliation, past criminal conduct, proclivity to carry a\n\nfirearm, and probationary status.                  While any of these four factors\n\nstanding alone could well be insufficient to warrant a Terry stop,\n\nthe   combination        provided       a    reasonable    basis   to    conduct    an\n\ninvestigatory stop of Am.               See Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 30; United\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fStates v. Feliciano, 45 F.3d 1070, 1074 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"Knowledge\n\nof gang association and recent relevant criminal conduct, while of\n\ndoubtful evidentiary value in view of the strictures against\n\nproving guilt by association or by a predisposition based on past\n\ncriminal acts, is a permissible component of the articulable\n\nsuspicion required for a Terry stop.\"). Am concedes that Vail knew\n\nhe was on probation but contends that his previous convictions were\n\nirrelevant because none involved firearms.   However, we have noted\n\nthat officers can consider all prior criminal activity, including\n\ngang membership, in determining whether to initiate a Terry stop,\n\nKimball, 25 F.3d at 7.   Vail testified at the suppression hearing\n\nthat he was aware that Am had been arrested for a drive-by\n\nshooting.   Vail also had been the interviewing officer when Am was\n\narrested while possessing a .22 caliber rifle.   Therefore, we find\n\nthat the district court was correct in concluding that the factors\n\narticulated by the officers, taken together, demonstrated that when\n\nthey decided to approach Am, they reasonably believed that Am was\n\nengaged in criminal conduct.    See United States v. Hart, 334 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 5, 10 (D. Mass. 2003) (noting that there was reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop the defendant because of the officers' belief\n\nthat he would be carrying a weapon for protection and did not have\n\nthe requisite license to do so).4\n\n\n     4\n       In its opinion, the district court cited and discussed Hart\nat some length, comparing it to the operative facts in the present\ncase. Am, 2007 WL 465676 at *3-4. Am spends considerable time\n\n                               -10-\n\f             Finally, the officers testified that they considered\n\nDetective Hogan's tip to Vail that Am was a suspect in a recent\n\nshooting.      Am argues that this reliance was improper because\n\nHogan's tip was unsubstantiated.     Under the \"collective knowledge\"\n\nor \"pooled knowledge\" principle, \"reasonable suspicion can be\n\nimputed to the officer conducting a search if he acts in accordance\n\nwith   the    direction   of   another    officer   who   has   reasonable\n\nsuspicion.\"      Barnes, 506 F.3d at 62-63; see also Morelli v.\n\nWebster, 552 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2009); United States v. Cook,\n\n277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he knowledge of each officer\n\nshould be imputed to others jointly involved in executing the\n\nstop.\").     Thus, for example, Officer Kmiec was entitled to assume\n\nthat Sergeant Vail, who had far greater familiarity with Am, was\n\n\"acting in a manner consistent with [his] legal responsibilities.\"\n\nMorelli, 552 F.3d at 17.\n\n             The district court credited Vail with the information\n\nconveyed by Hogan -- Hogan, a gang specialist in the Lynn police\n\nforce, had interviewed an anonymous witness who believed Am was the\n\n\n\nhere objecting to the court's reliance on Hart and argues that the\ncourt instead should have found controlling United States v. Weaks,\n1995 WL 791944 (D. Mass. 1995), in which the court suppressed\nevidence seized in a taxicab stop and search after officers\nobserved the defendant cover his face. We find no fault with the\ndistrict court's reasoning. We agree with the government that the\ncourt discussed Hart to support one of the multiple factors upon\nwhich it relied in reaching its decision. Moreover, we concur with\nthe district court that the facts leading up to Am's search more\nclosely align with those in Hart than in Weaks.\n\n                                   -11-\n\ftriggerman in a recent shooting.             A tip to an officer must bear\n\nsufficient \"indicia of reliability.\"            Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S.\n\n143, 147 (1972).        If information is conveyed \"in the absence of a\n\nreasonable suspicion, then a stop in the objective reliance upon it\n\nviolates the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S.\n\n221, 232 (1985).       Compare Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 30-31 (finding stop\n\njustified where police relied in part on an anonymous telephone\n\ncall but the caller confirmed his phone number and agreed that the\n\nofficers could call him back) with Monteiro, 447 F.3d at 44-45\n\n(determining     that    police    unreasonably     relied    on    a    tip   by    an\n\nanonymous    relative     of   a   rival     rang   member    who       relayed     the\n\ninformation, noting hearsay and motive concerns). In its brief and\n\nat oral argument, the government failed to provide information\n\nregarding the source or reliability of Hogan's tip.5                Without more,\n\nwe refrain from passing judgment on the reasonableness of Hogan's\n\nreliance    on   the    witness    report.     Instead,      as    the   government\n\nsuggested at oral argument, we excise Hogan's information from our\n\nanalysis of the officers' decision to approach Am.6                     Nonetheless,\n\n\n     5\n       For example, we do not know the manner in which the witness\nprovided his information to Hogan, a consideration which has proven\nmaterial in prior cases. See, e.g., Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266,\n270 (2000) (unknown tipster called police from an unknown\nlocation); Adams, 407 U.S. at 146 (informant came forward to\nprovide the information); Taylor, 162 F.3d at 15 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(officer recognized informant's voice and knew informant, who\npreviously had provided accurate information, by name).\n     6\n      Indeed, on cross-examination, Vail stated, \"Regardless of my\nphone call with Detective Hogan, I would have spoke[n] with [Am].\"\n\n                                      -12-\n\fwe find that the other factors discussed -- the high-crime area;\n\nAm's criminal history, gang affiliation, probationary status, and\n\nproclivity to carry a weapon; and the unusual occurrence of Am\n\nwalking alone in a rival gang's territory -- were sufficient to\n\nestablish the reasonable suspicion required to initiate a Terry\n\nstop of Am.\n\n          We next review whether the search conducted by the\n\nofficers was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which\n\njustified the stop.   The district court properly noted that \"[t]he\n\nreasonable suspicion that permitted the police to stop Am does not\n\nautomatically give police the authority to frisk him attendant to\n\nthat search.\"   Am, 2007 WL 465676 at *4.    Instead, an officer's\n\n\"subsequent actions must be 'responsive to the emerging tableau -\n\nthe circumstances originally warranting the stop, informed by what\n\noccurred, and what the officer learned, as the stop progressed.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001)).   When the\n\nofficers exited their vehicle, they did not call for backup, and\n\nneither unholstered his weapon to suggest the stop would escalate\n\nto an arrest.   Cf. United States v. Smith, 423 F.3d 25, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).   Meanwhile, Am did an \"about face\" and thrust his hand\n\ninto his pocket. This action corroborated the officers' reasonable\n\nsuspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity and heightened\n\ntheir concern that he might be armed and dangerous, justifying the\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fofficers' decision to conduct a pat-frisk.7     Cf. United States v.\n\nAndrade, 551 F.3d 103, 112-13 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding that the\n\nofficer reasonably could have thought the defendant was concealing\n\na weapon because he had his hands in his pocket); United States v.\n\nAlston, 112 F.3d 32, 33 (1st Cir. 1997) (same).\n\n            The officers limited their search to the exterior of Am's\n\nclothing and felt an object in his left-hand pocket before reaching\n\ninto the pocket to retrieve the gun.       Compare United States v.\n\nRomain, 393 F.3d 63, 72 (1st. Cir 2004) (finding search reasonable\n\nwhere the officer began at the defendant’s waist and went no\n\nfurther than to extract the gun) with United States v. Casado, 303\n\nF.3d 440, 447 (2d Cir. 2002) (suppressing evidence where officer\n\nreached into defendant's pocket before conducting a pat-down).\n\nFurther, Am was stopped and questioned in a neutral setting, a\n\nstreet, the stop only lasted for five minutes before he was\n\narrested based upon probable cause, and the officers did not\n\nhandcuff Am until after their retrieval of the gun.      Cf. Taylor,\n\n162 F.3d at 21 (finding pat-frisk reasonable where ten to twelve\n\nofficers were at the scene and the detention lasted roughly thirty\n\nminutes).    In sum, we find the Terry stop and pat-frisk of Am\n\n\n\n     7\n       Am argues that the officers did not conduct a pat-frisk and\ninstead shoved their hands directly into his pockets. The district\ncourt found that a pat-frisk occurred, and we will not disturb this\nfactual finding.    See Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 32 (\"[C]redibility\njudgments are for the district court, not for the court of\nappeals.\").\n\n                                 -14-\n\fsupported by reasonable suspicion and properly responsive in scope\n\nto the circumstances surrounding the stop.8\n\nB. Sentencing\n\n           Am also objects to his sentence separately in a pro se\n\nbrief.    Citing the Supreme Court's recent decision in Begay v.\n\nUnited States, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (2008), Am mainly argues that his\n\nprior conviction for assault with a knife does not qualify as a\n\npredicate offense under ACCA because the statute under which he was\n\nconvicted, M.G.L. ch. 265, §15B, lacks an express element requiring\n\nforce.    We agree with the government that this contention fails\n\nregardless of the standard of review we employ.          By its terms, the\n\nMassachusetts statute at issue, which criminalizes \"an assault upon\n\nanother\" by \"means of a dangerous weapon,\" id., \"has as an element\n\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" as\n\nrequired by ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i).                See Commw. v.\n\nMelton, 436 Mass. 291, 295 (2002) (stating that the Massachusetts\n\nstatute   requires   the   state   to   prove   either   an   attempted   or\n\n\n\n     8\n       We thus disagree with Am's suggestion that the stop amounted\nto a de facto arrest. \"There is no scientifically precise formula\nthat enables courts to distinguish between investigatory stops,\nwhich can be justified by reasonable suspicion . . . and . . . 'de\nfacto arrests'\" which require probable cause. United States v.\nZapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994). While Am clearly was\nseized when the officers physically restrained him, \"[t]he\nappropriate legal determination to be made in this case is whether\nthe seizure exceeded the scope of a permissible Terry stop.\"\nUnited States v. Maguire, 359 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. 2004). Because\nwe have concluded that the stop did not exceed such bounds, we\nsimilarly find that no de facto arrest occurred.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fimmediately threatened battery perpetrated by means of a dangerous\n\nweapon); Commw. v. Gorassi, 432 Mass. 244, 248 (2000) (\"[A]n\n\nassault is defined as either an attempt to use physical force on\n\nanother, or as a threat of use of physical force.\").9\n\n                  Finally, we deal summarily with Am's claim, also made in\n\nhis pro se brief, that the district court failed to examine the\n\nmens        rea    requirement   of    the     predicate   offense.10      Under\n\nMassachusetts law, assault by means of a dangerous weapon is a\n\ngeneral       intent     crime   and   requires     either   intentional    and\n\nunjustified use of force upon another person or the \"intentional\n\ncommission of a wanton or reckless act . . . causing physical or\n\nbodily injury to another.\"             Cmmw. v. Ford, 424 Mass. 709, 711\n\n(1997) (quotation omitted).             Because the state, under either of\n\nthese two theories, had to show that Am acted intentionally, his\n\n\n\n       9\n       Am's reliance on Begay is misplaced. In Begay, the Court\ndetermined that a New Mexico felony conviction for driving under\nthe influence of alcohol did not qualify as a violent felony for\nACCA purposes because the crime was not \"purposeful, violent, and\naggressive\" and was not similar in kind to ACCA's example crimes of\n\"burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives.\" 128 S.Ct. at 1586. Am's conviction for assault with\na dangerous weapon, however, clearly satisfies the requirements of\nACCA.\n\n       10\n        The government urges us to treat the argument as waived,\nciting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), in\nwhich we refused to consider an argument because the defendant's\nlawyer presented the issue \"in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\nby some effort at developed argumentation.\" Because Am introduces\nthis issue pro se, we decline to require of him the same level of\nanalysis we would for trained legal counsel.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fconviction    for   assault   by   means   of   a   dangerous   weapon   thus\n\nconstituted a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of career offender\n\nstatus.     Cf. United States v. Zuniga-Soto, 527 F.3d 1110, 1113\n\n(10th Cir. 2008) (reversing district court's determination that the\n\ndefendant was a career offender because a prior offense did not\n\nqualify as a \"crime of violence\" where the state statute permitted\n\nconviction on recklessness grounds).\n\n                                    III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Am's conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Samnang Am appeals both his conviction and sentence under the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Am's primary argument is that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress a firearm and ammunition seized incident to a <i>Terry</i> stop.<sup>[1]</sup> He additionally claims that the court was in error when it found that one of his prior convictions qualified as a predicate under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Finding no error, we affirm both the conviction and subsequent sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We relate the facts \"as the trial court found them, consistent with record support.\" <i>United States v. Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003)). On May 26, 2005, Sergeant Michael Vail and Officer Michael Kmiec of the Lynn Police Department were patrolling in a marked police cruiser a high-crime area of Lynn, Massachusetts, where there were frequent shootings and where the Department was conducting increased patrols as part of its ongoing gang suppression strategy. At approximately 7:00 p.m., the uniformed officers observed Am, who Vail recognized, walking alone down Essex Street. Am then on probation, a fact Vail knew, was on his way to a mandatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> anger management course, a term of his probation. Upon seeing Am, Vail turned the cruiser around and without using the take down lights or siren, pulled up behind Am.</p>\n<p>Just minutes before the officers observed Am, Detective Robert Hogan of the Lynn Police Gang Unit had informed Vail that Am was a suspect in a recent shooting. Vail had previously interacted with Am roughly twenty to thirty times, the encounters varying in nature with twenty percent resulting in a pat-frisk. Although none of Vail's prior searches had yielded a weapon, Vail had interviewed Am in 2003 after Am was arrested with a rifle on his person, and Vail knew that Am had been a suspect in several prior shootings. Vail also was aware that Am was a leader of the Oriental Street Boys, a Massachusetts gang affiliate of the Los Angeles-based Crypts. Further, Vail was familiar with Am's reputation for carrying a weapon and knew that Am was prohibited from doing so by the terms of his probation. Importantly, Vail never before had seen Am walking alone and surmised that he would not do so, in rival gang territory, without being armed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>After pulling approximately five to fifteen feet behind Am, both officers exited the vehicle. Am did an \"about face,\" began walking toward the officers, and in a quick motion, put his right hand into his right-hand pants pocket. Vail immediately ordered Am to take his hand out of his pocket, and Am complied.<sup>[3]</sup> Vail and Kmiec put Am against the hood of the police cruiser, pat-frisked him, found a gun in his left front pocket, and then arrested him. Am filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from the <i>Terry</i> stop on the basis that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. After the district court denied Am's motion, Am filed a conditional guilty plea.</p>\n<p>Prior to and during the sentencing hearing, Am objected to his Presentence Report which concluded that he was an armed career criminal because he had been convicted for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and because he had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. Specifically, Am argued that a 1997 juvenile conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, a knife, did not qualify as an ACCA predicate because the court documents from the 1997 conviction did not make clear whether Am had pled guilty to assault by means of a dangerous weapon or, more specifically, to assault by means of a dangerous weapon, a knife. The court rejected Am's argument and sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment with three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>Am challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> pat-frisk. Am first argues that the district court's denial was improper because the Lynn officers lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Alternatively, he contends that the officers exceeded the bounds of a permissible <i>Terry</i> stop, constituting a de facto arrest in the absence of probable cause.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 28. \"A clear error exists only if, after considering all the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 506 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1996)). This \"[d]eference to the district court's findings of fact reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the testimony, observes the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.\" <i>United States v. Young,</i> 105 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const., amend. IV. Its primary purpose is to protect against \"arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.\" <i>I.N.S. v. Delgado,</i> 466 U.S. 210, 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984) (quoting <i>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Terry v. Ohio</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court counseled that \"a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\" 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868. Thus, a police officer is permitted to make a brief investigatory stop of an individual if the officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot, <i>United States v. Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002), and to frisk an individual if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous, <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868. <i>See id.</i> at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (permitting a limited search to discover weapons \"where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.\"). The so-called <i>Terry</i> stop \"lies somewhere between a consensual encounter and a full-blown custodial arrest,\" <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 218 Fed.Appx. 525, 527 (7th Cir.2007), such that reasonable suspicion \"requires more than a mere hunch but less than probable cause,\" <i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p>Under our \"familiar two-pronged inquiry,\" we evaluate \"whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868). To satisfy the first prong, we decide whether the police officer can \"point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\" <i>United States v. Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868); <i>see also </i><i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (\"[I]n determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or `hunch,' but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\"). To determine whether a pat-frisk is justified under the second prong of our analysis, we consider the totality of the circumstances. <i>United States v. Cortez,</i> 449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Bayless,</i> 201 F.3d 116, 133 (2d Cir.2000) (\"[T]he court must evaluate those circumstances `through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene, guided by his experience and training.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Oates,</i> 560 F.2d 45, 61 (2d Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p>We turn first to the inception of the Lynn officers' stop and note that even innocuous facts, which when taken alone may not be \"sufficient to create reasonable suspicion[,] ... may in combination with other innocuous facts take on added significance.\" <i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 30 (citation omitted). Here, the officers articulated six factors that led them to believe Am might be engaged in criminal activity. We find that five factors articulated by the officers, even excluding the tip from Hogan, were sufficient to show that the officers possessed the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop of Am.</p>\n<p>Among the factors taken into account by Vail and Kmiec was Am's presence in a high-crime area. While location on its own is insufficient to create reasonable suspicion, it \"is clearly a consideration that a police officer may use to decide to make a <i>Terry</i> stop.\" <i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 7; <i>see also </i><i>Illinois v. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (\"[O]fficers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation. Accordingly, we have previously noted the fact that the stop occurred in a `high crime area' among the relevant contextual considerations in a <i>Terry</i> analysis.\"); <i>United States v. Stroman,</i> 500 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir.2007). Am argues that location was not a permissible consideration because the area in which he was stopped had no connection with the type of criminal activity in which he was engaged. We disagree that there was no such connection. Given his familiarity with Am, Vail believed that it was uncharacteristic for Am to walk unaccompanied in the area. The stop occurred in a location of known gang violence based on suspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity related to his gang membership, namely carrying a weapon for protection from rival gangs. <i>Compare </i><i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 6-7 (holding that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the inception of the search where the officer was aware of the defendant's criminal history, the defendant was spotted in a school parking lot, and the officer knew that a number of schools had been burglarized in the area) <i>with </i><i>United States v. Monteiro,</i> 447 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2006) (finding search unconstitutional where a co-defendant's gang involvement and prior arrest were not linked to reliable information about the potential criminal activity which the officers were investigating). The officers also were aware of and considered Am's known gang affiliation, past criminal conduct, proclivity to carry a firearm, and probationary status. While any of these four factors standing alone could well be insufficient to warrant a <i>Terry</i> stop, the combination provided a reasonable basis to conduct an investigatory stop of Am. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Feliciano,</i> 45 F.3d 1070, 1074 (7th Cir.1995) (\"Knowledge of gang association <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> and recent relevant criminal conduct, while of doubtful evidentiary value in view of the strictures against proving guilt by association or by a predisposition based on past criminal acts, is a permissible component of the articulable suspicion required for a <i>Terry</i> stop.\"). Am concedes that Vail knew he was on probation but contends that his previous convictions were irrelevant because none involved firearms. However, we have noted that officers can consider all prior criminal activity, including gang membership, in determining whether to initiate a <i>Terry</i> stop, <i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 7. Vail testified at the suppression hearing that he was aware that Am had been arrested for a drive-by shooting. Vail also had been the interviewing officer when Am was arrested while possessing a.22 caliber rifle. Therefore, we find that the district court was correct in concluding that the factors articulated by the officers, taken together, demonstrated that when they decided to approach Am, they reasonably believed that Am was engaged in criminal conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hart,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d 5, 10 (D.Mass.2003) (noting that there was reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant because of the officers' belief that he would be carrying a weapon for protection and did not have the requisite license to do so).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, the officers testified that they considered Detective Hogan's tip to Vail that Am was a suspect in a recent shooting. Am argues that this reliance was improper because Hogan's tip was unsubstantiated. Under the \"collective knowledge\" or \"pooled knowledge\" principle, \"reasonable suspicion can be imputed to the officer conducting a search if he acts in accordance with the direction of another officer who has reasonable suspicion.\" <i>Barnes,</i> 506 F.3d at 62-63; <i>see also </i><i>Morelli v. Webster,</i> 552 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2009); <i>United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[T]he knowledge of each officer should be imputed to others jointly involved in executing the stop.\"). Thus, for example, Officer Kmiec was entitled to assume that Sergeant Vail, who had far greater familiarity with Am, was \"acting in a manner consistent with [his] legal responsibilities.\" <i>Morelli,</i> 552 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p>The district court credited Vail with the information conveyed by Hogan Hogan, a gang specialist in the Lynn police force, had interviewed an anonymous witness who believed Am was the triggerman in a recent shooting. A tip to an officer must bear sufficient \"indicia of reliability.\" <i>Adams v. Williams,</i> 407 U.S. 143, 147, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). If information is conveyed \"in the absence of a reasonable suspicion, then a stop in the objective reliance upon it violates the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>United States v. Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). <i>Compare </i><i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 30-31 (finding stop justified where police relied in part on an anonymous telephone call but the caller confirmed his phone number and agreed that the officers could call him back) <i>with </i><i>Monteiro,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> 447 F.3d at 44-45 (determining that police unreasonably relied on a tip by an anonymous relative of a rival rang member who relayed the information, noting hearsay and motive concerns). In its brief and at oral argument, the government failed to provide information regarding the source or reliability of Hogan's tip.<sup>[5]</sup> Without more, we refrain from passing judgment on the reasonableness of Hogan's reliance on the witness report. Instead, as the government suggested at oral argument, we excise Hogan's information from our analysis of the officers' decision to approach Am.<sup>[6]</sup> Nonetheless, we find that the other factors discussedthe high-crime area; Am's criminal history, gang affiliation, probationary status, and proclivity to carry a weapon; and the unusual occurrence of Am walking alone in a rival gang's territorywere sufficient to establish the reasonable suspicion required to initiate a <i>Terry</i> stop of Am.</p>\n<p>We next review whether the search conducted by the officers was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the stop. The district court properly noted that \"[t]he reasonable suspicion that permitted the police to stop Am does not automatically give police the authority to frisk him attendant to that search.\" <i>Am,</i> 2007 WL 465676 at *4. Instead, an officer's \"subsequent actions must be `responsive to the emerging tableauthe circumstances originally warranting the stop, informed by what occurred, and what the officer learned, as the stop progressed.'\" <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001)). When the officers exited their vehicle, they did not call for backup, and neither unholstered his weapon to suggest the stop would escalate to an arrest. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2005). Meanwhile, Am did an \"about face\" and thrust his hand into his pocket. This action corroborated the officers' reasonable suspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity and heightened their concern that he might be armed and dangerous, justifying the officers' decision to conduct a pat-frisk.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Andrade,</i> 551 F.3d 103, 112-13 (1st Cir.2008) (finding that the officer reasonably could have thought the defendant was concealing a weapon because he had his hands in his pocket); <i>United States v. Alston,</i> 112 F.3d 32, 33 (1st Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p>The officers limited their search to the exterior of Am's clothing and felt an object in his left-hand pocket before reaching into the pocket to retrieve the gun. <i>Compare </i><i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir.2004) (finding search reasonable where the officer began at the defendant's waist and went no further <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> than to extract the gun) <i>with </i><i>United States v. Casado,</i> 303 F.3d 440, 447 (2d Cir.2002) (suppressing evidence where officer reached into defendant's pocket before conducting a pat-down). Further, Am was stopped and questioned in a neutral setting, a street, the stop only lasted for five minutes before he was arrested based upon probable cause, and the officers did not handcuff Am until after their retrieval of the gun. <i>Cf. </i><i>Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d at 21 (finding pat-frisk reasonable where ten to twelve officers were at the scene and the detention lasted roughly thirty minutes). In sum, we find the <i>Terry</i> stop and pat-frisk of Am supported by reasonable suspicion and properly responsive in scope to the circumstances surrounding the stop.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Am also objects to his sentence separately in a pro se brief. Citing the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Begay v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), Am mainly argues that his prior conviction for assault with a knife does not qualify as a predicate offense under ACCA because the statute under which he was convicted, M.G.L. ch. 265, § 15B, lacks an express element requiring force. We agree with the government that this contention fails regardless of the standard of review we employ. By its terms, the Massachusetts statute at issue, which criminalizes \"an assault upon another\" by \"means of a dangerous weapon,\" <i>id.,</i> \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" as required by ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). <i>See Commw. v. Melton,</i> 436 Mass. 291, 295, 763 N.E.2d 1092 (2002) (stating that the Massachusetts statute requires the state to prove either an attempted or immediately threatened battery perpetrated by means of a dangerous weapon); <i>Commw. v. Gorassi,</i> 432 Mass. 244, 248, 733 N.E.2d 106 (2000) (\"[A]n assault is defined as either an attempt to use physical force on another, or as a threat of use of physical force.\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, we deal summarily with Am's claim, also made in his pro se brief, that the district court failed to examine the mens rea requirement of the predicate offense.<sup>[10]</sup> Under Massachusetts law, assault <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> by means of a dangerous weapon is a general intent crime and requires either intentional and unjustified use of force upon another person or the \"intentional commission of a wanton or reckless act ... causing physical or bodily injury to another.\" <i>Commw. v. Ford,</i> 424 Mass. 709, 711, 677 N.E.2d 1149 (1997) (quotation omitted). Because the state, under either of these two theories, had to show that Am acted intentionally, his conviction for assault by means of a dangerous weapon thus constituted a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of career offender status. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zuniga-Soto,</i> 527 F.3d 1110, 1113 (10th Cir.2008) (reversing district court's determination that the defendant was a career offender because a prior offense did not qualify as a \"crime of violence\" where the state statute permitted conviction on recklessness grounds).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Am's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Am also seeks to suppress statements he allegedly made to the officers during the stop. The district court found as fact that the statements were not actually made and that, in the alternative, the statements were not subject to suppression because Am was not the subject of a custodial interrogation when the statements were claimed to have been made.</p>\n<p>[2]  Indeed, at the suppression hearing, Vail testified that he said to Kmiec, \"There's no way he would be walking down Essex Street without a gun on him,\" and Am conceded that during his previous encounters with Vail, \"It's never me walking like this by myself.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  At the suppression hearing, the parties disputed whether Am made certain statements, such as \"I'm strapped,\" after the officers told him to take his hand out of his pocket. The district court heard testimony from Vail, Kmiec, and Am and examined both Kmiec's police report, transcribed some hours after the incident had occurred, and Am's deposition, signed more than a year after the encounter. The court concluded that time had clouded the minds of the parties and ultimately determined that the statements were not made. For purposes of deciding whether the court properly admitted the firearm and ammunition, it is not necessary to determine whether the statements were or were not made.</p>\n<p>[4]  In its opinion, the district court cited and discussed <i>Hart</i> at some length, comparing it to the operative facts in the present case. <i>Am,</i> 2007 WL 465676 at *3-4. Am spends considerable time here objecting to the court's reliance on <i>Hart</i> and argues that the court instead should have found controlling <i>United States v. Weaks,</i> 1995 WL 791944 (D.Mass.1995), in which the court suppressed evidence seized in a taxicab stop and search after officers observed the defendant cover his face. We find no fault with the district court's reasoning. We agree with the government that the court discussed <i>Hart</i> to support one of the multiple factors upon which it relied in reaching its decision. Moreover, we concur with the district court that the facts leading up to Am's search more closely align with those in <i>Hart</i> than in <i>Weaks.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  For example, we do not know the manner in which the witness provided his information to Hogan, a consideration which has proven material in prior cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (unknown tipster called police from an unknown location); <i>Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921 (informant came forward to provide the information); <i>Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d at 15 (1st Cir.1998) (officer recognized informant's voice and knew informant, who previously had provided accurate information, by name).</p>\n<p>[6]  Indeed, on cross-examination, Vail stated, \"Regardless of my phone call with Detective Hogan, I would have spoke[n] with [Am].\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Am argues that the officers did not conduct a pat-frisk and instead shoved their hands directly into his pockets. The district court found that a pat-frisk occurred, and we will not disturb this factual finding. <i>See </i><i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 32 (\"[C]redibility judgments are for the district court, not for the court of appeals.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  We thus disagree with Am's suggestion that the stop amounted to a de facto arrest. \"There is no scientifically precise formula that enables courts to distinguish between investigatory stops, which can be justified by reasonable suspicion ... and ... `de facto arrests'\" which require probable cause. <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994). While Am clearly was seized when the officers physically restrained him, \"[t]he appropriate legal determination to be made in this case is whether the seizure exceeded the scope of a permissible <i>Terry</i> stop.\" <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 359 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. 2004). Because we have concluded that the stop did not exceed such bounds, we similarly find that no de facto arrest occurred.</p>\n<p>[9]  Am's reliance on <i>Begay</i> is misplaced. In <i>Begay,</i> the Court determined that a New Mexico felony conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol did not qualify as a violent felony for ACCA purposes because the crime was not \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive\" and was not similar in kind to ACCA's example crimes of \"burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives.\" 128 S.Ct. at 1586. Am's conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, however, clearly satisfies the requirements of ACCA.</p>\n<p>[10]  The government urges us to treat the argument as waived, citing <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), in which we refused to consider an argument because the defendant's lawyer presented the issue \"in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation.\" Because Am introduces this issue pro se, we decline to require of him the same level of analysis we would for trained legal counsel.</p>\n\n</div>",

Am's primary argument is that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress a firearm and ammunition seized incident to a <i>Terry</i> stop.<sup>[1]</sup> He additionally claims that the court was in error when it found that one of his prior convictions qualified as a predicate under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Finding no error, we affirm both the conviction and subsequent sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We relate the facts \"as the trial court found them, consistent with record support.\" <i>United States v.

On May 26, 2005, Sergeant Michael Vail and Officer Michael Kmiec of the Lynn Police Department were patrolling in a marked police cruiser a high-crime area of Lynn, Massachusetts, where there were frequent shootings and where the Department was conducting increased patrols as part of its ongoing gang suppression strategy. At approximately 7:00 p.m., the uniformed officers observed Am, who Vail recognized, walking alone down Essex Street. Am then on probation, a fact Vail knew, was on his way to a mandatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> anger management course, a term of his probation. Upon seeing Am, Vail turned the cruiser around and without using the take down lights or siren, pulled up behind Am.</p>\n<p>Just minutes before the officers observed Am, Detective Robert Hogan of the Lynn Police Gang Unit had informed Vail that Am was a suspect in a recent shooting. Vail had previously interacted with Am roughly twenty to thirty times, the encounters varying in nature with twenty percent resulting in a pat-frisk. Although none of Vail's prior searches had yielded a weapon, Vail had interviewed Am in 2003 after Am was arrested with a rifle on his person, and Vail knew that Am had been a suspect in several prior shootings. Vail also was aware that Am was a leader of the Oriental Street Boys, a Massachusetts gang affiliate of the Los Angeles-based Crypts. Further, Vail was familiar with Am's reputation for carrying a weapon and knew that Am was prohibited from doing so by the terms of his probation. Importantly, Vail never before had seen Am walking alone and surmised that he would not do so, in rival gang territory, without being armed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>After pulling approximately five to fifteen feet behind Am, both officers exited the vehicle. Am did an \"about face,\" began walking toward the officers, and in a quick motion, put his right hand into his right-hand pants pocket. Vail immediately ordered Am to take his hand out of his pocket, and Am complied.<sup>[3]</sup> Vail and Kmiec put Am against the hood of the police cruiser, pat-frisked him, found a gun in his left front pocket, and then arrested him. Am filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from the <i>Terry</i> stop on the basis that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. After the district court denied Am's motion, Am filed a conditional guilty plea.</p>\n<p>Prior to and during the sentencing hearing, Am objected to his Presentence Report which concluded that he was an armed career criminal because he had been convicted for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and because he had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. Specifically, Am argued that a 1997 juvenile conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, a knife, did not qualify as an ACCA predicate because the court documents from the 1997 conviction did not make clear whether Am had pled guilty to assault by means of a dangerous weapon or, more specifically, to assault by means of a dangerous weapon, a knife. The court rejected Am's argument and sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment with three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>Am challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> pat-frisk. Am first argues that the district court's denial was improper because the Lynn officers lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct a <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>Terry v.

Here, the officers articulated six factors that led them to believe Am might be engaged in criminal activity.

Am argues that location was not a permissible consideration because the area in which he was stopped had no connection with the type of criminal activity in which he was engaged. We disagree that there was no such connection. Given his familiarity with Am, Vail believed that it was uncharacteristic for Am to walk unaccompanied in the area. The stop occurred in a location of known gang violence based on suspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity related to his gang membership, namely carrying a weapon for protection from rival gangs. <i>Compare </i><i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 6-7 (holding that reasonable suspicion existed to justify the inception of the search where the officer was aware of the defendant's criminal history, the defendant was spotted in a school parking lot, and the officer knew that a number of schools had been burglarized in the area) <i>with </i><i>United States v.

The officers also were aware of and considered Am's known gang affiliation, past criminal conduct, proclivity to carry a firearm, and probationary status. While any of these four factors standing alone could well be insufficient to warrant a <i>Terry</i> stop, the combination provided a reasonable basis to conduct an investigatory stop of Am. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v.

Am concedes that Vail knew he was on probation but contends that his previous convictions were irrelevant because none involved firearms. However, we have noted that officers can consider all prior criminal activity, including gang membership, in determining whether to initiate a <i>Terry</i> stop, <i>Kimball,</i> 25 F.3d at 7. Vail testified at the suppression hearing that he was aware that Am had been arrested for a drive-by shooting. Vail also had been the interviewing officer when Am was arrested while possessing a.22 caliber rifle. Therefore, we find that the district court was correct in concluding that the factors articulated by the officers, taken together, demonstrated that when they decided to approach Am, they reasonably believed that Am was engaged in criminal conduct. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Am argues that this reliance was improper because Hogan's tip was unsubstantiated.

In its brief and at oral argument, the government failed to provide information regarding the source or reliability of Hogan's tip.<sup>[5]</sup> Without more, we refrain from passing judgment on the reasonableness of Hogan's reliance on the witness report. Instead, as the government suggested at oral argument, we excise Hogan's information from our analysis of the officers' decision to approach Am.<sup>[6]</sup> Nonetheless, we find that the other factors discussedthe high-crime area; Am's criminal history, gang affiliation, probationary status, and proclivity to carry a weapon; and the unusual occurrence of Am walking alone in a rival gang's territorywere sufficient to establish the reasonable suspicion required to initiate a <i>Terry</i> stop of Am.</p>\n<p>We next review whether the search conducted by the officers was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the stop.

When the officers exited their vehicle, they did not call for backup, and neither unholstered his weapon to suggest the stop would escalate to an arrest. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

Meanwhile, Am did an \"about face\" and thrust his hand into his pocket. This action corroborated the officers' reasonable suspicion that Am was engaged in criminal activity and heightened their concern that he might be armed and dangerous, justifying the officers' decision to conduct a pat-frisk.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

Further, Am was stopped and questioned in a neutral setting, a street, the stop only lasted for five minutes before he was arrested based upon probable cause, and the officers did not handcuff Am until after their retrieval of the gun. <i>Cf. </i><i>Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d at 21 (finding pat-frisk reasonable where ten to twelve officers were at the scene and the detention lasted roughly thirty minutes). In sum, we find the <i>Terry</i> stop and pat-frisk of Am supported by reasonable suspicion and properly responsive in scope to the circumstances surrounding the stop.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Am also objects to his sentence separately in a pro se brief. Citing the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Begay v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145815\"><a href=\"/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1581</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145815\"><a href=\"/opinion/145815/begay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (2008), Am mainly argues that his prior conviction for assault with a knife does not qualify as a predicate offense under ACCA because the statute under which he was convicted, M.G.L. ch. 265, § 15B, lacks an express element requiring force. We agree with the government that this contention fails regardless of the standard of review we employ. By its terms, the Massachusetts statute at issue, which criminalizes \"an assault upon another\" by \"means of a dangerous weapon,\" <i>id.,</i> \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\" as required by ACCA, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). <i>See Commw. v. Melton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></span>, 295, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></span> (2002) (stating that the Massachusetts statute requires the state to prove either an attempted or immediately threatened battery perpetrated by means of a dangerous weapon); <i>Commw. v. Gorassi,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span>, 248, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span> (2000) (\"[A]n assault is defined as either an attempt to use physical force on another, or as a threat of use of physical force.\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, we deal summarily with Am's claim, also made in his pro se brief, that the district court failed to examine the mens rea requirement of the predicate offense.<sup>[10]</sup> Under Massachusetts law, assault <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> by means of a dangerous weapon is a general intent crime and requires either intentional and unjustified use of force upon another person or the \"intentional commission of a wanton or reckless act ... causing physical or bodily injury to another.\" <i>Commw. v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></span>, 711, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></span> (1997) (quotation omitted). Because the state, under either of these two theories, had to show that Am acted intentionally, his conviction for assault by means of a dangerous weapon thus constituted a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of career offender status. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zuniga-Soto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170791\"><a href=\"/opinion/170791/united-states-v-zuniga-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1113 (10th Cir.2008) (reversing district court's determination that the defendant was a career offender because a prior offense did not qualify as a \"crime of violence\" where the state statute permitted conviction on recklessness grounds).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Am's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Am also seeks to suppress statements he allegedly made to the officers during the stop. The district court found as fact that the statements were not actually made and that, in the alternative, the statements were not subject to suppression because Am was not the subject of a custodial interrogation when the statements were claimed to have been made.</p>\n<p>[2]  Indeed, at the suppression hearing, Vail testified that he said to Kmiec, \"There's no way he would be walking down Essex Street without a gun on him,\" and Am conceded that during his previous encounters with Vail, \"It's never me walking like this by myself.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  At the suppression hearing, the parties disputed whether Am made certain statements, such as \"I'm strapped,\" after the officers told him to take his hand out of his pocket. The district court heard testimony from Vail, Kmiec, and Am and examined both Kmiec's police report, transcribed some hours after the incident had occurred, and Am's deposition, signed more than a year after the encounter. The court concluded that time had clouded the minds of the parties and ultimately determined that the statements were not made. For purposes of deciding whether the court properly admitted the firearm and ammunition, it is not necessary to determine whether the statements were or were not made.</p>\n<p>[4]  In its opinion, the district court cited and discussed <i>Hart</i> at some length, comparing it to the operative facts in the present case. <i>Am,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">465676</span></span> at *3-4. Am spends considerable time here objecting to the court's reliance on <i>Hart</i> and argues that the court instead should have found controlling <i>United States v. Weaks,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">791944</span></span> (D.Mass.1995), in which the court suppressed evidence seized in a taxicab stop and search after officers observed the defendant cover his face. We find no fault with the district court's reasoning. We agree with the government that the court discussed <i>Hart</i> to support one of the multiple factors upon which it relied in reaching its decision. Moreover, we concur with the district court that the facts leading up to Am's search more closely align with those in <i>Hart</i> than in <i>Weaks.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  For example, we do not know the manner in which the witness provided his information to Hogan, a consideration which has proven material in prior cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 270, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (2000) (unknown tipster called police from an unknown location); <i>Adams,</i> 407 U.S. at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108571\"><a href=\"/opinion/108571/adams-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1921</span></a></span> (informant came forward to provide the information); <i>Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d at 15 (1st Cir.1998) (officer recognized informant's voice and knew informant, who previously had provided accurate information, by name).</p>\n<p>[6]  Indeed, on cross-examination, Vail stated, \"Regardless of my phone call with Detective Hogan, I would have spoke[n] with [Am].\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Am argues that the officers did not conduct a pat-frisk and instead shoved their hands directly into his pockets. The district court found that a pat-frisk occurred, and we will not disturb this factual finding. <i>See </i><i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 32 (\"[C]redibility judgments are for the district court, not for the court of appeals.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  We thus disagree with Am's suggestion that the stop amounted to a de facto arrest. \"There is no scientifically precise formula that enables courts to distinguish between investigatory stops, which can be justified by reasonable suspicion ... and ... `de facto arrests'\" which require probable cause. <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir. 1994). While Am clearly was seized when the officers physically restrained him, \"[t]he appropriate legal determination to be made in this case is whether the seizure exceeded the scope of a permissible <i>Terry</i> stop.\" <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201013\"><a href=\"/opinion/201013/united-states-v-maguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir. 2004). Because we have concluded that the stop did not exceed such bounds, we similarly find that no de facto arrest occurred.</p>\n<p>[9]  Am's reliance on <i>Begay</i> is misplaced. In <i>Begay,</i> the Court determined that a New Mexico felony conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol did not qualify as a violent felony for ACCA purposes because the crime was not \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive\" and was not similar in kind to ACCA's example crimes of \"burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives.\" 128 S.Ct. at 1586. Am's conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, however, clearly satisfies the requirements of ACCA.</p>\n<p>[10]  The government urges us to treat the argument as waived, citing <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), in which we refused to consider an argument because the defendant's lawyer presented the issue \"in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation.\" Because Am introduces this issue pro se, we decline to require of him the same level of analysis we would for trained legal counsel.</p>\n\n</div>",
