Petitioner Russell Horton, a\n\nMassachusetts state prisoner convicted of two first-degree murders,\n\nappeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus.   We affirm.\n\n                       I. Factual Background\n\n           In June 1998, a jury convicted Horton of committing two\n\nfirst-degree murders and an assault with the intent to murder.    We\n\nprovide a summary of the evidence introduced at Horton's trial.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Horton, 753 N.E.2d 119, 122-24 (Mass. 2001).\n\n          On May 25, 1994, the three victims, Carlos and Manuel\n\nAraujo and Kepler Desir drove together from Boston to Brockton,\n\nMassachusetts.   During the drive, Desir instructed Manuel to pick\n\nup Horton and Frederick Christian on Owens Street in Brockton.\n\nDesir knew these two men, but the Araujos did not.     Christian and\n\nHorton got into the back seat of the car with Carlos, and the five\n\nmen drove off together.\n\n           During the drive, Horton announced that he wanted to rob\n\nsome \"Dominican drug dealers\" and instructed Manuel to drive to a\n\ncertain location where he could carry out his plan.   Along the way,\n\nHorton exposed a gun and asked the others if they had weapons.\n\nThey claimed that they did not.   Upon arriving at the site,   Horton\n\nand Christian left the car but returned shortly, claiming that they\n\nwere unable to complete the robbery.       After reentering the car,\n\nHorton instructed Manuel to drive to a nearby parking lot.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f           In the parking lot, while staring out the window, Carlos\n\nwas shot in the head.   He immediately slumped forward, pretending\n\nto be dead.   After two more shots were fired, Carlos heard Horton\n\nsay, \"Go through their pockets.\" Carlos then sensed Christian move\n\nfrom his seat and heard him ask Horton, \"Did you do him?\"   Several\n\nminutes later, Christian and Horton departed the scene.\n\n           After laying still for a few more moments, Carlos saw the\n\nbodies of Manuel and Desir and ran to the nearest house for help.\n\nCarlos told the people in the house that \"Russell\" had shot him.\n\nLater, at the hospital, Carlos repeated that \"Russell\" had shot\n\nhim.\n\n           Barry Stephens lived near the parking lot where the\n\nmurders occurred and knew Horton and Christian.   He testified that\n\nHorton had sold drugs for Desir but, because of a recent falling\n\nout, Horton was no longer working for Desir.      He also testified\n\nthat, on the night of the murders, he had heard gun shots, and that\n\nfive minutes later, Horton and Christian had arrived at his house.\n\nAccording to Stephens, Horton \"was foaming at the mouth\" and\n\nlooking \"wild.\"   Horton told him that, \"[He] smoked him . . . [He]\n\nsmoked all three of them.\"   In particular, Horton said that he had\n\n\"smoked Quarter,\" which was Desir's nickname. Stephens told Horton\n\nand Christian to leave immediately.\n\n           At the time of the murders, Christian was in financial\n\ntrouble.   On the day of the shootings, Christian stated that he\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fneeded money and asked Desir for drugs on credit, a request which\n\nDesir refused.      Horton and Christian believed that Desir was\n\ncarrying a large amount of cash on the night of the murders because\n\nhe was planning to travel to New York later that night to buy\n\nseveral thousand dollars worth of drugs.\n\n           Horton   gave   inconsistent   statements   concerning   his\n\nwhereabouts on the night of the murders.     He first told the police\n\nthat he had met up with Christian, that they had gone for a walk\n\nwith another friend, and had gone home at approximately 11 p.m.\n\nAfter the police indicated that they intended to search the car for\n\nfingerprints and talk to Christian, Horton changed his story.        He\n\nstated that he and Christian were with Desir and two other men, and\n\nthat they had driven to Fuller Avenue, where he and Christian left\n\nto buy drugs.    He told the police that he expected Desir to return\n\nto pick him up, but Desir never did.\n\n                      II. Procedural Background\n\n           The trial court sentenced Horton to concurrent life terms\n\nof imprisonment for the murders and a 10-15 year term for the\n\nassault.   Horton subsequently filed a motion for new trial, see\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30, which was denied by the trial court.\n\nThereafter, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (SJC)\n\nrejected Horton's direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of\n\nhis new trial motion.      See Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 131.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            Horton then filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.    See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).         In his petition, Horton\n\nclaimed that (1) his right to a public trial was violated; (2) his\n\nright to confront witnesses was violated; (3) the jury instructions\n\nwere incorrect; and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective.                In an\n\nunpublished memorandum and order, the district court rejected the\n\npetition.    See Horton v. Maloney, No. 02-CV-10416-MEL, (D. Mass.\n\nFeb. 5, 2003).    Horton obtained certificates of appealability for\n\neach of the claims, except the jury instruction issue.                   See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2253.\n\n                             III. Discussion\n\n            Horton's appeal raises three claims.             First, he argues\n\nthat the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public\n\ntrial by holding the individual voir dire of potential jurors in an\n\nanteroom rather than the courtroom.          Second, he contends that the\n\ntrial   court   violated    his    Sixth    Amendment    right   to     confront\n\nwitnesses by admitting certain hearsay testimony.                     Third, he\n\nasserts that his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was\n\nviolated    because    defense    counsel   did   not   call   certain    alibi\n\nwitnesses and failed to interview certain potential character\n\nwitnesses.\n\n            Horton's    habeas    corpus    petition    is   governed    by   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).                   See 28\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 2244-2266.       Under the AEDPA, a federal court may grant a\n\nhabeas petition if it finds that the state court adjudication\n\n\"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\"               28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n             Under the \"contrary to\" prong of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1),\n\nthe petition may be granted if the state court \"arrives at a\n\nconclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a\n\nquestion of law or if the state court decides a case differently\n\nthan   [the     Supreme]     Court    has   on   a   set      of   materially\n\nindistinguishable facts.\"       Williams v. Taylor,     529 U.S. 362, 412-\n\n13 (2000). Under the \"unreasonable application\" prong of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1), the petition may be granted if the state court\n\n\"identifies    the   correct   governing    legal    principle     from   [the\n\nSupreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle\n\nto the facts of the prisoner's case.\"            Id. at 413.        To be an\n\nunreasonable    application    of    governing   law,   the   state   court's\n\ndetermination must not only be incorrect but also be objectively\n\nunreasonable.     Id. at 410-11.       In other words, if the petition\n\npresents a close call, it must be rejected, even if the state court\n\nwas wrong.    See Nom v. Spencer, 337 F.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIf, however, the petition presents a federal claim that was raised\n\nbefore the state court but was left unresolved, the AEDPA's strict\n\nstandards do not apply.        See Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 2001).            In such a circumstance, we review the claim de\n\nnovo.       See Norton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                 A.       Public Trial\n\n                 Horton and the prosecution jointly requested that the\n\ntrial court conduct an individual voir dire of prospective jurors\n\nto ask them about the effect that racial prejudice and pretrial\n\npublicity         could     have    on   their    ability   to   decide   the   case\n\nimpartially.1           Massachusetts law requires that an individual voir\n\ndire be conducted \"outside the presence of other persons about to\n\nbe called as jurors or already called.\"                 Mass. Gen. L. ch. 234, §\n\n28.         To   comply     with    this   statute,   the   court   conducted    the\n\nindividual voir dire in an anteroom, while the other potential\n\njurors waited in the courtroom.                    Horton and his counsel were\n\npresent for the entire proceeding, and Horton was able to aid his\n\ncounsel throughout.2           Defense counsel did not object to conducting\n\nthe individual voir dire in the anteroom.                   Accordingly, the SJC\n\nheld that the issue was not preserved for appellate review and\n\nconsidered it only for \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage\n\nof justice.\"            Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 127.          The SJC rejected the\n\nclaim because Horton did not suffer prejudice from the voir dire\n\nprocedure.            Id. at 128.\n\n\n\n      1\n            Horton is African American.\n        2\n       The judge, prosecutor, clerk, court reporter, and court\nofficer were also present.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f            Citing Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S.\n\n501 (1984), Horton argued in the district court that this voir dire\n\nprocedure violated his right to a public trial because the public\n\nwas excluded from attending the individual juror questioning.                 The\n\ndistrict court rejected this claim on procedural default grounds\n\nbecause defense counsel did not object at trial.\n\n            Generally, habeas review is precluded when a state court\n\nreaches its decision on an independent and adequate state law\n\nground.    See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729 (1991).                  A\n\nstate    court's   decision   to   find   a   forfeiture,       based    on   the\n\ndefendant's failure to object at trial, is an independent and\n\nadequate    ground   for   decision   so      long   as   the    state    court\n\nconsistently applies its contemporaneous objection rule and has not\n\nwaived it in the particular case by basing the decision on some\n\nother ground.      See Burks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).    That is the situation here.      The SJC consistently enforces\n\nthe rule that unpreserved claims are forfeited, see Gunter v.\n\nMaloney, 291 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002), and enforced the rule in\n\nthe instant case, see Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 127.                  The SJC did\n\nreview the claim for a \"substantial miscarriage of justice,\" id.,\n\nbut this sort of limited review does not work a waiver of the\n\ncontemporaneous objection requirement. See Gunter, 291 F.3d at 79-\n\n80; Dubois, 55 F.3d at 716 n.2; Tart v. Massachusetts, 949 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f490, 496 (1st Cir. 1991); Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1200 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).\n\n            Because the SJC resolved Horton's claim on state law\n\ngrounds,    the   habeas   court   may   consider   the    claim    if    Horton\n\nestablishes \"cause and prejudice\" with respect to the procedural\n\ndefault.3   See Dretke v. Haley, –- U.S. --, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 1851-52\n\n(2004); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750.         To satisfy the cause portion of\n\nthe test, Horton must show \"that some objective factor external to\n\nthe defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's\n\nprocedural rule.\"     Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).\n\nOne way to establish cause is to demonstrate that defense counsel's\n\ninaction    constituted    ineffective    assistance      of   counsel.     See\n\nColeman, 501 U.S. at 752; Carrier, 477 U.S. at 488;                Gunter, 291\n\nF.3d at 81.       Horton takes this tack in an effort to establish\n\ncause.\n\n            Under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984),\n\ncounsel's performance is ineffective only if it was objectively\n\nunreasonable under prevailing professional norms.4              To prevail on\n\n\n     3\n       A procedural default may also be excused if the defendant\nshows a fundamental miscarriage of justice, i.e., \"a constitutional\nviolation that has probably resulted in the conviction of one who\nis actually innocent.\" Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995)\n(internal quotations and citations omitted). Horton has made no\nsuch showing here.\n     4\n      Strickland also requires a demonstration of prejudice, i.e.,\n\"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n466 U.S. at 694. Citing Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 49-50 &\n\n                                    -9-\n\fhis claim, Horton must overcome the \"strong presumption that . . .\n\nthe challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\"\n\nTejeda     v.   Dubois,   142   F.3d   18,    22   (1st   Cir.   1998)    (quoting\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Horton contends that his counsel was\n\nineffective by failing to object to the voir dire procedure because\n\nthe   \"public    trial    right   of   a   criminal   defendant     was    clearly\n\nestablished by the time of trial.\"            The trial court rejected this\n\nclaim, finding that Horton's counsel welcomed the individual voir\n\ndire procedure because \"it was most conducive to eliciting candid\n\nresponses by the jurors on possible prejudice.\"                  The SJC agreed,\n\nnoting that \"the less public setting for the voir dire in all\n\nlikelihood helped rather than harmed [Horton].\"              Horton,753 N.E.2d\n\nat 128.5\n\n\nn.9 (1984), Horton argues that the prejudice prong of Strickland is\nautomatically satisfied because the denial of a public trial is a\nstructural error. Because, as discussed in the text, we resolve\nthe ineffective assistance claim on the performance prong of the\nanalysis, we do not decide if prejudice would be presumed in the\npresent circumstances.\n      5\n       Horton has not introduced competent evidence to challenge\nthe state court's finding that defense counsel welcomed the voir\nprocedure for strategic reasons.       See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1)\n(stating   that   in   habeas   proceeding   state   court   factual\ndeterminations are presumptively correct absent contrary showing by\nclear and convincing evidence).        The only arguably contrary\ninformation is an affidavit from Horton's habeas counsel containing\na summary of his conversations with defense counsel in which\ndefense counsel stated that he should have insisted that the\nindividual voir dire be conducted in public. This affidavit is\ninadequate to justify disregarding the state court's finding. Cf.\nUnited States v. Maguire, 600 F.2d 330, 332 (1st Cir. 1979)\n(holding that     affidavit   of   appellate   counsel   summarizing\nconversations with trial counsel in which trial counsel admitted\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          In some circumstances, defense counsel's interest in\n\nprotecting the accused's right to a completely public trial may\n\ngive way to other concerns, such as maximizing the accused's chance\n\nof obtaining a favorable jury composition.       For this reason, the\n\ndefendant may have an \"interest in protecting juror privacy in\n\norder to encourage honest answers to the voir dire questions.\"\n\nPress-Enterprise, 464 U.S. at 515 (Blackmun, J., concurring).       In\n\nparticular, defense counsel may wish to shield jurors from public\n\nquestioning when the objective is to identify possible racial\n\nbiases in the venire because the prospects of a potential juror\n\npublically admitting such bias are slim.       As one court noted, \"It\n\nis no doubt a difficult thing for any person to admit to any degree\n\nof racial bias, but to do so [publically] might well require what\n\nthe theologians used to call heroic virtue.\"         United States v.\n\nKing, 911 F.

Carolina Press Ass'n, 946 F.2d 1037,\n\n1043 (4th Cir. 1991) (\"[F]ear of publicity that might be given to\n\nanswers of venirepersons during voir dire may so inhibit or chill\n\ntruthful responses that an accused is denied the fair trial to\n\nwhich he is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment\"); United\n\nStates v.

Torres, 844\n\nA.2d 155, 158 (R.I. 2004), the strategic advantage that he received\n\nfrom the individual voir dire taking place in private cannot be\n\nignored.6      Defense       counsel's     decision     to    agree    to    a    closed\n\n\n      6\n       Arguably, Horton's public trial rights were not violated\nbecause he has not demonstrated that the trial court actually\nexcluded any members of the public from attending the juror\nquestioning.

Harris, 703 A.2d 441, 446 (Pa.\n1998) (rejecting public trial claim based on voir dire conducted in\nanteroom because \"no exclusionary order was entered and the record\ndoes not establish that the court prohibited the public from\n\n                                         -12-\n\findividual    voir    dire    was   an    objectively   reasonable    strategy\n\ndesigned to elicit forthcoming responses from the jurors about\n\nracial bias.     Accordingly, we cannot conclude that defense counsel\n\nwas ineffective in failing to object to the voir dire procedure.\n\nBecause Horton has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, he has not established cause for the procedural default.\n\nThe district court therefore correctly declined to reach the merits\n\nof the public trial claim.          See Dubois, 55 F.3d at 718.\n\n            B.       Confrontation Clause\n\n            Over     Horton's    objection,     the   trial   court   admitted\n\ntestimony from one Henry Garcia that, on the day of the murders,\n\nChristian had stated that he needed money and that Desir had\n\nrefused to give him drugs on credit.                  The SJC affirmed the\n\nadmission of this testimony under the state-of-mind exception to\n\nthe hearsay rule.         See Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 125. The SJC's\n\nanalysis was based exclusively on Massachusetts evidence law and\n\ndid   not   reference    Horton's    Confrontation      Clause   claim.   Id.\n\nBecause the SJC did not resolve the constitutional issue, we\n\nconsider it de novo.         See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.\n\n\n\nobserving the individualized voir dire\"). Moreover, there is no\nevidence that the trial court limited the availability of a\ntranscript of the individual voir dire proceeding. As the Press-\nEnterprise Court recognized, in at least some circumstances, \"the\nconstitutional values sought to be protected by holding open\nproceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the\nclosed proceeding available within a reasonable time.\" 464 U.S. at\n512.\n\n                                         -13-\n\f           After this appeal was briefed, the Supreme Court decided\n\nCrawford v. Washington, -- U.S. --, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), which\n\nchanged the legal landscape for determining whether the admission\n\nof certain hearsay statements violates the accused's right to\n\nconfront   witnesses.     In   Crawford,       the   Court    held    that   the\n\nConfrontation Clause bars the admission of testimonial hearsay\n\nunless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior\n\nopportunity to cross-examine the declarant.                Id. at 1374.      This\n\nholding abrogated, in part, the prior rule that the admission of\n\nhearsay did not violate the Confrontation Clause if the declarant\n\nwas unavailable and the statement fell under a \"firmly rooted\n\nhearsay exception\" or otherwise bore particularized guarantees of\n\ntrustworthiness.     Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980).\n\n           At oral argument, the parties disagreed over Crawford's\n\napplication to Horton's petition.     The debate is important because\n\n\"new   rules   of   criminal   procedure\"      do    not    apply    in   habeas\n\nproceedings unless they fall within either of two exceptions: (1)\n\nthe rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the\n\nstate to proscribe, or (2) the rule is a \"watershed rule\" of\n\ncriminal   procedure,   implicating      the   fundamental      fairness      and\n\naccuracy of the proceeding.     See Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 310-\n\n11 (1989); Curtis v. Duval, 124 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).                 While\n\nthe question of the retroactive effect of Crawford, if any, is an\n\nimportant one, we bypass the question here because, as explained\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbelow, Crawford does not apply to this case.                  See Campiti v.\n\nMatesanz, 333 F.3d 317, 321-22 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that court\n\nneed not resolve a Teague issue that was susceptible of resolution\n\non narrower or easier grounds).\n\n              Crawford draws a distinction between testimonial and\n\nnontestimonial hearsay and applies only to the former category of\n\nstatements.     See 124 S.Ct. at 1374.       As the Court explained, \"Where\n\nnontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with\n\nthe Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their\n\ndevelopment of hearsay law--as does Roberts, and as would an\n\napproach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause\n\nscrutiny altogether.\"         Id.    Thus, unless Christian's statements\n\nqualify as \"testimonial,\" Crawford is inapplicable and Roberts\n\ncontinues to apply.\n\n              The Crawford Court declined to provide a comprehensive\n\ndefinition of testimonial statements.           Id. at 1374 & n.10.     It did,\n\nhowever,   provide    three    \"formulations     of   [the]    core   class    of\n\ntestimonial statements.\"        Id. at 1364.     In the first, testimonial\n\nstatements     consist   of    \"ex   parte    in-court   testimony     or     its\n\nfunctional     equivalent--that      is,   material   such     as   affidavits,\n\ncustodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was\n\nunable   to    cross-examine    or    similar    pretrial     statements    that\n\ndeclarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.\"\n\nId.   The second formulation described testimonial statements as\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fconsisting      of   \"extrajudicial    statements         .    .   .    contained   in\n\nformalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions,\n\nprior testimony, or confessions.\" Id. (quoting White v. Illinois,\n\n502 U.S. 346, 365 (1992)).            Finally, the third explained that\n\ntestimonial statements are those \"made under circumstances which\n\nwould lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the\n\nstatement would be available for use at a later trial.\"                    Id.   While\n\nthe Court declined to settle on a single formulation, it noted\n\nthat, \"[w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies .\n\n. . to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand\n\njury, or at a former trial, and to police interrogations.                         These\n\nare the   modern      abuses   at   which    the   Confrontation          Clause    was\n\ndirected.\"      Id. at 1374.\n\n           In light of these formulations, Christian's statements do\n\nnot qualify as testimonial.            They were not ex-parte in-court\n\ntestimony or its equivalent; were not contained in formalized\n\ndocuments such as affidavits, depositions, or prior testimony\n\ntranscripts; and were not made as part of a confession resulting\n\nfrom custodial examination.          Rather, Christian's statements were\n\nmade   during    a   private   conversation        with       Garcia.      In    short,\n\nChristian did not make the statements under circumstances in which\n\nan objective person would \"reasonably believe that the statement\n\nwould be available for use at a later trial.\"                           Id. at 1364.\n\nBecause Christian's statements were nontestimonial, their admission\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fis outside of Crawford's scope.   See id. (\"an accuser who makes a\n\nformal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense\n\nthat a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does\n\nnot\"); United States v. Reyes, 362 F.3d 536, 540 n.4 (8th Cir.\n\n2004) (stating that Crawford does not apply to co-conspirator\n\nstatements because they are nontestimonial). Accordingly, we apply\n\nRoberts to determine whether the admission of Christian's hearsay\n\nstatements violated Horton's Confrontation Clause rights.\n\n          As discussed above, Roberts permits the admission of a\n\nhearsay statement of an unavailable declarant as long as the\n\nstatement \"falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\" or\n\notherwise bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.   See\n\nsupra at 13-14.     The relevant exception here is state-of-mind.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, the state-of-mind exception permits the\n\nadmission of statements that demonstrate the declarant's intent to\n\nperform some future act.     See P.J. Liacos et al., Handbook of\n\nMassachusetts Evidence, § 8.15 (7th ed. 1999)(citing cases).    The\n\nSJC determined that Christian's statements that he needed money and\n\nthat Desir would not give him drugs on credit suggested his intent\n\nto subsequently rob Desir, and the statements were admissible to\n\nshow this intent.   See Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 125.7\n\n\n     7\n       The statements were relevant because they provided an\nexplanation for Christian's conduct on the night of the murders\nwhen he was acting with Horton. Because the prosecution charged\nHorton with felony murder (based on the armed robbery of Desir),\nevidence suggesting that Horton's compatriot had a motive for\n\n                               -17-\n\f           The admission of Christian's statements comports with\n\nRoberts.   First, Christian was unavailable to testify because he\n\nwas also accused of the murders.             See Commonwealth v. Christian,\n\n722 N.E.2d 416 (Mass. 2000).         Second, the statements fall within a\n\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception for statements evidencing the\n\ndeclarant's state-of-mind.\n\n           A hearsay exception is firmly rooted if, \"in light of\n\nlongstanding judicial and legislative experience [the exception]\n\nrests on such a solid foundation that admission of virtually any\n\nevidence   within     it     comports     with     the    substance    of     the\n\nconstitutional protection.\"         Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 126\n\n(1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted).               The state-of-\n\nmind exception has been recognized by the Supreme Court and the SJC\n\nfor over a century.        See Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Hillman, 145 U.S.\n\n285,   295-96   (1892)     (admitting    letter     stating   that    declarant\n\nintended   to   travel     to   a   certain     destination   with    another);\n\nCommonwealth    v.   Trefethen,     31   N.E.    961,    964-65   (Mass.    1892)\n\n(admitting statement of declarant's intention to commit suicide).\n\nIndeed, \"the exception exists in every jurisdiction in the country,\n\nwhether by statute, court rule, or common law tradition,\" Hayes v.\n\nYork, 311 F.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir. 2002), and has been codified in\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, see Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).                      The\n\n\n\nrobbing Desir was relevant to proving the prosecution's theory of\nthe case.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fpremise for admitting hearsay statements evidencing state-of-mind\n\nis that such statements are reliable because of their \"spontaneity\n\nand [the] resulting probable sincerity.\"              McCormick on Evidence, §\n\n274 (5th ed. 1999).          Thus, the rationale for the state-of-mind\n\nexception    is    similar   to   the   rationale     for   the   other   hearsay\n\nexceptions    that    the    Supreme    Court   has    recognized   as    \"firmly\n\nrooted.\"     See Lilly, 527 U.S. at 127 (stating that firmly rooted\n\nexceptions are those that permit the admission of declarations\n\n\"made without motive to reflect on the legal consequences of one's\n\nstatements and in situations that are exceptionally conducive to\n\nveracity\").       Considering the state-of-mind exception's lineage and\n\npolicy origins, we agree with the many other courts that have\n\nrecognized it to be a firmly rooted hearsay exception.               See, e.g.,\n\nHayes, 311 F.3d at 326; Moore v. Reynolds, 153 F.3d 1086, 1107\n\n(10th Cir. 1998); Terrovona v. Kincheloe, 852 F.2d 424, 427 (9th\n\nCir. 1988); Barber v. Scully, 731 F.2d 1073, 1075 (2d Cir. 1984);\n\nLenza v. Wyrick, 665 F.2d 804, 811 (8th Cir. 1981); Frazier v.\n\nMitchell, 188 F. Supp. 2d 798, 813-14 (N.D. Ohio 2001); United\n\nStates v. Alfonso, 66 F. Supp. 2d 261, 267 (D.P.R. 1999); Reyes v.\n\nState, 819 A.2d 305, 313 (Del. 2003); People v. Waidla, 996 P.2d\n\n46, 67 n.8 (Cal. 2000); Wyatt v. State, 981 P.2d 109, 115 (Alaska\n\n1999); State v. Wood, 881 P.2d 1158, 1169 (Ariz. 1994).\n\n            To sum up, because Christian's hearsay statements were\n\nnontestimonial, we apply Roberts to decide the Confrontation Clause\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fissue. The admission of these statements satisfies Roberts because\n\nChristian was unavailable to testify, and the statements were\n\nadmitted    pursuant     to     a   firmly     rooted     hearsay      exception.\n\nAccordingly,     Horton's      Confrontation     Clause       rights   were   not\n\nviolated.\n\n            C.      Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            Finally, Horton claims that the SJC misapplied federal\n\nlaw in rejecting his ineffective assistance of counsel arguments\n\nbased on defense counsel's failure to call his family members as\n\nalibi witnesses and to interview his school teachers as possible\n\ncharacter witnesses. In assessing these arguments, the SJC applied\n\nits rule that \"on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in\n\na case of murder in the first degree, the defendant must show there\n\nwas an error in the trial and that the error likely influenced the\n\njury's decision.\"       Horton, 753 N.E.2d at 127 (citing Commonwealth\n\nv. Wright, 584 N.E.2d 621 (Mass. 1992)).          The Wright standard is at\n\nleast as generous to the defendant as the federal ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel standard.          See Mello v. DiPaulo, 295 F.3d\n\n137,   144-45    (1st   Cir.    2002).       Because    the   SJC   applied   the\n\nappropriate legal standard to Horton's claims, he can only succeed\n\nby demonstrating that the SJC unreasonably applied this standard to\n\nthe facts of his case.         See supra at 5-6.\n\n            The SJC rejected Horton's claims because it determined\n\nthat defense counsel had valid reasons for declining to call\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fHorton's family members and that Horton was not prejudiced by\n\ndefense counsel's failure to interview his teachers.                       See Horton,\n\n753 N.E.2d at 128-29.       Horton argued that his family members would\n\nhave established his alibi by testifying that he was home at 10\n\np.m., the time that the murders occurred.                      The SJC concluded,\n\nhowever, that had these witnesses been called they would have been\n\nopen to damaging impeachment.                Id. at 128.      Therefore, it was a\n\nreasonable     decision    not    to    call      them.      Id.    The      SJC   also\n\ndetermined that interviewing Horton's teachers would not have\n\nbenefitted the defense because there would have been testimony of\n\nan unflattering change in Horton's demeanor just prior to the\n\nmurders.   Id. at 128-29.\n\n           As    discussed       above,      to    succeed    on    his    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims, Horton must show that his counsel's\n\nperformance     was   deficient        and    that   the    deficient      performance\n\nprejudiced the defense.          See supra at 9-10; Phoenix v. Matesanz,\n\n233 F.3d 77, 81 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687).                      \"The habeas\n\ncourt   must    evaluate     the       challenged         conduct   from    counsel's\n\nperspective at the time . . . making every effort to eliminate the\n\ndistorting effects of hindsight.\"               Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d\n\n48, 51 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nIt must also start with the presumption that the challenged action\n\nwas sound trial strategy.          Phoenix, 233 F.3d at 82.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f              The SJC reasonably determined that defense counsel made\n\na sound decision in declining to call Horton's family members as\n\nalibi witnesses.           As we have explained,\n\n              The decision whether to call a particular\n              witness is almost always strategic,\n              requiring a balancing of the benefits and\n              risks of the anticipated testimony. The\n              witness may not testify as anticipated or\n              the witness's demeanor or character may\n              impress the jury unfavorably and taint the\n              jury's perception of the accused; or the\n              testimony, though sympathetic, may prompt\n              jurors to draw inferences unfavorable to\n              the accused.\n\nLema,    987        F.2d    at   54     (internal          citations     omitted).\n\n              Defense counsel interviewed the family members before\n\ndeciding that their testimony would not have helped Horton's case.\n\nThe proposed alibi testimony would have been open to impeachment\n\nbecause it was based primarily on vague assertions from Horton's\n\nfather   on    the     approximate      time     of    a    basketball    game.      More\n\nimportant,     the     proposed       testimony       would   have     conflicted    with\n\nHorton's own version of events (that he came home at 11 p.m.),\n\nleaving the jury with the option of rejecting the alibi witnesses's\n\ntestimony      or    rejecting    Horton's       own       story.      Considering    the\n\npossible danger to the defense from calling these witnesses, the\n\ndecision to bypass them reasonably could be viewed as legitimate\n\ntrial strategy.            See Phoenix, 233 F.3d at 82 n.2 (stating that\n\ntrial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance unless\n\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fcounsel's decision was \"so patently unreasonable that no competent\n\nattorney would have made it\").\n\n             The SJC was also reasonable in rejecting Horton's claim\n\nconcerning defense counsel's failure to interview his teachers.\n\nDespite being told by Horton's father that Horton's teachers could\n\nprovide positive character testimony, defense counsel failed to\n\nspeak with them. In some instances, the failure of defense counsel\n\nto interview witnesses can establish the deficient performance\n\nprong of the Strickland analysis.                See, e.g., Riley v. Payne, 352\n\nF.3d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir. 2003).                 But even assuming that defense\n\ncounsel's performance was deficient in this respect, the error\n\nwould not have prejudiced Horton's defense.\n\n             The    affidavits       summarizing      the    teachers'       expected\n\ntestimony are mixed. The teachers would have presented a generally\n\nfavorable view of Horton as a courteous person and a good student.\n\nBut   they   also    would    have       also    testified   that    Horton    seemed\n\ndistracted in the days leading to the murders.                In particular, one\n\nteacher would have testified that, because of Horton's changed\n\ndemeanor,    she    asked    him    if    \"anything    was   going    on,\"    and    he\n\nresponded that he \"was just taking care of business.\" Testimony of\n\na   noticeable     change    in    Horton's      demeanor,   just    prior    to    the\n\nmurders, likely would have damaged his case more than testimony\n\nabout his general good character would have helped.                    Considering\n\nthe limited positive impact (if any) that the character testimony\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fwould have had, the SJC reasonably concluded that defense counsel's\n\nfailure   to   interview   these   witnesses   likely   would   not   have\n\ninfluenced the trial outcome.      See Siers v. Weber, 259 F.3d 969,\n\n974-75 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming denial of habeas petition based\n\non ineffective assistance counsel due to counsel's failure to\n\ninterview witnesses where defendant failed to establish prejudice);\n\nUnited States v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, a jury convicted Horton of committing two first-degree murders and an assault with the intent to murder. We provide a summary of the evidence introduced at Horton's trial. <i>See Commonwealth v. Horton,</i> 434 Mass. 823, 753 N.E.2d 119, 122-24 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 25, 1994, the three victims, Carlos and Manuel Araujo and Kepler Desir drove together from Boston to Brockton, Massachusetts. During the drive, Desir instructed Manuel to pick up Horton and Frederick Christian on Owens Street in Brockton. Desir knew these two men, but the Araujos did not. Christian and Horton got into the back seat of the car with Carlos, and the five men drove off together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the drive, Horton announced that he wanted to rob some \"Dominican drug dealers\" and instructed Manuel to drive to a certain location where he could carry out his plan. Along the way, Horton exposed a gun and asked the others if they had weapons. They claimed that they did not. Upon arriving at the site, Horton and Christian left the car but returned shortly, claiming that they were unable to complete the robbery. After reentering the car, Horton instructed Manuel to drive to a nearby parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parking lot, while staring out the window, Carlos was shot in the head. He immediately slumped forward, pretending to be dead. After two more shots were fired, Carlos heard Horton say, \"Go through their pockets.\" Carlos then sensed Christian move from his seat and heard him ask Horton, \"Did you do him?\" Several minutes later, Christian and Horton departed the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After laying still for a few more moments, Carlos saw the bodies of Manuel and Desir and ran to the nearest house for help. Carlos told the people in the house that \"Russell\" had shot him. Later, at the hospital, Carlos repeated that \"Russell\" had shot him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barry Stephens lived near the parking lot where the murders occurred and knew Horton and Christian. He testified that Horton had sold drugs for Desir but, because of a recent falling out, Horton was no longer working for Desir. He also testified that, on the night of the murders, he had heard gun shots, and that five minutes later, Horton and Christian had arrived at his house. According to Stephens, Horton \"was foaming at the mouth\" and looking \"wild.\" Horton told him that, \"[He] smoked him ... [He] smoked all three of them.\" In particular, Horton said that he had \"smoked Quarter,\" which was Desir's nickname. Stephens told Horton and Christian to leave immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the murders, Christian was in financial trouble. On the day of the shootings, Christian stated that he needed money and asked Desir for drugs on credit, a request which Desir refused. Horton and Christian believed that Desir was carrying a large amount of cash on the night of the murders because he was planning to travel to New York later that night to buy several thousand dollars worth of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton gave inconsistent statements concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murders. He first told the police that he had met up with Christian, that they had gone for a walk with another friend, and had gone home at approximately 11 p.m. After the police indicated that they intended to search the car for fingerprints and talk to Christian, Horton changed his story. He stated that he and Christian were with Desir and two other men, and that they had driven to Fuller Avenue, where he and Christian left to buy drugs. He told the police that he expected Desir to return to pick him up, but Desir never did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sentenced Horton to concurrent life terms of imprisonment for the murders and a 10-15 year term for the assault. Horton subsequently filed a motion for new trial, <i>see</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30, which was denied by the trial court. Thereafter, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (SJC) rejected Horton's direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of his new trial motion. <i>See Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton then filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). In his petition, Horton claimed that (1) his right to a public trial was violated; (2) his right to confront witnesses was violated; (3) the jury instructions were incorrect; and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective. In an unpublished memorandum and order, the district court rejected the petition. <i>See Horton v. Maloney,</i> No. 02-CV-10416-MEL, (D.Mass. Feb. 5, 2003). Horton obtained certificates of appealability for each of the claims, except the jury instruction issue. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton's appeal raises three claims. First, he argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial by holding the individual voir dire of potential jurors in an anteroom rather than the courtroom. Second, he contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses by admitting certain hearsay testimony. Third, he asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated because defense counsel did not call certain alibi witnesses and failed to interview certain potential character witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton's habeas corpus petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244-2266. Under the AEDPA, a federal court may grant a habeas petition if it finds that the state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the \"contrary to\" prong of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), the petition may be granted if the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Under the \"unreasonable application\" prong of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), the petition may be granted if the state court \"identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. To be an unreasonable application of governing law, the state court's determination must not only be incorrect but also be objectively unreasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 410-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495. In other words, if the petition presents a close call, it must be rejected, even if the state court was wrong. <i>See Nom v. Spencer,</i> 337 F.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir.2003). If, however, the petition presents a federal claim that was raised before the state court but was left unresolved, the AEDPA's strict standards do not apply. <i>See Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2001). In such a circumstance, we review the claim <i>de novo. See Norton v. Spencer,</i> 351 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Public Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton and the prosecution jointly requested that the trial court conduct an individual voir dire of prospective jurors to ask them about the effect that racial prejudice and pretrial publicity could have on their ability to decide the case impartially.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Massachusetts law requires that an individual voir dire be conducted \"outside the presence of other persons about to be called as jurors or already called.\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 234, &#167; 28. To comply with this statute, the court conducted the individual voir dire in an anteroom, while the other potential jurors waited in the courtroom. Horton and his counsel were present for the entire proceeding, and Horton was able to aid his counsel throughout.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Defense counsel did not object to conducting the individual voir dire in the anteroom. Accordingly, the SJC held that the issue was not preserved for appellate review and considered it only for \"a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 127. The SJC rejected the claim because Horton did not suffer prejudice from the voir dire procedure. <i>Id.</i> at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing <i>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court,</i> 464 U.S. 501, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984), Horton argued in the district court that this voir dire procedure violated his right to a public trial because the public was excluded from attending the individual juror questioning. The district court rejected this claim on procedural default grounds because defense counsel did not object at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, habeas review is precluded when a state court reaches its decision on an independent and adequate state law ground. <i>See Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). A state court's decision to find a forfeiture, based on the defendant's failure to object at trial, is an independent and adequate ground for decision so long as the state court consistently applies its contemporaneous objection rule and has not waived it in the particular case by basing the decision on some other ground. <i>See Burks v. Dubois,</i> 55 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.1995). That is the situation here. The SJC consistently enforces the rule that unpreserved claims are forfeited, <i>see Gunter v. Maloney,</i> 291 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir.2002), and enforced the rule in the instant case, <i>see Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 127. The SJC did review the claim for a \"substantial miscarriage of justice,\" <i>id.,</i> but this sort of limited review does not work a waiver of the contemporaneous objection requirement. <i>See Gunter,</i> 291 F.3d at 79-80; <i>Dubois,</i> 55 F.3d at 716 n. 2; <i>Tart v. Massachusetts,</i> 949 F.2d 490, 496 (1st Cir.1991); <i>Puleio v. Vose,</i> 830 F.2d 1197, 1200 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the SJC resolved Horton's claim on state law grounds, the habeas court may consider the claim if Horton establishes \"cause and prejudice\" with respect to the procedural default.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Dretke v. Haley,</i> 541 U.S. 386, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 1851-52, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2004); <i>Coleman,</i> 501 U.S. at 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546. To satisfy the cause portion of the test, Horton must show \"that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\" <i>Murray v. Carrier,</i> 477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). One way to establish cause is to demonstrate that defense counsel's inaction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. <i>See Coleman,</i> 501 U.S. at 752, 111 S.Ct. 2546; <i>Carrier,</i> 477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639; <i>Gunter,</i> 291 F.3d at 81. Horton takes this tack in an effort to establish cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), counsel's performance is ineffective only if it was objectively unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> To prevail on his claim, Horton must overcome the \"strong presumption that ... the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\" <i>Tejeda v. Dubois,</i> 142 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Horton contends that his counsel was ineffective by failing to object to the voir dire procedure because the \"public trial right of a criminal defendant was clearly established by the time of trial.\" The trial court rejected this claim, finding that Horton's counsel welcomed the individual voir dire procedure because \"it was most conducive to eliciting candid responses by the jurors on possible prejudice.\" The SJC agreed, noting that \"the less public setting for the voir dire in all likelihood helped rather than harmed [Horton].\" <i>Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 128.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some circumstances, defense counsel's interest in protecting the accused's right to a completely public trial may give way to other concerns, such as maximizing the accused's chance of obtaining a favorable jury composition. For this reason, the defendant may have an \"interest in protecting juror privacy in order to encourage honest answers to the voir dire questions.\" <i>Press-Enterprise,</i> 464 U.S. at 515, 104 S.Ct. 819 (Blackmun, J., concurring). In particular, defense counsel may wish to shield jurors from public questioning when the objective is to identify possible racial biases in the venire because the prospects of a potential juror publically admitting such bias are slim. As one court noted, \"It is no doubt a difficult thing for any person to admit to any degree of racial bias, but to do so [publically] might well require what the theologians used to call heroic virtue.\" <i>United States v. King,</i> 911 F.Supp. 113, 117 (S.D.N.Y.1995), <i>aff'd</i> 140 F.3d 76 (2d Cir.1998); <i>see also In re S. Carolina Press Ass'n,</i> 946 F.2d 1037, 1043 (4th Cir.1991) (\"[F]ear of publicity that might be given to answers of venirepersons during voir dire may so inhibit or chill truthful responses that an accused is denied the fair trial to which he is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment\"); <i>United States v. Colabella,</i> 448 F.2d 1299, 1304 (2d Cir.1971) (\"It is too much to expect of human nature that a juror would volunteer in open court, before his fellow jurors, that he would be influenced in his verdict by a newspaper story of the trial. Not only so, but had one or more of them said they would be so influenced, and especially if they had then explained why, the damage to the defendant would have been spread to the listening other jurors.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted); <i>United States v. Koubriti,</i> 252 F.Supp.2d 424, 431 (E.D.Mich.2003) (\"The potential jurors will be more candid in their responses if they do not have to worry about what the public's opinion of those responses might be.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted); Kimba M. Wood, <i>Reexamining the Access Doctrine,</i> 69 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1105, 1119 (1996) (\"When jurors are reticent, the parties are denied the opportunity to probe meaningfully for bias. The more intimate setting of the robing room is far more conducive for probing bias.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Horton may have had a right to insist that the entire voir dire be conducted publically, <i>see State v. Torres,</i> 844 A.2d 155, 158 (R.I.2004), the strategic advantage that he received from the individual voir dire taking place in private cannot be ignored.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Defense counsel's decision to agree to a closed individual voir dire was an objectively reasonable strategy designed to elicit forthcoming responses from the jurors about racial bias. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the voir dire procedure. Because Horton has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not established cause for the procedural default. The district court therefore correctly declined to reach the merits of the public trial claim. <i>See Dubois,</i> 55 F.3d at 718.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Confrontation Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over Horton's objection, the trial court admitted testimony from one Henry Garcia that, on the day of the murders, Christian had stated that he needed money and that Desir had refused to give him drugs on credit. The SJC affirmed the admission of this testimony under the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule. <i>See Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 125. The SJC's analysis was based exclusively on Massachusetts evidence law and did not reference Horton's Confrontation Clause claim. <i>Id.</i> Because the SJC did not resolve the constitutional issue, we consider it <i>de novo. See Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this appeal was briefed, the Supreme Court decided <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), which changed the legal landscape for determining whether the admission of certain hearsay statements violates the accused's right to confront witnesses. In <i>Crawford,</i> the Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of <i>testimonial</i> hearsay unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. <i>Id.</i> at 1374. This holding abrogated, in part, the prior rule that the admission of hearsay did not violate the Confrontation Clause if the declarant was unavailable and the statement fell under a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\" or otherwise bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the parties disagreed over <i>Crawford</i>'s application to Horton's petition. The debate is important because \"new rules of criminal procedure\" do not apply in habeas proceedings unless they fall within either of two exceptions: (1) the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the state to proscribe, or (2) the rule is a \"watershed rule\" of criminal procedure, implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the proceeding. <i>See Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 310-11, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989); <i>Curtis v. Duval,</i> 124 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997). While the question of the retroactive effect of <i>Crawford,</i> if any, is an important one, we bypass the question here because, as explained below, <i>Crawford</i> does not apply to this case. <i>See Campiti v. Matesanz,</i> 333 F.3d 317, 321-22 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that court need not resolve a <i>Teague</i> issue that was susceptible of resolution on narrower or easier grounds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Crawford</i> draws a distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay and applies only to the former category of statements. <i>See</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1374. As the Court explained, \"Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law &#8212; as does <i>Roberts,</i> and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, unless Christian's statements qualify as \"testimonial,\" <i>Crawford</i> is inapplicable and <i>Roberts</i> continues to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Crawford</i> Court declined to provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial statements. <i>Id.</i> at 1374 &amp; n. 10. It did, however, provide three \"formulations of [the] core class of testimonial statements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1364. In the first, testimonial statements consist of \"ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent &#8212; that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.\" <i>Id.</i> The second formulation described testimonial statements as consisting of \"extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>White v. Illinois,</i> 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992)). Finally, the third explained that testimonial statements are those \"made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Id.</i> While the Court declined to settle on a single formulation, it noted that, \"[w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies... to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial, and to police interrogations. These are the modern abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1374.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these formulations, Christian's statements do not qualify as testimonial. They were not ex-parte in-court testimony or its equivalent; were not contained in formalized documents such as affidavits, depositions, or prior testimony transcripts; and were not made as part of a confession resulting from custodial examination. Rather, Christian's statements were made during a private conversation with Garcia. In short, Christian did not make the statements under circumstances in which an objective person would \"reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1364. Because Christian's statements were nontestimonial, their admission is outside of <i>Crawford</i>'s scope. <i>See id.</i> (\"an accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not\"); <i>United States v. Reyes,</i> 362 F.3d 536, 540 n. 4 (8th Cir.2004) (stating that <i>Crawford</i> does not apply to co-conspirator statements because they are nontestimonial). Accordingly, we apply <i>Roberts</i> to determine whether the admission of Christian's hearsay statements violated Horton's Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, <i>Roberts</i> permits the admission of a hearsay statement of an unavailable declarant as long as the statement \"falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\" or otherwise bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <i>See supra</i> at 83. The relevant exception here is state-of-mind. Under Massachusetts law, the state-of-mind exception permits the admission of statements that demonstrate the declarant's intent to perform some future act. <i>See</i> P.J. Liacos et al., <i>Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence,</i> &#167; 8.15 (7th ed.1999)(citing cases). The SJC determined that Christian's statements that he needed money and that Desir would not give him drugs on credit suggested his intent to subsequently rob Desir, and the statements were admissible to show this intent. <i>See Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 125.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admission of Christian's statements comports with <i>Roberts.</i> First, Christian was unavailable to testify because he was also accused of the murders. <i>See Commonwealth v. Christian,</i> 430 Mass. 552, 722 N.E.2d 416 (2000). Second, the statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception for statements evidencing the declarant's state-of-mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A hearsay exception is firmly rooted if, \"in light of longstanding judicial and legislative experience [the exception] rests on such a solid foundation that admission of virtually any evidence within it comports with the substance of the constitutional protection.\" <i>Lilly v. Virginia,</i> 527 U.S. 116, 126, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The state-of-mind exception has been recognized by the Supreme Court and the SJC for over a century. <i>See Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Hillmon,</i> 145 U.S. 285, 295-96, 12 S.Ct. 909, 36 L.Ed. 706 (1892) (admitting letter stating that declarant intended to travel to a certain destination with another); <i>Commonwealth v. Trefethen,</i> 157 Mass. 180, 31 N.E. 961, 964-65 (1892) (admitting statement of declarant's intention to commit suicide). Indeed, \"the exception exists in every jurisdiction in the country, whether by statute, court rule, or common law tradition,\" <i>Hayes v. York,</i> 311 F.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir.2002), and has been codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(3). The premise for admitting hearsay statements evidencing state-of-mind is that such statements are reliable because of their \"spontaneity and [the] resulting probable sincerity.\" <i>McCormick on Evidence,</i> &#167; 274 (5th ed.1999). Thus, the rationale for the state-of-mind exception is similar to the rationale for the other hearsay exceptions that the Supreme Court has recognized as \"firmly rooted.\" <i>See Lilly,</i> 527 U.S. at 127, 119 S.Ct. 1887 (stating that firmly rooted exceptions are those that permit the admission of declarations \"made without motive to reflect on the legal consequences of one's statements and in situations that are exceptionally conducive to veracity\"). Considering the state-of-mind exception's lineage and policy origins, we agree with the many other courts that have recognized it to be a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <i>See, e.g., Hayes,</i> 311 F.3d at 326; <i>Moore v. Reynolds,</i> 153 F.3d 1086, 1107 (10th Cir.1998); <i>Terrovona v. Kincheloe,</i> 852 F.2d 424, 427 (9th Cir.1988); <i>Barber v. Scully,</i> 731 F.2d 1073, 1075 (2d Cir.1984); <i>Lenza v. Wyrick,</i> 665 F.2d 804, 811 (8th Cir.1981); <i>Frazier v. Mitchell,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d 798, 813-14 (N.D.Ohio 2001); <i>United States v. Alfonso,</i> 66 F.Supp.2d 261, 267 (D.P.R.1999); <i>Reyes v. State,</i> 819 A.2d 305, 313 (Del.2003); <i>People v. Waidla,</i> 22 Cal.4th 690, 94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46, 67 n. 8 (2000); <i>Wyatt v. State,</i> 981 P.2d 109, 115 (Alaska 1999); <i>State v. Wood,</i> 180 Ariz. 53, 881 P.2d 1158, 1169 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, because Christian's hearsay statements were nontestimonial, we apply <i>Roberts</i> to decide the Confrontation Clause issue. The admission of these statements satisfies <i>Roberts</i> because Christian was unavailable to testify, and the statements were admitted pursuant to a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Accordingly, Horton's Confrontation Clause rights were not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Horton claims that the SJC misapplied federal law in rejecting his ineffective assistance of counsel arguments based on defense counsel's failure to call his family members as alibi witnesses and to interview his school teachers as possible character witnesses. In assessing these arguments, the SJC applied its rule that \"on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case of murder in the first degree, the defendant must show there was an error in the trial and that the error likely influenced the jury's decision.\" <i>Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 127 (citing <i>Commonwealth v. Wright,</i> 411 Mass. 678, 584 N.E.2d 621 (1992)). The <i>Wright</i> standard is at least as generous to the defendant as the federal ineffective assistance of counsel standard. <i>See Mello v. DiPaulo,</i> 295 F.3d 137, 144-45 (1st Cir.2002). Because the SJC applied the appropriate legal standard to Horton's claims, he can only succeed by demonstrating that the SJC unreasonably applied this standard to the facts of his case. <i>See supra</i> at 79-80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC rejected Horton's claims because it determined that defense counsel had valid reasons for declining to call Horton's family members and that Horton was not prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to interview his teachers. <i>See Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 128-29. Horton argued that his family members would have established his alibi by testifying that he was home at 10 p.m., the time that the murders occurred. The SJC concluded, however, that had these witnesses been called they would have been open to damaging impeachment. <i>Id.</i> at 128. Therefore, it was a reasonable decision not to call them. <i>Id.</i> The SJC also determined that interviewing Horton's teachers would not have benefitted the defense because there would have been testimony of an unflattering change in Horton's demeanor just prior to the murders. <i>Id.</i> at 128-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, to succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Horton must show that his counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <i>See supra</i> at 81; <i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 233 F.3d 77, 81 (citing <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052). \"The habeas court must evaluate the challenged conduct from counsel's perspective at the time ... making every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.\" <i>Lema v. United States,</i> 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1993) (internal citations and quotations omitted). It must also start with the presumption that the challenged action was sound trial strategy. <i>Phoenix,</i> 233 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC reasonably determined that defense counsel made a sound decision in declining to call Horton's family members as alibi witnesses. As we have explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision whether to call a particular witness is almost always strategic, requiring a balancing of the benefits and risks of the anticipated testimony. The witness may not testify as anticipated or the witness's demeanor or character may impress the jury unfavorably and taint the jury's perception of the accused; or the testimony, though sympathetic, may prompt jurors to draw inferences unfavorable to the accused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lema,</i> 987 F.2d at 54 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel interviewed the family members before deciding that their testimony would not have helped Horton's case. The proposed alibi testimony would have been open to impeachment because it was based primarily on vague assertions from Horton's father on the approximate time of a basketball game. More important, the proposed testimony would have conflicted with Horton's own version of events (that he came home at 11 p.m.), leaving the jury with the option of rejecting the alibi witnesses's testimony or rejecting Horton's own story. Considering the possible danger to the defense from calling these witnesses, the decision to bypass them reasonably could be viewed as legitimate trial strategy. <i>See Phoenix,</i> 233 F.3d at 82 n. 2 (stating that trial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance unless counsel's decision was \"so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC was also reasonable in rejecting Horton's claim concerning defense counsel's failure to interview his teachers. Despite being told by Horton's father that Horton's teachers could provide positive character testimony, defense counsel failed to speak with them. In some instances, the failure of defense counsel to interview witnesses can establish the deficient performance prong of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis. <i>See, e.g., Riley v. Payne,</i> 352 F.3d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir.2003). But even assuming that defense counsel's performance was deficient in this respect, the error would not have prejudiced Horton's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavits summarizing the teachers' expected testimony are mixed. The teachers would have presented a generally favorable view of Horton as a courteous person and a good student. But they also would have also testified that Horton seemed distracted in the days leading to the murders. In particular, one teacher would have testified that, because of Horton's changed demeanor, she asked him if \"anything was going on,\" and he responded that he \"was just taking care of business.\" Testimony of a noticeable change in Horton's demeanor, just prior to the murders, likely would have damaged his case more than testimony about his general good character would have helped. Considering the limited positive impact (if any) that the character testimony would have had, the SJC reasonably concluded that defense counsel's failure to interview these witnesses likely would not have influenced the trial outcome. <i>See Siers v. Weber,</i> 259 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir.2001) (affirming denial of habeas petition based on ineffective assistance counsel due to counsel's failure to interview witnesses where defendant failed to establish prejudice); <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 216 F.3d 1126, 1131 (D.C.Cir.2000) (similar); <i>Clabourne v. Lewis,</i> 64 F.3d 1373, 1382 (9th Cir.1995) (similar); <i>Galowski v.

Georgia,</i> 467 U.S. 39, 49-50 &amp; n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984), Horton argues that the prejudice prong of <i>Strickland</i> is automatically satisfied because the denial of a public trial is a structural error. Because, as discussed in the text, we resolve the ineffective assistance claim on the performance prong of the analysis, we do not decide if prejudice would be presumed in the present circumstances.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Horton has not introduced competent evidence to challenge the state court's finding that defense counsel welcomed the voir procedure for strategic reasons<i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1) (stating that in habeas proceeding state court factual determinations are presumptively correct absent contrary showing by clear and convincing evidence). The only arguably contrary information is an affidavit from Horton's habeas counsel containing a summary of his conversations with defense counsel in which defense counsel stated that he should have insisted that the individual voir dire be conducted in public. This affidavit is inadequate to justify disregarding the state court's finding. <i>Cf. United States v.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the trial court limited the availability of a transcript of the individual voir dire proceeding.

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, a jury convicted Horton of committing two first-degree murders and an assault with the intent to murder. We provide a summary of the evidence introduced at Horton's trial. <i>See Commonwealth v. Horton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span>, 122-24 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 25, 1994, the three victims, Carlos and Manuel Araujo and Kepler Desir drove together from Boston to Brockton, Massachusetts. During the drive, Desir instructed Manuel to pick up Horton and Frederick Christian on Owens Street in Brockton. Desir knew these two men, but the Araujos did not. Christian and Horton got into the back seat of the car with Carlos, and the five men drove off together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the drive, Horton announced that he wanted to rob some \"Dominican drug dealers\" and instructed Manuel to drive to a certain location where he could carry out his plan. Along the way, Horton exposed a gun and asked the others if they had weapons. They claimed that they did not. Upon arriving at the site, Horton and Christian left the car but returned shortly, claiming that they were unable to complete the robbery. After reentering the car, Horton instructed Manuel to drive to a nearby parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parking lot, while staring out the window, Carlos was shot in the head. He immediately slumped forward, pretending to be dead. After two more shots were fired, Carlos heard Horton say, \"Go through their pockets.\" Carlos then sensed Christian move from his seat and heard him ask Horton, \"Did you do him?\" Several minutes later, Christian and Horton departed the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After laying still for a few more moments, Carlos saw the bodies of Manuel and Desir and ran to the nearest house for help. Carlos told the people in the house that \"Russell\" had shot him. Later, at the hospital, Carlos repeated that \"Russell\" had shot him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barry Stephens lived near the parking lot where the murders occurred and knew Horton and Christian. He testified that Horton had sold drugs for Desir but, because of a recent falling out, Horton was no longer working for Desir. He also testified that, on the night of the murders, he had heard gun shots, and that five minutes later, Horton and Christian had arrived at his house. According to Stephens, Horton \"was foaming at the mouth\" and looking \"wild.\" Horton told him that, \"[He] smoked him ... [He] smoked all three of them.\" In particular, Horton said that he had \"smoked Quarter,\" which was Desir's nickname. Stephens told Horton and Christian to leave immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the murders, Christian was in financial trouble. On the day of the shootings, Christian stated that he needed money and asked Desir for drugs on credit, a request which Desir refused. Horton and Christian believed that Desir was carrying a large amount of cash on the night of the murders because he was planning to travel to New York later that night to buy several thousand dollars worth of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton gave inconsistent statements concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murders. He first told the police that he had met up with Christian, that they had gone for a walk with another friend, and had gone home at approximately 11 p.m. After the police indicated that they intended to search the car for fingerprints and talk to Christian, Horton changed his story. He stated that he and Christian were with Desir and two other men, and that they had driven to Fuller Avenue, where he and Christian left to buy drugs. He told the police that he expected Desir to return to pick him up, but Desir never did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sentenced Horton to concurrent life terms of imprisonment for the murders and a 10-15 year term for the assault. Horton subsequently filed a motion for new trial, <i>see</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30, which was denied by the trial court. Thereafter, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (SJC) rejected Horton's direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of his new trial motion. <i>See Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton then filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). In his petition, Horton claimed that (1) his right to a public trial was violated; (2) his right to confront witnesses was violated; (3) the jury instructions were incorrect; and (4) his trial counsel was ineffective. In an unpublished memorandum and order, the district court rejected the petition. <i>See Horton v. Maloney,</i> No. 02-CV-10416-MEL, (D.Mass. Feb. 5, 2003). Horton obtained certificates of appealability for each of the claims, except the jury instruction issue. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton's appeal raises three claims. First, he argues that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial by holding the individual voir dire of potential jurors in an anteroom rather than the courtroom. Second, he contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses by admitting certain hearsay testimony. Third, he asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated because defense counsel did not call certain alibi witnesses and failed to interview certain potential character witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horton's habeas corpus petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2244-2266. Under the AEDPA, a federal court may grant a habeas petition if it finds that the state court adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the \"contrary to\" prong of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), the petition may be granted if the state court \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v.

In assessing these arguments, the SJC applied its rule that \"on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case of murder in the first degree, the defendant must show there was an error in the trial and that the error likely influenced the jury's decision.\" <i>Horton,</i> 753 N.E.2d at 127 (citing <i>Commonwealth v.

Horton argued that his family members would have established his alibi by testifying that he was home at 10 p.m., the time that the murders occurred. The SJC concluded, however, that had these witnesses been called they would have been open to damaging impeachment. <i>Id.</i> at 128. Therefore, it was a reasonable decision not to call them. <i>Id.</i> The SJC also determined that interviewing Horton's teachers would not have benefitted the defense because there would have been testimony of an unflattering change in Horton's demeanor just prior to the murders. <i>Id.</i> at 128-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, to succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Horton must show that his counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <i>See supra</i> at 81; <i>Phoenix v.

The proposed alibi testimony would have been open to impeachment because it was based primarily on vague assertions from Horton's father on the approximate time of a basketball game. More important, the proposed testimony would have conflicted with Horton's own version of events (that he came home at 11 p.m.), leaving the jury with the option of rejecting the alibi witnesses's testimony or rejecting Horton's own story. Considering the possible danger to the defense from calling these witnesses, the decision to bypass them reasonably could be viewed as legitimate trial strategy. <i>See Phoenix,</i> 233 F.3d at 82 n. 2 (stating that trial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance unless counsel's decision was \"so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC was also reasonable in rejecting Horton's claim concerning defense counsel's failure to interview his teachers. Despite being told by Horton's father that Horton's teachers could provide positive character testimony, defense counsel failed to speak with them. In some instances, the failure of defense counsel to interview witnesses can establish the deficient performance prong of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis. <i>See, e.g., Riley v.

The teachers would have presented a generally favorable view of Horton as a courteous person and a good student. But they also would have also testified that Horton seemed distracted in the days leading to the murders. In particular, one teacher would have testified that, because of Horton's changed demeanor, she asked him if \"anything was going on,\" and he responded that he \"was just taking care of business.\" Testimony of a noticeable change in Horton's demeanor, just prior to the murders, likely would have damaged his case more than testimony about his general good character would have helped. Considering the limited positive impact (if any) that the character testimony would have had, the SJC reasonably concluded that defense counsel's failure to interview these witnesses likely would not have influenced the trial outcome. <i>See Siers v.

The only arguably contrary information is an affidavit from Horton's habeas counsel containing a summary of his conversations with defense counsel in which defense counsel stated that he should have insisted that the individual voir dire be conducted in public. This affidavit is inadequate to justify disregarding the state court's finding. <i>Cf. United States v.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the trial court limited the availability of a transcript of the individual voir dire proceeding.
