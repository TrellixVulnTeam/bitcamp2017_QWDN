See, e.g. Young v.

Apart from English\n\ntranslations of the relevant deeds, claimant failed to adduce any\n\nnew evidence to support his claim to the property on retrial.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court\n\nclearly erred in declining to credit fully claimant's testimony\n\nregarding the source of the purchase money.       Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court's forfeiture judgment is affirmed.   See Local Rule\n\n27(c).\n\f",
