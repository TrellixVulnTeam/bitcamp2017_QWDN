Primarily relying on arguments\n\nrelating to the safety valve requirements of the law and the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, defendant-appellant Jorge De Los Santos\n\nseeks a remand for resentencing in light of Blakely v. Washington,\n\n542 U.S. 296 (2004), and United States v. Booker, __ U.S. __, 125\n\nS. Ct. 738 (2005).            We affirm De Los Santos's sentence.1\n\n                                      I. Background\n\n            On May 27, 2003, De Los Santos pled guilty to one count\n\nof conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, 900 grams of\n\na substance containing heroin, an offense that carries a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence of 60 months of imprisonment.                       See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§   841,   846.        The    relevant    facts    are   brief     and   undisputed:\n\nbeginning no later than December 2000, while based in the U.S.\n\nVirgin Islands, De Los Santos participated in a conspiracy to\n\nimport and distribute heroin in Puerto Rico and the continental\n\nUnited States by supplying heroin to co-conspirators in exchange\n\nfor cash.    In a plea agreement, De Los Santos stipulated that the\n\ndrug quantity involved in the offense was 900 grams of heroin,\n\ncorresponding      to    a     base   offense     level   of   30   under   the   U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines.             U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1.           The parties jointly\n\n\n\n      1\n      De Los Santos's appeal was originally consolidated with that\nof a co-defendant. Because the issues raised in the two appeals\nare unrelated, we have chosen to issue separate decisions. See\nUnited States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 n.2 (1st Cir. 2001). We\nissue both decisions today.       See United States v. Delgado-\nHernandez, No. 03-2245 (1st Cir. Aug. 24, 2005).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fagreed to recommend that De Los Santos receive a three-level\n\ndecrease   if   he   accepted   responsibility   pursuant   to   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3E1.1, no adjustment based on his role in the offense pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 3B1.1 and 3B1.2, and a two-level decrease pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(6) if he complied with each of the five \"safety\n\nvalve\" requirements set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(5) and\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1)-(5).2     Under the agreement, De Los Santos's\n\n\n     2\n      U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(6) was renumbered as § 2D1.1(b)(7) in\n2004. That Guideline provides for a two-level decrease in offense\nlevel for covered offenses \"[i]f the defendant meets the criteria\nset forth\" in U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1)-(5):\n\n           (1) the defendant does not have more than 1\n           criminal history point, as determined under\n           the sentencing guidelines before application\n           of subsection (b) of § 4A1.3 (Departures Based\n           on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category);\n\n           (2) the defendant did not use violence or\n           credible threats of violence or possess a\n           firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce\n           another participant to do so) in connection\n           with the offense;\n\n           (3) the offense did not result in death or\n           serious bodily injury to any person;\n\n           (4) the defendant was not an organizer,\n           leader, manager, or supervisor of others in\n           the   offense,   as   determined   under   the\n           sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n           continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in\n           21 U.S.C. § 848; and\n\n           (5) not later than the time of the sentencing\n           hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided\n           to the Government all information and evidence\n           the defendant has concerning the offense or\n           offenses that were part of the same course of\n           conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the\n\n                                   -3-\n\flowest possible total offense level was 25, which corresponds to a\n\nGuidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 57-71 months of imprisonment\n\nfor a defendant in Criminal History Category I.        Finally, upon the\n\ncourt's acceptance of the plea agreement \"and the calculations of\n\ndefendant's   Adjusted   Offense   Level   contained    [t]herein,\"   the\n\nparties jointly agreed to \"recommend a sentence of sixty months\n\n(60) imprisonment\" -- the statutory minimum -- \"or the nearest term\n\nof imprisonment available under the Sentencing Guidelines.\"\n\n          At his sentencing hearing on September 12, 2003, De Los\n\nSantos confirmed that he declined to be debriefed in order to\n\npursue a safety valve sentence reduction.     The district court then\n\nimposed a three-level decrease from a base offense level of 30 for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and sentenced De Los Santos to 70\n\nmonths of imprisonment, at the bottom of the applicable GSR of 70-\n\n87 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I with a\n\n\n\n          fact that the defendant has no relevant or\n          useful other information to provide or that\n          the Government is already aware of the\n          information shall not preclude a determination\n          by the court that the defendant has complied\n          with this requirement.\n\nThese criteria are identical to the safety valve criteria set forth\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(5). See United States v. Bermúdez, 407\nF.3d 536, 541 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The Sentencing Commission\nincorporated the text of § 3553(f) verbatim into the Guidelines.\").\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a) (with an exception not applicable\nhere), \"the court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the\napplicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum\nsentence, if the court finds that the defendant meets\" the five\ncriteria. See also 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftotal offense level of 27. The court also imposed a four-year term\n\nof supervised release and a special monetary assessment of $100.\n\nDe Los Santos timely appealed his sentence.\n\n                         II. Blakely and Booker Claims\n\n           Briefing in this case was completed prior to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in United States v. Booker, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct.\n\n738   (2005).       In    his   opening   brief,   De   Los   Santos    sought\n\nresentencing under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), on\n\nthe ground that the Sixth Amendment requires the facts determining\n\ncompliance   with    the     safety   valve   requirements    of   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a) to be found by a jury (beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt) rather than by a judge (by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence).   Because he did not understand that requirement when he\n\ndecided, prior to Blakely, not to participate in the safety valve\n\nregimen, De Los Santos argues that he would have made a different\n\ndecision if he had known that his entitlement to a sentence\n\nreduction would have to be found by a jury by a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis claim is a non-starter.          A change in the law does not warrant\n\nvacating a sentence so that the defendant may reconsider his\n\ninitial decision not to pursue a safety valve reduction, just as a\n\nchange in the law does not warrant vacating a guilty plea so that\n\nthe defendant may choose to face trial instead.           See United States\n\nv. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]he possibility of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fa favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the\n\nnormal risks that accompany a guilty plea.\").3\n\n              In Booker, the Supreme Court clarified that Blakely\n\napplies to the federal sentencing Guidelines, holding that the\n\nSixth       Amendment   requires    \"[a]ny   fact   (other   than   a    prior\n\nconviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the\n\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or\n\na jury verdict [to] be admitted by the defendant or proved to a\n\njury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"             125 S. Ct. at 756.         In its\n\nremedial opinion, however, the Court eliminated any Sixth Amendment\n\nconcerns under the Guidelines by severing the provision of the\n\nSentencing Reform Act which made the Guidelines mandatory.              Id. at\n\n764.4       After oral argument, we invited the parties to submit\n\nsupplemental briefs addressing the effect of Booker and our circuit\n\nprecedent on De Los Santos's claim of sentencing error.\n\n              Because    De   Los   Santos    failed   to    challenge     the\n\nconstitutionality of the Guidelines before the district court, his\n\n\n        3\n      Even if De Los Santos had chosen to be debriefed for the\nsafety valve, the fact that his entitlement to a sentence\nreduction, as distinct from a sentence enhancement, may have\ndepended on judicial factfinding would not have offended Blakely or\nthe Sixth Amendment. See Bermúdez, 407 F.3d at 545 (possibility\nthat \"judicial factfinding prevented [defendant] from getting a\npotentially lower sentence than what he might have gotten absent\nthat judicial factfinding . . . . does not implicate Blakely\"\n(emphasis added)).\n        4\n      The Court also severed 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), which authorized\nappellate courts to engage in de novo review of certain sentencing\nissues.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fclaim of Booker error is unpreserved and subject only to plain\n\nerror review on appeal.         United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\n68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).         Under plain-error doctrine, we may notice\n\nand correct (1) error (2) that is plain, (3) that affected a\n\ndefendant's substantial rights, and (4) that \"'seriously affect[ed]\n\nthe    fairness,    integrity      or    public   reputation    of   judicial\n\nproceedings.'\" Id. at 77 (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n\n725, 736 (1993)).\n\n             As we explained in Antonakopoulos, the relevant inquiry\n\nunder Booker is not whether the Sixth Amendment precludes judicial\n\nfactfinding by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of\n\nimposing a mandatory sentence enhancement \"beyond [the sentence]\n\nauthorized by a jury verdict or an admission by the defendant.\"\n\nId. at 75.      Rather, \"[t]he Booker error is that the defendant's\n\nGuidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\"                 Id.\n\nBecause De Los Santos's sentence was imposed under a mandatory\n\nGuidelines regime, prongs one and two of the plain error analysis\n\nare satisfied.      Id.    De Los Santos fails, however, to meet his\n\nburden of persuasion on the \"prejudice\" prong, which requires him\n\nto \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that\n\nthe district court would impose a different sentence more favorable\n\nto    the   defendant   under    the    new   'advisory   Guidelines'   Booker\n\nregime.\"     Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            De   Los   Santos   argues   that    factors   relating     to    his\n\ndecision not to participate in the safety valve regimen, as well as\n\nother mitigating factors in the record, establish a reasonable\n\nprobability of a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines system\n\non remand.    First, he asserts that he declined to be debriefed by\n\nthe government only because he \"did not want to squeal on anyone\"\n\nand because he \"fear[ed] for the safety of himself and his family.\"\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(5) (conditioning satisfaction of the safety\n\nvalve requirements on defendant's \"truthful[] provi[sion] to the\n\nGovernment [of] all information and evidence [he had] concerning\n\nthe offense or offenses that were part of the same course of\n\nconduct or of a common scheme or plan\"); U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(5)\n\n(same).   We have no reason to doubt that De Los Santos had weighty\n\nreasons for deciding not to seek a safety valve reduction.              We fail\n\nto see, however, why the district court would consider De Los\n\nSantos's rationale for forgoing an opportunity for a lower sentence\n\nto be a mitigating factor in support of a lower sentence.\n\n            De Los Santos next points to evidence contained in his\n\npre-sentence investigation report showing that he experienced a\n\ndifficult    childhood,   has   a   history     of   alcohol   abuse,   and   is\n\ndeportable as a consequence of his drug-trafficking conviction, as\n\nfactors supporting a remand for resentencing under Booker. We note\n\nthat the district court, while not bound by the parties' joint\n\nrecommendation of either the 60-month statutory mandatory minimum\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fsentence or \"the nearest term of imprisonment available under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines,\" did sentence De Los Santos to the lowest\n\navailable   sentence   in   the   applicable   GSR   of   70-87   months   of\n\nimprisonment, evidencing at least some willingness to be lenient.\n\n            While \"[w]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to\n\nproof of probability where, either in the existing record or by\n\nplausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district\n\njudge might well have reached a different result under advisory\n\nguidelines,\" United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), we are unable to discern any such indication based on the\n\ncombination of mitigating factors identified here.                See United\n\nStates v. Tavarez, 410 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2005) (defendant seeking\n\nBooker remand could not show prejudice under plain error review by\n\npointing to his \"status as a deportable felon, his psychiatric\n\nhistory, and his recognition of the consequences of his crime on\n\nfamily members\").      Having failed to demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability of a lower sentence under advisory guidelines, De Los\n\nSantos's Booker claim must fail.5\n\n\n     5\n      Because De Los Santos declined to be debriefed in order to\nseek a safety valve reduction, the district court had no occasion\nto apply either U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(6) (now § 2D1.1(b)(7)) or its\nstatutory counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). This case therefore\ndoes not require us to decide whether a court applying the safety\nvalve pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), which provides that \"the\ncourt shall impose a sentence pursuant to\" the Guidelines (emphasis\nadded) \"without regard to any statutory minimum sentence\" if the\nfive criteria are met, must nevertheless treat the Guidelines as\nadvisory under Booker. See United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400\nF.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The effect of Booker, if any, on the\n\n                                    -9-\n\f        III. Drug Testing Condition of Supervised Release\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the district court ordered De\n\nLos Santos to observe \"the standard conditions of supervised\n\nrelease recommended by the United States Sentencing Commission and\n\nadopted by this Court.\"     In its written judgment, the court\n\nspecified that, as one of those conditions, \"[t]he defendant shall\n\nsubmit to one drug test within 15 days of release from imprisonment\n\nand at least two periodic drug tests thereafter\" (emphasis added).\n\n          De Los Santos argues that the written drug testing\n\nprovision could be construed as \"vest[ing] the probation officer\n\nwith the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests\" in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d), which requires the determination\n\nof the maximum number of tests to be made by the court.   See United\n\nStates v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\noverruled on other grounds by United States v. Padilla, No. 03-\n\n1918, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 15153 (1st Cir. July 25, 2005) (en banc)\n\n(declining to revisit settled law that district court's delegation\n\nof the discretion to determine the maximum number of drug tests to\n\na probation officer is legal error, but holding that such error\n\n\n\nsafety valve has not been determined.\"), petitions for cert. filed,\n___ U.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. May 27, 2005) (No. 04-10405), and ___\nU.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. June 2, 2005) (No. 04-10489); cf. United States\nv. Duran, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1287, at *13 (D. Utah Feb. 17,\n2005) (concluding that the Guidelines are advisory for purposes of\nsafety valve sentences and noting that the government \"agrees that\nan interpretation of the safety valve 'that treats the [G]uidelines\nas mandatory cannot be reconciled with Booker.'\").\n\n                               -10-\n\fdoes       not    warrant   an    automatic      remand    for    resentencing     if\n\nforfeited).6\n\n                 De Los Santos also argues that the written judgment could\n\npotentially be construed as being in material conflict with his\n\noral sentence in violation of his right to be present during the\n\nimposition of any \"potentially significant new burden,\" id. at 100\n\n-- here, the burden of \"a written drug testing condition, not\n\nannounced at the sentencing hearing, which orders more drug tests\n\nthan the minimum three required by the statute,\" United States v.\n\nTulloch, 380 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasis omitted).                      See\n\nid. (declining to decide whether imposition of such a condition in\n\na written judgment but not at the sentencing hearing would violate\n\ndefendant's        right    to   be   present).     In    order    to   avoid   these\n\npossibilities, De Los Santos seeks judicial amendment of the\n\nwritten drug testing provision and/or a limited remand for the\n\npurpose of resentencing on the drug testing condition of supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n                 In United States v. Lewandowski, 372 F.3d 470 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)      (per    curiam),      we   confronted   a     drug    testing   provision\n\nidentical to that imposed in the written judgment in this case.\n\n\n       6\n      18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he\ncourt shall . . . order, as an explicit condition of supervised\nrelease, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a\ncontrolled substance and submit to a drug test within 15 days of\nrelease on supervised release and at least 2 periodic drug tests\nthereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled\nsubstance\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                          -11-\n\fAlthough the provision contained no express delegation of authority\n\nto a probation officer, we \"construe[d] the condition to cap the\n\nnumber of drug tests at three, i.e., to state both the maximum and\n\nminimum number of tests.      In effect, we read the words 'at least'\n\nout of the condition as imposed, so that it requires only three\n\ndrug tests during the supervised release term.\"         Id. at 471.      We\n\nfurther stated that \"probation officers who monitor supervisees\n\nsubject to the drug testing condition we consider here may not\n\nrequire more than the minimum three tests without obtaining a\n\nmodification of the condition under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e).\"         Id.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 2003, De Los Santos pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, 900 grams of a substance containing heroin, an offense that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months of imprisonment. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841, 846. The relevant facts are brief and undisputed: beginning no later than December 2000, while based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, De Los Santos participated in a conspiracy to import and distribute heroin in Puerto Rico and the continental United States by supplying heroin to co-conspirators in exchange for cash. In a plea agreement, De Los Santos stipulated that the drug quantity involved in the offense was 900 grams of heroin, corresponding to a base offense level of 30 under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1. The parties jointly agreed to recommend that De Los Santos receive a three-level decrease if he accepted responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, no adjustment based on his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3B1.1 and 3B1.2, and a two-level decrease pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6) if he complied with each of the five \"safety valve\" requirements set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(1)-(5) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1)-(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Under the agreement, De Los Santos's lowest possible total offense level was 25, which corresponds to a Guidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 57-71 months of imprisonment for a defendant in Criminal History Category I. Finally, upon the court's acceptance of the plea agreement \"and the calculations of defendant's Adjusted Offense Level contained [t]herein,\" the parties jointly agreed to \"recommend a sentence of sixty months (60) imprisonment\" &#8212; the statutory minimum &#8212; \"or the nearest term of imprisonment available under the Sentencing Guidelines.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing on September 12, 2003, De Los Santos confirmed that he declined to be debriefed in order to pursue a safety valve sentence reduction. The district court then imposed a three-level decrease from a base offense level of 30 for acceptance of responsibility and sentenced De Los Santos to 70 months of imprisonment, at the bottom of the applicable GSR of 70-87 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I with a total offense level of 27. The court also imposed a four-year term of supervised release and a special monetary assessment of $100. De Los Santos timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefing in this case was completed prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his opening brief, De Los Santos sought resentencing under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on the ground that the Sixth Amendment requires the facts determining compliance with the safety valve requirements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a) to be found by a jury (beyond a reasonable doubt) rather than by a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence). Because he did not understand that requirement when he decided, prior to <i>Blakely,</i> not to participate in the safety valve regimen, De Los Santos argues that he would have made a different decision if he had known that his entitlement to a sentence reduction would have to be found by a jury by a reasonable doubt. This claim is a non-starter. A change in the law does not warrant vacating a sentence so that the defendant may reconsider his initial decision not to pursue a safety valve reduction, just as a change in the law does not warrant vacating a guilty plea so that the defendant may choose to face trial instead. <i>See United States v. Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the normal risks that accompany a guilty plea.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court clarified that <i>Blakely</i> applies to the federal sentencing Guidelines, holding that the Sixth Amendment requires \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict [to] be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 125 S.Ct. at 756. In its remedial opinion, however, the Court eliminated any Sixth Amendment concerns under the Guidelines by severing the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act which made the Guidelines mandatory. <i>Id.</i> at 764.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After oral argument, we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the effect of <i>Booker</i> and our circuit precedent on De Los Santos's claim of sentencing error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because De Los Santos failed to challenge the constitutionality of the Guidelines before the district court, his claim of <i>Booker</i> error is unpreserved and subject only to plain error review on appeal. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Under plain-error doctrine, we may notice and correct (1) error (2) that is plain, (3) that affected a defendant's substantial rights, and (4) that \"`seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained in <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> the relevant inquiry under <i>Booker</i> is not whether the Sixth Amendment precludes judicial factfinding by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of imposing a mandatory sentence enhancement \"beyond [the sentence] authorized by a jury verdict or an admission by the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75. Rather, \"[t]he <i>Booker</i> error is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\" <i>Id.</i> Because De Los Santos's sentence was imposed under a mandatory Guidelines regime, prongs one and two of the plain error analysis are satisfied. <i>Id.</i> De Los Santos fails, however, to meet his burden of persuasion on the \"prejudice\" prong, which requires him to \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos argues that factors relating to his decision not to participate in the safety valve regimen, as well as other mitigating factors in the record, establish a reasonable probability of a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines system on remand. First, he asserts that he declined to be debriefed by the government only because he \"did not want to squeal on anyone\" and because he \"fear[ed] for the safety of himself and his family.\" <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5) (conditioning satisfaction of the safety valve requirements on defendant's \"truthful[ ] provi[sion] to the Government [of] all information and evidence [he had] concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan\"); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(5) (same). We have no reason to doubt that De Los Santos had weighty reasons for deciding not to seek a safety valve reduction. We fail to see, however, why the district court would consider De Los Santos's rationale for forgoing an opportunity for a lower sentence to be a mitigating factor in support of a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos next points to evidence contained in his pre-sentence investigation report showing that he experienced a difficult childhood, has a history of alcohol abuse, and is deportable as a consequence of his drug-trafficking conviction, as factors supporting a remand for resentencing under <i>Booker.</i> We note that the district court, while not bound by the parties' joint recommendation of either the 60-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence or \"the nearest term of imprisonment available under the Sentencing Guidelines,\" did sentence De Los Santos to the lowest available sentence in the applicable GSR of 70-87 months of imprisonment, evidencing at least some willingness to be lenient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"[w]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines,\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), we are unable to discern any such indication based on the combination of mitigating factors identified here. <i>See United States v. Tavarez,</i> 410 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2005) (defendant seeking <i>Booker</i> remand could not show prejudice under plain error review by pointing to his \"status as a deportable felon, his psychiatric history, and his recognition of the consequences of his crime on family members\"). Having failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of a lower sentence under advisory guidelines, De Los Santos's <i>Booker</i> claim must fail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>III. Drug Testing Condition of Supervised Release</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court ordered De Los Santos to observe \"the standard conditions of supervised release recommended by the United States Sentencing Commission and adopted by this Court.\" In its written judgment, the court specified that, as one of those conditions, \"[t]he defendant shall submit to one drug test within 15 days of release from imprisonment and <i>at least</i> two periodic drug tests thereafter\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos argues that the written drug testing provision could be construed as \"vest[ing] the probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), which requires the determination of the maximum number of tests to be made by the court. <i>See United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir.2003), <i>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc) (declining to revisit settled law that district court's delegation of the discretion to determine the maximum number of drug tests to a probation officer is legal error, but holding that such error does not warrant an automatic remand for resentencing if forfeited).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos also argues that the written judgment could potentially be construed as being in material conflict with his oral sentence in violation of his right to be present during the imposition of any \"potentially significant new burden,\" <i>id.</i> at 100-here, the burden of \"a written drug testing condition, not announced at the sentencing hearing, which orders more drug tests than the minimum three required by the statute,\" <i>United States v. Tulloch,</i> 380 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (emphasis omitted). <i>See id.</i> (declining to decide whether imposition of such a condition in a written judgment but not at the sentencing hearing would violate defendant's right to be present). In order to avoid these possibilities, De Los Santos seeks judicial amendment of the written drug testing provision and/or a limited remand for the purpose of resentencing on the drug testing condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Lewandowski,</i> 372 F.3d 470 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam), we confronted a drug testing provision identical to that imposed in the written judgment in this case. Although the provision contained no express delegation of authority to a probation officer, we \"construe[d] the condition to cap the number of drug tests at three, i.e., to state both the maximum and minimum number of tests. In effect, we read the words `at least' out of the condition as imposed, so that it requires only three drug tests during the supervised release term.\" <i>Id.</i> at 471. We further stated that \"probation officers who monitor supervisees subject to the drug testing condition we consider here may not require more than the minimum three tests without obtaining a modification of the condition under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e).\" <i>Id.</i> We apply the same construction to the written drug testing provision here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As De Los Santos acknowledges, this construction of the drug testing provision eliminates the possibility that it could be interpreted as imposing a condition of supervised release materially different from that of which he had constructive notice during oral sentencing. <i>See Tulloch,</i> 380 F.3d at 13 (defendant had constructive notice of burden imposed by drug testing condition that is \"consistent with the burden mandated by &#167; 3583(d)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, as construed herein, and in all other respects, De Los Santos's sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> De Los Santos's appeal was originally consolidated with that of a co-defendant.

The relevant facts are brief and undisputed: beginning no later than December 2000, while based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, De Los Santos participated in a conspiracy to import and distribute heroin in Puerto Rico and the continental United States by supplying heroin to co-conspirators in exchange for cash. In a plea agreement, De Los Santos stipulated that the drug quantity involved in the offense was 900 grams of heroin, corresponding to a base offense level of 30 under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1. The parties jointly agreed to recommend that De Los Santos receive a three-level decrease if he accepted responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, no adjustment based on his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3B1.1 and 3B1.2, and a two-level decrease pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6) if he complied with each of the five \"safety valve\" requirements set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(1)-(5) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1)-(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Under the agreement, De Los Santos's lowest possible total offense level was 25, which corresponds to a Guidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 57-71 months of imprisonment for a defendant in Criminal History Category I. Finally, upon the court's acceptance of the plea agreement \"and the calculations of defendant's Adjusted Offense Level contained [t]herein,\" the parties jointly agreed to \"recommend a sentence of sixty months (60) imprisonment\" &#8212; the statutory minimum &#8212; \"or the nearest term of imprisonment available under the Sentencing Guidelines.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing on September 12, 2003, De Los Santos confirmed that he declined to be debriefed in order to pursue a safety valve sentence reduction. The district court then imposed a three-level decrease from a base offense level of 30 for acceptance of responsibility and sentenced De Los Santos to 70 months of imprisonment, at the bottom of the applicable GSR of 70-87 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I with a total offense level of 27. The court also imposed a four-year term of supervised release and a special monetary assessment of $100. De Los Santos timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Blakely</i> and <i>Booker</i> Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefing in this case was completed prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). In his opening brief, De Los Santos sought resentencing under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), on the ground that the Sixth Amendment requires the facts determining compliance with the safety valve requirements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a) to be found by a jury (beyond a reasonable doubt) rather than by a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence). Because he did not understand that requirement when he decided, prior to <i>Blakely,</i> not to participate in the safety valve regimen, De Los Santos argues that he would have made a different decision if he had known that his entitlement to a sentence reduction would have to be found by a jury by a reasonable doubt. This claim is a non-starter. A change in the law does not warrant vacating a sentence so that the defendant may reconsider his initial decision not to pursue a safety valve reduction, just as a change in the law does not warrant vacating a guilty plea so that the defendant may choose to face trial instead. <i>See United States v. Sahlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789352\"><a href=\"/opinion/789352/united-states-v-gary-sahlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the normal risks that accompany a guilty plea.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court clarified that <i>Blakely</i> applies to the federal sentencing Guidelines, holding that the Sixth Amendment requires \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict [to] be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 125 S.Ct. at 756. In its remedial opinion, however, the Court eliminated any Sixth Amendment concerns under the Guidelines by severing the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act which made the Guidelines mandatory. <i>Id.</i> at 764.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After oral argument, we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the effect of <i>Booker</i> and our circuit precedent on De Los Santos's claim of sentencing error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because De Los Santos failed to challenge the constitutionality of the Guidelines before the district court, his claim of <i>Booker</i> error is unpreserved and subject only to plain error review on appeal. <i>United States v.

Rather, \"[t]he <i>Booker</i> error is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\" <i>Id.</i> Because De Los Santos's sentence was imposed under a mandatory Guidelines regime, prongs one and two of the plain error analysis are satisfied. <i>Id.</i> De Los Santos fails, however, to meet his burden of persuasion on the \"prejudice\" prong, which requires him to \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos argues that factors relating to his decision not to participate in the safety valve regimen, as well as other mitigating factors in the record, establish a reasonable probability of a lower sentence under an advisory Guidelines system on remand. First, he asserts that he declined to be debriefed by the government only because he \"did not want to squeal on anyone\" and because he \"fear[ed] for the safety of himself and his family.\" <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5) (conditioning satisfaction of the safety valve requirements on defendant's \"truthful[ ] provi[sion] to the Government [of] all information and evidence [he had] concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan\"); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(5) (same). We have no reason to doubt that De Los Santos had weighty reasons for deciding not to seek a safety valve reduction. We fail to see, however, why the district court would consider De Los Santos's rationale for forgoing an opportunity for a lower sentence to be a mitigating factor in support of a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Los Santos next points to evidence contained in his pre-sentence investigation report showing that he experienced a difficult childhood, has a history of alcohol abuse, and is deportable as a consequence of his drug-trafficking conviction, as factors supporting a remand for resentencing under <i>Booker.</i> We note that the district court, while not bound by the parties' joint recommendation of either the 60-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence or \"the nearest term of imprisonment available under the Sentencing Guidelines,\" did sentence De Los Santos to the lowest available sentence in the applicable GSR of 70-87 months of imprisonment, evidencing at least some willingness to be lenient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While \"[w]e are inclined not to be overly demanding as to proof of probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines,\" <i>United States v.

Although the provision contained no express delegation of authority to a probation officer, we \"construe[d] the condition to cap the number of drug tests at three, i.e., to state both the maximum and minimum number of tests.
