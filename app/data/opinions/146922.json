Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                   Lipez, Howard and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Alfredo Castellanos, Dayra Amill-Acosta and Castellanos &\nCastellanos Law Firm, P.S.C., on brief for appellant Nilsa Ortíz-\nAlvarado.\n     Jorge J. Oppenheimer-Méndez, Oppenheimer-Soltero Retirement\nPlan Trust and Julie Soltero-Rinaldi on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                             May 21, 2010\n\f               Per Curiam. This appeal arises from the district court's\n\nallowance of the plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal--without prejudice\n\nand without any conditions--of the complaints in two consolidated\n\ncases.    The sole appellant, Nilsa Ortíz-Alvarado (\"Ortíz\"), is a\n\ndefendant in both cases.\n\n               Where, as here, a defendant has answered the complaint or\n\nmoved    for    summary   judgment,1   a     plaintiff   cannot   unilaterally\n\ndismiss an action without court approval \"on terms that the court\n\nconsiders proper.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).           The purpose of\n\nrequiring such approval is to ensure that \"'no other party will be\n\nprejudiced.'\"       Doe v. Urohealth Sys., Inc., 216 F.3d 157, 160 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (quoting P.R. Mar. Shipping Auth. v. Leith, 668 F.2d 46,\n\n50 (1st Cir. 1981)).          Accordingly, in ruling on a motion for\n\nvoluntary dismissal, \"[t]he district court is responsible . . . for\n\nexercising its discretion to ensure that such prejudice will not\n\noccur.\"    Id.\n\n               In exercising that discretion, \"courts typically look to\n\n'the defendant's effort and expense of preparation for trial,\n\nexcessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff\n\nin prosecuting the action, insufficient explanation for the need to\n\ntake a dismissal, and the fact that a motion for summary judgment\n\nhas been filed by the defendant.'\"           Id. (quoting Pace v. S. Express\n\n\n\n     1\n      Ortíz filed an answer in both cases and a motion for summary\njudgment in the JRA case.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCo., 409 F.2d 331, 334 (7th Cir. 1969)).   Although \"courts need not\n\nanalyze each factor or limit their consideration to these factors,\"\n\nid. (citing Tyco Labs., Inc. v. Koppers Co., 627 F.2d 54, 56 (7th\n\nCir. 1980)), they serve as \"a guide for the trial judge, in whom\n\nthe discretion ultimately rests.\"     Tyco, 627 F.2d at 56.\n\n          This court's review of a district court's approval of a\n\nvoluntary dismissal is for abuse of discretion,     Doe, 216 F.3d at\n\n160, which can occur not only by failing to consider a significant\n\nfactor, relying on an improper factor, or making a serious mistake\n\nin weighing the applicable factors, but also by failing to exercise\n\nits discretion at all.   Janney Montgomery Scott LLC v. Tobin, 571\n\nF.3d 162, 166 (1st Cir. 2009) (so holding with respect to a\n\ndiscretionary award of attorneys' fees).       Where, as here, the\n\ndistrict court provides no explanation for dismissing a case\n\nwithout prejudice and without imposing any conditions on the moving\n\nparty, such as paying the opposing party's attorneys' fees or\n\ncosts, and no reason for doing so is apparent from the record, this\n\ncourt cannot assess whether an abuse of discretion has occurred.\n\nBridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal-MCA Music Publ'g, Inc., 481\n\nF.3d 926, 930-931 (6th Cir. 2007); Conafay by Conafay v. Wyeth\n\nLabs., 793 F.2d 350, 354 (D.C. Cir. 1986).     Indeed, \"the best we\n\ncan do [under those circumstances] is to conclude that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion by not exercising it,\"      Janney, 571\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fF.3d at 166, and to remand for explicit consideration of the\n\nappropriate factors, Urohealth, 216 F.3d at 163.\n\n            If,    instead,     the    district       court     had      provided    \"some\n\nindication\"       of   its   reasons      for      rejecting       Ortíz's     colorable\n\narguments for dismissing the case with, rather than without,\n\nprejudice or for imposing conditions on the dismissal to ensure\n\nthat she is not unduly prejudiced by the dismissal, then remand\n\nwould not be required.          Bridgeport Music, 481 F.3d at 931; In re\n\nBayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc., 471 F.3d 1233, 1259 (11th Cir.\n\n2006).     Citing      relevant     factors--her           considerable      expense     in\n\nactively defending the cases, the plaintiffs' relative lack of\n\ndiligence, the pendency of dispositive motions in both cases, and\n\nthe inadequacy of the plaintiffs' reasons for seeking dismissal--\n\nOrtíz    argued    below     that   the      cases    should       be    dismissed     with\n\nprejudice or with conditions, and she presses those arguments on\n\nappeal.     Those      arguments      may,    or     may    not,    be    sound   in    the\n\ncircumstances of these cases, and other factors may weigh in favor\n\nof dismissal without prejudice or conditions.                           But the district\n\ncourt, which was actively involved in the management of these\n\ncomplex cases, is in a better position to apply and weigh such\n\nfactors, at least in the first instance.\n\n            The voluntary dismissals are vacated, and the case is\n\nremanded to the district court for further proceedings. Each party\n\nshall bear its own costs.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
