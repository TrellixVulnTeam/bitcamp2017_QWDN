LEVASSEUR,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n\n                      U.S. POSTAL SERVICE,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro,   U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John K. Levasseur on brief pro se.\n     Michelle A. Windmueller, Attorney, Appellate Division, Hélène\nKazanjian, Special Attorney to the United States Attorney General,\nand Lori J. Dym, Chief Counsel, Appellate Division, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         October 1, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam. We affirm the judgment substantially for the\n\nreasons enumerated in the district court's opinion, see 2007 WL\n\n2011273 (D.N.H. 2007), adding only the following comments.\n\n           This case raises a single issue involving the so-called\n\n\"postal-matter exception\" to the Federal Tort Claims Act.                  That\n\nexception preserves sovereign immunity for \"[a]ny claim arising out\n\nof the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or\n\npostal matters.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2680(b).       The question is whether the\n\ntheft or concealment of mail--in this case, political campaign\n\nflyers that were diverted by a partisan postal employee to prevent\n\nthem from being delivered to voters shortly before a municipal\n\nelection--falls within that provision.           The district court deemed\n\nthe   exception     applicable   and     thus    dismissed   for    lack     of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n           Levasseur contends that the postal-matter exception does\n\nnot apply to intentional torts.        In his view, the plain meaning of\n\nthe   statutory    language   supports    such    a   conclusion.    To     the\n\ncontrary, as the district court explained, the fact that the word\n\n\"negligent\" only modifies the word \"transmission\" indicates that\n\nintentional acts of \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" are also covered.\n\nSee, e.g., Watkins v. United States, 2003 WL 1906176, at *4 (N.D.\n\nIll. 2003).       Levasseur has offered no rebuttal to this line of\n\nreasoning.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          Levasseur also relies on a comment in Birnbaum v. United\n\nStates, 588 F.2d 319 (2d Cir. 1978).   Under challenge there was a\n\nCIA program in which letters to and from the Soviet Union were\n\nopened, photocopied, and then returned to the mail for delivery.\n\nIn concluding that the postal-matter exception did not bar suit,\n\nthe court stated as follows:\n\n               The language of the exception itself\n          indicates that it was not aimed to encompass\n          intentional acts.   Had Congress intended to\n          bring intentional disturbance of the integrity\n          of a letter within the postal exception, it\n          would not have used the term \"negligent\n          transmission.\" Nor were the letters lost or\n          miscarried. \"Miscarriage\" in the context of\n          mail means misdelivery.\n\nId. at 328 (emphasis added and deleted).   Levasseur relies on the\n\nemphasized sentence. Yet it seems clear that this remark pertained\n\nsolely to the \"negligent transmission\" factor, for it otherwise\n\nwould have conflicted with Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, 378\n\nF.2d 812 (2d Cir. 1967).    It was there held that the § 2680(b)\n\nexception applied to the theft of postal matter by a governmental\n\nemployee. The Birnbaum court was able to distinguish that decision\n\nbecause, unlike in the case before it, the claim in Marine had\n\ninvolved the package's \"'loss' from the postal system.\"    Birnbaum,\n\n588 F.2d at 328 n.20; accord C.D. of NYC, Inc. v. U.S.P.S., 2005 WL\n\n3322993, at *1 (2d Cir. 2005) (applying Marine and holding that\n\ntheft of mail by postal employees involved \"loss\"; distinguishing\n\nBirnbaum on ground that mail there \"was not lost\"), cert. denied,\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f127 S. Ct. 346 (2006); see also Georgacarakos v. United States, 420\n\nF.3d 1185, 1188 (10th Cir. 2005) (distinguishing Birnbaum on same\n\nbasis).     Since Birnbaum did not involve a loss, the remark in\n\nquestion also would have been dicta if it was meant to apply\n\nthereto.    Levasseur thus derives no support from that decision.\n\n            Indeed, the cases holding that theft of mail is a \"loss\"\n\nfor purposes of § 2680(b) directly undermine Levasseur's position,\n\nsince theft is of course a form of intentional misconduct.                      We\n\nthink it entirely reasonable to say, as these cases have, that mail\n\nthat is stolen by a postal employee is thereby \"lost\" from the\n\npostal system.\n\n            The Supreme Court has stated that, as a general rule, the\n\npostal-matter exception preserves immunity for \"injuries arising,\n\ndirectly or consequentially, because mail either fails to arrive at\n\nall   or   arrives    late,   in   damaged     condition,   or   at   the   wrong\n\naddress.\"     Dolan v. U.S.P.S., 546 U.S. 481, 489 (2006).                     It\n\nprovided    several    examples    of   such    injuries,   including       \"harms\n\narising from nondelivery or late delivery of sensitive materials or\n\ninformation (e.g., medicines or a mortgage foreclosure notice).\"\n\nId.   The claim here, which similarly complains of the \"nondelivery\n\n... of sensitive materials,\" falls squarely within this category.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f",
