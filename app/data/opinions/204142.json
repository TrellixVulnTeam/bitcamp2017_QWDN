In this ERISA1 matter, Edward\n\nRichards appeals from an adverse summary judgment ruling which\n\nupheld the termination of his long-term disability benefits by\n\nPrudential Insurance Co. of America (\"Prudential\").2         We affirm.\n\n                              I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.   The Policy\n\n           From May 1984 until January 1991, Richards was employed\n\nby Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") as a software engineer.3\n\nAs a benefit of his employment with DEC, Richards was offered\n\ninsurance coverage under the DEC Long-Term Disability Plan (\"the\n\nPlan\").   Pursuant to the Plan, Prudential managed and administered\n\ndisability claims filed by DEC employees.         The Plan is governed by\n\nERISA.\n\n           To be eligible for long-term disability benefits under\n\nthe Plan, a claimant must have suffered a sickness or accidental\n\ninjury rendering him unable \"to perform, for wage or profit, the\n\nmaterial and substantial duties of his occupation.\"         After twenty-\n\n\n\n      1\n      Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.§\n1001 et seq.\n      2\n      There were several named defendants, including Richards'\nformer employer and an individual employee of Prudential.     The\nindividual defendant is no longer a party.      We refer to the\nremaining defendants/appellees collectively as \"Prudential,\" both\nfor convenience and because the insurer is the real party in\ninterest in this litigation.\n      3\n      Digital     was   subsequently   acquired   by   appellee   Hewlett-\nPackard.\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffour months, eligibility hinges on whether the claimant is \"able to\n\nperform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of\n\nany job\" for which the claimant is reasonably fit by education,\n\ntraining or experience (emphasis added).\n\nB.    Richards' claim, termination and internal appeals\n\n            Richards applied for long-term benefits in May 1991, at\n\nthe   age   of   thirty-nine.    He    cited      chronic    fatigue   immune\n\ndysfunction and fibromyalgia as the causes of his disability, which\n\nleft him unable to work after January 15, 1991.                   Prudential\n\naccepted Richards' claim in October 1991 and commenced paying\n\nbenefits retroactive to July 1991.         In 1992 Richards was awarded\n\nSocial Security disability benefits.\n\n            Since the Plan required proof of ongoing disability as a\n\ncondition to continued receipt of benefits, Prudential regularly\n\nrequired Richards to provide a statement of his current condition\n\nand releases enabling Prudential to obtain his medical records.\n\nAlthough Richards occasionally balked -- at least once referring to\n\nthe   requests   as   \"harassment\"    --   he    uniformly    complied   with\n\nPrudential's requests, and his benefits continued apace.\n\n            In January 2001, Prudential, using releases provided by\n\nRichards a month earlier, requested medical records from three\n\ntreating physicians Richards had previously identified in his\n\nperiodic submissions to Prudential.         The records request covered\n\nthe period from January 1999 forward.           On February 5, 2001, one of\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe physicians, Dr. Carol Englender, reported that she had not seen\n\nRichards in her office since prior to January 1999.          A few weeks\n\nlater, in response to Dr. Englender's information, and consistent\n\nwith plans to review Richards' claim developed in March 2000,\n\nPrudential sought an independent review of Richards' claim from Dr.\n\nGwen   Brachman,   whose   practice    included   internal     medicine,\n\nrheumatology and occupational medicine.    After reviewing Richards'\n\nmedical history, Dr. Brachman submitted a report to Prudential,\n\nconcluding that although Richards qualified for a diagnosis of\n\nfibromyalgia, he was not physically impaired from performing the\n\nessential functions of a sedentary job.    Relying on Dr. Brachman's\n\nreport, Prudential informed Richards on March 26, 2001 that he was\n\nno longer eligible for long-term disability benefits and that\n\npayments would cease as of June 1, 2001.\n\n          The letter terminating Richards' benefits also contained\n\ninformation about the appeals process, as did a follow-up letter\n\nsent approximately one month later.      Over the next three years,\n\nRichards contacted Prudential on numerous occasions.         Many of the\n\ncalls were requests for details on the appeals process.           Others\n\nwere direct requests to immediately reinstate his benefits while he\n\nprepared his appeal.   Still other calls contained accusations by\n\nRichards of Prudential's professional malfeasance and threats to\n\nbring Prudential's alleged misconduct to the attention of entities\n\nranging from the federal government to television exposé programs.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            On July 26, 2004, Richards submitted a formal written\n\nappeal of Prudential's March 2001 decision.        He set forth three\n\narguments for reinstatement of his benefits:          first, that Dr.\n\nBrachman was not only unqualified to review his disability, but\n\nthat she also used improper evaluation techniques and made false\n\nstatements in her review; second, that Prudential should have\n\ndeferred to the opinions of Richards' treating doctors; and third,\n\nthat Prudential should have given deference to the 1992 decision of\n\nthe administrative law judge who awarded Richards Social Security\n\ndisability benefits.     Prudential denied the appeal by letter dated\n\nSeptember 28, 2004.\n\n            Responding to Richards' specific complaints, Prudential\n\nnoted that Dr. Brachman specialized in occupational medicine and\n\nrheumatology, and was thus qualified to review Richards' medical\n\nrecords, his diagnoses of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and to\n\noffer an opinion on his ability to work.     Prudential further noted\n\nthat   it   did   take   the   Social   Security   determination   into\n\nconsideration, but that Prudential's determinations are independent\n\nfrom the agency's.    Prudential also indicated that it had reviewed\n\nRichards' records before making its original determination in 2001,\n\nand since three years had passed, it also considered additional\n\nrecords that Richards had provided since the decision.        Finally,\n\nPrudential buttressed its decision by pointing to a transferable\n\nskills analysis that concluded that Richards could perform a number\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fof sedentary occupations which fit within his education, training\n\nor experience.\n\n            In response to the September 28, 2004 letter, Richards\n\nsubmitted a letter and additional records from one of his treating\n\nphysicians, Dr. Mark Hryniewich, and requested that Prudential\n\nagain review its decision.          On February 8, 2005, following review\n\nof the additional materials, Prudential again informed Richards\n\nthat its original decision was correct.\n\n            The February 2005 letter also instructed Richards about\n\nhis rights to pursue further appeals.                Richards availed himself of\n\nthis opportunity by submitting his second written appeal in August\n\n2005.    This appeal set forth three chief claims.                 First, Richards\n\naccused    Prudential      of   ignoring       Dr.    Hryniewich's      opinion    that\n\nRichards' fibromyalgia had left him chronically disabled. Richards\n\nalso    protested    the   fact    that    Prudential       did   not    contact   Dr.\n\nHryniewich personally. Finally, Richards claimed that Prudential's\n\nbenefit termination notification was legally deficient because it\n\nlacked    detailed    instructions        on    how    to   appeal      and    explicit\n\ninstructions about the particular information Richards would need\n\nto supply to get his benefits reinstated.\n\n            In response, Prudential conducted another review, and\n\nagain    affirmed    the   decision       to    terminate    Richards'        benefits.\n\nRelying    on   a   medical     record    review      performed    by    its   Medical\n\nDirector, Dr. Richard Day, Prudential reiterated its finding that\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fRichards could perform the duties of a sedentary job for which he\n\nwas   qualified.      The   denial   letter   also   noted   that   previous\n\nneurological assessments Richards had undergone were \"completely\n\nnormal,   as   were    laboratory     findings,      and   there    were   no\n\nrheumatological laboratory or physical findings consistent with\n\nsynovitis or an inflammatory process.\"4         Additionally, Prudential\n\ninformed Richards of Dr. Day's opinion that any treatment he was\n\nreceiving for chronic fatigue syndrome was incomplete, given the\n\nlack of cognitive behavioral therapy.5            In connection with Dr.\n\nDay's report, Prudential also referred back to the transferable\n\nskills analysis performed the previous year, which identified a\n\nnumber of sedentary positions suitable for Richards, given what\n\nPrudential contended was his residual functioning capacity.\n\n           Richards, this time through counsel, availed himself of\n\nPrudential's final level of appeal on January 30, 2006.                    In\n\naddition to repeating the claim that Richards was in fact totally\n\ndisabled from performing any occupation, the appeal alleged that\n\n\n\n      4\n      \"Synovitis\" is inflammation of fluid membranes in certain of\nthe body's joint cavities and tendon sheaths. Stedman's Medical\nDictionary 1773 (27th ed. 2000).\n      5\n      Dr. Day also referred to a note from a Dr. O'Leary, which\nstrongly opposed Richards' claim of disability. However, Dr. Day\nincorrectly referred to O'Leary's note as being dated April 2001,\nwhen the record reflects an actual date of April 1991. While this\ndiscrepancy might weaken somewhat the foundation of Dr. Day's\nopinion, it does not significantly undercut it. We address later\nthe relevance of Dr. O'Leary's report within the overall context of\nthe administrative record.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe previous rejection -- the September 29, 2005 decision -- \"did\n\nnot set forth with the required specificity\" the reasons that\n\nRichards' benefits were discontinued.        Also, Richards took issue\n\nwith Dr. Day's reference to cognitive behavior therapy, likening it\n\nto \"years ago, [when] epileptics were locked away in institutions\n\nfor the mentally insane.\"       Finally, Richards' attorney asked to\n\nmeet with Prudential's appeals committee prior to its decision.\n\n           Although   the    substantive   decision   on   Richards'   last\n\nappeal was still months away, Prudential responded quickly to his\n\nattorney's missive. In a letter dated February 6, 2006, Prudential\n\nexpressed its view that its various benefit termination letters\n\nadequately detailed the reasons for its decisions.          Specifically,\n\nPrudential noted that its letters cited policy provisions, medical\n\nreviews   and   vocational   assessments.     Additionally,    Prudential\n\nrejected Richards' demand that it contact his physicians, as it was\n\nnot contractually obligated to do so and because it was unnecessary\n\ngiven the information already in his medical file.               Further,\n\nPrudential rejected Richards' attorney's request to appear before\n\nthe appeals committee, as that committee \"doesn't 'meet' with\n\nclaimants or their representatives; rather the panel provides a\n\nthird and voluntary level of appeal review.\"\n\n           Prudential originally set an April 1, 2006 deadline for\n\nRichards to submit materials in support of his final appeal.           Due\n\nto various communication breakdowns regarding deadlines, Prudential\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fextended the deadline to June 2006.          Richards used the additional\n\ntime to supplement the record.6         In a letter dated June 5, 2006,\n\none day before the deadline, Richards' attorney submitted a report\n\nfrom Dr. Hryniewich, dated the same day, in which he opined that\n\nRichards \"has been totally and permanently disabled from engaging\n\nin and maintaining any gainful employment activity since 1991, up\n\nto and including the present, and further, it is likely that his\n\ntotal and permanent disability will continue for the foreseeable\n\nfuture.\"   Dr. Hryniewich noted that Richards \"tested positive for\n\nfibromyalgia,\" and that while symptoms could be treated with pain\n\nmedication, side effects made his return to gainful employment\n\nimpossible.7\n\n               During     the   pendency    of   Richards'   final    appeal,\n\nPrudential     sought    additional   medical    record   reviews    from   two\n\nrheumatologists.        One of these reviews, from Dr. Paul Howard, took\n\nplace after receipt of Dr. Hryniewich's June 5 report.          On July 18,\n\n2006, Prudential informed Richards' attorney of its determination\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The record also reflects that communication between Richards\nand Prudential had become further strained; phone logs contain\nnotations of accusations by Richards during frequent phone calls,\nto which Prudential responded by communicating with him only in\nwriting.\n     7\n      The letter from Dr. Hryniewich was the only new medical\nevidence submitted to Prudential.     Several other letters were\nlittle more than attacks on Prudential and its medical reviewers,\nor efforts \"to make Prudential aware\" of damage awards against\nother insurance companies, seemingly as a warning.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat the decision to terminate Richards' benefits in 2001 was\n\nappropriate.\n\n            After rehashing some of the lengthy procedural history of\n\nthe case, the denial letter detailed the findings of Dr. Howard and\n\nDr. Dayton Dennis Payne, who reviewed Richards' records in April\n\n2006.     Dr. Payne's report noted Richards' diagnoses of chronic\n\nfatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome and\n\nfibromyalgia.        He also noted Richards' myriad other symptoms,\n\nincluding    short-term      memory      issues,    irritable   bowel   syndrome,\n\ndepression and possible bursitis.               Dr. Payne found that Richards'\n\nrecords    showed    that    his    symptoms       had   remained    \"essentially\n\nunchanged\"    over    the    fifteen      years    since   he   began   receiving\n\nbenefits, and also noted the statements by others that he would\n\n\"never be able to return to gainful employment.\"\n\n            Dr. Payne also determined, however, that he could find no\n\nevidence of \"destructive rheumatic findings,\" or that Richards had\n\nlimitation    of    motion   in    his    joints,    weakness   or   atrophy,   or\n\nspecific organ system abnormalities.               In light of these findings,\n\nDr. Payne concluded that: 1) the records did not support a finding\n\nof functional impairment existing from June 2001 forward; 2) the\n\nrecords contained no objective evidence of any disease process that\n\nwould be expected to lead to any restrictions or limitations; 3)\n\nwhile there was no evidence of malingering, no physical examination\n\nor testing procedure revealed objective evidence of impairment; and\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f4) because the objective findings did not support any degree of\n\nrestrictions or limitations, Richards would be expected to have\n\nage-appropriate functional capacity.\n\n           Dr. Howard's report, dated July 6, 2006, noted that\n\nRichards' rheumatological symptoms between 2001 and 2006 were\n\nconsistent with fibromyalgia, but that the resulting functional\n\nimpairments were \"mild in nature.\"            Dr. Howard noted the 1991\n\nopinions from Dr. O'Leary and Dr. Englender that posited that\n\nRichards' symptoms should allow him to eventually return to work.\n\nDr.   Howard   also    pointed   out   that   a   comprehensive     physical\n\nexamination conducted by Dr. Hryniewich in 2001 contained normal\n\nneurological findings, with no indication of any reported physical\n\nexamination abnormalities.       Regarding Dr. Hryniewich's June 2006\n\nletter, Dr. Howard implied that its conclusion of total disability\n\nwas somewhat suspect, given that a November 2005 examination\n\nyielded normal results, other than a complaint of foot pain.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Howard noted that while Dr. Hryniewich's letter\n\ncited   side-effects    of   pain   medication,     the   medical   records\n\nthemselves lacked any reference to side effects.            Moreover, Dr.\n\nHoward suggested that Richards' non-compliance with recommended\n\nexercise programs deprived him of an opportunity to improve his\n\nfunctional capacity.\n\n           Relying on what he described as an \"absence of any\n\nabnormalities by radiological study, laboratory studies and . . .\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\frepeated physical examinations,\" Dr. Howard expressed his opinion\n\nthat Richards, despite a \"mild degree of impairment,\" would be able\n\nto perform sedentary work involving sitting, walking occasionally,\n\nstanding frequently, lifting ten pounds frequently (occasionally\n\ntwenty), working at a desk, and using his hands and fingers without\n\nrestriction.\n\n           As noted, Prudential, relying in large measure on the\n\nopinions of Drs. Payne and Howard, rejected Richards' final appeal,\n\nconcluding that \"the medical evidence overwhelmingly supports that\n\nMr. Richards has been capable of returning to work on a full time\n\nbasis in both his own occupation as well as in an alternate,\n\ngainful occupation since at least June 01, 2001.\"\n\nC.   District court proceedings\n\n           Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Richards\n\nfiled suit in federal district court, seeking reinstatement of\n\nbenefits retroactive to June 2001, attorneys fees, and roughly\n\n$43,000 in sanctions against Prudential for failing to provide\n\ncertain documents during the administrative process.        In due\n\ncourse, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which\n\nwere referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation\n\n(\"R & R\").\n\n           Following a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended\n\nthat Prudential's motion be granted and that Richards' be denied.\n\nIn the course of reaching its conclusion, the fifty-six page R & R\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\frejected Richards' arguments that Dr. Brachman was not qualified to\n\nevaluate Richards' records, that Prudential did not provide him\n\nwith enough information about the benefit termination, and that\n\nPrudential       improperly    required     Richards      to   supply     \"objective\n\nmedical evidence\" in support of his claim.                  Moreover, the R & R\n\nrefused Richards' entreaties to give special weight to the Social\n\nSecurity Administration's favorable benefit determination and the\n\nopinion of Dr. Hryniewich, as Richards' treating physician.                       The\n\ndistrict court judge adopted the R & R over Richards' objections\n\nand denied multiple motions for reconsideration.                         This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                    II.   ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Standard of review\n\n            Prior        to   addressing       the     substance    of     Richards'\n\ngrievances, the district court ruled in his favor on an important\n\npreliminary      issue.       The    parties     had   disputed    the    applicable\n\nstandard of review. Prudential sought to have the court review the\n\nadministrative record for abuse of discretion, while Richards urged\n\na more searching de novo review.             See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.\n\nv. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989) (\"[A] denial of benefits\n\nchallenged under [29 U.S.C.] § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed\n\nunder   a   de    novo    standard    unless     the   benefit     plan   gives   the\n\nadministrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine\n\neligibility for benefits . . . .\").                  After a thorough review of\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fcases addressing identical policy language from this circuit and\n\nelsewhere, the court concluded that application of the de novo\n\nstandard of review was warranted.        Prudential does not challenge\n\nthis ruling.8\n\n          Our task is to independently weigh the facts and opinions\n\nin the administrative record to determine whether the claimant has\n\nmet his burden of showing that he is disabled within the meaning of\n\nthe policy.     We grant no deference to the administrators' opinions\n\nor conclusions.     Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d\n\n510, 518 (1st Cir. 2005).    In other words, we stand in the shoes of\n\nthe administrator to \"determine . . . whether the administrative\n\ndecision was correct.\"     Few v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., No. 06-CV-\n\n00427-JL, 2009 WL 756211 (D.N.H. March 19, 2009); cf. Leahy v.\n\nRaytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2002) (under arbitrary and\n\ncapricious review, reviewing court may not substitute its opinion\n\nfor that of the plan administrator).        Where, as here, review is\n\nbased on the administrative record and represents an ultimate\n\nconclusion as to a claimant's disability to be drawn from the\n\nfacts, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the\n\nissue.\"   Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 517.       Accordingly, the non-moving\n\n\n\n     8\n      The district court also denied Richards' motion to supplement\nthe record with an affidavit in which he described his condition.\nAs Richards contested this decision only in his reply brief, it is\nwaived. See Cunningham v. Nat'l City Bank, 588 F.3d 49, 54 n.6\n(1st Cir. 2009) (arguments not raised in appellant's opening brief\nare waived).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fparty is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.                         Id.\n\nIn sum, \"[o]ur guiding principle in conducting de novo review                       . .\n\n.    is   that    the   plaintiff   bears      the   burden   of     proving   he   is\n\ndisabled.\"       Id. at 518-19.     Therefore, in the context of the policy\n\ndefinitions applicable here, Richards' burden is to prove that he\n\nis    \"unable     to    perform   for   wage    or   profit    the    material      and\n\nsubstantial duties of any job\" for which he is reasonably fit by\n\neducation, training or experience.\n\nB.    Appellant's claims\n\n             Richards makes three arguments on appeal.                    First, he\n\nclaims that no weight was given to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions.\n\nSecond, he asserts error in the failure to give \"any weight\" to the\n\nSocial Security Administration's ruling in his favor.                   Finally, he\n\nargues that it was \"error for the court to adopt the opinion of a\n\npaper consulting physician who proffered a psychiatric condition to\n\nthe plaintiff\" without justification.                We address these arguments\n\nin turn.\n\n             1.    Dr. Hryniewich's opinions\n\n             Richards complains that the district court did not give\n\nany weight to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions.                Since we are reviewing\n\nthe administrator's decision, we construe this argument as though\n\nit were directed at Prudential.             Regardless,       Richards' complaint\n\nabout the alleged exclusion of Dr. Hryniewich's records falls short\n\nof the mark. For example, he argues that reference to Hryniewich's\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fnotes were absent from Dr. Brachman's 2001 report.        Our review of\n\nthe nearly 1,000-page administrative record suggests otherwise.\n\nDr. Brachman's report explicitly mentions review of records from\n\nRichards' visits to the Fallon Clinic in Massachusetts.           Included\n\namong these records were office notes from several visits with Dr.\n\nHryniewich in 1997, 1999 and 2000 as well as Attending Physician's\n\nStatements from 1997 and 1999 in which Dr. Hryniewich informed\n\nPrudential of Richards' fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and\n\nstated that Richards' ability to perform work duties was \"unknown.\"\n\nMoreover, as previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's 2006 conclusion\n\nthat Richards was disabled from any work was addressed by Dr.\n\nHoward during the final level of appeal.\n\n          A broader reading of Richards' argument suggests that his\n\nactual grievance is that Dr. Hryniewich's conclusions should have\n\nbeen given controlling weight, especially when compared to the\n\ndoctors who reviewed Richards' record without examining him.            This\n\nargument is contrary to existing law, as \"the opinion of the\n\nclaimant's   treating   physician,    which   was   considered,    is   not\n\nentitled to special deference.\"      Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 526     (citing\n\nBlack & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 831 (2003)).9\n\n\n     9\n      By contrast, treating physicians' opinions are ordinarily\naccorded deference in Social Security disability proceedings. See\nMorales-Alejandro, 486 F.3d at 700 n.7 (citing 20 C.F.R. §\n404.1527(d)(2)). That deference does not extend, however, to a\nphysician's opinion -- such as the one offered by Dr. Hryniewich –\nthat a claimant is unable to work, as such an opinion is not a\nmedical one. Id.\n\n                                -16-\n\f            In the final analysis, Dr. Hryniewich's opinions provide\n\na shaky foundation for Richards' claim. First, his descriptions in\n\n1997 and 1999 of Richards' employment prospects as \"unknown\" is at\n\nodds with his later pronouncements that Richards was disabled from\n\nany employment. Similarly, office notes from 2001 and 2005 contain\n\nno reference to disability from fibromyalgia.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we reject Richards' arguments\n\nregarding the adequacy of the weight given to Dr. Hryniewich's\n\nopinions.\n\n            2.   Social Security disability determination\n\n            After Richards' initial application for Social Security\n\ndisability benefits was denied in 1991, an administrative law judge\n\nruled in his favor in October 1992.      Richards argues that it was\n\nerror to not give \"any weight\" to the fact that he was awarded\n\nSocial Security disability benefits due to fibromyalgia and chronic\n\nfatigue immune dysfunction.      We disagree with both the factual\n\npremise of the argument -- that no weight was given -- and its\n\nimplied legal conclusion -- that the Social Security decision\n\ninexorably leads to reversal of Prudential's decision.\n\n            As a factual matter, the record suggests that Prudential\n\ndid not ignore Richards' receipt of Social Security benefits.       To\n\nthe   contrary,     in   rejecting   Richards'   first   request   for\n\nreconsideration in 2004, Prudential stated that its determinations\n\n\"are independent from those of the Social Security Administrations\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f[sic] although we will review and consider documentation concerning\n\ntheir [sic] decisions.\"10\n\n             Richards fares no better when the legal underpinnings of\n\nhis argument are examined.      Similar to his argument regarding his\n\ntreating physician, Richards seems to suggest that the Social\n\nSecurity determination is entitled to a high degree of deference.\n\nHowever, in Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life and Accident Insurance\n\nCo., we held that \"benefits eligibility determinations by the\n\nSocial     Security   Administration   are   not   binding   on   disability\n\ninsurers.\"     230 F.3d 415, 420 (1st Cir. 2000).         While the Social\n\nSecurity determination might be relevant to an insurer's decision,\n\n\"it should not be given controlling weight except perhaps in the\n\nrare case in which the statutory criteria are identical to the\n\ncriteria set forth in the insurance plan.\"         Id.   Here, Richards has\n\nnot attempted a comparison between the two sets of criteria and has\n\nthus waived that strand of argument. See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).           Even if we were to ignore the\n\nwaiver, however, the administrative law judge's ruling on Richards'\n\napplication for disability benefits contains the following finding:\n\n\"The claimant retains the residual functioning capacity for less\n\nthan a full range of sedentary work activity\" (emphasis added).\n\nGiven that, in the context of this case, the policy at issue\n\nrequires Richards to prove that he is disabled from all sedentary\n\n\n     10\n          The district court made a similar pronouncement.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fwork, a finding that he retains the capacity for \"less than a full\n\nrange\" of such work hardly bolsters his case.11          Accordingly, we\n\nfind    no   merit   to   Richards'    Social   Security-based   argument.\n\n             3.   \"Paper consulting physicians\"\n\n             Richards' final argument is targeted at both the specific\n\nopinion of Dr. Brachman and, more generally, at the use of non-\n\nexamining physicians to review claimant files.         As to the latter,\n\nRichards argues that the policy language giving Prudential the\n\nright to have a claimant undergo a physical examination somehow\n\nlimits Prudential to the use of physical exams.12         We do not share\n\nthis strained reading of the policy language, for which Richards\n\nhas provided no legal support.13         Moreover, we have squarely held\n\nthat an insurer is not required to physically examine a claimant,\n\n\n       11\n      We also note that the Social Security award was made in 1992,\nwhile Prudential's termination occurred nine years later. Although\nRichards points out that only Prudential terminated his benefits,\nhe does not specify whether, or to what extent, his Social Security\nclaim was reviewed in the years following the 1992 decision.\n       12\n      Under the section captioned \"Claim Rules,\" the Plan provides\nthat \"Prudential, at its own expense, has the right to examine the\nperson whose loss is the basis of the claim. Prudential may do\nthis when and as often as is reasonable while the claim is\npending.\"\n       13\n      Richards invokes the doctrine of contra proferentem,\naccording to which ambiguous policy terms must be strictly\nconstrued against the drafter during de novo review. See Stamp v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 531 F.3d 84, 93 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 636 (2008); Balestracci v. NSTAR Elec. and Gas\nCorp., 449 F.3d 224, 231 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006). Here, however, we\nfind no ambiguity in the policy provision giving Prudential the\nright to have Richards examined, such that it should be read as a\nrequirement.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fand that benefit determinations may be based on reviews of medical\n\nrecords.    Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 526.          Additionally, as in Orndorf,\n\n\"this is simply not a case where the only medical evidence ran in\n\n[claimant's] favor, thus casting into doubt a denial of benefits.\"\n\nId.    In fact, while the evidence may have supported the diagnoses\n\nof    fibromyalgia   or   chronic    fatigue    immune      dysfunction,    every\n\nreviewing,   board-certified        doctor,    with   the    exception     of   Dr.\n\nHryniewich, found that Richards could perform a sedentary job for\n\nwhich he was reasonably fit by education, training or experience.14\n\n            As to Dr. Brachman's opinion, Richards first takes issue\n\nwith her medical qualifications. We are not persuaded. The record\n\nreflects that Dr. Brachman specializes in occupational medicine and\n\nrheumatology, and Richards offers no evidence to the contrary.\n\n            Next, Richards argues that Brachman improperly ascribed\n\na psychiatric condition -- depression -- to him without any basis.\n\nHe then asserts that Prudential used this finding to discontinue\n\nhis benefits by relying on the Plan's twenty-four month maximum\n\npayment period for disabilities \"caused in whole or part by a\n\nmental health issue.\"       Even assuming that Dr. Brachman's mental\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      As previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's definitive statements\nregarding Richards' incapacity came several years after the initial\ndenial and were arguably inconsistent with his pre-termination\nopinions regarding Richards' employment prospects, which he at\nleast twice described as \"unknown.\"\n\n                                      -20-\n\fhealth conclusion is overstated,15 Richards' argument nevertheless\n\nfails for two related reasons.             First, while Dr. Brachman in          her\n\nreport discussed the medical record evidence of depression in\n\nRichards' history, she also addressed the lack of evidence of\n\nphysical impairment, including synovitis, deformity, or decreased\n\nrange of joint motion.       She also noted the lack of any inflammatory\n\nvascular disease or neurocognitive impairment.              Second, Prudential\n\ndid not terminate Richards' benefits on the ground that he had\n\nexhausted them under the mental health provisions of the Plan.\n\nInstead,    Prudential      explicitly      stated   that   it    was   evaluating\n\nwhether     his   \"current   physical      condition     prevented      [him]   from\n\nperforming any occupation.\"            In other words, regardless of Dr.\n\nBrachman's      reference    to    Richards'   mental     health   history,      the\n\nrequirement that he prove his then-current physical disability\n\nremained.\n\n               Finally, to the extent that Richards argues that Dr.\n\nBrachman did not review the entirety of his medical history, we\n\nnote    that    \"the   denial     letter    need   not   detail    every   bit    of\n\ninformation in the record; it must have enough information to\n\nrender the decision to deny benefits susceptible to judicial\n\n\n\n       15\n      There are, in fact, references to depression in the record\ndating back to the early 1990s.      In Dr. Brachman's opinion,\ndepression can lead to a magnification or exaggeration of\nfibromyalgia symptoms. While Richards disputes this conclusion,\nhis brief contains no refutation to the articles upon which Dr.\nBrachman relied in her report.\n\n                                       -21-\n\freview.\"   Orndorf, 404 F.3d at 526.        Dr. Brachman's report and\n\nPrudential's termination letter easily satisfy this standard.16\n\n                            III.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We   are   not   without   sympathy   to   Richards'   plight.\n\nHowever, the dispute in this case is not over whether Richards is\n\nafflicted with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction.\n\nAnd while termination of benefits after ten years of payments is a\n\nharsh outcome, it is one that Prudential was legally entitled to\n\npursue within ERISA's strictures.         The sole issue before us is\n\nwhether Richards met his burden of showing that these conditions\n\nrendered him unable to perform any job for which he is qualified.\n\nBased on the record before us, we agree with the administrator and\n\nthe district court that he has failed to meet his burden.             The\n\njudgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      One possible basis for Richards' view is that the letter to\nhim from Prudential lists certain records as \"included\" among those\nsent to Dr. Brachman, while Brachman's report contains a much\nlarger list of records she actually reviewed.\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

O'Leary, with whom Fitzhugh &amp; Mariani LLP was on brief, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, STAHL and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this ERISA<sup>[1]</sup> matter, Edward Richards appeals from an adverse summary judgment ruling which upheld the termination of his long-term disability benefits by Prudential Insurance Co. of America (\"Prudential\").<sup>[2]</sup> We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The Policy</i></h2>\n<p>From May 1984 until January 1991, Richards was employed by Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") as a software engineer.<sup>[3]</sup> As a benefit of his employment with DEC, Richards was offered insurance coverage under the DEC Long-Term Disability Plan (\"the Plan\"). Pursuant to the Plan, Prudential managed and administered disability claims filed by DEC employees. The Plan is governed by ERISA.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for long-term disability benefits under the Plan, a claimant must have suffered a sickness or accidental injury rendering him unable \"to perform, for wage or profit, the material and substantial duties of his occupation.\" After twenty-four months, eligibility hinges on whether the claimant is \"able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of <i>any job</i>\" for which the claimant is reasonably fit by education, training or experience (emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Richards' claim, termination and internal appeals</i></h2>\n<p>Richards applied for long-term benefits in May 1991, at the age of thirty-nine. He cited chronic fatigue immune dysfunction and fibromyalgia as the causes of his disability, which left him unable to work after January 15, 1991. Prudential accepted Richards' claim in October 1991 and commenced paying benefits retroactive to July 1991. In 1992 Richards was awarded Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p>Since the Plan required proof of ongoing disability as a condition to continued receipt of benefits, Prudential regularly required Richards to provide a statement of his current condition and releases enabling Prudential to obtain his medical records. Although Richards occasionally balkedat least once referring to the requests as \"harassment\"he uniformly complied with Prudential's requests, and his benefits continued apace.</p>\n<p>In January 2001, Prudential, using releases provided by Richards a month earlier, requested medical records from three treating physicians Richards had previously identified in his periodic submissions to Prudential. The records request covered the period from January 1999 forward. On February 5, 2001, one of the physicians, Dr. Carol Englender, reported that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> she had not seen Richards in her office since prior to January 1999. A few weeks later, in response to Dr. Englender's information, and consistent with plans to review Richards' claim developed in March 2000, Prudential sought an independent review of Richards' claim from Dr. Gwen Brachman, whose practice included internal medicine, rheumatology and occupational medicine. After reviewing Richards' medical history, Dr. Brachman submitted a report to Prudential, concluding that although Richards qualified for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, he was not physically impaired from performing the essential functions of a sedentary job. Relying on Dr. Brachman's report, Prudential informed Richards on March 26, 2001 that he was no longer eligible for long-term disability benefits and that payments would cease as of June 1, 2001.</p>\n<p>The letter terminating Richards' benefits also contained information about the appeals process, as did a follow-up letter sent approximately one month later. Over the next three years, Richards contacted Prudential on numerous occasions. Many of the calls were requests for details on the appeals process. Others were direct requests to immediately reinstate his benefits while he prepared his appeal. Still other calls contained accusations by Richards of Prudential's professional malfeasance and threats to bring Prudential's alleged misconduct to the attention of entities ranging from the federal government to television exposé programs.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2004, Richards submitted a formal written appeal of Prudential's March 2001 decision. He set forth three arguments for reinstatement of his benefits: first, that Dr. Brachman was not only unqualified to review his disability, but that she also used improper evaluation techniques and made false statements in her review; second, that Prudential should have deferred to the opinions of Richards' treating doctors; and third, that Prudential should have given deference to the 1992 decision of the administrative law judge who awarded Richards Social Security disability benefits. Prudential denied the appeal by letter dated September 28, 2004.</p>\n<p>Responding to Richards' specific complaints, Prudential noted that Dr. Brachman specialized in occupational medicine and rheumatology, and was thus qualified to review Richards' medical records, his diagnoses of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and to offer an opinion on his ability to work. Prudential further noted that it did take the Social Security determination into consideration, but that Prudential's determinations are independent from the agency's. Prudential also indicated that it had reviewed Richards' records before making its original determination in 2001, and since three years had passed, it also considered additional records that Richards had provided since the decision. Finally, Prudential buttressed its decision by pointing to a transferable skills analysis that concluded that Richards could perform a number of sedentary occupations which fit within his education, training or experience.</p>\n<p>In response to the September 28, 2004 letter, Richards submitted a letter and additional records from one of his treating physicians, Dr. Mark Hryniewich, and requested that Prudential again review its decision. On February 8, 2005, following review of the additional materials, Prudential again informed Richards that its original decision was correct.</p>\n<p>The February 2005 letter also instructed Richards about his rights to pursue further appeals. Richards availed himself of this opportunity by submitting his second written appeal in August 2005. This appeal set forth three chief claims. First, Richards accused Prudential of ignoring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> Dr. Hryniewich's opinion that Richards' fibromyalgia had left him chronically disabled. Richards also protested the fact that Prudential did not contact Dr. Hryniewich personally. Finally, Richards claimed that Prudential's benefit termination notification was legally deficient because it lacked detailed instructions on how to appeal and explicit instructions about the particular information Richards would need to supply to get his benefits reinstated.</p>\n<p>In response, Prudential conducted another review, and again affirmed the decision to terminate Richards' benefits. Relying on a medical record review performed by its Medical Director, Dr. Richard Day, Prudential reiterated its finding that Richards could perform the duties of a sedentary job for which he was qualified. The denial letter also noted that previous neurological assessments Richards had undergone were \"completely normal, as were laboratory findings, and there were no rheumatological laboratory or physical findings consistent with synovitis or an inflammatory process.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Additionally, Prudential informed Richards of Dr. Day's opinion that any treatment he was receiving for chronic fatigue syndrome was incomplete, given the lack of cognitive behavioral therapy.<sup>[5]</sup> In connection with Dr. Day's report, Prudential also referred back to the transferable skills analysis performed the previous year, which identified a number of sedentary positions suitable for Richards, given what Prudential contended was his residual functioning capacity.</p>\n<p>Richards, this time through counsel, availed himself of Prudential's final level of appeal on January 30, 2006. In addition to repeating the claim that Richards was in fact totally disabled from performing any occupation, the appeal alleged that the previous rejectionthe September 29, 2005 decision\"did not set forth with the required specificity\" the reasons that Richards' benefits were discontinued. Also, Richards took issue with Dr. Day's reference to cognitive behavior therapy, likening it to \"years ago, [when] epileptics were locked away in institutions for the mentally insane.\" Finally, Richards' attorney asked to meet with Prudential's appeals committee prior to its decision.</p>\n<p>Although the substantive decision on Richards' last appeal was still months away, Prudential responded quickly to his attorney's missive. In a letter dated February 6, 2006, Prudential expressed its view that its various benefit termination letters adequately detailed the reasons for its decisions. Specifically, Prudential noted that its letters cited policy provisions, medical reviews and vocational assessments. Additionally, Prudential rejected Richards' demand that it contact his physicians, as it was not contractually obligated to do so and because it was unnecessary given the information already in his medical file. Further, Prudential rejected Richards' attorney's request to appear before the appeals committee, as that committee \"doesn't `meet' with claimants or their representatives; rather the panel provides a third and voluntary level of appeal review.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> Prudential originally set an April 1, 2006 deadline for Richards to submit materials in support of his final appeal. Due to various communication breakdowns regarding deadlines, Prudential extended the deadline to June 2006. Richards used the additional time to supplement the record.<sup>[6]</sup> In a letter dated June 5, 2006, one day before the deadline, Richards' attorney submitted a report from Dr. Hryniewich, dated the same day, in which he opined that Richards \"has been totally and permanently disabled from engaging in and maintaining any gainful employment activity since 1991, up to and including the present, and further, it is likely that his total and permanent disability will continue for the foreseeable future.\" Dr. Hryniewich noted that Richards \"tested positive for fibromyalgia,\" and that while symptoms could be treated with pain medication, side effects made his return to gainful employment impossible.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>During the pendency of Richards' final appeal, Prudential sought additional medical record reviews from two rheumatologists. One of these reviews, from Dr. Paul Howard, took place after receipt of Dr. Hryniewich's June 5 report. On July 18, 2006, Prudential informed Richards' attorney of its determination that the decision to terminate Richards' benefits in 2001 was appropriate.</p>\n<p>After rehashing some of the lengthy procedural history of the case, the denial letter detailed the findings of Dr. Howard and Dr. Dayton Dennis Payne, who reviewed Richards' records in April 2006. Dr. Payne's report noted Richards' diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome and fibromyalgia. He also noted Richards' myriad other symptoms, including short-term memory issues, irritable bowel syndrome, depression and possible bursitis. Dr. Payne found that Richards' records showed that his symptoms had remained \"essentially unchanged\" over the fifteen years since he began receiving benefits, and also noted the statements by others that he would \"never be able to return to gainful employment.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Payne also determined, however, that he could find no evidence of \"destructive rheumatic findings,\" or that Richards had limitation of motion in his joints, weakness or atrophy, or specific organ system abnormalities. In light of these findings, Dr. Payne concluded that: 1) the records did not support a finding of functional impairment existing from June 2001 forward; 2) the records contained no objective evidence of any disease process that would be expected to lead to any restrictions or limitations; 3) while there was no evidence of malingering, no physical examination or testing procedure revealed objective evidence of impairment; and 4) because the objective findings did not support any degree of restrictions or limitations, Richards would be expected to have age-appropriate functional capacity.</p>\n<p>Dr. Howard's report, dated July 6, 2006, noted that Richards' rheumatological symptoms between 2001 and 2006 were consistent with fibromyalgia, but that the resulting functional impairments were \"mild in nature.\" Dr. Howard noted the 1991 opinions from Dr. O'Leary and Dr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> Englender that posited that Richards' symptoms should allow him to eventually return to work. Dr. Howard also pointed out that a comprehensive physical examination conducted by Dr. Hryniewich in 2001 contained normal neurological findings, with no indication of any reported physical examination abnormalities. Regarding Dr. Hryniewich's June 2006 letter, Dr. Howard implied that its conclusion of total disability was somewhat suspect, given that a November 2005 examination yielded normal results, other than a complaint of foot pain. Additionally, Dr. Howard noted that while Dr. Hryniewich's letter cited side-effects of pain medication, the medical records themselves lacked any reference to side effects. Moreover, Dr. Howard suggested that Richards' non-compliance with recommended exercise programs deprived him of an opportunity to improve his functional capacity.</p>\n<p>Relying on what he described as an \"absence of any abnormalities by radiological study, laboratory studies and ... repeated physical examinations,\" Dr. Howard expressed his opinion that Richards, despite a \"mild degree of impairment,\" would be able to perform sedentary work involving sitting, walking occasionally, standing frequently, lifting ten pounds frequently (occasionally twenty), working at a desk, and using his hands and fingers without restriction.</p>\n<p>As noted, Prudential, relying in large measure on the opinions of Drs. Payne and Howard, rejected Richards' final appeal, concluding that \"the medical evidence overwhelmingly supports that Mr. Richards has been capable of returning to work on a full time basis in both his own occupation as well as in an alternate, gainful occupation since at least June 01, 2001.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. District court proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Richards filed suit in federal district court, seeking reinstatement of benefits retroactive to June 2001, attorneys fees, and roughly $43,000 in sanctions against Prudential for failing to provide certain documents during the administrative process. In due course, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which were referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation (\"R &amp; R\").</p>\n<p>Following a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that Prudential's motion be granted and that Richards' be denied. In the course of reaching its conclusion, the fifty-six page R &amp; R rejected Richards' arguments that Dr. Brachman was not qualified to evaluate Richards' records, that Prudential did not provide him with enough information about the benefit termination, and that Prudential improperly required Richards to supply \"objective medical evidence\" in support of his claim. Moreover, the R &amp; R refused Richards' entreaties to give special weight to the Social Security Administration's favorable benefit determination and the opinion of Dr. Hryniewich, as Richards' treating physician. The district court judge adopted the R &amp; R over Richards' objections and denied multiple motions for reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Standard of review</i></h2>\n<p>Prior to addressing the substance of Richards' grievances, the district court ruled in his favor on an important preliminary issue. The parties had disputed the applicable standard of review. Prudential sought to have the court review the administrative record for abuse of discretion, while Richards urged a more searching de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989) (\"[A] denial of benefits challenged under [29 U.S.C.] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits....\"). After a thorough review of cases addressing identical policy language from this circuit and elsewhere, the court concluded that application of the de novo standard of review was warranted. Prudential does not challenge this ruling.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Our task is to independently weigh the facts and opinions in the administrative record to determine whether the claimant has met his burden of showing that he is disabled within the meaning of the policy. We grant no deference to the administrators' opinions or conclusions. <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 518 (1st Cir.2005). In other words, we stand in the shoes of the administrator to \"determine ... whether the administrative decision was correct.\" <i>Few v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> No. 06-CV-00427-JL, 2009 WL 756211 (D.N.H. March 19, 2009); <i>cf. </i><i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir.2002) (under arbitrary and capricious review, reviewing court may not substitute its opinion for that of the plan administrator). Where, as here, review is based on the administrative record and represents an ultimate conclusion as to a claimant's disability to be drawn from the facts, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 517. Accordingly, the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor. <i>Id.</i> In sum, \"[o]ur guiding principle in conducting de novo review ... is that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving he is disabled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. Therefore, in the context of the policy definitions applicable here, Richards' burden is to prove that he is \"unable to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job\" for which he is reasonably fit by education, training or experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Appellant's claims</i></h2>\n<p>Richards makes three arguments on appeal. First, he claims that no weight was given to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions. Second, he asserts error in the failure to give \"any weight\" to the Social Security Administration's ruling in his favor. Finally, he argues that it was \"error for the court to adopt the opinion of a paper consulting physician who proffered a psychiatric condition to the plaintiff\" without justification. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Dr. Hryniewich's opinions</i></h2>\n<p>Richards complains that the district court did not give <i>any</i> weight to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions. Since we are reviewing the administrator's decision, we construe this argument as though it were directed at Prudential. Regardless, Richards' complaint about the alleged exclusion of Dr. Hryniewich's records falls short of the mark. For example, he argues that reference to Hryniewich's notes were absent from Dr. Brachman's 2001 report. Our review of the nearly 1,000-page administrative record suggests otherwise. Dr. Brachman's report explicitly mentions review of records from Richards' visits to the Fallon Clinic in Massachusetts. Included among these records were office notes from several visits with Dr. Hryniewich in 1997, 1999 and 2000 as well as Attending Physician's Statements from 1997 and 1999 in which Dr. Hryniewich informed Prudential of Richards' fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and stated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> that Richards' ability to perform work duties was \"unknown.\" Moreover, as previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's 2006 conclusion that Richards was disabled from any work was addressed by Dr. Howard during the final level of appeal.</p>\n<p>A broader reading of Richards' argument suggests that his actual grievance is that Dr. Hryniewich's conclusions should have been given <i>controlling</i> weight, especially when compared to the doctors who reviewed Richards' record without examining him. This argument is contrary to existing law, as \"the opinion of the claimant's treating physician, which was considered, is not entitled to special deference.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526 (citing <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> 538 U.S. 822, 831, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003)).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In the final analysis, Dr. Hryniewich's opinions provide a shaky foundation for Richards' claim. First, his descriptions in 1997 and 1999 of Richards' employment prospects as \"unknown\" is at odds with his later pronouncements that Richards was disabled from any employment. Similarly, office notes from 2001 and 2005 contain no reference to disability from fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, we reject Richards' arguments regarding the adequacy of the weight given to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Social Security disability determination</i></h2>\n<p>After Richards' initial application for Social Security disability benefits was denied in 1991, an administrative law judge ruled in his favor in October 1992. Richards argues that it was error to not give \"any weight\" to the fact that he was awarded Social Security disability benefits due to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue immune dysfunction. We disagree with both the factual premise of the argumentthat no weight was givenand its implied legal conclusionthat the Social Security decision inexorably leads to reversal of Prudential's decision.</p>\n<p>As a factual matter, the record suggests that Prudential did not ignore Richards' receipt of Social Security benefits. To the contrary, in rejecting Richards' first request for reconsideration in 2004, Prudential stated that its determinations \"are independent from those of the Social Security Administrations [sic] although we will review and consider documentation concerning their [sic] decisions.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Richards fares no better when the legal underpinnings of his argument are examined. Similar to his argument regarding his treating physician, Richards seems to suggest that the Social Security determination is entitled to a high degree of deference. However, in <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Co.,</i> we held that \"benefits eligibility determinations by the Social Security Administration are not binding on disability insurers.\" 230 F.3d 415, 420 (1st Cir.2000). While the Social Security determination might be relevant to an insurer's decision, \"it should not be given controlling weight except perhaps in the rare case in which the statutory criteria are identical to the criteria set forth in the insurance plan.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, Richards has not attempted a comparison between the two sets of criteria and has thus waived that strand of argument. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). Even if we were to ignore the waiver, however, the administrative law judge's ruling on Richards' application for disability benefits contains the following finding: \"The claimant retains the residual functioning capacity for <i>less than a full range</i> of sedentary work activity\" (emphasis added). Given that, in the context of this case, the policy at issue requires Richards to prove that he is disabled from <i>all</i> sedentary work, a finding that he retains the capacity for \"less than a full range\" of such work hardly bolsters his case.<sup>[11]</sup> Accordingly, we find no merit to Richards' Social Security-based argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. \"Paper consulting physicians\"</i></h2>\n<p>Richards' final argument is targeted at both the specific opinion of Dr. Brachman and, more generally, at the use of non-examining physicians to review claimant files. As to the latter, Richards argues that the policy language giving Prudential the right to have a claimant undergo a physical examination somehow limits Prudential to the use of physical exams.<sup>[12]</sup> We do not share this strained reading of the policy language, for which Richards has provided no legal support.<sup>[13]</sup> Moreover, we have squarely held that an insurer is not required to physically examine a claimant, and that benefit determinations may be based on reviews of medical records. <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526. Additionally, as in <i>Orndorf,</i> \"this is simply not a case where the only medical evidence ran in [claimant's] favor, thus casting into doubt a denial of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> In fact, while the evidence may have supported the diagnoses of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction, every reviewing, board-certified doctor, with the exception of Dr. Hryniewich, found that Richards could perform a sedentary job for which he was reasonably fit by education, training or experience.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>As to Dr. Brachman's opinion, Richards first takes issue with her medical qualifications. We are not persuaded. The record reflects that Dr. Brachman specializes in occupational medicine and rheumatology, and Richards offers no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Next, Richards argues that Brachman improperly ascribed a psychiatric conditiondepressionto him without any basis. He then asserts that Prudential used this finding to discontinue his benefits by relying on the Plan's twenty-four month maximum payment period for disabilities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> \"caused in whole or part by a mental health issue.\" Even assuming that Dr. Brachman's mental health conclusion is overstated,<sup>[15]</sup> Richards' argument nevertheless fails for two related reasons. First, while Dr. Brachman in her report discussed the medical record evidence of depression in Richards' history, she also addressed the lack of evidence of <i>physical</i> impairment, including synovitis, deformity, or decreased range of joint motion. She also noted the lack of any inflammatory vascular disease or neurocognitive impairment. Second, Prudential did not terminate Richards' benefits on the ground that he had exhausted them under the mental health provisions of the Plan. Instead, Prudential explicitly stated that it was evaluating whether his \"current physical condition prevented [him] from performing any occupation.\" In other words, regardless of Dr. Brachman's reference to Richards' mental health history, the requirement that he prove his then-current physical disability remained.</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent that Richards argues that Dr. Brachman did not review the entirety of his medical history, we note that \"the denial letter need not detail every bit of information in the record; it must have enough information to render the decision to deny benefits susceptible to judicial review.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526. Dr. Brachman's report and Prudential's termination letter easily satisfy this standard.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. CONCLUSION</i></h2>\n<p>We are not without sympathy to Richards' plight. However, the dispute in this case is not over whether Richards is afflicted with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction. And while termination of benefits after ten years of payments is a harsh outcome, it is one that Prudential was legally entitled to pursue within ERISA's strictures. The sole issue before us is whether Richards met his burden of showing that these conditions rendered him unable to perform <i>any job</i> for which he is qualified. Based on the record before us, we agree with the administrator and the district court that he has failed to meet his burden. The judgment of the district court is therefore <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.</p>\n<p>[2]  There were several named defendants, including Richards' former employer and an individual employee of Prudential. The individual defendant is no longer a party. We refer to the remaining defendants/appellees collectively as \"Prudential,\" both for convenience and because the insurer is the real party in interest in this litigation.</p>\n<p>[3]  Digital was subsequently acquired by appellee Hewlett-Packard.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"Synovitis\" is inflammation of fluid membranes in certain of the body's joint cavities and tendon sheaths. <i>Stedman's Medical Dictionary</i> 1773 (27th ed.2000).</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. Day also referred to a note from a Dr. O'Leary, which strongly opposed Richards' claim of disability. However, Dr. Day incorrectly referred to O'Leary's note as being dated April 2001, when the record reflects an actual date of April 1991. While this discrepancy might weaken somewhat the foundation of Dr. Day's opinion, it does not significantly undercut it. We address later the relevance of Dr. O'Leary's report within the overall context of the administrative record.</p>\n<p>[6]  The record also reflects that communication between Richards and Prudential had become further strained; phone logs contain notations of accusations by Richards during frequent phone calls, to which Prudential responded by communicating with him only in writing.</p>\n<p>[7]  The letter from Dr. Hryniewich was the only new medical evidence submitted to Prudential. Several other letters were little more than attacks on Prudential and its medical reviewers, or efforts \"to make Prudential aware\" of damage awards against other insurance companies, seemingly as a warning.</p>\n<p>[8]  The district court also denied Richards' motion to supplement the record with an affidavit in which he described his condition. As Richards contested this decision only in his reply brief, it is waived. <i>See </i><i>Cunningham v. Nat'l City Bank,</i> 588 F.3d 49, 54 n. 6 (1st Cir.2009) (arguments not raised in appellant's opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p>[9]  By contrast, treating physicians' opinions are ordinarily accorded deference in Social Security disability proceedings. <i>See Morales-Alejandro,</i> 486 F.3d at 700 n. 7 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2)). That deference does <i>not</i> extend, however, to a physician's opinionsuch as the one offered by Dr. Hryniewichthat a claimant is unable to work, as such an opinion is not a medical one. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  The district court made a similar pronouncement.</p>\n<p>[11]  We also note that the Social Security award was made in 1992, while Prudential's termination occurred nine years later. Although Richards points out that only Prudential terminated his benefits, he does not specify whether, or to what extent, his Social Security claim was reviewed in the years following the 1992 decision.</p>\n<p>[12]  Under the section captioned \"Claim Rules,\" the Plan provides that \"Prudential, at its own expense, has the right to examine the person whose loss is the basis of the claim. Prudential may do this when and as often as is reasonable while the claim is pending.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  Richards invokes the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem,</i> according to which ambiguous policy terms must be strictly construed against the drafter during de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Stamp v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> 531 F.3d 84, 93 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 636, 172 L.Ed.2d 639 (2008); <i>Balestracci v. NSTAR Elec. and Gas Corp.,</i> 449 F.3d 224, 231 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006). Here, however, we find no ambiguity in the policy provision giving Prudential the right to have Richards examined, such that it should be read as a requirement.</p>\n<p>[14]  As previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's definitive statements regarding Richards' incapacity came several years after the initial denial and were arguably inconsistent with his pre-termination opinions regarding Richards' employment prospects, which he at least twice described as \"unknown.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  There are, in fact, references to depression in the record dating back to the early 1990s. In Dr. Brachman's opinion, depression can lead to a magnification or exaggeration of fibromyalgia symptoms. While Richards disputes this conclusion, his brief contains no refutation to the articles upon which Dr. Brachman relied in her report.</p>\n<p>[16]  One possible basis for Richards' view is that the letter to him from Prudential lists certain records as \"included\" among those sent to Dr. Brachman, while Brachman's report contains a much larger list of records she actually reviewed.</p>\n\n</div>",

O'Leary, with whom Fitzhugh &amp; Mariani LLP was on brief, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, STAHL and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this ERISA<sup>[1]</sup> matter, Edward Richards appeals from an adverse summary judgment ruling which upheld the termination of his long-term disability benefits by Prudential Insurance Co. of America (\"Prudential\").<sup>[2]</sup> We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The Policy</i></h2>\n<p>From May 1984 until January 1991, Richards was employed by Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") as a software engineer.<sup>[3]</sup> As a benefit of his employment with DEC, Richards was offered insurance coverage under the DEC Long-Term Disability Plan (\"the Plan\"). Pursuant to the Plan, Prudential managed and administered disability claims filed by DEC employees. The Plan is governed by ERISA.</p>\n<p>To be eligible for long-term disability benefits under the Plan, a claimant must have suffered a sickness or accidental injury rendering him unable \"to perform, for wage or profit, the material and substantial duties of his occupation.\" After twenty-four months, eligibility hinges on whether the claimant is \"able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of <i>any job</i>\" for which the claimant is reasonably fit by education, training or experience (emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Richards' claim, termination and internal appeals</i></h2>\n<p>Richards applied for long-term benefits in May 1991, at the age of thirty-nine. He cited chronic fatigue immune dysfunction and fibromyalgia as the causes of his disability, which left him unable to work after January 15, 1991. Prudential accepted Richards' claim in October 1991 and commenced paying benefits retroactive to July 1991. In 1992 Richards was awarded Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p>Since the Plan required proof of ongoing disability as a condition to continued receipt of benefits, Prudential regularly required Richards to provide a statement of his current condition and releases enabling Prudential to obtain his medical records. Although Richards occasionally balkedat least once referring to the requests as \"harassment\"he uniformly complied with Prudential's requests, and his benefits continued apace.</p>\n<p>In January 2001, Prudential, using releases provided by Richards a month earlier, requested medical records from three treating physicians Richards had previously identified in his periodic submissions to Prudential. The records request covered the period from January 1999 forward. On February 5, 2001, one of the physicians, Dr. Carol Englender, reported that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*235</span> she had not seen Richards in her office since prior to January 1999. A few weeks later, in response to Dr. Englender's information, and consistent with plans to review Richards' claim developed in March 2000, Prudential sought an independent review of Richards' claim from Dr. Gwen Brachman, whose practice included internal medicine, rheumatology and occupational medicine. After reviewing Richards' medical history, Dr. Brachman submitted a report to Prudential, concluding that although Richards qualified for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, he was not physically impaired from performing the essential functions of a sedentary job. Relying on Dr. Brachman's report, Prudential informed Richards on March 26, 2001 that he was no longer eligible for long-term disability benefits and that payments would cease as of June 1, 2001.</p>\n<p>The letter terminating Richards' benefits also contained information about the appeals process, as did a follow-up letter sent approximately one month later. Over the next three years, Richards contacted Prudential on numerous occasions. Many of the calls were requests for details on the appeals process. Others were direct requests to immediately reinstate his benefits while he prepared his appeal. Still other calls contained accusations by Richards of Prudential's professional malfeasance and threats to bring Prudential's alleged misconduct to the attention of entities ranging from the federal government to television exposé programs.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2004, Richards submitted a formal written appeal of Prudential's March 2001 decision. He set forth three arguments for reinstatement of his benefits: first, that Dr. Brachman was not only unqualified to review his disability, but that she also used improper evaluation techniques and made false statements in her review; second, that Prudential should have deferred to the opinions of Richards' treating doctors; and third, that Prudential should have given deference to the 1992 decision of the administrative law judge who awarded Richards Social Security disability benefits. Prudential denied the appeal by letter dated September 28, 2004.</p>\n<p>Responding to Richards' specific complaints, Prudential noted that Dr. Brachman specialized in occupational medicine and rheumatology, and was thus qualified to review Richards' medical records, his diagnoses of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and to offer an opinion on his ability to work. Prudential further noted that it did take the Social Security determination into consideration, but that Prudential's determinations are independent from the agency's. Prudential also indicated that it had reviewed Richards' records before making its original determination in 2001, and since three years had passed, it also considered additional records that Richards had provided since the decision. Finally, Prudential buttressed its decision by pointing to a transferable skills analysis that concluded that Richards could perform a number of sedentary occupations which fit within his education, training or experience.</p>\n<p>In response to the September 28, 2004 letter, Richards submitted a letter and additional records from one of his treating physicians, Dr. Mark Hryniewich, and requested that Prudential again review its decision. On February 8, 2005, following review of the additional materials, Prudential again informed Richards that its original decision was correct.</p>\n<p>The February 2005 letter also instructed Richards about his rights to pursue further appeals. Richards availed himself of this opportunity by submitting his second written appeal in August 2005. This appeal set forth three chief claims. First, Richards accused Prudential of ignoring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> Dr. Hryniewich's opinion that Richards' fibromyalgia had left him chronically disabled. Richards also protested the fact that Prudential did not contact Dr. Hryniewich personally. Finally, Richards claimed that Prudential's benefit termination notification was legally deficient because it lacked detailed instructions on how to appeal and explicit instructions about the particular information Richards would need to supply to get his benefits reinstated.</p>\n<p>In response, Prudential conducted another review, and again affirmed the decision to terminate Richards' benefits. Relying on a medical record review performed by its Medical Director, Dr. Richard Day, Prudential reiterated its finding that Richards could perform the duties of a sedentary job for which he was qualified. The denial letter also noted that previous neurological assessments Richards had undergone were \"completely normal, as were laboratory findings, and there were no rheumatological laboratory or physical findings consistent with synovitis or an inflammatory process.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Additionally, Prudential informed Richards of Dr. Day's opinion that any treatment he was receiving for chronic fatigue syndrome was incomplete, given the lack of cognitive behavioral therapy.<sup>[5]</sup> In connection with Dr. Day's report, Prudential also referred back to the transferable skills analysis performed the previous year, which identified a number of sedentary positions suitable for Richards, given what Prudential contended was his residual functioning capacity.</p>\n<p>Richards, this time through counsel, availed himself of Prudential's final level of appeal on January 30, 2006. In addition to repeating the claim that Richards was in fact totally disabled from performing any occupation, the appeal alleged that the previous rejectionthe September 29, 2005 decision\"did not set forth with the required specificity\" the reasons that Richards' benefits were discontinued. Also, Richards took issue with Dr. Day's reference to cognitive behavior therapy, likening it to \"years ago, [when] epileptics were locked away in institutions for the mentally insane.\" Finally, Richards' attorney asked to meet with Prudential's appeals committee prior to its decision.</p>\n<p>Although the substantive decision on Richards' last appeal was still months away, Prudential responded quickly to his attorney's missive. In a letter dated February 6, 2006, Prudential expressed its view that its various benefit termination letters adequately detailed the reasons for its decisions. Specifically, Prudential noted that its letters cited policy provisions, medical reviews and vocational assessments. Additionally, Prudential rejected Richards' demand that it contact his physicians, as it was not contractually obligated to do so and because it was unnecessary given the information already in his medical file. Further, Prudential rejected Richards' attorney's request to appear before the appeals committee, as that committee \"doesn't `meet' with claimants or their representatives; rather the panel provides a third and voluntary level of appeal review.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> Prudential originally set an April 1, 2006 deadline for Richards to submit materials in support of his final appeal. Due to various communication breakdowns regarding deadlines, Prudential extended the deadline to June 2006. Richards used the additional time to supplement the record.<sup>[6]</sup> In a letter dated June 5, 2006, one day before the deadline, Richards' attorney submitted a report from Dr. Hryniewich, dated the same day, in which he opined that Richards \"has been totally and permanently disabled from engaging in and maintaining any gainful employment activity since 1991, up to and including the present, and further, it is likely that his total and permanent disability will continue for the foreseeable future.\" Dr. Hryniewich noted that Richards \"tested positive for fibromyalgia,\" and that while symptoms could be treated with pain medication, side effects made his return to gainful employment impossible.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>During the pendency of Richards' final appeal, Prudential sought additional medical record reviews from two rheumatologists. One of these reviews, from Dr. Paul Howard, took place after receipt of Dr. Hryniewich's June 5 report. On July 18, 2006, Prudential informed Richards' attorney of its determination that the decision to terminate Richards' benefits in 2001 was appropriate.</p>\n<p>After rehashing some of the lengthy procedural history of the case, the denial letter detailed the findings of Dr. Howard and Dr. Dayton Dennis Payne, who reviewed Richards' records in April 2006. Dr. Payne's report noted Richards' diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome and fibromyalgia. He also noted Richards' myriad other symptoms, including short-term memory issues, irritable bowel syndrome, depression and possible bursitis. Dr. Payne found that Richards' records showed that his symptoms had remained \"essentially unchanged\" over the fifteen years since he began receiving benefits, and also noted the statements by others that he would \"never be able to return to gainful employment.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Payne also determined, however, that he could find no evidence of \"destructive rheumatic findings,\" or that Richards had limitation of motion in his joints, weakness or atrophy, or specific organ system abnormalities. In light of these findings, Dr. Payne concluded that: 1) the records did not support a finding of functional impairment existing from June 2001 forward; 2) the records contained no objective evidence of any disease process that would be expected to lead to any restrictions or limitations; 3) while there was no evidence of malingering, no physical examination or testing procedure revealed objective evidence of impairment; and 4) because the objective findings did not support any degree of restrictions or limitations, Richards would be expected to have age-appropriate functional capacity.</p>\n<p>Dr. Howard's report, dated July 6, 2006, noted that Richards' rheumatological symptoms between 2001 and 2006 were consistent with fibromyalgia, but that the resulting functional impairments were \"mild in nature.\" Dr. Howard noted the 1991 opinions from Dr. O'Leary and Dr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> Englender that posited that Richards' symptoms should allow him to eventually return to work. Dr. Howard also pointed out that a comprehensive physical examination conducted by Dr. Hryniewich in 2001 contained normal neurological findings, with no indication of any reported physical examination abnormalities. Regarding Dr. Hryniewich's June 2006 letter, Dr. Howard implied that its conclusion of total disability was somewhat suspect, given that a November 2005 examination yielded normal results, other than a complaint of foot pain. Additionally, Dr. Howard noted that while Dr. Hryniewich's letter cited side-effects of pain medication, the medical records themselves lacked any reference to side effects. Moreover, Dr. Howard suggested that Richards' non-compliance with recommended exercise programs deprived him of an opportunity to improve his functional capacity.</p>\n<p>Relying on what he described as an \"absence of any abnormalities by radiological study, laboratory studies and ... repeated physical examinations,\" Dr. Howard expressed his opinion that Richards, despite a \"mild degree of impairment,\" would be able to perform sedentary work involving sitting, walking occasionally, standing frequently, lifting ten pounds frequently (occasionally twenty), working at a desk, and using his hands and fingers without restriction.</p>\n<p>As noted, Prudential, relying in large measure on the opinions of Drs. Payne and Howard, rejected Richards' final appeal, concluding that \"the medical evidence overwhelmingly supports that Mr. Richards has been capable of returning to work on a full time basis in both his own occupation as well as in an alternate, gainful occupation since at least June 01, 2001.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. District court proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Richards filed suit in federal district court, seeking reinstatement of benefits retroactive to June 2001, attorneys fees, and roughly $43,000 in sanctions against Prudential for failing to provide certain documents during the administrative process. In due course, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which were referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation (\"R &amp; R\").</p>\n<p>Following a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that Prudential's motion be granted and that Richards' be denied. In the course of reaching its conclusion, the fifty-six page R &amp; R rejected Richards' arguments that Dr. Brachman was not qualified to evaluate Richards' records, that Prudential did not provide him with enough information about the benefit termination, and that Prudential improperly required Richards to supply \"objective medical evidence\" in support of his claim. Moreover, the R &amp; R refused Richards' entreaties to give special weight to the Social Security Administration's favorable benefit determination and the opinion of Dr. Hryniewich, as Richards' treating physician. The district court judge adopted the R &amp; R over Richards' objections and denied multiple motions for reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Standard of review</i></h2>\n<p>Prior to addressing the substance of Richards' grievances, the district court ruled in his favor on an important preliminary issue. The parties had disputed the applicable standard of review. Prudential sought to have the court review the administrative record for abuse of discretion, while Richards urged a more searching de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1989) (\"[A] denial of benefits challenged under [29 U.S.C.] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*239</span> § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits....\"). After a thorough review of cases addressing identical policy language from this circuit and elsewhere, the court concluded that application of the de novo standard of review was warranted. Prudential does not challenge this ruling.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Our task is to independently weigh the facts and opinions in the administrative record to determine whether the claimant has met his burden of showing that he is disabled within the meaning of the policy. We grant no deference to the administrators' opinions or conclusions. <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201537\"><a href=\"/opinion/201537/orndorf-v-paul-revere-life-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.2005). In other words, we stand in the shoes of the administrator to \"determine ... whether the administrative decision was correct.\" <i>Few v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> No. 06-CV-00427-JL, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">756211</span></span> (D.N.H. March 19, 2009); <i>cf. </i><i>Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200246\"><a href=\"/opinion/200246/leahy-v-raytheon-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2002) (under arbitrary and capricious review, reviewing court may not substitute its opinion for that of the plan administrator). Where, as here, review is based on the administrative record and represents an ultimate conclusion as to a claimant's disability to be drawn from the facts, \"summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 517. Accordingly, the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor. <i>Id.</i> In sum, \"[o]ur guiding principle in conducting de novo review ... is that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving he is disabled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. Therefore, in the context of the policy definitions applicable here, Richards' burden is to prove that he is \"unable to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job\" for which he is reasonably fit by education, training or experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Appellant's claims</i></h2>\n<p>Richards makes three arguments on appeal. First, he claims that no weight was given to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions. Second, he asserts error in the failure to give \"any weight\" to the Social Security Administration's ruling in his favor. Finally, he argues that it was \"error for the court to adopt the opinion of a paper consulting physician who proffered a psychiatric condition to the plaintiff\" without justification. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Dr. Hryniewich's opinions</i></h2>\n<p>Richards complains that the district court did not give <i>any</i> weight to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions. Since we are reviewing the administrator's decision, we construe this argument as though it were directed at Prudential. Regardless, Richards' complaint about the alleged exclusion of Dr. Hryniewich's records falls short of the mark. For example, he argues that reference to Hryniewich's notes were absent from Dr. Brachman's 2001 report. Our review of the nearly 1,000-page administrative record suggests otherwise. Dr. Brachman's report explicitly mentions review of records from Richards' visits to the Fallon Clinic in Massachusetts. Included among these records were office notes from several visits with Dr. Hryniewich in 1997, 1999 and 2000 as well as Attending Physician's Statements from 1997 and 1999 in which Dr. Hryniewich informed Prudential of Richards' fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, and stated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> that Richards' ability to perform work duties was \"unknown.\" Moreover, as previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's 2006 conclusion that Richards was disabled from any work was addressed by Dr. Howard during the final level of appeal.</p>\n<p>A broader reading of Richards' argument suggests that his actual grievance is that Dr. Hryniewich's conclusions should have been given <i>controlling</i> weight, especially when compared to the doctors who reviewed Richards' record without examining him. This argument is contrary to existing law, as \"the opinion of the claimant's treating physician, which was considered, is not entitled to special deference.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526 (citing <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 831, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1965</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span> (2003)).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>In the final analysis, Dr. Hryniewich's opinions provide a shaky foundation for Richards' claim. First, his descriptions in 1997 and 1999 of Richards' employment prospects as \"unknown\" is at odds with his later pronouncements that Richards was disabled from any employment. Similarly, office notes from 2001 and 2005 contain no reference to disability from fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, we reject Richards' arguments regarding the adequacy of the weight given to Dr. Hryniewich's opinions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Social Security disability determination</i></h2>\n<p>After Richards' initial application for Social Security disability benefits was denied in 1991, an administrative law judge ruled in his favor in October 1992. Richards argues that it was error to not give \"any weight\" to the fact that he was awarded Social Security disability benefits due to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue immune dysfunction. We disagree with both the factual premise of the argumentthat no weight was givenand its implied legal conclusionthat the Social Security decision inexorably leads to reversal of Prudential's decision.</p>\n<p>As a factual matter, the record suggests that Prudential did not ignore Richards' receipt of Social Security benefits. To the contrary, in rejecting Richards' first request for reconsideration in 2004, Prudential stated that its determinations \"are independent from those of the Social Security Administrations [sic] although we will review and consider documentation concerning their [sic] decisions.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Richards fares no better when the legal underpinnings of his argument are examined. Similar to his argument regarding his treating physician, Richards seems to suggest that the Social Security determination is entitled to a high degree of deference. However, in <i>Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Co.,</i> we held that \"benefits eligibility determinations by the Social Security Administration are not binding on disability insurers.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770872\"><a href=\"/opinion/770872/carolyn-pari-fasano-v-itt-hartford-life-and-accident-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 420 (1st Cir.2000). While the Social Security determination might be relevant to an insurer's decision, \"it should not be given controlling weight except perhaps in the rare case in which the statutory criteria are identical to the criteria set forth in the insurance plan.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, Richards has not attempted a comparison between the two sets of criteria and has thus waived that strand of argument. <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). Even if we were to ignore the waiver, however, the administrative law judge's ruling on Richards' application for disability benefits contains the following finding: \"The claimant retains the residual functioning capacity for <i>less than a full range</i> of sedentary work activity\" (emphasis added). Given that, in the context of this case, the policy at issue requires Richards to prove that he is disabled from <i>all</i> sedentary work, a finding that he retains the capacity for \"less than a full range\" of such work hardly bolsters his case.<sup>[11]</sup> Accordingly, we find no merit to Richards' Social Security-based argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. \"Paper consulting physicians\"</i></h2>\n<p>Richards' final argument is targeted at both the specific opinion of Dr. Brachman and, more generally, at the use of non-examining physicians to review claimant files. As to the latter, Richards argues that the policy language giving Prudential the right to have a claimant undergo a physical examination somehow limits Prudential to the use of physical exams.<sup>[12]</sup> We do not share this strained reading of the policy language, for which Richards has provided no legal support.<sup>[13]</sup> Moreover, we have squarely held that an insurer is not required to physically examine a claimant, and that benefit determinations may be based on reviews of medical records. <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526. Additionally, as in <i>Orndorf,</i> \"this is simply not a case where the only medical evidence ran in [claimant's] favor, thus casting into doubt a denial of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> In fact, while the evidence may have supported the diagnoses of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction, every reviewing, board-certified doctor, with the exception of Dr. Hryniewich, found that Richards could perform a sedentary job for which he was reasonably fit by education, training or experience.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>As to Dr. Brachman's opinion, Richards first takes issue with her medical qualifications. We are not persuaded. The record reflects that Dr. Brachman specializes in occupational medicine and rheumatology, and Richards offers no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Next, Richards argues that Brachman improperly ascribed a psychiatric conditiondepressionto him without any basis. He then asserts that Prudential used this finding to discontinue his benefits by relying on the Plan's twenty-four month maximum payment period for disabilities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> \"caused in whole or part by a mental health issue.\" Even assuming that Dr. Brachman's mental health conclusion is overstated,<sup>[15]</sup> Richards' argument nevertheless fails for two related reasons. First, while Dr. Brachman in her report discussed the medical record evidence of depression in Richards' history, she also addressed the lack of evidence of <i>physical</i> impairment, including synovitis, deformity, or decreased range of joint motion. She also noted the lack of any inflammatory vascular disease or neurocognitive impairment. Second, Prudential did not terminate Richards' benefits on the ground that he had exhausted them under the mental health provisions of the Plan. Instead, Prudential explicitly stated that it was evaluating whether his \"current physical condition prevented [him] from performing any occupation.\" In other words, regardless of Dr. Brachman's reference to Richards' mental health history, the requirement that he prove his then-current physical disability remained.</p>\n<p>Finally, to the extent that Richards argues that Dr. Brachman did not review the entirety of his medical history, we note that \"the denial letter need not detail every bit of information in the record; it must have enough information to render the decision to deny benefits susceptible to judicial review.\" <i>Orndorf,</i> 404 F.3d at 526. Dr. Brachman's report and Prudential's termination letter easily satisfy this standard.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. CONCLUSION</i></h2>\n<p>We are not without sympathy to Richards' plight. However, the dispute in this case is not over whether Richards is afflicted with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue immune dysfunction. And while termination of benefits after ten years of payments is a harsh outcome, it is one that Prudential was legally entitled to pursue within ERISA's strictures. The sole issue before us is whether Richards met his burden of showing that these conditions rendered him unable to perform <i>any job</i> for which he is qualified. Based on the record before us, we agree with the administrator and the district court that he has failed to meet his burden. The judgment of the district court is therefore <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.</p>\n<p>[2]  There were several named defendants, including Richards' former employer and an individual employee of Prudential. The individual defendant is no longer a party. We refer to the remaining defendants/appellees collectively as \"Prudential,\" both for convenience and because the insurer is the real party in interest in this litigation.</p>\n<p>[3]  Digital was subsequently acquired by appellee Hewlett-Packard.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"Synovitis\" is inflammation of fluid membranes in certain of the body's joint cavities and tendon sheaths. <i>Stedman's Medical Dictionary</i> 1773 (27th ed.2000).</p>\n<p>[5]  Dr. Day also referred to a note from a Dr. O'Leary, which strongly opposed Richards' claim of disability. However, Dr. Day incorrectly referred to O'Leary's note as being dated April 2001, when the record reflects an actual date of April 1991. While this discrepancy might weaken somewhat the foundation of Dr. Day's opinion, it does not significantly undercut it. We address later the relevance of Dr. O'Leary's report within the overall context of the administrative record.</p>\n<p>[6]  The record also reflects that communication between Richards and Prudential had become further strained; phone logs contain notations of accusations by Richards during frequent phone calls, to which Prudential responded by communicating with him only in writing.</p>\n<p>[7]  The letter from Dr. Hryniewich was the only new medical evidence submitted to Prudential. Several other letters were little more than attacks on Prudential and its medical reviewers, or efforts \"to make Prudential aware\" of damage awards against other insurance companies, seemingly as a warning.</p>\n<p>[8]  The district court also denied Richards' motion to supplement the record with an affidavit in which he described his condition. As Richards contested this decision only in his reply brief, it is waived. <i>See </i><i>Cunningham v. Nat'l City Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204087\"><a href=\"/opinion/204087/cunningham-v-national-city-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 n. 6 (1st Cir.2009) (arguments not raised in appellant's opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p>[9]  By contrast, treating physicians' opinions are ordinarily accorded deference in Social Security disability proceedings. <i>See Morales-Alejandro,</i> 486 F.3d at 700 n. 7 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2)). That deference does <i>not</i> extend, however, to a physician's opinionsuch as the one offered by Dr. Hryniewichthat a claimant is unable to work, as such an opinion is not a medical one. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  The district court made a similar pronouncement.</p>\n<p>[11]  We also note that the Social Security award was made in 1992, while Prudential's termination occurred nine years later. Although Richards points out that only Prudential terminated his benefits, he does not specify whether, or to what extent, his Social Security claim was reviewed in the years following the 1992 decision.</p>\n<p>[12]  Under the section captioned \"Claim Rules,\" the Plan provides that \"Prudential, at its own expense, has the right to examine the person whose loss is the basis of the claim. Prudential may do this when and as often as is reasonable while the claim is pending.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  Richards invokes the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem,</i> according to which ambiguous policy terms must be strictly construed against the drafter during de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Stamp v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203356\"><a href=\"/opinion/203356/stamp-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></span> (2008); <i>Balestracci v. NSTAR Elec. and Gas Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202237\"><a href=\"/opinion/202237/balestracci-v-nstar-electric-gas/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 231 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006). Here, however, we find no ambiguity in the policy provision giving Prudential the right to have Richards examined, such that it should be read as a requirement.</p>\n<p>[14]  As previously noted, Dr. Hryniewich's definitive statements regarding Richards' incapacity came several years after the initial denial and were arguably inconsistent with his pre-termination opinions regarding Richards' employment prospects, which he at least twice described as \"unknown.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  There are, in fact, references to depression in the record dating back to the early 1990s. In Dr. Brachman's opinion, depression can lead to a magnification or exaggeration of fibromyalgia symptoms. While Richards disputes this conclusion, his brief contains no refutation to the articles upon which Dr. Brachman relied in her report.</p>\n<p>[16]  One possible basis for Richards' view is that the letter to him from Prudential lists certain records as \"included\" among those sent to Dr. Brachman, while Brachman's report contains a much larger list of records she actually reviewed.</p>\n\n</div>",
