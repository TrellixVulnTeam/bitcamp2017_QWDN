Stotter, with whom Bromley Newton, LLP, Robert\nWolkon, and Wolkon & Pascucci, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Karen L. Goodwin, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                           March 31, 2006\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge.        In 1996, a passenger airliner\n\nbound for Paris crashed in the Atlantic Ocean ten minutes after\n\ndeparting from New York.          All on board perished.          Following an\n\ninvestigation by multiple federal agencies, including the FBI, the\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable\n\ncause of the crash was an explosion in one of the fuel tanks.                 A\n\ngroup    of    the   victims'    family   members    formed     an   unofficial\n\norganization to conduct an independent investigation into the\n\ncrash.    A member of that organization, Graeme Sephton, brought the\n\npresent action under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5\n\nU.S.C.    ยง   552,   seeking    records     from   the    FBI   concerning   its\n\ninvestigation.       After almost five years of litigation and the\n\ndisclosure of nearly 600 pages of documents, the district court\n\nconcluded that the FBI had satisfied its obligation to conduct a\n\n\"reasonable\" search for documents responsive to Sephton's FOIA\n\nrequest, and accordingly granted it summary judgment.                See Sephton\n\nv. FBI, 365 F. Supp. 2d 91 (D. Mass. 2005).              For substantially the\n\nreasons offered by the district court, we affirm.\n\n              The district court's opinion provides a comprehensive\n\ndescription of the lengthy procedural and factual history of this\n\ncase.    See id. at 93-96.      We therefore confine our narrative to the\n\nessentials.\n\n              In September 1998, Sephton sent a letter to the FBI's New\n\nYork field office -- the office that had coordinated the FBI's\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\finvestigation -- requesting a list of all foreign material removed\n\nor recovered from the victims' bodies and the results of any\n\nforensic analyses performed by the FBI on such materials.        The FBI\n\ninitially located 21 pages of responsive documents, but it resisted\n\ndisclosure of those documents on the grounds that their disclosure\n\neither would interfere with an ongoing investigation, see 5 U.S.C.\n\nยง 552(b)(7)(A), or violate the secrecy of federal grand jury\n\nproceedings, see id. ยง 552(b)(3).\n\n           After exhausting his administrative remedies, Sephton\n\nfiled a federal action in July 2000 seeking disclosure of the\n\nwithheld documents and an injunction ordering the FBI to conduct a\n\nthorough, good-faith search of its records for all documents\n\nresponsive to his request.     The parties spent the next five years\n\nlitigating this case in the district court and in this court.\n\nAlong the way, the FBI relinquished the 21 pages of initially\n\nwithheld documents and conducted further searches yielding over 550\n\npages of additional documents that were subsequently delivered to\n\nSephton.    The   litigation   proceeded,   however,   because   Sephton\n\nremained unconvinced that the FBI had conducted an adequate search.\n\nBy the time the district court issued its summary judgment ruling,\n\nthe FBI had submitted four affidavits attesting to and describing\n\nits search for documents.\n\n           Scott Hodes, the Acting Unit Chief of the Litigation\n\nUnit, Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts Section, Office of Public\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fand Congressional Affairs, described the FBI's Central Records\n\nSystem (CRS) and explained how it was searched to comply with\n\nSephton's request.     Hodes's successor, Christine Kiefer, described\n\nthe   main   file   concerning   the    1996   crash   and   how   that   file,\n\ncontaining 80,000 pages, was organized into 97 sub-files.                  She\n\nstated that the FBI had reviewed the list of sub-files and had\n\nidentified one particular sub-file, containing over 2,000 pages, as\n\nthe likely repository of the records Sephton sought.                 She also\n\nstated that a paralegal had searched this sub-file \"page-by-page.\"\n\nEileen Rawlinson, supervisor of the Legal Unit of the Freedom of\n\nInformation-Privacy Acts Group in New York, explained how the FBI\n\nhad initially overlooked 550 pages of responsive documents that\n\nwere later provided to Sephton.              She also described the FBI's\n\nfurther search efforts, including a \"line-by-line\" review of the\n\npreviously identified sub-file as well as a review of certain\n\nrecords located in other areas of the main file.                    The final\n\naffidavit, from Gregory Carl, Unit Chief of the Explosive Unit,\n\nScientific Analysis Section, Laboratory Unit, rebutted certain\n\nclaims made in Sephton's summary judgment submissions. Carl stated\n\nthat the FBI Laboratory has not, since 1995, maintained any records\n\nsystems containing records not reflected in the CRS.\n\n             The parties disputed before the district court whether\n\nthese affidavits established as a matter of law that the FBI had\n\nadequately searched for documents responsive to Sephton's FOIA\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\frequest.    Applying our precedent, the district court recognized\n\nthat although Sephton might prefer the FBI to search every file\n\nthat    might    conceivably      contain      responsive       information,     FOIA\n\nrequires a \"reasonable\" search, not an exhaustive one. See Maynard\n\nv. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 559 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The crucial issue is\n\nnot    whether   relevant       documents    might     exist,    but   whether    the\n\nagency's search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested\n\ndocuments.\")      (internal      quotation     marks    omitted).        The   court\n\nreviewed the four FBI affidavits and found that they collectively\n\ndescribe, \"in a detailed and nonconclusory fashion, the structure\n\nof the agency's file system, the scope of the search performed, and\n\nthe method by which it was conducted.\"            Sephton, 365 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n97    (setting   forth    the    Maynard     standard    for     establishing     the\n\nadequacy of an agency's search at the summary judgment stage). The\n\ncourt further found that Sephton's affidavits were insufficient to\n\nrebut the presumption of good faith that FOIA attaches to agency\n\naffidavits.      Id. at 97, 100; see Maynard, 986 F.2d at 560 (holding\n\nthat when an agency seeks summary judgment based on reasonably\n\ndetailed affidavits establishing that it conducted a reasonably\n\nthorough    search,      \"the    FOIA   requester      can   rebut     the   agency's\n\naffidavit[s] only by showing that the agency's search was not made\n\nin good faith\").      Concluding that the FBI's search had met the FOIA\n\nstandard, the court granted its motion for summary judgment.\n\nSephton, 365 F. Supp. 2d at 101.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                  On appeal, Sephton challenges the district court's ruling\n\nthat the FBI's search was adequate.                Our review of this ruling is\n\nde novo.          See Church of Scientology Int'l v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,\n\n30 F.3d 224, 228 (1994).            Because we agree that the FOIA standard\n\nwas met, for largely the reasons expressed in the district court's\n\ncogent opinion, we see no utility in replicating its sound analysis\n\nhere.        See Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 101 F.3d\n\n218,        220   (1st   Cir.   1996)   (\"[W]hen    a   lower   court   produces   a\n\ncomprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\").1             We write briefly, however, to address one\n\nargument raised by Sephton on appeal that he did not raise before\n\nthe district court.\n\n                  Sephton contends that, by operation of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n8(d), the FBI's failure to file an answer to his FOIA complaint\n\namounts to an admission to all of the allegations contained in the\n\ncomplaint, including the allegation that \"the FBI acted in bad\n\nfaith when, in response to plaintiff Sephton's legitimate FOIA\n\nrequest . . . it did not conduct an adequate search of its records\n\n. . . .\"          The FBI counters that Sephton forfeited this argument by\n\n\n        1\n      Because we agree that the FBI's affidavits establish that\ncopies of all potentially responsive documents -- including\ndocuments originating from the FBI's Washington, D.C. offices --\nwould have been stored in the CRS and that the FBI adequately\nsearched the CRS, we need not consider Sephton's contention that\nthe FBI had an obligation to search offices other than its New York\noffice, the office to which the FOIA request was directed.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fnot raising it below.   See B&T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Public Srv.\n\nMutual Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          The issue is foreit and does not call for an exercise of\n\nour power to correct plain errors.    See Chestnut v. City of Lowell,\n\n305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc per curiam).   At least two\n\nother circuits have held that FOIA does not require an answer to\n\nthe complaint so long as the issues are otherwise joined, for\n\nexample, by the filing a dispositive motion.        See Chilivis v.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Comm'n, 673 F.2d 1205, 1209 (11th Cir.\n\n1982) (filing a motion to dismiss satisfies FOIA's requirement that\n\nthe agency file an answer or \"otherwise plead\"); Weber v. T.R.\n\nConey, 642 F.2d 91, 93-94 (5th Cir. 1981) (same with respect to a\n\nmotion for summary judgment). We needn't expressly adopt or reject\n\nthat proposition here; in light of the above precedent and the\n\nlanguage in the statute allowing an agency to \"answer or otherwise\n\nplead,\" 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(C), it was not plain error for the\n\ndistrict court to consider the issues joined upon the FBI's filing\n\nof a motion for summary judgment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

After almost five years of litigation and the disclosure of nearly 600 pages of documents, the district court concluded that the FBI had satisfied its obligation to conduct a \"reasonable\" search for documents responsive to Sephton's FOIA request, and accordingly granted it summary judgment. <i>See Sephton v. FBI,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2426794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2426794/sephton-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2005). For substantially the reasons offered by the district court, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion provides a comprehensive description of the lengthy procedural and factual history of this case. <i>See id.</i> at 93-96. We therefore confine our narrative to the essentials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1998, Sephton sent a letter to the FBI's New York field office &#8212; the office that had coordinated the FBI's investigation &#8212; requesting a list of all foreign material removed or recovered from the victims' bodies and the results of any forensic analyses performed by the FBI on such materials. The FBI initially located 21 pages of responsive documents, but it resisted disclosure of those documents on the grounds that their disclosure either would interfere with an ongoing investigation, <i>see</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(7)(A), or violate the secrecy of federal grand jury proceedings, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 552(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Sephton filed a federal action in July 2000 seeking disclosure of the withheld documents and an injunction ordering the FBI to conduct a thorough, good-faith search of its records for all documents responsive to his request. The parties spent the next five years litigating this case in the district court and in this court. Along the way, the FBI relinquished the 21 pages of initially withheld documents and conducted further searches yielding over 550 pages of additional documents that were subsequently delivered to Sephton. The litigation proceeded, however, because Sephton remained unconvinced that the FBI had conducted an adequate search. By the time the district court issued its summary judgment ruling, the FBI had submitted four affidavits attesting to and describing its search for documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Hodes, the Acting Unit Chief of the Litigation Unit, Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts Section, Office of Public and Congressional Affairs, described the FBI's Central Records System (CRS) and explained how it was searched to comply with Sephton's request. Hodes's successor, Christine Kiefer, described the main file concerning the 1996 crash and how that file, containing 80,000 pages, was organized into 97 sub-files. She stated that the FBI had reviewed the list of sub-files and had identified one particular sub-file, containing over 2,000 pages, as the likely repository of the records Sephton sought. She also stated that a paralegal had searched this sub-file \"page-by-page.\" Eileen Rawlinson, supervisor of the Legal Unit of the Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts Group in New York, explained how the FBI had initially overlooked 550 pages of responsive documents that were later provided to Sephton. She also described the FBI's further search efforts, including a \"line-by-line\" review of the previously identified sub-file as well as a review of certain records located in other areas of the main file. The final affidavit, from Gregory Carl, Unit Chief of the Explosive Unit, Scientific Analysis Section, Laboratory Unit, rebutted certain claims made in Sephton's summary judgment submissions. Carl stated that the FBI Laboratory has not, since 1995, maintained any records systems containing records not reflected in the CRS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disputed before the district court whether these affidavits established as a matter of law that the FBI had adequately searched for documents responsive to Sephton's FOIA request. Applying our precedent, the district court recognized that although Sephton might prefer the FBI to search every file that might conceivably contain responsive information, FOIA requires a \"reasonable\" search, not an exhaustive one. <i>See Maynard v. CIA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600729\"><a href=\"/opinion/600729/beatrice-maynard-v-central-intelligence-agency-beatrice-maynard-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 559 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The crucial issue is not whether relevant documents might exist, but whether the agency's search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The court reviewed the four FBI affidavits and found that they collectively describe, \"in a detailed and nonconclusory fashion, the structure of the agency's file system, the scope of the search performed, and the method by which it was conducted.\" <i>Sephton,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 97 (setting forth the <i>Maynard</i> standard for establishing the adequacy of an agency's search at the summary judgment stage). The court further found that Sephton's affidavits were insufficient to rebut the presumption of good faith that FOIA attaches to agency affidavits. <i>Id.</i> at 97, 100; <i>see Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 560 (holding that when an agency seeks summary judgment based on reasonably detailed affidavits establishing that it conducted a reasonably thorough search, \"the FOIA requester can rebut the agency's affidavit[s] only by showing that the agency's search was not made in good faith\"). Concluding that the FBI's search had met the FOIA standard, the court granted its motion for summary judgment. <i>Sephton,</i> 365 F.Supp.2d at 101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Sephton challenges the district court's ruling that the FBI's search was adequate. Our review of this ruling is de novo. <i>See Church of Scientology Int'l v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195518\"><a href=\"/opinion/195518/church-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 228 (1994). Because we agree that the FOIA standard was met, for largely the reasons expressed in the district court's cogent opinion, we see no utility in replicating its sound analysis here. <i>See Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197113\"><a href=\"/opinion/197113/lawton-v-state-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[W]hen a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We write briefly, however, to address one argument raised by Sephton on appeal that he did not raise before the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sephton contends that, by operation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d), the FBI's failure to file an answer to his FOIA complaint amounts to an admission to all of the allegations contained in the complaint, including the allegation that \"the FBI acted in bad faith when, in response to plaintiff Sephton's legitimate FOIA request ... it did not conduct an adequate search of its records. . . .\" The FBI counters that Sephton forfeited this argument by not raising it below. <i>See B &amp; T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Public Srv. Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201229\"><a href=\"/opinion/201229/bt-masonry-construc-v-public-service-mutua/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is foreit and does not call for an exercise of our power to correct plain errors. <i>See Chestnut v. City of Lowell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779262\"><a href=\"/opinion/779262/craig-chestnut-v-city-of-lowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc per curiam). At least two other circuits have held that FOIA does not require an answer to the complaint so long as the issues are otherwise joined, for example, by the filing a dispositive motion. <i>See Chilivis v. Securities and Exchange Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span>, 1209 (11th Cir.1982) (filing a motion to dismiss satisfies FOIA's requirement that the agency file an answer or \"otherwise plead\"); <i>Weber v. T.R. Coney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387433\"><a href=\"/opinion/387433/leona-weber-v-t-r-coney-us-marshall-and-j-a-tony-canales-us/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 93-94 (5th Cir.1981) (same with respect to a motion for summary judgment). We needn't expressly adopt or reject that proposition here; in light of the above precedent and the language in the statute allowing an agency to \"answer or otherwise plead,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(C), it was not plain error for the district court to consider the issues joined upon the FBI's filing of a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because we agree that the FBI's affidavits establish that copies of all potentially responsive documents &#8212; including documents originating from the FBI's Washington, D.C. offices&#8212;would have been stored in the CRS and that the FBI adequately searched the CRS, we need not consider Sephton's contention that the FBI had an obligation to search offices other than its New York office, the office to which the FOIA request was directed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
