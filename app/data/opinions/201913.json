Howard with whom Howard & Bowie, P.A. was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                           November 4, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BOUDIN,    Chief   Judge.       This    appeal   arises    from   the\n\nsinking of a fishing vessel, the M/V SAILOR (\"SAILOR\"), while\n\ndocked at the Rockland Fish Pier (\"Fish Pier\") owned by the City of\n\nRockland,   Maine     (\"Rockland\").     A    jury    found   that     Rockland's\n\nnegligence caused the sinking, and it awarded damages to the\n\ncompany that owned the vessel in the amount of $202,088.                Rockland\n\nnow appeals, seeking reversal of the district judge's denial of its\n\nmotions for judgment as a matter of law or new trial or, in the\n\nalternative, for remittitur of the damages award.\n\n            SAILOR was a 75-foot \"scalloper,\" owned, through his\n\ncompany, by Gary Hatch and captained by Myron Benner.                  The Fish\n\nPier was initially operated through a lease agreement by Water\n\nStreet Management (\"Water Street\"), but on January 1, 2002, the\n\nlease was terminated and Rockland assumed full operation and\n\nmanagement of the Fish Pier.\n\n            SAILOR docked at the Fish Pier on February 9, 2002, in\n\nits assigned berth.      On February 12, 2002, Hatch and Benner moved\n\nSAILOR from its assigned berth to the take-out berth (a common\n\nberth that is primarily used for the unloading of hauls), where it\n\nremained until the early morning of February 16, 2002.                 Sometime\n\nduring the night or morning the hull of the SAILOR was pierced by\n\nan exposed bolt on the Fish Pier, causing the vessel to sink.\n\n            Hatch filed suit against Rockland on October 10, 2003, in\n\nMaine state court, and Rockland, invoking general maritime law,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fremoved the case to federal district court.               Partial summary\n\njudgment was granted in Rockland's favor limiting liability to the\n\nfair market value of the SAILOR prior to sinking.          At the close of\n\ntrial,    the   jury,   using   a   special   verdict   form,   found   that\n\nRockland's negligence had caused the sinking and that Hatch had not\n\nbeen negligent.    The jury set the fair market value of the SAILOR,\n\nincluding prejudgment interest, at $202,088.\n\n            On this appeal, Rockland seeks reversal of the district\n\ncourt's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law or new\n\ntrial, or in the alternative, a remand to the district court for a\n\nnew trial to apportion fault between Rockland and SAILOR.               As a\n\nfinal alternative, Rockland requests a remittitur, contending that\n\nthe damage award is not supported by the evidence.         The remittitur\n\nwould give Hatch the choice of accepting a lower figure fixed by\n\nthe court or facing a new trial on damages.\n\n            Our review is de novo as to the motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.     Nonetheless, \"our scrutiny of the jury verdict is\n\ntightly circumscribed; we will reverse only 'if a reasonable person\n\ncould not have reached the conclusion of the jury.'\"              Foisy v.\n\nRoyal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 356 F.3d 141, 145 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting White v. N.H. Dept. of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).    As to the motion for new trial, we review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, bearing in mind that a district court \"may set aside a\n\njury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is so\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fclearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice.\"    Rivera Castillo v. Autokirey,\n\nInc., 379 F.3d 4, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Federico v. Order of\n\nSaint Benedict in Rhode Island, 64 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n          The legal framework as to negligence in this situation is\n\nstraightforward.   The wharf owner must exercise the diligence to\n\nmaintain its berths in a safe manner and to remove any \"dangerous\n\nobstruction\" or warn of its existence.    Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v.\n\nP.R. Ports Auth., 295 F.3d 108, 114-15 (1st Cir. 2002).        This\n\nextends to dangerous conditions of which the wharf owner knows or\n\nshould have known.   Smith v. Burnett, 173 U.S. 430, 433 (1899).\n\nYet the vessel too must use \"ordinary care,\" avoiding dangerous\n\nconditions that are known to the operator or are obvious. Id.; Pan\n\nAm. Grain Mfg., 295 F.3d at 115.\n\n          On appeal, Rockland first objects to the finding that its\n\nnegligence caused the sinking. The jury heard evidence that before\n\nRockland took over the wharf, it did not perform necessary repair\n\nand maintenance requested by Water Street, and that after it took\n\nover there was no policy of inspection or maintenance; Water Street\n\nhad performed such functions regularly.   The city manager conceded\n\nthat the Fish Pier was in \"disarray\" when the city began its own\n\nmanagement, which it regarded as a \"caretaker\" role until a new\n\noperator could be found.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f            Although the jury thus had ample basis to find negligence\n\nby Rockland in the operation of the wharf, causation was a closer\n\nquestion.    Hatch's position at trial was that the take-out berth\n\nshould have had \"camels\"--logs shielded by rubber tires--to keep\n\nvessels from rubbing against the concrete piers; alternatively,\n\nHatch charged that it was negligent for Rockland to allow an\n\nexposed bolt to protrude from the pier.      Both theories assumed,\n\nwith adequate basis in the evidence, that the SAILOR had chafed\n\nagainst an exposed bolt which ultimately holed the vessel and\n\ncaused her sinking.\n\n            The first theory was weak; the absence at the take-out\n\nberth of camels, present in regular berths, seemingly facilitated\n\nunloading and anyhow this absence was obvious to Hatch and Benner.\n\nIn fact, Hatch placed two polyethylene buffer balls (\"polyballs\")\n\nbetween SAILOR and the pier, although in the end this proved\n\ninsufficient to protect the vessel.    There were also chafe boards\n\non the side of the pier--a further precaution: it appears likely\n\nthat one board was absent or split during the night and that a\n\nbolt, thus exposed, was the immediate cause of the sinking.1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      From the photographs and descriptions in evidence, it appears\nthat the piers are solid concrete, covered with a deck of wooden\nplanking.    The wooden planking extends beyond the concrete on\neither side, and wooden pilings extend down from the planking into\nthe water, lining the concrete railroad-tie-style; it is to these\npilings that the chafe boards are bolted.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f              Hatch's second theory (that the exposed bolt bespoke\n\ncausal negligence on the part of Rockland) is sufficient, given the\n\ndeference due to a jury's factfinding.                 N.H. Dept. of Corr., 221\n\nF.3d at 259.     The situation is confused because the chafe board may\n\nhave been in place on the afternoon before the sinking and split\n\nduring the night.          If the board was missing in the afternoon, then\n\nthe bolt was already exposed, and Rockland now argues that it was\n\nan obvious hazard that should have led Hatch to remove either the\n\nbolt or the vessel; if the board split off during the night, then\n\nRockland says it was not negligent in failing to cope with a new\n\nhazard of which it was not aware.\n\n              However, the guilty bolt lay close to the water at low\n\ntide, and assuming the board was not in place, this could have been\n\na    hazard   that     a    regular    wharf-owner      inspection     would   have\n\ndiscovered and dealt with, yet it could still not have been obvious\n\nto Hatch and Benner from the deck of a large vessel.                   And, if the\n\nboard was present but was chafed away at night, the jury could have\n\ninferred negligence in maintaining the boards.                     Absent contrary\n\nevidence, it is a permissible inference that a properly maintained\n\nboard   would    not       suddenly   break    apart    in   the   normal   weather\n\nconditions that prevailed.            Or at least a reasonable jury could so\n\nconclude, which is all that is necessary.                Autokirey, 379 F.3d at\n\n9.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             Rockland's    stronger     argument--but    not   quite   strong\n\nenough--is that SAILOR's own negligence was the true cause, or at\n\nleast a contributing cause, of the accident.            Under maritime law,\n\nthe former would arguably eliminate liability for Rockland and the\n\nlatter would permit an apportionment of damages.           Carey v. Bahama\n\nCruise Lines, 864 F.2d 201, 207-08 (1st Cir. 1988).              The evidence\n\nraised a set of doubts about the conduct of Hatch and his captain,\n\nany of which might have persuaded a jury of their negligence; but\n\nnone    of   them   compelled    that    conclusion.      We   address    them\n\nindividually.\n\n             First, Hatch moored the vessel for several days at the\n\ntake-out berth, which plainly had no camel.         If the chafe board was\n\nalready missing or damaged and if the exposed bolt was readily\n\nvisible from the deck, arguably Hatch could not reasonably have\n\nleft the situation as it was; however, there is no conclusive proof\n\nthat these premises are correct.          Alternatively, a jury might have\n\nthought that the two polyballs employed by Hatch were not enough;\n\nbut nothing in the evidence (there were conflicting expert opinions\n\non the issue) clearly compelled that conclusion.\n\n             Rockland also criticizes the amount of slack that Hatch\n\nleft in the lines that moored the SAILOR to the pier, arguing that\n\nit was excessive and allowed the SAILOR to chafe against the pier\n\nmore than usual, contributing to the wearing away of the chafe\n\nboard   or   SAILOR's     hull   (or   both).    Once   again,    there   were\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fconflicting expert opinions presented at trial on the sufficiency\n\nof the mooring: Hatch (testifying as an expert) stated that the\n\nconditions on the evening in question were normal, and that the\n\nSAILOR was tied up according to his usual practice; Rockland's\n\nexpert     testified    that     the    mooring    was,   in     his   opinion,\n\ninsufficient.     The jury was entitled to credit Hatch's expert\n\ntestimony over Rockland's.\n\n            Next, Rockland's brief on appeal says that there was worm\n\ndamage to the vessel and that the repair measures (e.g., sheathing)\n\nhad not been adequate to prevent a weakening of the boards where\n\nthe bolt had pierced the hull.            But whether the repair measures\n\nwere negligent and whether the weakened boards played a causal role\n\nwere hardly clear-cut.         Again, this was a choice for the jury.\n\n            Finally, it is claimed that SAILOR's owner or captain had\n\na duty \"to tend\" the vessel--Rockland's suggestion being that one\n\nof the two should have visited the vessel overnight, checked the\n\nlines, and discovered and remedied any undue movement and chafing\n\nagainst the pier.       That a vessel-owner or operator has a duty of\n\nreasonable care in securing the vessel is well-established, Smith,\n\n173 U.S. at 433, but there is no law that this automatically\n\nrequires    overnight    visits    to    the   vessel   nor    any   showing   of\n\ncircumstances in this case that required the jury to find such\n\nvisits necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f          We conclude that the district court properly refused to\n\noverturn the jury's verdict as to liability.    In some cases, the\n\nevidence might preclude judgment as a matter of law and yet lean so\n\nheavily in the other direction so as to justify a district judge in\n\nordering a new trial.    9A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure: Civil 2d § 2531 (1995); Nat'l Car Rental Sys. v. Better\n\nMonkey Grip Co., 511 F.2d 724, 730-31 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423\n\nU.S. 894 (1975).   It would be much rarer to find that the district\n\njudge, who observed the trial, had \"abused his discretion\" (the\n\nrelevant standard) in refusing to order a new trial.   E.g. Lama v.\n\nBorras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir. 1994).   No such abuse occurred\n\nin this case.\n\n          Damages are the final target of Rockland's appeal.   The\n\ntreatment of damages by a federal appellate court is potentially\n\ncomplicated in at least two ways: first, the curious limitation\n\nthat requires use of remittitur (as opposed to judgment as a matter\n\nof law) to remedy an excessive verdict, 11 Wright, Miller & Kane,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d § 2815, at 159-60 (1995);\n\nand second, some arguable tension in the case law as to the\n\nstandard of review of a denial of remittitur by the district court:\n\ncommonly, courts say that review is for \"abuse of discretion,\" but\n\nthe problem and some of the case law may be more subtle.\n\n          We need not pursue these issues because, in the present\n\nappeal, Rockland has invoked a test taken from our case law,\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fnamely, that a \"jury's damage award should be upset if [quoting\n\nfrom our decision] it 'exceeds any rational appraisal or estimate\n\nof the damages that could be based upon the evidence . . . .'\n\nWortley v. Camplin, 333 F.3d 284, 297 (1st Cir. 2003).\"     Hatch has\n\npointed to the same language in his answering brief, and we use\n\nthis as an undisputed standard.\n\n          In this case, the jury award was for $202,088.      But as\n\nthe district court pointed out (in its post-judgment decision on\n\nremittitur), the jury was told that prejudgment interest could be\n\nincluded in its discretion.   Carey, 864 F.2d at 208 n.6.    Working\n\nbackward from the specified rate of annual interest, the district\n\ncourt deemed it reasonable to impute a value of $168,929 to the\n\nvessel, with the balance representing interest on this figure.\n\nHatch argues on appeal that--using somewhat different formulas and\n\nassumptions as to dates--the jury may have found a vessel value as\n\nlow as $161,000.\n\n          Rockland grumbles about the assumption that the jury did\n\nin fact allow for prejudgment interest, but the assumption does not\n\nturn on mind-reading of the jury: the verdict is not irrational if\n\nunder the governing law the evidence permitted a rational jury to\n\nimpose liability and award damages in the amount reflected in the\n\nverdict. If the evidence permitted the jury's result, then whether\n\nthe jury reasoned properly in reaching it is a matter over which\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe law ordinarily draws a veil.       See Fed. R. Evid. 606(b); Ramos\n\nv. Davis & Geck, Inc., 224 F.3d 30, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          In   this   case,   the   jury   was   offered   much    evidence\n\nsupporting a value of the vessel well under $169,000.             Hatch had\n\npurchased the SAILOR two years before the sinking for $35,000, and\n\nit was apparently insured for an \"agreed value\" of $50,000 at the\n\ntime of its loss.     Yet there had been refurbishment in 2001, also\n\nthe subject of evidence, and the issue was the refurbished vessel's\n\nfair market value at the time it sank, which could easily be well\n\nabove the original purchase price.\n\n          At trial, Rockland's expert estimated the value of the\n\nvessel just before its sinking as between $80,000 and $100,000.\n\nHatch's expert made his own estimate of $120,000; but he was called\n\nby Rockland, not Hatch, and his testimony did not prevent the jury\n\nfrom awarding more, if more was rationally supported by evidence.\n\nThe evidence for a higher figure was furnished by Hatch himself:\n\nciting his own experience as a captain and maritime surveyor, he\n\nopined as an expert witness that the vessel had been worth between\n\n$166,000 and $189,000; indeed, he later adjusted his testimony to\n\nsupport a figure as high as $199,000.\n\n          Obviously, Hatch was subject to being discredited, both\n\nbecause of his patent self-interest and because both of the other\n\nexperts had arrived at lower figures.        E.g., Shane v. Shane, 891\n\nF.2d 976, 982 (1st Cir. 1989).        But Rockland does not deny that\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fHatch was entitled to testify as an expert, and the jury was free\n\nto weigh the credentials of the witnesses and the cogency of the\n\nbases given for their opinions.       This is the kind of fact and\n\ncredibility judgment on which the jury is ordinarily entitled to\n\ngreat latitude.   See Primus v. Galgano, 329 F.3d 236, 244-45 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n          The latitude is not unlimited: one can imagine a case\n\nwhere, when the details of the testimony are examined, a jury could\n\nrationally accept one expert's view but could not accept the\n\nother's. See Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1105\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1190 (1995).           Here,\n\nRockland's brief makes no effort to set out the reasoning of the\n\nexperts and explain why its expert's discussion is compelling and\n\nHatch's so weak that no rational jury could accept it.       Without\n\nsuch a showing, we have no basis for saying that Hatch's estimate\n\nof $166,000-$189,000 had to be disregarded.\n\n          The verdict rendered by the jury--attributing to it a\n\nvalue of $169,000 for the vessel--fits within Hatch's estimate.\n\nFrom the surface facts, it appears that the jury was generous in\n\naccepting Hatch's estimate over and above the more modest figure\n\noffered by Rockland's expert and the expert whom Hatch himself\n\nretained but did not proffer as a witness.    Yet this does not show\n\nthat the jury acted irrationally.     Autokirey, 379 F.3d at 13.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f           As a tail-end argument, Rockland complains that it was\n\nunreasonably limited in cross-examining Hatch.         The district court\n\ndid permit considerable cross-examination into Hatch's experience\n\nand history.     However, when Rockland's counsel sought to cross-\n\nexamine Hatch as to whether he had been involved in the sinking of\n\ntwo other vessels before SAILOR's demise, the district court\n\nsustained an objection to the line of inquiry under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n403.   That provision gives the district judge ample discretion to\n\nexclude testimony where its probity is substantially outweighed by\n\nprejudice, confusion or the like.\n\n           What Rockland fails to mention is that before ruling on\n\nthe objection, the court inquired whether Rockland intended to\n\nbring out evidence that Hatch had been negligent in connection with\n\nthe earlier sinkings.       Rockland conceded that it had no such\n\nevidence, and it did not suggest that it expected to adduce it from\n\nHatch.   Absent such evidence, the threshold relevance of the prior\n\nsinkings   is   not   apparent,   and    Rockland's   brief   furnishes   no\n\nexplanation of the relevance of the questions.          Nothing more need\n\nbe said on the Rule 403 determination.\n\n           The district judge suggested that, on these facts, he\n\nwould not have ruled this way.          Indeed, this is a close case for\n\napportioning all fault to Rockland, and one's confidence in the\n\nresult is not increased by the rather generous damages award.\n\nHowever, we put our faith in juries to resolve close cases, and\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\falthough the appeal has been ably briefed, the jury verdict is not\n\nirrational.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\f",

A jury found that Rockland's negligence caused the sinking, and it awarded damages to the company that owned the vessel in the amount of $202,088. Rockland now appeals, seeking reversal of the district judge's denial of its motions for judgment as a matter of law or new trial or, in the alternative, for remittitur of the damages award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SAILOR was a 75-foot \"scalloper,\" owned, through his company, by Gary Hatch and captained by Myron Benner. The Fish Pier was initially operated through a lease agreement by Water Street Management (\"Water Street\"), but on January 1, 2002, the lease was terminated and Rockland assumed full operation and management of the Fish Pier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SAILOR docked at the Fish Pier on February 9, 2002, in its assigned berth. On February 12, 2002, Hatch and Benner moved SAILOR from its assigned berth to the take-out berth (a common berth that is primarily used for the unloading of hauls), where it remained until the early morning of February 16, 2002. Sometime during the night or morning the hull of the SAILOR was pierced by an exposed bolt on the Fish Pier, causing the vessel to sink.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch filed suit against Rockland on October 10, 2003, in Maine state court, and Rockland, invoking general maritime law, removed the case to federal district court. Partial summary judgment was granted in Rockland's favor limiting liability to the fair market value of the SAILOR prior to sinking. At the close of trial, the jury, using a special verdict form, found that Rockland's negligence had caused the sinking and that Hatch had not been negligent. The jury set the fair market value of the SAILOR, including prejudgment interest, at $202,088.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Rockland seeks reversal of the district court's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial, or in the alternative, a remand to the district court for a new trial to apportion fault between Rockland and SAILOR. As a final alternative, Rockland requests a remittitur, contending that the damage award is not supported by the evidence. The remittitur would give Hatch the choice of accepting a lower figure fixed by the court or facing a new trial on damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is <i>de novo</i> as to the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Nonetheless, \"our scrutiny of the jury verdict is tightly circumscribed; we will reverse only `if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.'\" <i>Foisy v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co.,</i> 356 F.3d 141, 145 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>White v. N.H. Dept. of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2000)). As to the motion for new trial, we review for abuse of discretion, bearing in mind that a district court \"may set aside a jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Rivera Castillo v. Autokirey, Inc.,</i> 379 F.3d 4, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Federico v. Order of Saint Benedict in Rhode Island,</i> 64 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal framework as to negligence in this situation is straightforward. The wharf owner must exercise diligence to maintain its berths in a safe manner and to remove any \"dangerous obstruction\" or warn of its existence. <i>Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 295 F.3d 108, 114-15 (1st Cir.2002). This extends to dangerous conditions of which the wharf owner knows or should have known. <i>Smith v. Burnett,</i> 173 U.S. 430, 433, 19 S.Ct. 442, 43 L.Ed. 756 (1899). Yet the vessel too must use \"ordinary care,\" avoiding dangerous conditions that are known to the operator or are obvious. <i>Id.; Pan Am. Grain Mfg.,</i> 295 F.3d at 115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rockland first objects to the finding that its negligence caused the sinking. The jury heard evidence that before Rockland took over the wharf, it did not perform necessary repair and maintenance requested by Water Street, and that after it took over there was no policy of inspection or maintenance; Water Street had performed such functions regularly. The city manager conceded that the Fish Pier was in \"disarray\" when the city began its own management, which it regarded as a \"caretaker\" role until a new operator could be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the jury thus had ample basis to find negligence by Rockland in the operation of the wharf, causation was a closer question. Hatch's position at trial was that the take-out berth should have had \"camels\" &#8212; logs shielded by rubber tires &#8212; to keep vessels from rubbing against the concrete piers; alternatively, Hatch charged that it was negligent for Rockland to allow an exposed bolt to protrude from the pier. Both theories assumed, with adequate basis in the evidence, that the SAILOR had chafed against an exposed bolt which ultimately holed the vessel and caused her sinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first theory was weak; the absence at the take-out berth of camels, present in regular berths, seemingly facilitated unloading and anyhow this absence was obvious to Hatch and Benner. In fact, Hatch placed two polyethylene buffer balls (\"polyballs\") between SAILOR and the pier, although in the end this proved insufficient to protect the vessel. There were also chafe boards on the side of the pier &#8212; a further precaution: it appears likely that one board was absent or split during the night and that a bolt, thus exposed, was the immediate cause of the sinking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch's second theory (that the exposed bolt bespoke causal negligence on the part of Rockland) is sufficient, given the deference due to a jury's factfinding. <i>N.H. Dept. of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d at 259. The situation is confused because the chafe board may have been in place on the afternoon before the sinking and split during the night. If the board was missing in the afternoon, then the bolt was already exposed, and Rockland now argues that it was an obvious hazard that should have led Hatch to remove either the bolt or the vessel; if the board split off during the night, then Rockland says it was not negligent in failing to cope with a new hazard of which it was not aware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the guilty bolt lay close to the water at low tide, and assuming the board was not in place, this could have been a hazard that a regular wharf-owner inspection would have discovered and dealt with, yet it could still not have been obvious to Hatch and Benner from the deck of a large vessel. And, if the board was present but was chafed away at night, the jury could have inferred negligence in maintaining the boards. Absent contrary evidence, it is a permissible inference that a properly maintained board would not suddenly break apart in the normal weather conditions that prevailed. Or at least a reasonable jury could so conclude, which is all that is necessary. <i>Autokirey,</i> 379 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland's stronger argument &#8212; but not quite strong enough &#8212; is that SAILOR's own negligence was the true cause, or at least a contributing cause, of the accident. Under maritime law, the former would arguably eliminate liability for Rockland and the latter would permit an apportionment of damages. <i>Carey v. Bahama Cruise Lines,</i> 864 F.2d 201, 207-08 (1st Cir.1988). The evidence raised a set of doubts about the conduct of Hatch and his captain, any of which might have persuaded a jury of their negligence; but none of them <i>compelled</i> that conclusion. We address them individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Hatch moored the vessel for several days at the take-out berth, which plainly had no camel. <i>If</i> the chafe board was already missing or damaged and <i>if</i> the exposed bolt was readily visible from the deck, arguably Hatch could not reasonably have left the situation as it was; however, there is no conclusive proof that these premises are correct. Alternatively, a jury might have thought that the two polyballs employed by Hatch were not enough; but nothing in the evidence (there were conflicting expert opinions on the issue) clearly compelled that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland also criticizes the amount of slack that Hatch left in the lines that moored the SAILOR to the pier, arguing that it was excessive and allowed the SAILOR to chafe against the pier more than usual, contributing to the wearing away of the chafe board or SAILOR's hull (or both). Once again, there were conflicting expert opinions presented at trial on the sufficiency of the mooring: Hatch (testifying as an expert) stated that the conditions on the evening in question were normal, and that the SAILOR was tied up according to his usual practice; Rockland's expert testified that the mooring was, in his opinion, insufficient. The jury was entitled to credit Hatch's expert testimony over Rockland's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Rockland's brief on appeal says that there was worm damage to the vessel and that the repair measures (<i>e.g.,</i> sheathing) had not been adequate to prevent a weakening of the boards where the bolt had pierced the hull. But whether the repair measures were negligent and whether the weakened boards played a causal role were hardly clear-cut. Again, this was a choice for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is claimed that SAILOR's owner or captain had a duty \"to tend\" the vessel &#8212; Rockland's suggestion being that one of the two should have visited the vessel overnight, checked the lines, and discovered and remedied any undue movement and chafing against the pier. That a vessel-owner or operator has a duty of reasonable care in securing the vessel is well-established, <i>Smith,</i> 173 U.S. at 433, 19 S.Ct. 442, but there is no law that this automatically requires overnight visits to the vessel nor any showing of circumstances in this case that required the jury to find such visits necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court properly refused to overturn the jury's verdict as to liability. In some cases, the evidence might preclude judgment as a matter of law and yet lean so heavily in the other direction so as to justify a district judge in ordering a new trial. 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2531 (1995); <i>Nat'l Car Rental Sys. v. Better Monkey Grip Co.,</i> 511 F.2d 724, 730-31 (5th Cir.1975), <i>cert. denied,</i> 423 U.S. 894, 96 S.Ct. 193, 46 L.Ed.2d 126 (1975). It would be much rarer to find that the district judge, who observed the trial, had \"abused his discretion\" (the relevant standard) in refusing to order a new trial. <i>E.g. Lama v. Borras,</i> 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir.1994). No such abuse occurred in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damages are the final target of Rockland's appeal. The treatment of damages by a federal appellate court is potentially complicated in at least two ways: first, the curious limitation that requires use of remittitur (as opposed to judgment as a matter of law) to remedy an excessive verdict, 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2815, at 159-60 (1995); and second, some arguable tension in the case law as to the standard of review of a denial of remittitur by the district court: commonly, courts say that review is for \"abuse of discretion,\" but the problem and some of the case law may be more subtle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue these issues because, in the present appeal, Rockland has invoked a test taken from our case law, namely, that a \"jury's damage award should be upset if [quoting from our decision] it `exceeds any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence....' <i>Wortley v. Camplin,</i> 333 F.3d 284, 297 (1st Cir.2003).\" Hatch has pointed to the same language in his answering brief, and we use this as an undisputed standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury award was for $202,088. But as the district court pointed out (in its post-judgment decision on remittitur), the jury was told that prejudgment interest could be included in its discretion. <i>Carey,</i> 864 F.2d at 208 n. 6. Working backward from the specified rate of annual interest, the district court deemed it reasonable to impute a value of $168,929 to the vessel, with the balance representing interest on this figure. Hatch argues on appeal that &#8212; using somewhat different formulas and assumptions as to dates &#8212; the jury may have found a vessel value as low as $161,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland grumbles about the assumption that the jury did <i>in fact</i> allow for prejudgment interest, but the assumption does not turn on mind-reading of the jury: the verdict is not irrational if under the governing law the evidence <i>permitted</i> a rational jury to impose liability and award damages in the amount reflected in the verdict. If the evidence permitted the jury's result, then whether the jury <i>reasoned</i> properly in reaching it is a matter over which the law ordinarily draws a veil. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 606(b); <i>Ramos v. Davis &amp; Geck, Inc.,</i> 224 F.3d 30, 31-32 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury was offered much evidence supporting a value of the vessel well under $169,000. Hatch had purchased the SAILOR two years before the sinking for $35,000, and it was apparently insured for an \"agreed value\" of $50,000 at the time of its loss. Yet there had been refurbishment in 2001, also the subject of evidence, and the issue was the refurbished vessel's fair market value at the time it sank, which could easily be well above the original purchase price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Rockland's expert estimated the value of the vessel just before its sinking as between $80,000 and $100,000. Hatch's expert made his own estimate of $120,000; but he was called by Rockland, not Hatch, and his testimony did not prevent the jury from awarding more, if more was rationally supported by evidence. The evidence for a higher figure was furnished by Hatch himself: citing his own experience as a captain and maritime surveyor, he opined as an expert witness that the vessel had been worth between $166,000 and $189,000; indeed, he later adjusted his testimony to support a figure as high as $199,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, Hatch was subject to being discredited, both because of his patent self-interest and because both of the other experts had arrived at lower figures. <i>E.g., Shane v. Shane,</i> 891 F.2d 976, 982 (1st Cir.1989). But Rockland does not deny that Hatch was entitled to testify as an expert, and the jury was free to weigh the credentials of the witnesses and the cogency of the bases given for their opinions. This is the kind of fact and credibility judgment on which the jury is ordinarily entitled to great latitude. <i>See Primus v. Galgano,</i> 329 F.3d 236, 244-45 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latitude is not unlimited: one can imagine a case where, when the details of the testimony are examined, a jury could rationally accept one expert's view but could not accept the other's. <i>See Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League,</i> 34 F.3d 1091, 1105 (1st Cir.1994), <i>cert. denied,</i> 513 U.S. 1190, 115 S.Ct. 1252, 131 L.Ed.2d 133 (1995). Here, Rockland's brief makes no effort to set out the reasoning of the experts and explain why its expert's discussion is compelling and Hatch's so weak that no rational jury could accept it. Without such a showing, we have no basis for saying that Hatch's estimate of $166,000-$189,000 <i>had</i> to be disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict rendered by the jury &#8212; attributing to it a value of $169,000 for the vessel &#8212; fits within Hatch's estimate. From the surface facts, it appears that the jury was generous in accepting Hatch's estimate over and above the more modest figure offered by Rockland's expert and the expert whom Hatch himself retained but did not proffer as a witness. Yet this does not show that the jury acted irrationally. <i>Autokirey,</i> 379 F.3d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a tail-end argument, Rockland complains that it was unreasonably limited in cross-examining Hatch. The district court did permit considerable cross-examination into Hatch's experience and history. However, when Rockland's counsel sought to cross-examine Hatch as to whether he had been involved in the sinking of two other vessels before SAILOR's demise, the district court sustained an objection to the line of inquiry under Fed.R.Evid. 403. That provision gives the district judge ample discretion to exclude testimony where its probity is substantially outweighed by prejudice, confusion or the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Rockland fails to mention is that before ruling on the objection, the court inquired whether Rockland intended to bring out evidence that Hatch had been negligent in connection with the earlier sinkings. Rockland conceded that it had no such evidence, and it did not suggest that it expected to adduce it from Hatch. Absent such evidence, the threshold relevance of the prior sinkings is not apparent, and Rockland's brief furnishes no explanation of the relevance of the questions. Nothing more need be said on the Rule 403 determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge suggested that, on these facts, he would not have ruled this way. Indeed, this is a close case for apportioning all fault to Rockland, and one's confidence in the result is not increased by the rather generous damages award. However, we put our faith in juries to resolve close cases, and although the appeal has been ably briefed, the jury verdict is not irrational.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> From the photographs and descriptions in evidence, it appears that the piers are solid concrete, covered with a deck of wooden planking.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span> (1899). Yet the vessel too must use \"ordinary care,\" avoiding dangerous conditions that are known to the operator or are obvious. <i>Id.; Pan Am. Grain Mfg.,</i> 295 F.3d at 115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rockland first objects to the finding that its negligence caused the sinking. The jury heard evidence that before Rockland took over the wharf, it did not perform necessary repair and maintenance requested by Water Street, and that after it took over there was no policy of inspection or maintenance; Water Street had performed such functions regularly. The city manager conceded that the Fish Pier was in \"disarray\" when the city began its own management, which it regarded as a \"caretaker\" role until a new operator could be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the jury thus had ample basis to find negligence by Rockland in the operation of the wharf, causation was a closer question. Hatch's position at trial was that the take-out berth should have had \"camels\" &#8212; logs shielded by rubber tires &#8212; to keep vessels from rubbing against the concrete piers; alternatively, Hatch charged that it was negligent for Rockland to allow an exposed bolt to protrude from the pier. Both theories assumed, with adequate basis in the evidence, that the SAILOR had chafed against an exposed bolt which ultimately holed the vessel and caused her sinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first theory was weak; the absence at the take-out berth of camels, present in regular berths, seemingly facilitated unloading and anyhow this absence was obvious to Hatch and Benner. In fact, Hatch placed two polyethylene buffer balls (\"polyballs\") between SAILOR and the pier, although in the end this proved insufficient to protect the vessel. There were also chafe boards on the side of the pier &#8212; a further precaution: it appears likely that one board was absent or split during the night and that a bolt, thus exposed, was the immediate cause of the sinking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch's second theory (that the exposed bolt bespoke causal negligence on the part of Rockland) is sufficient, given the deference due to a jury's factfinding. <i>N.H. Dept. of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d at 259. The situation is confused because the chafe board may have been in place on the afternoon before the sinking and split during the night. If the board was missing in the afternoon, then the bolt was already exposed, and Rockland now argues that it was an obvious hazard that should have led Hatch to remove either the bolt or the vessel; if the board split off during the night, then Rockland says it was not negligent in failing to cope with a new hazard of which it was not aware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the guilty bolt lay close to the water at low tide, and assuming the board was not in place, this could have been a hazard that a regular wharf-owner inspection would have discovered and dealt with, yet it could still not have been obvious to Hatch and Benner from the deck of a large vessel. And, if the board was present but was chafed away at night, the jury could have inferred negligence in maintaining the boards. Absent contrary evidence, it is a permissible inference that a properly maintained board would not suddenly break apart in the normal weather conditions that prevailed. Or at least a reasonable jury could so conclude, which is all that is necessary. <i>Autokirey,</i> 379 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland's stronger argument &#8212; but not quite strong enough &#8212; is that SAILOR's own negligence was the true cause, or at least a contributing cause, of the accident. Under maritime law, the former would arguably eliminate liability for Rockland and the latter would permit an apportionment of damages. <i>Carey v. Bahama Cruise Lines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516164\"><a href=\"/opinion/516164/thomas-carey-v-bahama-cruise-lines/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 207-08 (1st Cir.1988). The evidence raised a set of doubts about the conduct of Hatch and his captain, any of which might have persuaded a jury of their negligence; but none of them <i>compelled</i> that conclusion. We address them individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Hatch moored the vessel for several days at the take-out berth, which plainly had no camel. <i>If</i> the chafe board was already missing or damaged and <i>if</i> the exposed bolt was readily visible from the deck, arguably Hatch could not reasonably have left the situation as it was; however, there is no conclusive proof that these premises are correct. Alternatively, a jury might have thought that the two polyballs employed by Hatch were not enough; but nothing in the evidence (there were conflicting expert opinions on the issue) clearly compelled that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland also criticizes the amount of slack that Hatch left in the lines that moored the SAILOR to the pier, arguing that it was excessive and allowed the SAILOR to chafe against the pier more than usual, contributing to the wearing away of the chafe board or SAILOR's hull (or both). Once again, there were conflicting expert opinions presented at trial on the sufficiency of the mooring: Hatch (testifying as an expert) stated that the conditions on the evening in question were normal, and that the SAILOR was tied up according to his usual practice; Rockland's expert testified that the mooring was, in his opinion, insufficient. The jury was entitled to credit Hatch's expert testimony over Rockland's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Rockland's brief on appeal says that there was worm damage to the vessel and that the repair measures (<i>e.g.,</i> sheathing) had not been adequate to prevent a weakening of the boards where the bolt had pierced the hull. But whether the repair measures were negligent and whether the weakened boards played a causal role were hardly clear-cut. Again, this was a choice for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is claimed that SAILOR's owner or captain had a duty \"to tend\" the vessel &#8212; Rockland's suggestion being that one of the two should have visited the vessel overnight, checked the lines, and discovered and remedied any undue movement and chafing against the pier. That a vessel-owner or operator has a duty of reasonable care in securing the vessel is well-established, <i>Smith,</i> 173 U.S. at 433, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span>, but there is no law that this automatically requires overnight visits to the vessel nor any showing of circumstances in this case that required the jury to find such visits necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court properly refused to overturn the jury's verdict as to liability. In some cases, the evidence might preclude judgment as a matter of law and yet lean so heavily in the other direction so as to justify a district judge in ordering a new trial. 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span> (1975). It would be much rarer to find that the district judge, who observed the trial, had \"abused his discretion\" (the relevant standard) in refusing to order a new trial. <i>E.g. Lama v. Borras,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195226\"><a href=\"/opinion/195226/lama-romero-v-asociacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 477 (1st Cir.1994). No such abuse occurred in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Damages are the final target of Rockland's appeal. The treatment of damages by a federal appellate court is potentially complicated in at least two ways: first, the curious limitation that requires use of remittitur (as opposed to judgment as a matter of law) to remedy an excessive verdict, 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2815, at 159-60 (1995); and second, some arguable tension in the case law as to the standard of review of a denial of remittitur by the district court: commonly, courts say that review is for \"abuse of discretion,\" but the problem and some of the case law may be more subtle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue these issues because, in the present appeal, Rockland has invoked a test taken from our case law, namely, that a \"jury's damage award should be upset if [quoting from our decision] it `exceeds any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence....' <i>Wortley v. Camplin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200518\"><a href=\"/opinion/200518/wortley-v-camplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 297 (1st Cir.2003).\" Hatch has pointed to the same language in his answering brief, and we use this as an undisputed standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury award was for $202,088. But as the district court pointed out (in its post-judgment decision on remittitur), the jury was told that prejudgment interest could be included in its discretion. <i>Carey,</i> 864 F.2d at 208 n. 6. Working backward from the specified rate of annual interest, the district court deemed it reasonable to impute a value of $168,929 to the vessel, with the balance representing interest on this figure. Hatch argues on appeal that &#8212; using somewhat different formulas and assumptions as to dates &#8212; the jury may have found a vessel value as low as $161,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rockland grumbles about the assumption that the jury did <i>in fact</i> allow for prejudgment interest, but the assumption does not turn on mind-reading of the jury: the verdict is not irrational if under the governing law the evidence <i>permitted</i> a rational jury to impose liability and award damages in the amount reflected in the verdict. If the evidence permitted the jury's result, then whether the jury <i>reasoned</i> properly in reaching it is a matter over which the law ordinarily draws a veil. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 606(b); <i>Ramos v. Davis &amp; Geck, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199061\"><a href=\"/opinion/199061/ramos-v-davis-geck/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 31-32 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury was offered much evidence supporting a value of the vessel well under $169,000. Hatch had purchased the SAILOR two years before the sinking for $35,000, and it was apparently insured for an \"agreed value\" of $50,000 at the time of its loss. Yet there had been refurbishment in 2001, also the subject of evidence, and the issue was the refurbished vessel's fair market value at the time it sank, which could easily be well above the original purchase price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Rockland's expert estimated the value of the vessel just before its sinking as between $80,000 and $100,000. Hatch's expert made his own estimate of $120,000; but he was called by Rockland, not Hatch, and his testimony did not prevent the jury from awarding more, if more was rationally supported by evidence. The evidence for a higher figure was furnished by Hatch himself: citing his own experience as a captain and maritime surveyor, he opined as an expert witness that the vessel had been worth between $166,000 and $189,000; indeed, he later adjusted his testimony to support a figure as high as $199,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, Hatch was subject to being discredited, both because of his patent self-interest and because both of the other experts had arrived at lower figures. <i>E.g., Shane v. Shane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533782\"><a href=\"/opinion/533782/michael-b-shane-v-james-h-shane/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span>, 982 (1st Cir.1989). But Rockland does not deny that Hatch was entitled to testify as an expert, and the jury was free to weigh the credentials of the witnesses and the cogency of the bases given for their opinions. This is the kind of fact and credibility judgment on which the jury is ordinarily entitled to great latitude. <i>See Primus v. Galgano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200485\"><a href=\"/opinion/200485/primus-v-galgano/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 244-45 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latitude is not unlimited: one can imagine a case where, when the details of the testimony are examined, a jury could rationally accept one expert's view but could not accept the other's. <i>See Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677790\"><a href=\"/opinion/677790/william-h-sullivan-ii-v-national-football-league-members-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span>, 1105 (1st Cir.1994), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span> (1995). Here, Rockland's brief makes no effort to set out the reasoning of the experts and explain why its expert's discussion is compelling and Hatch's so weak that no rational jury could accept it. Without such a showing, we have no basis for saying that Hatch's estimate of $166,000-$189,000 <i>had</i> to be disregarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict rendered by the jury &#8212; attributing to it a value of $169,000 for the vessel &#8212; fits within Hatch's estimate. From the surface facts, it appears that the jury was generous in accepting Hatch's estimate over and above the more modest figure offered by Rockland's expert and the expert whom Hatch himself retained but did not proffer as a witness. Yet this does not show that the jury acted irrationally. <i>Autokirey,</i> 379 F.3d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a tail-end argument, Rockland complains that it was unreasonably limited in cross-examining Hatch. The district court did permit considerable cross-examination into Hatch's experience and history. However, when Rockland's counsel sought to cross-examine Hatch as to whether he had been involved in the sinking of two other vessels before SAILOR's demise, the district court sustained an objection to the line of inquiry under Fed.R.Evid. 403. That provision gives the district judge ample discretion to exclude testimony where its probity is substantially outweighed by prejudice, confusion or the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Rockland fails to mention is that before ruling on the objection, the court inquired whether Rockland intended to bring out evidence that Hatch had been negligent in connection with the earlier sinkings. Rockland conceded that it had no such evidence, and it did not suggest that it expected to adduce it from Hatch. Absent such evidence, the threshold relevance of the prior sinkings is not apparent, and Rockland's brief furnishes no explanation of the relevance of the questions. Nothing more need be said on the Rule 403 determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge suggested that, on these facts, he would not have ruled this way. Indeed, this is a close case for apportioning all fault to Rockland, and one's confidence in the result is not increased by the rather generous damages award. However, we put our faith in juries to resolve close cases, and although the appeal has been ably briefed, the jury verdict is not irrational.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> From the photographs and descriptions in evidence, it appears that the piers are solid concrete, covered with a deck of wooden planking.
