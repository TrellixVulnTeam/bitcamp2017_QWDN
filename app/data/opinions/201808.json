Following a jury conviction on one\n\ncount of conspiring to defraud the United States, one count of\n\ninsurance fraud, and six counts of mail fraud, the district court\n\nsentenced Héctor Flores-Seda (\"Flores\") to 51 months in prison\n\nunder   the    then-mandatory   United    States   Sentencing   Guidelines.\n\nFlores does not challenge his conviction on appeal.             Rather, he\n\nassigns error to the district court's calculation of his sentence\n\nand asserts that, in any event, he is entitled to resentencing in\n\nlight of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).          We reject\n\nboth claims and affirm his sentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n              The sentencing issues on appeal do not require us to\n\nrecount in detail the events that led to Flores's conviction.           We\n\ntherefore provide only a brief outline of the relevant history.\n\n              At all times relevant to this case, Flores owned and\n\noperated an automobile repair shop called \"Taller El Poder\" in Vega\n\nBaja, Puerto Rico.       Between October 1995 and June 2001, Flores\n\nparticipated in a fraudulent car insurance scheme wherein he and\n\nhis co-conspirators staged car crashes and had police officers,\n\nalso participants in the scheme, prepare false police reports\n\ndocumenting the accidents.      Through his repair shop, Flores would\n\nthen prepare inflated estimates for insurance claims based on the\n\nstaged accidents, claiming both the damages sustained in the\n\naccidents and additional damage that did not, in fact, exist. This\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fscheme was lucrative.         At sentencing, an attorney for a consortium\n\nof defrauded insurance companies testified that the total loss to\n\nthe insurance companies was more than $4 million, and that just the\n\nclaims attributable to Flores, his shop, and his wife totaled more\n\nthan $600,000.\n\n            On July 9, 2002, a grand jury returned a multi-count\n\nindictment     against    Flores      and     seventeen    other   individuals,\n\nincluding one of Flores's employees, an insurance salesman, an\n\ninsurance     claims   adjustor,       and    numerous    police   officers,    in\n\nconnection with the car insurance scheme.                Nine of the counts in\n\nthe indictment implicated Flores: conspiracy to defraud the United\n\nStates, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count One), insurance fraud, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1033 (Count Two), and mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Counts Three\n\nthrough Eight and Sixteen).           On February 18, 2003, following a ten\n\nday trial, the jury convicted Flores on Counts One, Two, Three\n\nthrough Seven, and Sixteen, and acquitted him on Count Eight.\n\n            Flores was sentenced on July 22, 2003 under the 1998\n\nedition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.                See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.11(b)(1) (1998) (\"If the court determines that use of the\n\nGuidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is\n\nsentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in\n\neffect   on    the     date    that     the    offense     of   conviction     was\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fcommitted.\").1      The district court grouped the counts of conviction\n\ntogether pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(d), and assigned a base\n\noffense level of 6.       Id. § 2F1.1(a).2      Over Flores's objections,\n\nthe court then imposed a 10-level increase based on its finding\n\nthat the offense involved a loss of more than $500,000, see\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(k), a 2-level increase based on its finding\n\nthat the offense involved more than minimal planning, see id.\n\n§ 2B1.1(4)(a), and a 4-level increase based on its finding that\n\nFlores   was   an    organizer   or   leader   of   an   extensive   criminal\n\nactivity, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), for a total offense level of 22.\n\nBased on Flores's criminal history category of I, his guideline\n\nsentencing range was 41 to 51 months.           Flores asked the court to\n\nsentence him at the low end of the range on the grounds that he has\n\ntwo minor children and that his co-defendants -- who pled guilty\n\nrather than proceeding to trial -- received \"a sentence very\n\ndistant, even to the lower end of this offense level.\"                   The\n\ngovernment recommended a sentence at the upper end of the range,\n\nemphasizing that \"as far as we can tell, the defendant is still not\n\nrepentant.\"      After hearing a victim impact statement by Rafael\n\nBarreto, an attorney for the defrauded insurance companies in a\n\n\n\n     1\n      All Guidelines citations in this opinion are to the 1998\nedition, unless otherwise noted.\n     2\n      Section 2F1.1 \"was deleted by consolidation with § 2B1.1\neffective November 1, 2001.\" U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1, historical note\n(2004).\n\n                                      -4-\n\frelated civil case, the court sentenced Flores to 51 months in\n\nprison, the top of the applicable range, on each count, to run\n\nconcurrently.    The court also imposed a fine of $5,000 and ordered\n\nFlores to cooperate with Barreto in the related civil case.    This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           On appeal, Flores objects to his sentence on two grounds.\n\nFirst, he assigns error to the district court's finding that the\n\nloss from his fraudulent activities was in excess of $500,000.\n\nSecond, he contends that he is entitled to resentencing in light of\n\nBooker.   We consider each claim in turn.3\n\nA.         Loss calculation\n\n           The Guidelines section applicable to Flores's offense of\n\nconviction provides for incremental sentencing increases based on\n\nthe amount of the loss due to fraud.   See U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1.   Based\n\non testimony by Barreto, the pre-sentence report estimated the\n\namount of the loss attributable to Flores as being in excess of\n\n$500,000, and thus recommended a 10-level increase to Flores's base\n\noffense level.    See id. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(k).\n\n           At sentencing, the court asked Barreto to explain his\n\ncalculations regarding the \"counts and losses attributable to the\n\n\n\n     3\n      As we explained in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n68, 81 (1st Cir. 2005), even post-Booker, \"we will continue to\nreview pre-Booker type claims of Guideline error where it is\nplausible that the error committed affected the sentence.\"\n\n                                 -5-\n\fscheme in which this defendant participated.\"            Barreto testified\n\nunder oath that\n\n      in the civil complaint that is parallel to the criminal\n      case, the losses sustained by the insurance companies\n      actually   surpassing right     now  over   $4   million.\n      Nonetheless, we understand that there might have been a\n      few schemes, a few conspiracies against the insurance\n      companies, and therefore, in order to be just, and in\n      order to be able to sustain or to specify the losses\n      caused by this defendant, what we did was to address only\n      those cases and those claims made that were caused\n      directly by this defendant. We did not include the $4\n      million because we could not say that all of the claims\n      were all [attributable] directly to the defendant. . . .\n      The $600,000 amount that we provided to the probation\n      officer was the amount that added up all the claims that\n      had to do with Héctor Flores, with Taller El Poder, and\n      [with] his wife. Not necessarily that means that they\n      were in the claims that were included in the indictment.\n      There were other claims not included in the indictment\n      that nonetheless were included in the civil complaint\n      that were attributable to Héctor Flores.\n\nThe court asked Barreto to confirm that his testimony was that \"the\n\ninsurance fraud scheme and claims attributable directly to the\n\nparticipation by Mr. Flores, his wife, and Taller El Poder, is over\n\n$600,000.\"    Barreto responded that the court was correct.\n\n           Flores was then given an opportunity to question Barreto.\n\nHe declined, stating that \"we are in a total state of non-defense,\n\nso we cannot argue as to that matter.\"        Flores's only comment on\n\nthis point was to emphasize that the indictment cited a loss of\n\njust $334,529 and that he had been acquitted on one count, which\n\nwould suggest a lower total.    In response, the government informed\n\nthe   court   that   the   amount   alleged   in   the    indictment   was\n\nattributable only to the counts on which Flores was convicted.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fEven if not covered in the indictment, the government asserted that\n\nthe amounts stated by Barreto \"are relevant conduct as to this\n\ncase.\"     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2) (defining relevant conduct to\n\ninclude \"all acts and omissions . .. that were part of the same\n\ncourse of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of\n\nconviction\").\n\n            After hearing Barreto's testimony and arguments from both\n\nsides, the court found that the losses stated by Barreto were\n\nrelevant conduct and \"sustain[ed] the finding of the probation\n\nofficer in the pre-sentence report . . . that this defendant should\n\nbe sentenced with losses in excess of $500,000 which is less than\n\nthe $600,000 that the victim has supplied to this court and to the\n\nprobation officer.\"     On appeal, Flores asserts that this finding\n\nwas erroneous. We review the district court's loss calculation for\n\nclear error.    See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 82\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Flores attacks the court's loss calculation on several\n\ngrounds.     He asserts that the government failed to establish a\n\nnexus between all of the losses included in Barreto's estimate and\n\nthe conduct for which he was convicted, that it was in Barreto's\n\ninterest, because of the pending civil case, to \"err on the side of\n\nexaggeration,\" and that Barreto's calculation included some non-\n\nfraudulent claims filed by Flores.       More broadly, Flores also\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcontends that \"it was not established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the loss exceeded $500,000.\" We reject these claims.\n\n          As we have explained, \"[d]etermination of actual loss\n\nneed not be precise; '[t]he court need only make a reasonable\n\nestimate of the range of loss, given the available information.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 457 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 cmt. n.8 (1994)).        Here, the court relied on an\n\nestimate by a representative of Flores's victims of the losses\n\nbased on the \"insurance fraud scheme and claims attributable\n\ndirectly to the participation by Mr. Flores, his wife, and Taller\n\nEl Poder.\"   Barreto's testimony that the losses were attributable\n\nto Flores's participation in the insurance fraud scheme established\n\nthat they were relevant conduct for sentencing purposes, and Flores\n\nhas not offered any evidence to the contrary.                See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 1B1.3(a)(2) (defining \"relevant conduct\" to include \"all acts .\n\n. . that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme\n\nor plan as the offense of conviction\").\n\n          Nor are we persuaded by Flores's claim that Barreto's\n\nestimate was unreliable because he had an incentive to exaggerate\n\nthe loss or because he included non-fraudulent claims by Flores.\n\nBarreto   testified,   under    oath,    that   the   loss   specifically\n\nattributable to Flores's participation in the insurance fraud\n\nscheme was over $600,000.      When given the opportunity to question\n\nBarreto regarding his estimate, Flores declined. He made no effort\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fto impeach Barreto's testimony, either by raising the possibility\n\nof bias or by questioning him about the inclusion of non-fraudulent\n\nclaims, nor did he offer an alternative estimate.                      \"A defendant\n\ndissatisfied with the sentencing court's quantification of the\n\namount     of    loss   in   a   particular    case   must   go    a   long    way   to\n\ndemonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.\" United States\n\nv. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).         In light of Barreto's testimony regarding the\n\nestimated loss to the insurance companies and the absence of any\n\nevidence from Flores to refute Barreto's calculations, we reject\n\nFlores's claim of clear error.\n\nB.              Booker claim\n\n                In a supplemental brief filed after oral argument in this\n\ncase, Flores also claims that he is entitled to resentencing in\n\nlight of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738, 756-57 (2005),\n\nwhich held that the Guidelines must be treated as advisory, rather\n\nthan mandatory. Because Flores failed to preserve his Booker claim\n\nin   the   district      court,    we   review   it   only    for      plain   error.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.                The first two prongs of plain\n\nerror review are satisfied by the fact that Flores was sentenced\n\nunder the mandatory Guidelines.           See id. at 77.4         To be entitled to\n\n\n      4\n      In his opening brief, filed before the Supreme Court decided\nBooker, Flores assigned constitutional error to the district\ncourt's calculation of his sentence based in part on judicial\nfactfinding -- namely, the court's findings that the scheme\ninvolved more than minimal planning, that Flores was a leader or\n\n                                         -9-\n\fresentencing, however, Flores must also \"point to circumstances\n\ncreating a reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under\n\nthe new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"   Id. at 75.\n\n          Flores argues first that the district court's comments\n\nindicate that it \"felt the Guidelines required the adjustments that\n\nwere imposed.\"   The specific comments to which he points are the\n\ncourt's description of various increases to the base offense level\n\nas \"warranted\" or \"authorized\" by the Guidelines. This argument is\n\neasily dismissed.   Although the court's comments do reflect the\n\nreality that Flores's sentence was shaped by the Guidelines, they\n\nin no way indicate that the court would impose a more favorable\n\nsentence under the advisory Guidelines.\n\n          Flores next asserts that he would have received a lower\n\nsentence under the advisory Guidelines because the district court\n\nwould have been free to consider two mitigating factors: the fact\n\nthat Flores has two minor children relying on him for financial\n\nsupport, and the fact that many of Flores's co-defendants received\n\nsubstantially lower sentences than he did, thus leading to a\n\n\n\norganizer, and that the loss exceeded $500,000. We subsequently\nclarified that the Booker error \"is not that a judge (by a\npreponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the\nGuidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the\njury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only\nthat the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\"\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.      Flores's pre-Booker argument\nregarding judicial factfinding is therefore incorrect.\n\n                               -10-\n\fdisparity.      Flores brought both of these factors to the district\n\ncourt's attention, asking it to impose a sentence of 41 months, the\n\nbottom of the applicable Guidelines range, in the interest of\n\n\"humanism\" and \"uniformity.\"             Although the district court did not\n\ncomment on Flores's children, it responded with regard to the\n\nsentencing disparity that \"the other co-defendants in this case\n\npled guilty, and negotiated their pleas with the U.S. Attorney, and\n\nthe Court had that in mind when it sentenced the defendants in this\n\ncase.    So it is very difficult to argue uniformity in this case.\"\n\nThe court then sentenced Flores to 51 months in prison, the top of\n\nthe applicable Guidelines range.                Given the court's decision to\n\nimpose   a     sentence     at   the   top    of   the   Guidelines     after   being\n\npresented      with   the    only      mitigating      factors   that     Flores    has\n\nidentified on appeal, Flores has not established a reasonable\n\nprobability that the court would impose a more favorable sentence\n\nunder    the    advisory     Guideline       regime.      See    United    States    v.\n\nGonzalez-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 304 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"When, under\n\na mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to\n\nsentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range,\n\nthat is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an\n\nadvisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe   same    sentence.\").   He    therefore   is   not   entitled   to\n\nresentencing.5\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      In light of this disposition, Flores's claims regarding the\nsentencing procedures to be used on remand are inapposite.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

At all times relevant to this case, Flores owned and operated an automobile repair shop called \"Taller El Poder\" in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Between October 1995 and June 2001, Flores participated in a fraudulent car insurance scheme wherein he and his co-conspirators staged car crashes and had police officers, also participants in the scheme, prepare false police reports documenting the accidents. Through his repair shop, Flores would then prepare inflated estimates for insurance claims based on the staged accidents, claiming both the damages sustained in the accidents and additional damage that did not, in fact, exist. This scheme was lucrative.

He asserts that the government failed to establish a nexus between all of the losses included in Barreto's estimate and the conduct for which he was convicted, that it was in Barreto's interest, because of the pending civil case, to \"err on the side of exaggeration,\" and that Barreto's calculation included some non-fraudulent claims filed by Flores.

Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 457 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 cmt. n. 8 (1994)). Here, the court relied on an estimate by a representative of Flores's victims of the losses based on the \"insurance fraud scheme and claims attributable directly to the participation by Mr. Flores, his wife, and Taller El Poder.\" Barreto's testimony that the losses were attributable to Flores's participation in the insurance fraud scheme established that they were relevant conduct for sentencing purposes, and Flores has not offered any evidence to the contrary. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) (defining \"relevant conduct\" to include \"all acts. . . that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we persuaded by Flores's claim that Barreto's estimate was unreliable because he had an incentive to exaggerate the loss or because he included non-fraudulent claims by Flores. Barreto testified, under oath, that the loss specifically attributable to Flores's participation in the insurance fraud scheme was over $600,000. When given the opportunity to question Barreto regarding his estimate, Flores declined. He made no effort to impeach Barreto's testimony, either by raising the possibility of bias or by questioning him about the inclusion of non-fraudulent claims, nor did he offer an alternative estimate. \"A defendant dissatisfied with the sentencing court's quantification of the amount of loss in a particular case must go a long way to demonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which held that the Guidelines must be treated as advisory, rather than mandatory. Because Flores failed to preserve his <i>Booker</i> claim in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. The first two prongs of plain error review are satisfied by the fact that Flores was sentenced under the mandatory Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> at 77.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> To be entitled to resentencing, however, Flores must also \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores argues first that the district court's comments indicate that it \"felt the Guidelines required the adjustments that were imposed.\" The specific comments to which he points are the court's description of various increases to the base offense level as \"warranted\" or \"authorized\" by the Guidelines. This argument is easily dismissed. Although the court's comments do reflect the reality that Flores's sentence was shaped by the Guidelines, they in no way indicate that the court would impose a more favorable sentence under the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores next asserts that he would have received a lower sentence under the advisory Guidelines because the district court would have been free to consider two mitigating factors: the fact that Flores has two minor children relying on him for financial support, and the fact that many of Flores's co-defendants received substantially lower sentences than he did, thus leading to a disparity. Flores brought both of these factors to the district court's attention, asking it to impose a sentence of 41 months, the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range, in the interest of \"humanism\" and \"uniformity.\" Although the district court did not comment on Flores's children, it responded with regard to the sentencing disparity that \"the other co-defendants in this case pled guilty, and negotiated their pleas with the U.S. Attorney, and the Court had that in mind when it sentenced the defendants in this case. So it is very difficult to argue uniformity in this case.\" The court then sentenced Flores to 51 months in prison, the top of the applicable Guidelines range. Given the court's decision to impose a sentence at the top of the Guidelines after being presented with the only mitigating factors that Flores has identified on appeal, Flores has not established a reasonable probability that the court would impose a more favorable sentence under the advisory Guideline regime. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 304 (1st Cir.2005) (\"When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence.\").

At all times relevant to this case, Flores owned and operated an automobile repair shop called \"Taller El Poder\" in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Between October 1995 and June 2001, Flores participated in a fraudulent car insurance scheme wherein he and his co-conspirators staged car crashes and had police officers, also participants in the scheme, prepare false police reports documenting the accidents. Through his repair shop, Flores would then prepare inflated estimates for insurance claims based on the staged accidents, claiming both the damages sustained in the accidents and additional damage that did not, in fact, exist. This scheme was lucrative. At sentencing, an attorney for a consortium of defrauded insurance companies testified that the total loss to the insurance companies was more than $4 million, and that just the claims attributable to Flores, his shop, and his wife totaled more than $600,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 2002, a grand jury returned a multi-count indictment against Flores and seventeen other individuals, including one of Flores's employees, an insurance salesman, an insurance claims adjustor, and numerous police officers, in connection with the car insurance scheme.

Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores attacks the court's loss calculation on several grounds. He asserts that the government failed to establish a nexus between all of the losses included in Barreto's estimate and the conduct for which he was convicted, that it was in Barreto's interest, because of the pending civil case, to \"err on the side of exaggeration,\" and that Barreto's calculation included some non-fraudulent claims filed by Flores. More broadly, Flores also contends that \"it was not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the loss exceeded $500,000.\" We reject these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained, \"[d]etermination of actual loss need not be precise; `[t]he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available information.'\" <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 457 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 cmt. n. 8 (1994)). Here, the court relied on an estimate by a representative of Flores's victims of the losses based on the \"insurance fraud scheme and claims attributable directly to the participation by Mr. Flores, his wife, and Taller El Poder.\" Barreto's testimony that the losses were attributable to Flores's participation in the insurance fraud scheme established that they were relevant conduct for sentencing purposes, and Flores has not offered any evidence to the contrary. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) (defining \"relevant conduct\" to include \"all acts. . . that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we persuaded by Flores's claim that Barreto's estimate was unreliable because he had an incentive to exaggerate the loss or because he included non-fraudulent claims by Flores. Barreto testified, under oath, that the loss specifically attributable to Flores's participation in the insurance fraud scheme was over $600,000. When given the opportunity to question Barreto regarding his estimate, Flores declined. He made no effort to impeach Barreto's testimony, either by raising the possibility of bias or by questioning him about the inclusion of non-fraudulent claims, nor did he offer an alternative estimate. \"A defendant dissatisfied with the sentencing court's quantification of the amount of loss in a particular case must go a long way to demonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200051\"><a href=\"/opinion/200051/united-states-v-ranney/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of Barreto's testimony regarding the estimated loss to the insurance companies and the absence of any evidence from Flores to refute Barreto's calculations, we reject Flores's claim of clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Booker</i> claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a supplemental brief filed after oral argument in this case, Flores also claims that he is entitled to resentencing in light of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, 756-57, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), which held that the Guidelines must be treated as advisory, rather than mandatory. Because Flores failed to preserve his <i>Booker</i> claim in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. The first two prongs of plain error review are satisfied by the fact that Flores was sentenced under the mandatory Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> at 77.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> To be entitled to resentencing, however, Flores must also \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores argues first that the district court's comments indicate that it \"felt the Guidelines required the adjustments that were imposed.\" The specific comments to which he points are the court's description of various increases to the base offense level as \"warranted\" or \"authorized\" by the Guidelines. This argument is easily dismissed. Although the court's comments do reflect the reality that Flores's sentence was shaped by the Guidelines, they in no way indicate that the court would impose a more favorable sentence under the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores next asserts that he would have received a lower sentence under the advisory Guidelines because the district court would have been free to consider two mitigating factors: the fact that Flores has two minor children relying on him for financial support, and the fact that many of Flores's co-defendants received substantially lower sentences than he did, thus leading to a disparity. Flores brought both of these factors to the district court's attention, asking it to impose a sentence of 41 months, the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range, in the interest of \"humanism\" and \"uniformity.\" Although the district court did not comment on Flores's children, it responded with regard to the sentencing disparity that \"the other co-defendants in this case pled guilty, and negotiated their pleas with the U.S. Attorney, and the Court had that in mind when it sentenced the defendants in this case. So it is very difficult to argue uniformity in this case.\" The court then sentenced Flores to 51 months in prison, the top of the applicable Guidelines range. Given the court's decision to impose a sentence at the top of the Guidelines after being presented with the only mitigating factors that Flores has identified on appeal, Flores has not established a reasonable probability that the court would impose a more favorable sentence under the advisory Guideline regime. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201515\"><a href=\"/opinion/201515/united-states-v-gonzalez-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 304 (1st Cir.2005) (\"When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence.\").

We subsequently clarified that the <i>Booker</i> error \"is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75.
