Plaintiff-appellant Luis Gines-\n\nPerez appeals from the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nin favor of Raymond W. Kelly, Commissioner of the United States\n\nCustoms Service (the Service).        The underlying case involves the\n\nService's seizure of a boat belonging to the appellant on the\n\nground that a culpable connection existed between the boat and\n\ncertain money laundering and drug-trafficking activities.            See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956; 21 U.S.C. § 841.            The appellant claims that the\n\nService's actions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.    We agree.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The genesis of this matter can be traced to October 20,\n\n1998, when the government obtained a seizure warrant for the\n\nappellant's boat (a thirty-four foot Wellcraft Scarab III).             The\n\nfollowing day, the Service took possession of the boat. On October\n\n29, it notified the appellant of the seizure by letter.                This\n\nmissive stated that the government had reason to believe that the\n\nvessel had been purchased with the proceeds of unlawful activity,\n\nand therefore, that it was forfeitable.          The letter informed the\n\nappellant    that   he    could   request    relief   from   the   impending\n\nforfeiture by petitioning for remission within thirty days of the\n\ndate of the letter.       See 19 U.S.C. § 1618.\n\n            When the appellant did not file a petition for remission\n\nwithin the stipulated period, the Service sent him a second letter\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fin which it advised that a notice of seizure and intent to forfeit\n\nwould be published on and after May 5, 1999.               The letter also\n\nstated that should the appellant wish to stay the administrative\n\nforfeiture proceedings and place the matter before a court, he\n\nwould have to file a claim and post a bond within twenty days from\n\nthe date of the first publication.\n\n           The appellant responded to this letter within the twenty-\n\nday period, acknowledging the \"claim and cost bond\" requirement.\n\nHis letter stated that he had decided to apply for in forma\n\npauperis (IFP) status so as to dispense with the necessity for\n\nposting a bond. The appellant attached a completed IFP application\n\nto this letter.\n\n           Over eight months later — without either ruling on the\n\nIFP application or referring the case to the United States Attorney\n\nfor the initiation of judicial proceedings — the Service informed\n\nthe appellant, by letter dated February 7, 2000, that it had\n\ndecided not to pursue forfeiture, but, rather, would release the\n\nboat to the appellant.         The Service added, however, that the\n\nappellant would have to (a) pay the costs associated with the\n\nseizure   and   storage   of   the   boat,   and   (b)   sign   an   indemnity\n\nagreement.      The letter admonished that if no action were taken\n\ntoward \"the remission of the vessel\" within thirty days, the\n\nService would commence administrative forfeiture proceedings by\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fpublishing a first notice of intent to forfeit at some time during\n\nMarch of 2000.\n\n            The appellant apparently did not accept the offer.                In a\n\nfollow-up    letter,    under   date   of    March   29,   2000,   the     Service\n\ninformed him that since he had not paid the seizure and storage\n\ncosts, the boat would be summarily sold pursuant to 19 U.S.C. §\n\n1612(b), and that he would be entitled to any money leftover after\n\npayment of the costs.        The appellant responded by bringing this\n\nsuit on June 8, 2000. Approximately three weeks later, the Service\n\nreported that it had sold the boat, that there were no excess\n\nproceeds, and that it regarded the case as closed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Under the customs laws, which apply here, seized property\n\nworth $500,000 or less may be subject to administrative forfeiture\n\nwithout judicial involvement.          See 19 U.S.C. § 1607.            The agency\n\nseizing the property must give notice of the seizure to all parties\n\nin interest and must inform them of the applicable procedures for\n\ncontesting     the     proposed   forfeiture.          Id.         To     initiate\n\nadministrative forfeiture proceedings, the agency must publish\n\nnotice of intent to forfeit for three successive weeks in a\n\nnewspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which\n\nthe seizure occurred.      See id.; see also 19 C.F.R. § 162.45(b)(1).\n\n             In order to contest such a forfeiture, an interested\n\nparty must file a claim and cost bond within twenty days of the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdate of the first publication of the intent to forfeit.            19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1608.    The requirement for a cost bond is not inflexible:          it is\n\nroutinely waived upon proof that a party is unable to afford the\n\ncost of the bond.    19 C.F.R. § 162.47(e).       The timeous filing of a\n\nclaim, accompanied either by a cost bond or by proof of IFP status\n\nsufficient to secure a waiver, obliges the agency to refer the\n\nmatter to the United States Attorney for the commencement of\n\njudicial forfeiture proceedings.          19 U.S.C. § 1608.    If, however,\n\nno satisfactory filing is made with the twenty-day period, the\n\nagency may declare the property forfeit.          Id. § 1609(a).\n\n            As an alternative to litigation, an interested party may\n\npetition    the   Secretary   of   the    Treasury   (the   Secretary)   for\n\nremission or mitigation.       Id. § 1618.       The remission procedure\n\n\"grants the Secretary the discretion not to pursue a complete\n\nforfeiture despite the Government's entitlement to one.\"             United\n\nStates v. Von Neumann, 474 U.S. 242, 250 (1986).              Although this\n\nprocedure is an informal — and often helpful — way for the parties\n\nto resolve a dispute, remission proceedings are not required in\n\norder to obtain a forfeiture determination.          See id.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            The district court decided this case in favor of the\n\nService on the ground that the appellant had not timely responded\n\nto the notice of intent to forfeit.           The appellant attacks this\n\ndetermination. He asseverates in this venue, as he did below, that\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhis claim and IFP application were timely filed but that the\n\nService improperly ignored it.               Moreover, he says that once a\n\nseasonable claim and IFP application were filed, the Service had no\n\nlicense to proceed as it did and that its course of action violated\n\nhis due process rights.\n\n           The Service disagrees with the appellant's bottom-line\n\nposition. Importantly, however, it acknowledges that the appellant\n\nfiled a claim and IFP application and does not suggest that these\n\nfilings were untimely or otherwise deficient.                Thus, the Service\n\ndoes not seek to defend the district court's determination that the\n\nappellant had not timely responded — and the chronology set forth\n\nabove, see supra Part I, leaves no doubt but that the claim was\n\ntimely filed.    The question, then, is whether the district court's\n\ndecision is supportable on some alternative ground.\n\n           The Service sees the case this way.               It points out that\n\nit had changed its mind about proceeding with forfeiture and had\n\ndecided   to   abort   the   seizure    and    release      the   vessel   to   the\n\nappellant.     It then notified the appellant of its decision to sell\n\nthe vessel under 19 U.S.C. § 1612(b) in order to recoup its out-of-\n\npocket costs. The appellant did not interpose any objection to the\n\nsale. Accordingly, the Service posits, it provided all the process\n\nthat was due.\n\n             This argument does not withstand scrutiny. The principal\n\nproblem   is   that    the   manner    in     which   the    Service   proceeded\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\feffectively deprived the appellant of his vessel and held him\n\nliable   for    seizure   and   storage    costs   without   any   reasoned\n\ndetermination either that the boat was subject to forfeiture or\n\nthat the appellant was legally liable to reimburse the government's\n\ncosts.     We explain briefly.\n\n             Section 1612(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n                    If the Customs Service determines that\n             the expense of keeping the vessel . . . is\n             disproportionate to the value thereof, the\n             Customs Service may promptly order the\n             destruction or other appropriate disposition\n             of such property under regulations prescribed\n             by the Secretary.\n\n19 U.S.C. § 1612(b).      One of the purposes of section 1612 is to\n\nsubstitute a cash fund for a vessel or other seized piece of\n\nproperty subject to large custodial costs.            1 David B. Smith,\n\nProsecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases ¶ 8.04, at 8-28 (2000).\n\nAs a result, \"[t]he proceeds of [a] sale [under section 1612] shall\n\nbe held subject to the claims of parties in interest in the same\n\nmanner as the seized property would have been subject to such\n\nclaims.\"    19 C.F.R. § 162.48(a).        So viewed, a sale under section\n\n1612 does not — and should not — amount to a final decision\n\nconcerning a claimant's right to the property.          To the contrary,\n\nsuch a sale is an intermediate step pending the making of such a\n\ndecision.\n\n            Here, the Service made no claim of disproportionate\n\nexpense. Instead, it took the position that, because the appellant\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcould not afford to repay the costs incurred for seizure and\n\nstorage, the boat had to be sold.       This was a peculiar use of\n\nsection 1612 — and in all probability an improper one.      To make\n\nmatters worse, the Service seems to have treated the sale of the\n\nboat under section 1612 as a final disposition of the case.    Once\n\nit had sold the boat, the Service informed the appellant that there\n\nwere no proceeds in excess of its bill for costs and told him that\n\nit was closing its file.   We think that this was presumptuous — and\n\nwithout foundation in the law.\n\n          To be sure, it appears that the Service did not intend to\n\ntreat the sale of the vessel as an actual determination that the\n\nvessel was forfeitable.    Quite the opposite is true; the Service\n\ntold the appellant that it had decided not to pursue a forfeiture.\n\nNevertheless, the effect of the Service's action was the same as if\n\nit had decreed that the boat was forfeitable.    The closing of the\n\ncase meant that the appellant had lost both his property and his\n\nright to challenge that loss.\n\n          As a corollary, the Service had unilaterally decided that\n\nthe appellant was responsible for the seizure and storage costs\n\nwithout first having secured a determination that the boat was\n\nforfeitable.   This was a fatal omission:        had the appellant\n\nprevailed in a forfeiture action, he likely would not have been\n\nliable for these costs.    See, e.g., United States v. One 1986 Ford\n\nPickup, 56 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir. 1995) (in which the government\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fconceded that it could not tax seizure and storage costs against a\n\nparty who prevailed in a forfeiture action even though there had\n\nbeen   reasonable   cause     for   the     initiation    of   the    forfeiture\n\nproceedings); United States v. One 48 Ft. White Colored Sailboat,\n\n59 F. Supp. 2d 362, 366 (D.P.R. 1999) (holding that a claimant who\n\nprevailed in a forfeiture action was not responsible for storage\n\nand maintenance costs incurred while her property was in the\n\ncustody of the government).\n\n           Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the way in which\n\nthe Service proceeded deprived the appellant of his property\n\nwithout due process.    As said, a sale under section 1612 usually is\n\nan interlocutory remedy, leaving a claimant with a post-sale right\n\nto argue that he is entitled to the proceeds on the basis that the\n\nproperty originally seized was not forfeitable.                   The fact that\n\nthere were no proceeds leftover from the sale of the boat in the\n\ninstant case should not change this result; before the Service\n\nclosed the case, it should have provided the appellant with a\n\nproceeding in which to argue that the boat was not forfeitable and\n\nthat he was not liable for any of the seizure and storage costs,\n\nand that the proceeds of the sale should go to him (rather than to\n\ndefray seizure and storage costs).\n\n           The Service offers no real rationale in support of its\n\ndecision   to   treat   the    sale   under     section    1612      as   a   final\n\ndetermination that the appellant had no ownership interest in the\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fboat.    Instead, it focuses on the appellant's supposed failure to\n\nobject to the sale of the boat under section 1612.    This misses the\n\npoint.     The issue here is not the appellant's objection to the\n\nsale, but the proper distribution of the proceeds from the sale.\n\nThe lack of objection may operate as a waiver as to fact of the\n\nsale — we need not decide this today — but not as to the proper\n\ndistribution of the proceeds. Even if the appellant had acquiesced\n\nin a section 1612 sale,1 we question how any such acquiescence\n\ncould constitute either an abandonment of a right to the sale\n\nproceeds or an agreement to assume liability for the seizure and\n\nstorage costs.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            We need go no further.     Concluding, as we do, that the\n\nappellant is entitled to his day in court, we vacate the judgment\n\nbelow and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.    On remand, the district court should provide the\n\nappellant with the process that the Service neglected to give him:\n\nan opportunity to show that the boat is not forfeitable and that he\n\ntherefore should not be expected to bear the costs of seizure and\n\nstorage.

DEA, 111 F.3d 301, 306 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n(explaining that \"when the government is responsible for a . . .\n\n\n\n     1\n      In this regard, we note that the appellant filed the instant\naction on June 8, 2000 — shortly after receiving notice of the\nService's intent to sell and well before he received notice that\nthe sale had been consummated.\n\n                                -10-\n\fclaimant's inability to present a claim . . . a hearing on the\n\nmerits is available in the district court\") (citations and internal\n\npunctuation omitted).\n\n\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

The timeous filing of a claim, accompanied either by a cost bond or by proof of IFP status sufficient to secure a waiver, obliges the agency to refer the matter to the United States Attorney for the commencement of judicial forfeiture proceedings. 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1608.

The appellant attacks this determination. He asseverates in this venue, as he did below, that his claim and IFP application were timely filed but that the Service improperly ignored it.

Thus, the Service does not seek to defend the district court's determination that the appellant had not timely responded &#8212; and the chronology set forth above, <i>see supra</i> Part I, leaves no doubt but that the claim was timely filed.

It points out that it had changed its mind about proceeding with forfeiture and had decided to abort the seizure and release the vessel to the appellant. It then notified the appellant of its decision to sell the vessel under 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1612(b) in order to recoup its out-of-pocket costs. The appellant did not interpose any objection to the sale. Accordingly, the Service posits, it provided all the process that was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument does not withstand scrutiny. The principal problem is that the manner in which the Service proceeded effectively deprived the appellant of his vessel and held him liable for seizure and storage costs without any reasoned determination either that the boat was subject to forfeiture or that the appellant was legally liable to reimburse the government's costs. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1612(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Customs Service determines that the expense of keeping the vessel... is disproportionate to the value thereof, the Customs Service may promptly order the destruction or other appropriate disposition of such property under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">19 U.S.C. &#167; 1612(b). One of the purposes of section 1612 is to substitute a cash fund for a vessel or other seized piece of property subject to large custodial costs. 1 David B. Smith, <i>Prosecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases</i> &#182; 8.04, at 8-28 (2000). As a result, \"[t]he proceeds of [a] sale [under section 1612] shall be held subject to the claims of parties in interest in the same manner as the seized property would have been subject to such claims.\" 19 C.F.R. &#167; 162.48(a). So viewed, a sale under section 1612 does not &#8212; and should not &#8212; amount to a final decision concerning a claimant's right to the property. To the contrary, such a sale is an intermediate step <i>pending</i> the making of such a decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Service made no claim of disproportionate expense. Instead, it took the position that, because the appellant could not afford to repay the costs incurred for seizure and storage, the boat had to be sold. This was a peculiar use of section 1612 &#8212; and in all probability an improper one. To make matters worse, the Service seems to have treated the sale of the boat under section 1612 as a final disposition of the case. Once it had sold the boat, the Service informed the appellant that there were no proceeds in excess of its bill for costs and told him that it was closing its file. We think that this was presumptuous &#8212; and without foundation in the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, it appears that the Service did not intend to treat the sale of the vessel as an actual determination that the vessel was forfeitable. Quite the opposite is true; the Service told the appellant that it had decided not to pursue a forfeiture. Nevertheless, the effect of the Service's action was the same as if it had decreed that the boat was forfeitable. The closing of the case meant that the appellant had lost both his property and his right to challenge that loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a corollary, the Service had unilaterally decided that the appellant was responsible for the seizure and storage costs without first having secured a determination that the boat was forfeitable. This was a fatal omission: had the appellant prevailed in a forfeiture action, he likely would not have been liable for these costs. <i>See, e.g., United States v. One 1986 Ford Pickup,</i> 56 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.1995) (in which the government conceded that it could not tax seizure and storage costs against a party who prevailed in a forfeiture action even though there had been reasonable cause for the initiation of the forfeiture proceedings); <i>United States v. One 48 Ft. White Colored Sailboat,</i> 59 F.Supp.2d 362, 366 (D.P.R.1999) (holding that a claimant who prevailed in a forfeiture action was not responsible for storage and maintenance costs incurred while her property was in the custody of the government).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the way in which the Service proceeded deprived the appellant of his property without due process. As said, a sale under section 1612 usually is an interlocutory remedy, leaving a claimant with a post-sale right to argue that he is entitled to the proceeds on the basis that the property originally seized was not forfeitable. The fact that there were no proceeds leftover from the sale of the boat in the instant case should not change this result; before the Service closed the case, it should have provided the appellant with a proceeding in which to argue that the boat was not forfeitable and that he was not liable for any of the seizure and storage costs, and that the proceeds of the sale should go to him (rather than to defray seizure and storage costs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Service offers no real rationale in support of its decision to treat the sale under section 1612 as a final determination that the appellant had no ownership interest in the boat. Instead, it focuses on the appellant's supposed failure to object to the sale of the boat under section 1612. This misses the point. The issue here is not the appellant's objection to the sale, but the proper distribution of the proceeds from the sale. The lack of objection may operate as a waiver as to fact of the sale &#8212; we need not decide this today &#8212; but not as to the proper distribution of the proceeds. Even if the appellant had acquiesced in a section 1612 sale,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we question how any such acquiescence could constitute either an abandonment of a right to the sale proceeds or an agreement to assume liability for the seizure and storage costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, that the appellant is entitled to his day in court, we vacate the judgment below and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the district court should provide the appellant with the process that the Service neglected to give him: an opportunity to show that the boat is not forfeitable and that he therefore should not be expected to bear the costs of seizure and storage. <i>See Boero v. DEA,</i> 111 F.3d 301, 306 (2d Cir.1997) (explaining that \"when the government is responsible for a... claimant's inability to present a claim... a hearing on the merits is available in the district court\") (citations and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In this regard, we note that the appellant filed the instant action on June 8, 2000-shortly after receiving notice of the Service's intent to sell and well before he received notice that the sale had been consummated</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Kelly, Commissioner of the United States Customs Service (the Service). The underlying case involves the Service's seizure of a boat belonging to the appellant on the ground that a culpable connection existed between the boat and certain money laundering and drug-trafficking activities. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. The appellant claims that the Service's actions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of this matter can be traced to October 20, 1998, when the government obtained a seizure warrant for the appellant's boat (a thirty-four foot Wellcraft Scarab III). The following day, the Service took possession of the boat. On October 29, it notified the appellant of the seizure by letter. This missive stated that the government had reason to believe that the vessel had been purchased with the proceeds of unlawful activity, and therefore, that it was forfeitable. The letter informed the appellant that he could request relief from the impending forfeiture by petitioning for remission within thirty days of the date of the letter. <i>See</i> 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1618.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the appellant did not file a petition for remission within the stipulated period, the Service sent him a second letter in which it advised that a notice of seizure and intent to forfeit would be published on and after May 5, 1999. The letter also stated that should the appellant wish to stay the administrative forfeiture proceedings and place the matter before a court, he would have to file a claim and post a bond within twenty days from the date of the first publication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant responded to this letter within the twenty-day period, acknowledging the \"claim and cost bond\" requirement. His letter stated that he had decided to apply for in forma pauperis (IFP) status so as to dispense with the necessity for posting a bond. The appellant attached a completed IFP application to this letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over eight months later &#8212; without either ruling on the IFP application or referring the case to the United States Attorney for the initiation of judicial proceedings &#8212; the Service informed the appellant, by letter dated February 7, 2000, that it had decided not to pursue forfeiture, but, rather, would release the boat to the appellant. The Service added, however, that the appellant would have to (a) pay the costs associated with the seizure and storage of the boat, and (b) sign an indemnity agreement. The letter admonished that if no action were taken toward \"the remission of the vessel\" within thirty days, the Service would commence administrative forfeiture proceedings by publishing a first notice of intent to forfeit at some time during March of 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant apparently did not accept the offer. In a follow-up letter, under date of March 29, 2000, the Service informed him that since he had not paid the seizure and storage costs, the boat would be summarily sold pursuant to 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1612(b), and that he would be entitled to any money leftover after payment of the costs. The appellant responded by bringing this suit on June 8, 2000.

As said, a sale under section 1612 usually is an interlocutory remedy, leaving a claimant with a post-sale right to argue that he is entitled to the proceeds on the basis that the property originally seized was not forfeitable. The fact that there were no proceeds leftover from the sale of the boat in the instant case should not change this result; before the Service closed the case, it should have provided the appellant with a proceeding in which to argue that the boat was not forfeitable and that he was not liable for any of the seizure and storage costs, and that the proceeds of the sale should go to him (rather than to defray seizure and storage costs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Service offers no real rationale in support of its decision to treat the sale under section 1612 as a final determination that the appellant had no ownership interest in the boat. Instead, it focuses on the appellant's supposed failure to object to the sale of the boat under section 1612. This misses the point. The issue here is not the appellant's objection to the sale, but the proper distribution of the proceeds from the sale. The lack of objection may operate as a waiver as to fact of the sale &#8212; we need not decide this today &#8212; but not as to the proper distribution of the proceeds. Even if the appellant had acquiesced in a section 1612 sale,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> we question how any such acquiescence could constitute either an abandonment of a right to the sale proceeds or an agreement to assume liability for the seizure and storage costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>IV.</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, that the appellant is entitled to his day in court, we vacate the judgment below and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the district court should provide the appellant with the process that the Service neglected to give him: an opportunity to show that the boat is not forfeitable and that he therefore should not be expected to bear the costs of seizure and storage. <i>See Boero v.
