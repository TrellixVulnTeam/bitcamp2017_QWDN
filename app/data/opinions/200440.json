An\naffirmative answer to the first question may not be dispositive\neven where creation of the entity does not involve a question of\ncongressional ratification. The ultimate issue is still a\nfederal question for the courts to decide.\"\n\n     At p. 27, l. 19, add this footnote after \"binding.\": \"PRCCCC\nhas not provided any authority to support a claim that Section 20\nis binding. Even if Section 20 were binding, that would not be\ndispositive. The Commonwealth could choose to meet an obligation\nby contracting with a private corporation or by other means.\"\n\n     At p. 29, l. 1-2, delete \"The provision of medical care, in\nour economy, is not primarily a state function.\" and insert,\n\"Medical care in Puerto Rico, as in the United States, is\nprovided by a combination of private and public sector entities.\"\n\f",
