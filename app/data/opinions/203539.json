Heriberto Arroyo, formerly a\n\npolice   officer    in   the   city   of    Worcester,   Massachusetts,   was\n\nconvicted by a jury on two different drug conspiracy counts.              On\n\nthis appeal, he challenges his sentence on two grounds, one legal\n\nand one mostly factual.            Since the latter turns in part on\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, we recite the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government. United States v. David, 940 F.2d\n\n722, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 955 (1992).\n\n            Thomas Vigliatura, an amateur bodybuilder and owner of T\n\nVig's Sports Supplements, ran a drug ring from the T Vig's store\n\nand out of his home in Worcester.           Arroyo, then a police officer,\n\npurchased GHB and GBL for personal use and to provide to friends.\n\nGHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is a regulated drug with limited\n\nmedical uses that is sold illegally for its euphoric and body-\n\nbuilding qualities.       GBL (gamma butyrolactone) is an associated\n\ndrug that converts to GHB on ingestion.\n\n            Arroyo also purchased cocaine from Vigliatura and used it\n\nwith him.    In addition, Arroyo at various times possessed both\n\ncocaine and ecstasy (an illegal euphoric drug) and used the drugs\n\nwith various other individuals.             In July 2005, both Arroyo and\n\nVigliatura were indicted, with several others, in a multi-count\n\nfederal indictment; two of the counts named Arroyo.\n\n            Count   I    charged   Arroyo,     Vigliatura   and   two   other\n\ndefendants with conspiring to distribute, and to possess with\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fintent to distribute, GHB and GBL in and around Worcester, in\n\nMassachusetts, and elsewhere from around summer 2000 to around\n\nsummer 2004.       Count II charged Arroyo, Vigliatura and one of the\n\nother count I defendants with conspiring to possess cocaine and\n\necstasy in Massachusetts and elsewhere during the same time period.\n\nBoth counts charged violations of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), which\n\ncriminalizes drug conspiracies.\n\n            At     trial,      the     government      offered     evidence      from\n\nVigliatura's former girlfriend as to Vigliatura's sale of GHB and\n\nGBL to Arroyo, Arroyo's social use of GHB and GBL and cocaine, and\n\nArroyo's supply of the drugs to others.               Additional witnesses told\n\nof Arroyo's possession of cocaine or ecstasy or both on various\n\noccasions;       one   witness    (a    Vigliatura      customer    and   later    a\n\ndistributor of GHB and GBL) had seen Arroyo at Vigliatura's office\n\nwith   a   bag    of   white   powder      and   a   scale   and   testified     that\n\nVigliatura had told the witness that Arroyo was there \"to measure\n\nup some cocaine.\"\n\n            The jury convicted on count I only as to the lesser\n\nincluded offense of conspiracy to possess GHB and GBL; the jury\n\nalso   convicted       on   count    II,    which     was    already   limited    to\n\npossession.       The district court, rejecting a defense claim at\n\nsentencing that only one conspiracy existed, sentenced Arroyo to\n\nnine months in prison on each of the two counts of conviction to be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fserved concurrently, a year of supervised release, and on each\n\ncount a $1,000 fine and a $25 special assessment--both mandatory.\n\n             The guideline sentencing range for the two possession\n\nconspiracies taken together, see U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b), keyed to\n\ncocaine as the most serious drug, id. § 2D2.1, would have been zero\n\nto six months (because Arroyo had no prior criminal convictions).\n\nId. ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table).         The district court rejected\n\npossible adjustments to the offense level but chose to depart\n\nupward from the guideline sentence, justifying the departure on two\n\ngrounds: first, because Arroyo was a police officer, and second,\n\nbecause the quantity of drugs and other circumstances indicated\n\nthat Arroyo had intended to share the drugs with others.\n\n             On appeal, Arroyo's main challenge is to the decision to\n\nimpose   a    non-guideline   sentence     based    in   part    on     Arroyo's\n\noccupation as a police officer.1         The gist of the argument is that\n\nit is irrational, thus certainly unreasonable, and a violation of\n\nhis substantive due process and equal protection rights under the\n\nConstitution    to   give   Arroyo   a   higher    sentence     based    on   his\n\noccupation.     Some judges, Arroyo adds, might well have given a\n\npolice officer a sentence below the guideline range, citing the\n\ntensions of police work.\n\n\n\n     1\n      To the extent that the district court relied upon the sharing\nof the drugs, Arroyo makes no objection. In fact, the guideline\ncommentary suggests that supplying drugs to others may warrant a\ndeparture. See U.S.S.G. § 2D2.1 cmt. n. 1.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             Arroyo says that his constitutional challenge should be\n\nreviewed de novo, while the government says that review should be\n\nfor plain error since he made no constitutional claim below.                  It\n\ndoes   not    matter    in     this     instance.     The     district   judge's\n\ndetermination     was        not   irrational.      And,    apart     from   any\n\nconstitutional    constraint       or    legal   infirmity,    a   non-guideline\n\nsentence is tested primarily under a generous abuse of discretion\n\nstandard,    Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 591 (2007), which\n\nthe sentence meets.\n\n             The guidelines identify various sentencing facts and\n\nfactors, some of which are encouraged or discouraged bases for\n\nadjusting a sentence, e.g., U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.2, 5H1.7; others may be\n\nforbidden, e.g., id. § 5H1.10; still others require adjustments up\n\nor down in calculating the guideline range, see, e.g., id. § 3A1.1.\n\nPertinently the guidelines say that education and vocational skills\n\nare \"not ordinarily relevant\" except where a defendant used special\n\nskills or abused a position of trust, see id. §§ 3B1.3, 5H1.2.\n\n             Here, the district court did not find either a special\n\nskills or abuse of a position of trust adjustment appropriate;\n\nArroyo suggests that any other consideration of occupation is\n\nirrational. But even without abuse of authority or special skills,\n\nthe district court plausibly found that in this instance the very\n\nbad example set by having a police officer buying and making\n\navailable illegal drugs enhanced the seriousness of the crime.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fThat judgment is not irrational.          Indeed, the judge is expected to\n\nconsider the history and characteristics of the defendant and the\n\nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense and\n\npromote respect for the law.        See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2006).\n\n            The district judge did not adopt an abstract general rule\n\nthat every police officer who commits a crime gets a higher\n\nsentence.     Arroyo had in fact worn his uniform for some of the\n\npurchases, and some of those who obtained drugs from him socially\n\nknew his position and could have deemed his furnishing of the drugs\n\nas trivializing the seriousness of the offense--enhancing a risk\n\nalready present where use is recreational and liable to be brushed\n\noff as nothing to worry about.\n\n            Nor did \"occupation\" stand alone in the district court's\n\ncalculus. The district judge mentioned the quantity of drugs--this\n\nwas certainly not a case of one-time use or use during a brief\n\nperiod--and also the fact that Arroyo did not merely possess the\n\ndrugs but made them available to others, even if he did not take\n\npayment for them. So not only was Arroyo's occupation plausibly an\n\naggravating    factor,   but   it   was    only   one   of   several   related\n\ncircumstances that seemed to the judge to take this out of the mine\n\nrun of cases where the conviction is for simple possession.\n\n            Arroyo may be right that other judges might choose to\n\nreduce the sentence for a police officer; he cites us to United\n\nStates v. Mays, 470 F. Supp. 642 (S.D. Tex. 1979), where a court\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\frefused to incarcerate two police officers who were convicted of\n\nkilling a criminal suspect after a high speed car chase.               Yet the\n\npossibility that a fact or factor like occupation cuts one way in\n\none case and a different way in another means nothing, so long as\n\na different context makes that sensible.\n\n               It is perhaps more troubling that on exactly the same\n\nfacts another judge might have chosen not to impose an above\n\nguideline sentence. Yet this merely shows that rational judges can\n\ngive       somewhat   different   weight   to   the   myriad   incommensurable\n\nfactors that may bear on sentencing.             Perfect equality in result\n\ncould be achieved only by rigidly binding guidelines and tight\n\nreview--an approach with its own costs and one firmly rejected by\n\nthe Supreme Court in a set of recent cases.2\n\n               Arroyo's independent second attack on the sentence is\n\nthat the two separate conspiracies for which he was convicted were\n\nreally one, and therefore it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of\n\nthe Constitution to sentence him for both convictions.3             See United\n\nStates v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 673 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied,\n\n\n\n       2\n      See Gall, 128 S. Ct. 586; Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S.\nCt. 558 (2007); Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456 (2007);\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n       3\n      Arroyo's brief says that it was erroneous to impose sentences\nfor both counts, \"and one of the convictions should be vacated,\"\nbut counsel at oral argument stated that his \"real double jeopardy\nargument is you can't double sentence for this,\" and there is no\nindication that he challenged the second conviction on double\njeopardy grounds in the district court.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f531 U.S. 1154 (2001).    Little of consequence turns on this issue\n\nsince the sentences were concurrent save for the double fine\n\n($1,000 on each count) and assessment ($25 on each count), and the\n\nfine could easily have been the same if the conduct for the two\n\nconspiracies were included in a single count.\n\n          Arroyo   is   still   entitled   to   review   on   his   single\n\nconspiracy claim, cf. Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292, 302-\n\n03 (1996), but the relatively short argument in his brief pivots on\n\nthis single, conclusory argument:\n\n          The drug activity, possession of GHB, ecstasy,\n          and cocaine, occurred during the same time\n          frame, in the same district, among the same\n          crowd (including three of the same named and\n          indicted core co-conspirators), for the same\n          purpose (to party), using the same means\n          (sharing).   The evidence used to prove the\n          \"conspiracies\" was virtually identical.\n\nThis is the whole argument apart from citation to and quotation\n\nfrom general case law dealing with the question of one versus\n\nseveral conspiracies and a truncated version of the evidence\n\npresented in the fact section of the brief.\n\n          A defendant arguing for one rather than two conspiracies\n\nis ordinarily arguing that a reasonable fact finder could only\n\nconceive the pattern of events in a single way.      David, 940 F.2d at\n\n732-33.   Drug conspiracies are rarely express and are usually\n\ninferred from an assemblage of conduct recounted through various\n\nwitnesses.   To support a single conspiracy argument would normally\n\ntake a meticulous assembly of evidence (taken favorably to the\n\n                                  -8-\n\fverdict) and its association with different conspiracy factors.\n\nNothing like that is attempted by Arroyo in this case.\n\n            The government says that the issue has been forfeited\n\nbecause    Arroyo   was   convicted   by     the   jury   (under   a   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt standard) of two conspiracies, did not present\n\nthis one conspiracy argument to the jury, and made it only to the\n\nsentencing judge--who employs a preponderance standard, United\n\nStates v. Anderson, 452 F.3d 87, 92 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006).                We need\n\nnot resolve this objection, for Arroyo has not made an argument\n\nsufficiently complete to counter the government's position.\n\n            The government's brief conceded that the two conspiracy\n\nfinding was a close call, but it argued                   in detail that the\n\nconspiracies differed as to the drugs and the likely geographic\n\nscope of the activities; that evidence indicated an overlap but not\n\ncomplete identity of conspirators; and that some of the incidents\n\nrelated only to one of the two supposedly separate conspiracies.\n\nThe argument may be forced but is not frivolous, especially because\n\nassigning different conspiracy labels to complex overlapping drug\n\nactivities is an imprecise art.        See David, 940 F.2d at 732-35.\n\n            In scanting the issue in his opening brief and forgoing\n\na reply, Arroyo's able and experienced counsel doubtless concluded\n\nthat a $25 stake did not warrant detracting from Arroyo's main\n\nattack on the use of his occupation to increase the jail time\n\nimposed.      Having      concluded   that     the   district      judge's   two\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fconspiracies determination is colorable, we think that Arroyo's\n\nsummary argument against it is satisfied by a summary disposition,\n\nthere being no conceivable threat of injustice.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

Arroyo, then a police officer, purchased GHB and GBL for personal use and to provide to friends. GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is a regulated drug with limited medical uses that is sold illegally for its euphoric and body-building qualities. GBL (gamma butyrolactone) is an associated drug that converts to GHB on ingestion.</p>\n<p>Arroyo also purchased cocaine from Vigliatura and used it with him. In addition, Arroyo at various times possessed both cocaine and ecstasy (an illegal euphoric drug) and used the drugs with various other individuals. In July 2005, both Arroyo and Vigliatura were indicted, with several others, in a multi-count federal indictment; two of the counts named Arroyo.</p>\n<p>Count I charged Arroyo, Vigliatura and two other defendants with conspiring to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, GHB and GBL in and around Worcester, in Massachusetts, and elsewhere from around summer 2000 to around summer 2004. Count II charged Arroyo, Vigliatura and one of the other count I defendants with conspiring to possess cocaine and ecstasy in Massachusetts and elsewhere during the same time period. Both counts charged violations of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), which criminalizes drug conspiracies.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government offered evidence from Vigliatura's former girlfriend as to Vigliatura's sale of GHB and GBL to Arroyo, Arroyo's social use of GHB and GBL and cocaine, and Arroyo's supply of the drugs to others. Additional witnesses told of Arroyo's possession of cocaine or ecstasy or both on various occasions; one witness (a Vigliatura customer and later a distributor of GHB and GBL) had seen Arroyo at Vigliatura's office with a bag of white powder and a scale and testified that Vigliatura had told the witness that Arroyo was there \"to measure up some cocaine.\"</p>\n<p>The jury convicted on count I only as to the lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess GHB and GBL; the jury also convicted on count II, which was already limited to possession. The district court, rejecting a defense claim at sentencing that only one conspiracy existed, sentenced Arroyo to nine months in prison on each of the two counts of conviction to be served concurrently, a year of supervised release, and on each count a $1,000 fine and a $25 special assessmentboth mandatory.</p>\n<p>The guideline sentencing range for the two possession conspiracies taken together, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b), keyed to cocaine as the most serious drug, <i>id.</i> § 2D2.1, would have been zero to six months (because Arroyo had no prior criminal convictions). <i>Id.</i> ch. 5, pt.

The evidence used to prove the \"conspiracies\" was virtually identical.</blockquote>\n<p>This is the <i>whole</i> argument apart from citation to and quotation from general case law dealing with the question of one versus several conspiracies and a truncated version of the evidence presented in the fact section of the brief.</p>\n<p>A defendant arguing for one rather than two conspiracies is ordinarily arguing that a reasonable fact finder could only conceive the pattern of events in a single way. <i>David,</i> 940 F.2d at 732-33. Drug conspiracies are rarely express and are usually inferred from an assemblage of conduct recounted through various witnesses. To support a single conspiracy argument would normally take a meticulous assembly of evidence (taken favorably to the verdict) and its association with different conspiracy factors. Nothing like that is attempted by Arroyo in this case.</p>\n<p>The government says that the issue has been forfeited because Arroyo was convicted by the jury (under a beyond a reasonable doubt standard) of two conspiracies, did not present this one conspiracy argument <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> to the jury, and made it only to the sentencing judgewho employs a preponderance standard, <i>United States v.

We need not resolve this objection, for Arroyo has not made an argument sufficiently complete to counter the government's position.</p>\n<p>The government's brief conceded that the two conspiracy finding was a close call, but it argued in detail that the conspiracies differed as to the drugs and the likely geographic scope of the activities; that evidence indicated an overlap but not complete identity of conspirators; and that some of the incidents related only to one of the two supposedly separate conspiracies. The argument may be forced but is not frivolous, especially because assigning different conspiracy labels to complex overlapping drug activities is an imprecise art. <i>See </i><i>David,</i> 940 F.2d at 732-35.</p>\n<p>In scanting the issue in his opening brief and forgoing a reply, Arroyo's able and experienced counsel doubtless concluded that a $25 stake did not warrant detracting from Arroyo's main attack on the use of his occupation to increase the jail time imposed.

Arroyo, then a police officer, purchased GHB and GBL for personal use and to provide to friends. GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is a regulated drug with limited medical uses that is sold illegally for its euphoric and body-building qualities. GBL (gamma butyrolactone) is an associated drug that converts to GHB on ingestion.</p>\n<p>Arroyo also purchased cocaine from Vigliatura and used it with him. In addition, Arroyo at various times possessed both cocaine and ecstasy (an illegal euphoric drug) and used the drugs with various other individuals. In July 2005, both Arroyo and Vigliatura were indicted, with several others, in a multi-count federal indictment; two of the counts named Arroyo.</p>\n<p>Count I charged Arroyo, Vigliatura and two other defendants with conspiring to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, GHB and GBL in and around Worcester, in Massachusetts, and elsewhere from around summer 2000 to around summer 2004. Count II charged Arroyo, Vigliatura and one of the other count I defendants with conspiring to possess cocaine and ecstasy in Massachusetts and elsewhere during the same time period. Both counts charged violations of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), which criminalizes drug conspiracies.</p>\n<p>At trial, the government offered evidence from Vigliatura's former girlfriend as to Vigliatura's sale of GHB and GBL to Arroyo, Arroyo's social use of GHB and GBL and cocaine, and Arroyo's supply of the drugs to others. Additional witnesses told of Arroyo's possession of cocaine or ecstasy or both on various occasions; one witness (a Vigliatura customer and later a distributor of GHB and GBL) had seen Arroyo at Vigliatura's office with a bag of white powder and a scale and testified that Vigliatura had told the witness that Arroyo was there \"to measure up some cocaine.\"</p>\n<p>The jury convicted on count I only as to the lesser included offense of conspiracy to possess GHB and GBL; the jury also convicted on count II, which was already limited to possession. The district court, rejecting a defense claim at sentencing that only one conspiracy existed, sentenced Arroyo to nine months in prison on each of the two counts of conviction to be served concurrently, a year of supervised release, and on each count a $1,000 fine and a $25 special assessmentboth mandatory.</p>\n<p>The guideline sentencing range for the two possession conspiracies taken together, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b), keyed to cocaine as the most serious drug, <i>id.</i> § 2D2.1, would have been zero to six months (because Arroyo had no prior criminal convictions). <i>Id.</i> ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). The district court rejected possible adjustments to the offense level but chose to depart upward from the guideline sentence, justifying the departure on two grounds: first, because Arroyo was a police officer, and second, because the quantity of drugs and other circumstances indicated that Arroyo had intended to share the drugs with others.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Arroyo's main challenge is to the decision to impose a non-guideline sentence based in part on Arroyo's occupation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> as a police officer.<sup>[1]</sup> The gist of the argument is that it is irrational, thus certainly unreasonable, and a violation of his substantive due process and equal protection rights under the Constitution to give Arroyo a higher sentence based on his occupation. Some judges, Arroyo adds, might well have given a police officer a sentence below the guideline range, citing the tensions of police work.</p>\n<p>Arroyo says that his constitutional challenge should be reviewed <i>de novo,</i> while the government says that review should be for plain error since he made no constitutional claim below. It does not matter in this instance. The district judge's determination was not irrational. And, apart from any constitutional constraint or legal infirmity, a non-guideline sentence is tested primarily under a generous abuse of discretion standard, <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 591, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007), which the sentence meets.</p>\n<p>The guidelines identify various sentencing facts and factors, some of which are encouraged or discouraged bases for adjusting a sentence, <i>e.g.,</i> U.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.2, 5H1.7; others may be forbidden, <i>e.g., id.</i> § 5H1.10; still others require adjustments up or down in calculating the guideline range, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> § 3A1.1. Pertinently the guidelines say that education and vocational skills are \"not ordinarily relevant\" except where a defendant used special skills or abused a position of trust, <i>see id.</i> §§ 3B1.3, 5H1.2.</p>\n<p>Here, the district court did not find either a special skills or abuse of a position of trust adjustment appropriate; Arroyo suggests that any other consideration of occupation is irrational. But even without abuse of authority or special skills, the district court plausibly found that in this instance the very bad example set by having a police officer buying and making available illegal drugs enhanced the seriousness of the crime. That judgment is not irrational. Indeed, the judge is expected to consider the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense and promote respect for the law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2006).</p>\n<p>The district judge did not adopt an abstract general rule that every police officer who commits a crime gets a higher sentence. Arroyo had in fact worn his uniform for some of the purchases, and some of those who obtained drugs from him socially knew his position and could have deemed his furnishing of the drugs as trivializing the seriousness of the offense enhancing a risk already present where use is recreational and liable to be brushed off as nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>Nor did \"occupation\" stand alone in the district court's calculus. The district judge mentioned the quantity of drugs this was certainly not a case of one-time use or use during a brief periodand also the fact that Arroyo did not merely possess the drugs but made them available to others, even if he did not take payment for them. So not only was Arroyo's occupation plausibly an aggravating factor, but it was only one of several related circumstances that seemed to the judge to take this out of the mine run of cases where the conviction is for simple possession.</p>\n<p>Arroyo may be right that <i>other</i> judges might choose to reduce the sentence for a police officer; he cites us to <i>United States v. Mays,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></span> (S.D.Tex.1979), where a court refused to incarcerate two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> police officers who were convicted of killing a criminal suspect after a high speed car chase. Yet the possibility that a fact or factor like occupation cuts one way in one case and a different way in another means nothing, so long as a different context makes that sensible.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps more troubling that on exactly the <i>same</i> facts another judge might have chosen <i>not</i> to impose an above guideline sentence. Yet this merely shows that rational judges can give somewhat different weight to the myriad incommensurable factors that may bear on sentencing.
