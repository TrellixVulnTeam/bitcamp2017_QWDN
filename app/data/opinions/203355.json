Robinson and Robinson & Brandt, P.S.C. on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 30, 2008\n\f             Howard,      Circuit       Judge.       Pursuant      to     a    written      plea\n\nagreement, Juan C. Rodriguez-Ferreira (Rodriguez) pleaded guilty\n\nto a two count indictment for conspiring to distribute in excess\n\nof    five   kilograms       of   cocaine,      in     violation         of    21   U.S.C.       §§\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846, and to possession with intent\n\nto    distribute      approximately        thirty       kilograms         of    cocaine,         in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A).                             The agreement\n\nstipulated various sentencing base level reductions so long as\n\nRodriguez       met   all    the       safety       valve   requirements            under    the\n\nsentencing guidelines.             See U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a).                    At the change\n\nof plea hearing Rodriguez was informed, and he acknowledged, that\n\nhe could not be sentenced below the mandatory minimum sentence of\n\n120    months    unless      he    satisfied         the    five    requirements            of    §\n\n5C1.2(a).\n\n             It is uncontested that Rodriguez satisfied four of the\n\nfive safety valve requirements.                 The government contends, and the\n\ndistrict court agreed, that Rodriguez did not fulfill the fifth\n\nrequirement under 5C1.2(a), and thus Rodriguez did not fulfill\n\nhis obligations under the plea agreement.                          The court imposed a\n\n120    months’      sentence      on    July    15,    2003.        Rodriguez         appeals,\n\nraising      \"the     lone    question         of    whether       the    district       court\n\nincorrectly determined that Rodriguez [] did not satisfy each of\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fthe factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, the\n\n'safety valve.'\"\n\nI.   SAFETY VALVE\n\n           U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a) provides in part:\n\n[T]he court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the\napplicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum\nsentence, if the court finds that the defendant meets the\ncriteria in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)-(5) set forth verbatim below:\n\n     (1)...\n     (5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing,\n     the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government\n     all   information  and   evidence  the   defendant  has\n     concerning the offense or offenses that were part of\n     the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or\n     plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant\n     or useful other information to provide or that the\n     Government is already aware of the information shall\n     not preclude a determination by the court that the\n     defendant has complied with this requirement.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n           We   focus    on    the   requirement   that   Rodriguez    was\n\ntruthfully to provide all of the information and evidence he had\n\nconcerning the offense or offenses not later than the time of the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n           We   review   the    sentencing   court's   factual   findings\n\nsupporting the adverse determination of safety valve eligibility\n\nfor clear error.    United States v. Marquez, 280 F.3d 19, 22 (lst\n\nCir. 2002).     Our review is thus deferential.        Id. at 26.     \"[A]n\n\nappellate court ought not to disturb either findings of fact or\n                                     -3-\n\fconclusions         drawn    there     from   unless    the       whole       of    the   record\n\ncompels    a    strong,      unyielding       belief    that       a    mistake       has   been\n\nmade.\"     United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThe   district       court’s      determination        of    an    issue       of    statutory\n\ninterpretation is reviewed de novo.                   Marquez, 280 F.3d at 22.\n\nIII. BURDEN OF PROOF\n\n               Rodriguez bears the burden of showing that he made\n\nappropriate and timely disclosures to the government.                               Id. at 25;\n\nUnited States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nThis burden obliges Rodriguez to prove that the information he\n\nsupplied       in    the    relevant     time       frame    was       both    truthful       and\n\ncomplete.       Marquez, 280 F.3d at 25.              \"[A] safety valve debriefing\n\nis a situation that cries out for straight talk; equivocations,\n\nhalf-truths, and veiled allusions will not do.\"                           Matos, 328 F.3d\n\nat 39. \"Nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure will\n\nsuffice [] and, therefore, [] truthful and complete disclosure is\n\na condition precedent to relief under the safety valve.\"                                      Id.\n\n\"Full    disclosure         is   the   price    that    Congress         has       attached    to\n\nrelief    under      the    [safety     valve]      statute.\"           United       States    v.\n\nMontanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (lst Cir. 1996).\n\nIV. HEARINGS\n\n               The    government         debriefed          Rodriguez.         Finding        his\n\ndisclosures lacking, the government filed a notice with the court\n\n                                              -4-\n\fthat Rodriguez had not complied with § 5C1.2(a).                   Rodriguez asked\n\nthe government to detail the specific areas in which he was not\n\ntruthful or complete.         The court held a hearing on Rodriguez’s\n\ncompliance on October 11, 2002. To assist it in deciding whether\n\nor not Rodriguez was compliant, the court requested memoranda on\n\nthe arguments and case law.           Subsequently, the court entered an\n\norder denying Rodriguez's request for a second debriefing.                      But,\n\nin light of the deadline established by § 5C1.2(a), the court\n\nalso   allowed    Rodriguez    to   submit   a     writing    in    compliance   by\n\nFebruary 12, 2003.      A hearing would then be scheduled, at which\n\nthe government would be allowed to give voice to its position on\n\nRodriguez’s compliance with the safety valve requirement based on\n\nhis written statement.\n\n            The   originally     scheduled       April   1,   2003,     sentencing\n\nhearing was called but was converted into an evidentiary hearing\n\non Rodriguez’s safety valve compliance.                  The court questioned\n\nRodriguez directly.      The government, having acquired Rodriguez’s\n\nwritten   statement    shortly      before   the    hearing,       maintained    its\n\nposition that Rodriguez had not provided a truthful and complete\n\nstatement   regarding    his    criminal     offense.         Distilled    to    its\n\nessence, the government had evidence – pilot's logs - indicating\n\nRodriguez's involvement with approximately 19 flights importing\n\ncontraband.      Rodriguez had maintained his involvement was limited\n\n                                      -5-\n\fto four or five flights, \"more or less.\"           The government also had\n\na   notarized     statement    from    co-defendant    Domingo    Garcia   that\n\nindicated Rodriguez was involved in the importation of some 290\n\nkilograms of cocaine.         The court asked the government to provide\n\ncopies of the pilot's logs that the government maintained proved\n\nRodriguez was not forthcoming.           On April 8, 2003, the government\n\nsubmitted the logs, Garcia's statement, and other evidence.\n\n            By order dated June 11, 2003, the district court found\n\nRodriguez had failed to satisfy the fifth requirement of the\n\nsafety valve provisions and was ineligible for sentencing below\n\nthe statutory minimum.         The sentencing hearing was called again\n\non July 2, 2003, but was continued until July 15 at Rodriguez's\n\nrequest.     Just prior to the final hearing, Rodriguez filed a\n\nstatement in which he confirmed that the pilot log entries were\n\naccurate.     His written statement also acknowledged that he had\n\nengaged in several transactions with co-defendant Domingo Garcia\n\ninvolving    approximately      290   kilograms   of   cocaine.     Rodriguez\n\ninsists that these admissions fulfilled his obligations under\n\nsection 5C1.2(a).       The district court was less than impressed,\n\nnoting     that    Rodriguez    \"had     ample    opportunity     before    the\n\nsentencing hearing to disclose information that he had on the\n\noffense, in a timely manner...[a]nd this handwritten statement\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffile[d]    20    minutes    ago   or     25    minutes     ago    is     not    a   timely\n\ndisclosure....\"\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\n               Rodriguez avers that he is entitled to another bite of\n\nthe apple, because under the express language of 5C1.2(a) he need\n\nonly provide a complete and truthful debriefing by the time of\n\nthe   sentencing      hearing.       The      argument    fails    on    two    grounds.\n\nFirst,    it    ignores     the   fact     that    Rodriguez       did    not       provide\n\ncomplete    disclosure       by   the    time     of   the   sentencing         hearing.\n\nSecond,    the     safety    valve      provisions        cannot       mean    that    the\n\ndistrict court must let a defendant nibble at the apple so as to\n\nfrustrate the imposition of a sentence as justice demands.                              We\n\nbriefly explain.\n\n      Rodriguez was debriefed on April 26, 2002.                       On February 10,\n\n2003,     Rodriguez     filed     additional       statements          clarifying      his\n\ndebriefing       statements.         The      first      sentencing       hearing       was\n\nscheduled for and held on April 1, 2003.                     As far as Rodriguez\n\nknew, he would be sentenced at that time.                    During the course of\n\nthat hearing, Rodriguez was directly examined by the court.                            The\n\nfollowing exchange took place concerning the declaration filed on\n\nFebruary 10, 2003:\n\n           THE COURT: What is stated there, is that all you\n      know concerning this offense or any other scheme\n      related to the offense that you were charged with?\n\n                                           -7-\n\f          DEFENDANT RODRIGUEZ: This is everything I know\n     about this crime, your honor. Virtually everything I\n     know has been specified here.\n\n     Based on the government's contrary evidence the district\n\ncourt denied the safety valve.             In due course, sentencing was set\n\nto proceed further on July 2, 2003, and then again continued to\n\nJuly 15, 2003.       Shortly before the July 15 sentencing hearing was\n\nconvened, Rodriguez filed a statement acknowledging as true both\n\nthe dramatically different statements of a co-conspirator, as\n\nwell as the veracity of the pilot logs.                 Thus, twice after the\n\ninitial sentencing hearing commenced, and after stating under\n\noath that he had disclosed all he knew, Rodriguez provided new\n\ninformation and detail.\n\n             Even   taking     the   language     of   5C1.2(a)   on    the   terms\n\nRodriguez urges -– that the district court was required to accept\n\ndebriefing information up to the time the sentencing hearing\n\nbegan   --   Rodriguez    nevertheless        plainly    had   not     provided   a\n\ncomplete and truthful disclosure, and he thus defaulted on his\n\nobligation under the plea agreement.              The district court clearly\n\nindicated, and the record clearly reflects, that the sentencing\n\nhearing began April 1, 2003.           During the course of that hearing –\n\nafter the sentencing hearing began – Rodriguez proffered new\n\ninformation.        Again during the July 3, 2003 hearing Rodriguez\n\nattempted    to     maneuver    into   a    new   position,    faced     with   the\n\n                                        -8-\n\finformation provided by the government.               Finally, mere minutes\n\nbefore the July 15, 2003 continued sentencing hearing began,\n\nRodriguez yet again proffered new information.                Having materially\n\namended his statement three times after the commencement of the\n\nsentencing hearing, it is all too obvious that Rodriguez had not\n\nbeen forthright.\n\n              In Matos, we held that the deadline for making truthful\n\nand complete disclosure is the moment that the sentencing hearing\n\nstarts.    Matos, 328 F.3d. 39. See also, United States v. Marin,\n\n144 F.3d. 1085, 1091-92 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. Long,\n\n77 F.3d 1060, 1062 (8th Cir. 1996)(Per Curiam).                       Rodriguez's\n\nthree   day    sentencing    hearing     began   April   1,    2003,    but   even\n\ncharitably viewing the hearing as commencing at a later date,\n\nRodriguez’s statements throughout his interactions with the court\n\nand with the government were, up until the very last moment,\n\nequivocations and half-truths.           That the opportunity to provide\n\ninformation pursuant to the safety valve provisions may become\n\nforeclosed at the start of the sentencing hearing does not mean\n\nthat the defendant gets to withhold material information until\n\nthat moment. The obligation to provide truthful and complete\n\ninformation      was   a   continuing    one     throughout     the    debriefing\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f     Where,    as    here,   a   defendant   puts   the   government   on   a\n\nstarvation    diet   -   providing   morsels   of   information   when   the\n\ndefendant is presented with the truth – he is engaged in artful\n\nmanipulation, not complete and truthful disclosure.            Rodriguez’s\n\nconduct does not come close to timely straight talk.\n\n     The sentence imposed by the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

Rodriguez         appeals,\n\nraising      \"the     lone    question         of    whether       the    district       court\n\nincorrectly determined that Rodriguez [] did not satisfy each of\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fthe factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, the\n\n'safety valve.'\"\n\nI.

HEARINGS\n\n               The    government         debriefed          Rodriguez.         Finding        his\n\ndisclosures lacking, the government filed a notice with the court\n\n                                              -4-\n\fthat Rodriguez had not complied with § 5C1.2(a).                   Rodriguez asked\n\nthe government to detail the specific areas in which he was not\n\ntruthful or complete.         The court held a hearing on Rodriguez’s\n\ncompliance on October 11, 2002. To assist it in deciding whether\n\nor not Rodriguez was compliant, the court requested memoranda on\n\nthe arguments and case law.           Subsequently, the court entered an\n\norder denying Rodriguez's request for a second debriefing.                      But,\n\nin light of the deadline established by § 5C1.2(a), the court\n\nalso   allowed    Rodriguez    to   submit   a     writing    in    compliance   by\n\nFebruary 12, 2003.      A hearing would then be scheduled, at which\n\nthe government would be allowed to give voice to its position on\n\nRodriguez’s compliance with the safety valve requirement based on\n\nhis written statement.\n\n            The   originally     scheduled       April   1,   2003,     sentencing\n\nhearing was called but was converted into an evidentiary hearing\n\non Rodriguez’s safety valve compliance.                  The court questioned\n\nRodriguez directly.      The government, having acquired Rodriguez’s\n\nwritten   statement    shortly      before   the    hearing,       maintained    its\n\nposition that Rodriguez had not provided a truthful and complete\n\nstatement   regarding    his    criminal     offense.         Distilled    to    its\n\nessence, the government had evidence – pilot's logs - indicating\n\nRodriguez's involvement with approximately 19 flights importing\n\ncontraband.      Rodriguez had maintained his involvement was limited\n\n                                      -5-\n\fto four or five flights, \"more or less.\"           The government also had\n\na   notarized     statement    from    co-defendant    Domingo    Garcia   that\n\nindicated Rodriguez was involved in the importation of some 290\n\nkilograms of cocaine.         The court asked the government to provide\n\ncopies of the pilot's logs that the government maintained proved\n\nRodriguez was not forthcoming.           On April 8, 2003, the government\n\nsubmitted the logs, Garcia's statement, and other evidence.\n\n            By order dated June 11, 2003, the district court found\n\nRodriguez had failed to satisfy the fifth requirement of the\n\nsafety valve provisions and was ineligible for sentencing below\n\nthe statutory minimum.         The sentencing hearing was called again\n\non July 2, 2003, but was continued until July 15 at Rodriguez's\n\nrequest.     Just prior to the final hearing, Rodriguez filed a\n\nstatement in which he confirmed that the pilot log entries were\n\naccurate.     His written statement also acknowledged that he had\n\nengaged in several transactions with co-defendant Domingo Garcia\n\ninvolving    approximately      290   kilograms   of   cocaine.     Rodriguez\n\ninsists that these admissions fulfilled his obligations under\n\nsection 5C1.2(a).       The district court was less than impressed,\n\nnoting     that    Rodriguez    \"had     ample    opportunity     before    the\n\nsentencing hearing to disclose information that he had on the\n\noffense, in a timely manner...[a]nd this handwritten statement\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffile[d]    20    minutes    ago   or     25    minutes     ago    is     not    a   timely\n\ndisclosure....\"\n\nV. DISCUSSION\n\n               Rodriguez avers that he is entitled to another bite of\n\nthe apple, because under the express language of 5C1.2(a) he need\n\nonly provide a complete and truthful debriefing by the time of\n\nthe   sentencing      hearing.       The      argument    fails    on    two    grounds.\n\nFirst,    it    ignores     the   fact     that    Rodriguez       did    not       provide\n\ncomplete    disclosure       by   the    time     of   the   sentencing         hearing.\n\nSecond,    the     safety    valve      provisions        cannot       mean    that    the\n\ndistrict court must let a defendant nibble at the apple so as to\n\nfrustrate the imposition of a sentence as justice demands.                              We\n\nbriefly explain.\n\n      Rodriguez was debriefed on April 26, 2002.                       On February 10,\n\n2003,     Rodriguez     filed     additional       statements          clarifying      his\n\ndebriefing       statements.         The      first      sentencing       hearing       was\n\nscheduled for and held on April 1, 2003.                     As far as Rodriguez\n\nknew, he would be sentenced at that time.                    During the course of\n\nthat hearing, Rodriguez was directly examined by the court.                            The\n\nfollowing exchange took place concerning the declaration filed on\n\nFebruary 10, 2003:\n\n           THE COURT: What is stated there, is that all you\n      know concerning this offense or any other scheme\n      related to the offense that you were charged with?\n\n                                           -7-\n\f          DEFENDANT RODRIGUEZ: This is everything I know\n     about this crime, your honor. Virtually everything I\n     know has been specified here.\n\n     Based on the government's contrary evidence the district\n\ncourt denied the safety valve.             In due course, sentencing was set\n\nto proceed further on July 2, 2003, and then again continued to\n\nJuly 15, 2003.       Shortly before the July 15 sentencing hearing was\n\nconvened, Rodriguez filed a statement acknowledging as true both\n\nthe dramatically different statements of a co-conspirator, as\n\nwell as the veracity of the pilot logs.                 Thus, twice after the\n\ninitial sentencing hearing commenced, and after stating under\n\noath that he had disclosed all he knew, Rodriguez provided new\n\ninformation and detail.\n\n             Even   taking     the   language     of   5C1.2(a)   on    the   terms\n\nRodriguez urges -– that the district court was required to accept\n\ndebriefing information up to the time the sentencing hearing\n\nbegan   --   Rodriguez    nevertheless        plainly    had   not     provided   a\n\ncomplete and truthful disclosure, and he thus defaulted on his\n\nobligation under the plea agreement.              The district court clearly\n\nindicated, and the record clearly reflects, that the sentencing\n\nhearing began April 1, 2003.           During the course of that hearing –\n\nafter the sentencing hearing began – Rodriguez proffered new\n\ninformation.        Again during the July 3, 2003 hearing Rodriguez\n\nattempted    to     maneuver    into   a    new   position,    faced     with   the\n\n                                        -8-\n\finformation provided by the government.               Finally, mere minutes\n\nbefore the July 15, 2003 continued sentencing hearing began,\n\nRodriguez yet again proffered new information.                Having materially\n\namended his statement three times after the commencement of the\n\nsentencing hearing, it is all too obvious that Rodriguez had not\n\nbeen forthright.\n\n              In Matos, we held that the deadline for making truthful\n\nand complete disclosure is the moment that the sentencing hearing\n\nstarts.    Matos, 328 F.3d. 39. See also, United States v. Marin,\n\n144 F.3d. 1085, 1091-92 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v.

Rodriguez's\n\nthree   day    sentencing    hearing     began   April   1,    2003,    but   even\n\ncharitably viewing the hearing as commencing at a later date,\n\nRodriguez’s statements throughout his interactions with the court\n\nand with the government were, up until the very last moment,\n\nequivocations and half-truths.           That the opportunity to provide\n\ninformation pursuant to the safety valve provisions may become\n\nforeclosed at the start of the sentencing hearing does not mean\n\nthat the defendant gets to withhold material information until\n\nthat moment. The obligation to provide truthful and complete\n\ninformation      was   a   continuing    one     throughout     the    debriefing\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f     Where,    as    here,   a   defendant   puts   the   government   on   a\n\nstarvation    diet   -   providing   morsels   of   information   when   the\n\ndefendant is presented with the truth – he is engaged in artful\n\nmanipulation, not complete and truthful disclosure.            Rodriguez’s\n\nconduct does not come close to timely straight talk.\n\n     The sentence imposed by the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f</pre>",
