Rubin for petitioner.\n     Jennifer Levings, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nU.S. Department of Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Greg D. Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, were\non brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         September 17, 2007\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       Appellant Digna Perez de Vega\n\nclaims that the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") improperly\n\nfound her inadmissible and removable.     A citizen of the Dominican\n\nRepublic, de Vega contends that after she had lived in the United\n\nStates for eleven years as a lawful permanent resident, her brief\n\nvisit to her home country was not sufficient for a finding of\n\ninadmissibility.   She claims that the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nRosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 460-61 (1963), holding that\n\nlawful permanent residents who take innocent, casual, and brief\n\ntrips outside the country are not \"entering\" upon their return to\n\nthe United States, remains good law, despite a significant 1996\n\nrevision to the statutory provision interpreted in Fleuti.       She\n\nfurther argues that the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") incorrectly found\n\nthat she was ineligible for cancellation of removal because she had\n\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony.     De Vega's arguments are\n\nunavailing and we affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n                                I.\n\n          We begin with a brief sketch of the relevant statutory\n\nprovisions.   Prior to 1996, a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\")\n\nwould not be considered to be \"entering\" (and therefore would not\n\nbe subject to various entrance requirements) if her departure from\n\nthe country \"was not intended or reasonably expected by [her].\"    8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(13) (1994).   The Supreme Court, in Fleuti, held\n\nthat an LPR who took an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" trip outside\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe United States could not be deemed to have \"intended\" to depart,\n\nand thus was not \"entering\" upon her return.           374 U.S. at 461-62.\n\nThus, when an LPR briefly left the country and returned, the\n\nprimary legal issue was the nature and duration of the trip, as\n\nthose factors would determine whether the person had \"intended\" to\n\nleave.\n\n            In 1996, Congress revised the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct (\"INA\") by passing the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), which deleted the legal term \"entry\"\n\nand replaced it with the terms \"admission\" and \"admitted.\" Pub. L.\n\n104-208, § 308(f)(1)(A), (B).1        The revised statute provides that\n\nan LPR is not considered to be seeking admission when entering the\n\nUnited    States,   unless   she   falls     within   one    of   six   defined\n\ncategories.   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).        The relevant category for\n\nthis case covers LPRs who have \"committed an offense identified in\n\nsection   1182(a)(2),\"   id.,      meaning    those   LPRs    who   have   been\n\nconvicted of, \"or who admit[] having committed, or who admit[]\n\ncommitting acts which constitute the essential elements of,\" a\n\ncrime involving moral turpitude.        Id. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).\n\n            The BIA first addressed the viability of the Fleuti\n\ndoctrine, in light of IIRIRA's modifications to the INA, in 1998,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Under the revised statute, an alien is \"admitted\" to the\nUnited States if she enters lawfully after inspection and\nauthorization   by  an   immigration   officer.     8   U.S.C.\n§ 1101(a)(13)(A).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fand concluded that IIRIRA had abrogated Fleuti's exemption of LPRs\n\nwho departed the country for innocent, casual, and brief trips from\n\nthe legal requirements for \"entry\" (or its current equivalent,\n\n\"admission\").      In re Matter of Collado-Munoz, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1061,\n\n1065 (1998) (\"[W]e find that the Fleuti doctrine, with its origins\n\nin the no longer existent definition of 'entry' in the Act, does\n\nnot survive the enactment of the IIRIRA as a judicial doctrine.\").\n\nThe BIA held that the plain text of the statute meant that LPRs who\n\nleave the country and return, if they fall within one of the six\n\nenumerated categories, \"shall be regarded as 'seeking an admission'\n\ninto the United States, without regard to whether the alien's\n\ndeparture       from   the     United    States    might    previously      have   been\n\nregarded    as    'brief,       casual,     and    innocent'      under    the    Fleuti\n\ndoctrine.\"        Id. at 1066.           The BIA has since reaffirmed this\n\ninterpretation.         See, e.g., In re Nhat Hoang Do, No. A73-256-398,\n\n2005 WL 3709267 (BIA Dec. 30, 2005).\n\n                                           II.\n\n            With this statutory background, we turn to the facts of\n\nthis   case.       De    Vega     entered    the    United       States,    apparently\n\nillegally, in 1988 and adjusted her status to LPR in 1992.                           In\n\n1998, while living in Massachusetts, de Vega was charged, in a\n\nsingle indictment, with larceny of property valued at more than\n\n$250.00 and false representations to the Department of Public\n\nWelfare    in    order    to    secure    support.         She   admitted    to    facts\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fsufficient     for   a   finding   of     guilt,   and   the   court   issued    a\n\ncontinuation without a finding of guilt, contingent on her payment\n\nof $27,963 in restitution over six years.\n\n           In December 2003, de Vega traveled to the Dominican\n\nRepublic to visit her family.        Upon her return to Boston on January\n\n3, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security determined that she\n\nwas an \"arriving alien,\" and that she was inadmissible under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C) because of her criminal conviction.                     De\n\nVega appeared before an IJ, where she admitted that she was a\n\ncitizen of the Dominican Republic, that she had committed a crime\n\ninvolving moral turpitude, and that she was thereby removable. She\n\nnonetheless moved to terminate the proceedings, claiming that she\n\ncould not be classified as seeking \"admission\" to the United States\n\nbecause she was an LPR and had left the country only for an\n\n\"innocent, casual, and brief\" trip, Fleuti, 374 U.S. at 460-61.\n\nShe also filed a petition for cancellation of removal, arguing that\n\nthe larceny and fraud charges had not resulted in a \"conviction\"\n\nfor an aggravated felony, thereby rendering her eligible for that\n\nform of relief.\n\n           The IJ denied de Vega's motion to terminate, finding that\n\nthe   Fleuti   doctrine     had    been    superseded    by    Congress's   1996\n\namendments to the INA.        Therefore, the nature and duration of de\n\nVega's visit to the Dominican Republic were irrelevant, and her\n\nprior conviction required that she satisfy the conditions for\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fadmission.   The IJ also denied her request for cancellation of\n\nremoval because de Vega's 1998 continuation without a finding of\n\nguilt for false representations amounted to an aggravated felony\n\nconviction, as defined by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M), resulting in\n\nineligibility for cancellation, id. § 1229b(a).     Based on these\n\nfindings, the IJ ordered de Vega removed to the Dominican Republic.\n\n          De Vega appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision without further opinion. She then appealed to this court.\n\nBecause the BIA affirmed without writing its own opinion, we review\n\nthe IJ's decision.   See Simo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).    Our\n\nreview of the agency's statutory interpretations is de novo,\n\nalthough we give deference, in accordance with Chevron U.S.A v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43\n\n(1984), to the agency's reasonable interpretations of ambiguous or\n\nunclear statutory terms.     We give significant deference to the\n\nagency's factual findings.    Hoxha v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 210, 216\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (\"We review the IJ's factual findings . . . 'under\n\nthe deferential substantial evidence standard.'\" (quoting Dhima v.\n\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005))).\n\n                                III.\n\n          We turn first to the current viability of the Fleuti\n\ndoctrine, in light of IIRIRA's revisions to the INA.   Our court has\n\nnot previously addressed this question, although the other courts\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fof   appeals      that    have    confronted   it    have   upheld    the   BIA's\n\ninterpretation of IIRIRA.            Most recently, the Fifth Circuit held\n\nthat \"IIRIRA superseded the Fleuti doctrine . . . . The plain\n\nlanguage of the statute does not allow for the exception found by\n\nthe Court in Fleuti.\"            Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d\n\n498, 501 (5th Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted).                   The Fifth Circuit\n\nalso noted that its decision was consistent with those of other\n\ncircuits.       Id. at 501-02 (citing Tapia v. Ashcroft, 351 F.3d 795,\n\n799 (7th Cir. 2003); Tineo v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 382, 394 (3d Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n            We agree with the BIA and our sister circuits.                    The\n\ncurrent version of the INA deems a lawful permanent resident, who\n\nleaves    the    United     States    and   then    returns,    to   be   \"seeking\n\nadmission\" if that person fits within any of the six categories\n\nenumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).               The purpose, duration,\n\nand nature of the LPR's departure from the United States — the\n\nelements of the Fleuti doctrine — are irrelevant to the legal\n\ndetermination of whether she must undergo the admission process\n\nupon her return.         Although we find the statute plain on its face,\n\nthe same result would obtain if we thought the statute unclear.                We\n\nwould then defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation.                   See\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 843 (1984).         Therefore, the IJ did not err in deciding that de\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fVega   could   not   rely    on   the    Fleuti   doctrine   to    mitigate   the\n\nconsequences of her departure from the country.\n\n           Second, de Vega claims that she was not convicted of an\n\naggravated felony, and thus the IJ erred in finding her ineligible\n\nfor cancellation of removal, a form of relief available only to\n\nLPRs who have not been convicted of such a crime.                 See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229b(a)(3)     (stating      that      the    Attorney   General    may    grant\n\ncancellation of removal only if the alien \"has not been convicted\n\nof any aggravated felony\").               She contends that there was no\n\nconviction     at   all,   and,   alternatively,      that   if   there    were   a\n\nconviction, it was not for an aggravated felony.\n\n           We think it clear that de Vega was convicted within the\n\nmeaning of the INA.        IIRIRA specifies the criteria necessary for a\n\nconviction:\n\n           The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to\n           an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the\n           alien entered by a court or, if adjudication\n           of guilt has been withheld, where — (i) a\n           judge or jury has found the alien guilty or\n           the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo\n           contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to\n           warrant a finding of guilty, and (ii) the\n           judge has ordered some form of punishment,\n           penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty\n           to be imposed.\n\nId. § 1101(a)(48)(A).         There is no dispute that she admitted to\n\nfacts sufficient for a finding of guilt.             However, she claims that\n\nthe order requiring her to pay restitution did not constitute a\n\nform of \"punishment, penalty, or restraint on [her] liberty.\"                 Id.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f            Although the IJ and the BIA implicitly rejected de Vega's\n\nargument on this point, neither provided an explanation.                   We\n\nconclude that the particular order in this case was plainly a\n\npunishment or penalty.      De Vega was required to pay a large sum of\n\nmoney.   If she failed to make her payments, her admission could\n\nripen into a guilty plea and she would be subject to further\n\npunishment.       See Commonwealth v. Aboulmal, No. 02-P-830, 2003 WL\n\n22309058, at *2 (Mass. App. Ct.) (\"An admission to sufficient facts\n\nmay result . . . in a continuance without a finding to a specific\n\ndate, conditioned on compliance with specific terms.             In the event\n\nof a violation of those terms, the 'admission' remains and may\n\nripen into an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence.\").\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, therefore, a continuation, based on an\n\nadmission    of    facts   sufficient   for   a   finding   of    guilt   and\n\nconditioned on payment of restitution, is treated as the legal\n\nequivalent of a guilty plea and probationary sentence. Id. (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Villalobos, 777 N.E.2d 116, 119-20 (Mass. 2002)).\n\nBased on the facts of this case and Massachusetts law, we conclude\n\nthat the restitution order was punitive, and we find no error in\n\nthe agency's conclusion that, under the INA definition, de Vega was\n\nconvicted.\n\n            De Vega claims, alternatively, that her conviction was\n\nnot for an \"aggravated felony,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).               The IJ\n\nfound that de Vega's false representation to the Massachusetts\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fDepartment of Public Welfare amounted to an aggravated felony,\n\nunder IIRIRA, because it was \"an offense that involves fraud or\n\ndeceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\"\n\nid. § 1101(a)(43)(M).2   There was no dispute that fraud was a\n\nnecessary element of the offense; additionally, the IJ found that\n\nthe victim lost more than $10,000 because the restitution ordered\n\nwas over $27,000, thereby creating the inference that de Vega's\n\nmisrepresentations caused losses of that amount. The IJ noted that\n\nthe restitution was technically imposed in response to the larceny\n\ncharge, which the IJ found not to be an aggravated felony, but held\n\nthat the distinction was immaterial because the two charges were\n\n\"coterminous in terms of the dates of occurrence on the complaint\n\nform\" and the sentence imposed \"relate[d] clearly to both counts.\"\n\n          De Vega argues that the false representation charge\n\ncannot amount to an aggravated felony because there is insufficient\n\nevidence that the victim of her false representations suffered\n\n\n\n     2\n       De Vega was convicted under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 18, § 5B,\nwhich states:\n          Any   person   [who]  knowingly   makes   a   false\n     representation or, contrary to a legal duty to do so,\n     knowingly fails to disclose any material fact affecting\n     eligibility or level of benefits to the department of\n     public welfare or its agents, for the purpose of causing\n     any   person,   including   the   person   making   such\n     representations, to be supported in whole or in part by\n     the commonwealth, or for the purpose of procuring a\n     payment under any assistance program administered by the\n     department, shall be punished by a fine of not less than\n     two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars or by\n     imprisonment for not more than one year.\n\n                               -10-\n\flosses in excess of $10,000.         She says that the restitution order\n\ncan only be \"attributed\" to the larceny charge, and thus there was\n\nno single conviction based on fraud that resulted in the requisite\n\namount of loss.\n\n           We have previously held that the government meets its\n\nburden when \"the record of conviction,\" which includes \"an official\n\nrecord of plea,\" Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), provides clear and convincing evidence that the alien's\n\nconviction \"involved a loss to victim(s) of more than $10,000,\" id.\n\nat 60 (emphasis added).      The IJ in this case found that the false\n\nrepresentation    conviction       \"involved\"   losses   of   the   requisite\n\namount, and we owe substantial deference to that factual finding,\n\nsee Hoxha, 446 F.3d at 216.\n\n           The IJ's finding was based on evidence in the record of\n\nconviction that a single course of conduct underlay both charges.\n\nIn other words, de Vega engaged in a single scheme, resulting in\n\ntwo separate criminal charges, which caused the victim to lose over\n\n$27,000.    The IJ noted, in reaching this decision, that one\n\ncomplaint charged both crimes and the two crimes appear to have\n\noccurred during the same dates.         On the Tender of Plea agreement,\n\nthe defendant submitted her recommendations for the terms of her\n\nplea.      She    included     a     bracket    symbol   around     her   two\n\nrecommendations, suggesting that the terms of the plea could be\n\nread as a whole rather than piecemeal.          Furthermore, she suggested\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\frestitution for the larceny charge, but also proposed, specifically\n\nas   to   the    false   representation   charge,     that   the    sentence   be\n\n\"subject    to    continuation    of    restitution    not    paid\"    and    that\n\n\"restitution to be determined based upon Probation [Office]'s\n\ndetermination of her ability to pay.\"               This notation, made on\n\nbehalf of defendant by her counsel, strongly supports the IJ's\n\ninference that the two charges were factually interrelated and that\n\nthe restitution order reflected the total loss to the victim.\n\n            The Tender of Plea form also included the judge's final\n\ndecision as to the appropriate sentence.                While de Vega made\n\ndiscrete (though overlapping) recommendations for the two charges,\n\nthe judge imposed a single sentence without any separation or\n\ndistinction      between   the   two   charges.     Nothing    in     the   record\n\nsuggests that the loss was the result only of the larceny and not\n\nof the false representations; rather, the record demonstrates that\n\nthe losses suffered by Massachusetts were the result of one course\n\nof conduct that gave rise to two interrelated charges.\n\n            We conclude that the evidence contained in the record\n\nclearly and convincingly supports the IJ's finding that de Vega was\n\nconvicted of a crime, false representations, for which fraud was a\n\nnecessary element, that involved losses to the victim of more than\n\n$10,000, amounting to an aggravated felony.            Therefore, the denial\n\nof her petition for cancellation of removal was justified.\n\n            Petition denied.\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f",

Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, were on brief, for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, LIPEZ, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellant Digna Perez de Vega claims that the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") improperly found her inadmissible and removable. A citizen of the Dominican Republic, de Vega contends that after she had lived in the United States for eleven years as a lawful permanent resident, her brief visit to her home country was not sufficient for a finding of inadmissibility. She claims that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Rosenberg v. Fleuti,</i> 374 U.S. 449, 460-61, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), holding that lawful permanent residents who take innocent, casual, and brief trips outside the country are not \"entering\" upon their return to the United States, remains good law, despite a significant 1996 revision to the statutory provision interpreted in <i>Fleuti.</i> She further argues that the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") incorrectly found that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal because she had been convicted of an aggravated felony. De Vega's arguments are unavailing and we affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We begin with a brief sketch of the relevant statutory provisions. Prior to 1996, a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\") would not be considered to be \"entering\" (and therefore would not be subject to various entrance requirements) if her departure from the country \"was not intended or reasonably expected by [her].\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13) (1994). The Supreme Court, in <i>Fleuti,</i> held that an LPR who took an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" trip outside the United States could not be deemed to have \"intended\" to depart, and thus was not \"entering\" upon her return. 374 U.S. at 461-62, 83 S.Ct. 1804. Thus, when an LPR briefly left the country and returned, the primary legal issue was the nature and duration of the trip, as those factors would determine whether the person had \"intended\" to leave.</p>\n<p>In 1996, Congress revised the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") by passing the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which deleted the legal term \"entry\" and replaced it with the terms \"admission\" and \"admitted.\" Pub.L. 104-208, § 308(f)(1)(A), (B).<sup>[1]</sup> The revised statute provides that an LPR is not considered to be seeking admission when entering the United States, unless she falls within one of six defined categories. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C). The relevant category for this case covers LPRs who have \"committed an offense identified in section 1182(a)(2),\" <i>id.,</i> meaning those LPRs who have been convicted of, \"or who admit[] having committed, or who admit[ ] committing acts which constitute the essential elements of,\" a crime involving moral turpitude. <i>Id.</i> § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p>The BIA first addressed the viability of the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine, in light of IIRIRA's modifications to the INA, in 1998, and concluded that IIRIRA had abrogated <i>Fleuti</i>'s exemption of LPRs who departed the country for innocent, casual, and brief trips from the legal requirements for \"entry\" (or its current equivalent, \"admission\"). <i>In re Matter of Collado-Munoz,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1061, 1065 (1998) (\"[W]e find that the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine, with its origins in the no longer existent definition of `entry' in the Act, does not survive the enactment of the IIRIRA as a judicial. doctrine.\"). The BIA held that the plain text of the statute meant that LPRs who leave the country and return, if they fall within one of the six enumerated categories, \"shall be regarded as `seeking an admission' into the United States, without regard to whether the alien's departure from the United States might previously have been regarded as `brief, casual, and innocent' under the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1066. The BIA has since reaffirmed this interpretation. <i>See, e.g., In RE: NHAT HOANG DO,</i> No. A73-256-398, 2005 WL 3709267 (BIA Dec. 30, 2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>With this statutory background, we turn to the facts of this case. De Vega entered the United States, apparently illegally, in 1988 and adjusted her status to LPR in 1992. In 1998, while living in Massachusetts, de Vega was charged, in a single indictment, with larceny of property valued at more than $250.00 and false representations to the Department of Public Welfare in order to secure support. She admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt, and the court issued a continuation without a finding of guilt, contingent on her payment of $27,963 in restitution over six years.</p>\n<p>In December 2003, de Vega traveled to the Dominican Republic to visit her family. Upon her return to Boston on January 3, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security determined that she was an \"arriving alien,\" and that she was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C) because of her criminal conviction. De Vega appeared before an IJ, where she admitted that she was a citizen of the Dominican Republic, that she had committed a crime involving moral turpitude, and that she was thereby removable. She nonetheless moved to terminate the proceedings, claiming that she could not be classified as seeking \"admission\" to the United States because she was an LPR and had left the country only for an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" trip, <i>Fleuti,</i> 374 U.S. at 460-61, 83 S.Ct. 1804. She also filed a petition for cancellation of removal, arguing that the larceny and fraud charges had not resulted in a \"conviction\" for an aggravated felony, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> thereby rendering her eligible for that form of relief.</p>\n<p>The IJ denied de Vega's motion to terminate, finding that the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine had been superseded by Congress's 1996 amendments to the INA. Therefore, the nature and duration of de Vega's visit to the Dominican Republic were irrelevant, and her prior conviction required that she satisfy the conditions for admission. The IJ also denied her request for cancellation of removal because de Vega's 1998 continuation without a finding of guilt for false representations amounted to an aggravated felony conviction, as defined by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M), resulting in ineligibility for cancellation, <i>id.</i> § 1229b(a). Based on these findings, the IJ ordered de Vega removed to the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p>De Vega appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ's decision without further opinion. She then appealed to this court. Because the BIA affirmed without writing its own opinion, we review the IJ's decision. <i>See </i><i>Simo v. Gonzales,</i> 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2005). Our review of the agency's statutory interpretations is de novo, although we give deference, in accordance with <i>Chevron U.S.A v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), to the agency's reasonable interpretations of ambiguous or unclear statutory terms. We give significant deference to the agency's factual findings. <i>Hoxha v. Gonzales,</i> 446 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.2006) (\"We review the IJ's factual findings . . . `under the deferential substantial evidence standard.'\" (quoting <i>Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2005))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We turn first to the current viability of the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine, in light of IIRIRA's revisions to the INA. Our court has not previously addressed this question, although the other courts of appeals that have confronted it have upheld the BIA's interpretation of IIRIRA. Most recently, the Fifth Circuit held that \"IIRIRA superseded the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine. . . . The plain language of the statute does not allow for the exception found by the Court in <i>Fleuti.</i>\" <i>Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales,</i> 462 F.3d 498, 501 (5th Cir.2006) (footnote omitted). The Fifth Circuit also noted that its decision was consistent with those of other circuits. <i>Id.</i> at 501-02 (citing <i>Tapia v. Ashcroft,</i> 351 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir.2003); <i>Tineo v. Ashcroft,</i> 350 F.3d 382, 394 (3d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>We agree with the BIA and our sister circuits. The current version of the INA deems a lawful permanent resident, who leaves the United States and then returns, to be \"seeking admission\" if that person fits within any of the six categories enumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C). The purpose, duration, and nature of the LPR's departure from the United States  the elements of the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine  are irrelevant to the legal determination of whether she must undergo the admission process upon her return. Although we find the statute plain on its face, the same result would obtain if we thought the statute unclear. We would then defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Therefore, the IJ did not err in deciding that de Vega could not rely on the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine to mitigate the consequences of her departure from the country.</p>\n<p>Second, de Vega claims that she was not convicted of an aggravated felony, and thus the IJ erred in finding her ineligible for cancellation of removal, a form of relief available only to LPRs who have not been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> convicted of such a crime. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3) (stating that the Attorney General may grant cancellation of removal only if the alien \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony\"). She contends that there was no conviction at all, and, alternatively, that if there were a conviction, it was not for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p>We think it clear that de Vega was convicted within the meaning of the INA. IIRIRA specifies the criteria necessary for a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where  (i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, and (ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1101(a)(48)(A). There is no dispute that she admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt. However, she claims that the order requiring her to pay restitution did not constitute a form of \"punishment, penalty, or restraint on [her] liberty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although the IJ and the BIA implicitly rejected de Vega's argument on this point, neither provided an explanation. We conclude that the particular order in this case was plainly a punishment or penalty. De Vega was required to pay a large sum of money. If she failed to make her payments, her admission could ripen into a guilty plea and she would be subject to further punishment. <i>See Commonwealth v. Aboulmal,</i> No. 02-P-830, 2003 WL 22309058, at *2 (Mass.App.Ct.) (\"An admission to sufficient facts may result . . . in a continuance without a finding to a specific date, conditioned on compliance with specific terms. In the event of a violation of those terms, the `admission' remains and may ripen into an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence.\"). Under Massachusetts law, therefore, a continuation, based on an admission of facts sufficient for a finding of guilt and conditioned on payment of restitution, is treated as the legal equivalent of a guilty plea and probationary sentence. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Commonwealth v. Villalobos,</i> 437 Mass. 797, 777 N.E.2d 116, 119-20 (2002)). Based on the facts of this case and Massachusetts law, we conclude that the restitution order was punitive, and we find no error in the agency's conclusion that, under the INA definition, de Vega was convicted.</p>\n<p>De Vega claims, alternatively, that her conviction was not for an \"aggravated felony,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). The IJ found that de Vega's false representation to the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare amounted to an aggravated felony, under IIRIRA, because it was \"an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\" <i>id.</i> § 1101(a)(43)(M).<sup>[2]</sup> There was no dispute that fraud was a necessary element of the offense; additionally, the IJ found that the victim lost more than $10,000 because the restitution ordered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> was over $27,000, thereby creating the inference that de Vega's misrepresentations caused losses of that amount. The IJ noted that the restitution was technically imposed in response to the larceny charge, which the IJ found not to be an aggravated felony, but held that the distinction was immaterial because the two charges were \"coterminous in terms of the dates of occurrence on the complaint form\" and the sentence imposed \"relate[d] clearly to both counts.\"</p>\n<p>De Vega argues that the false representation charge cannot amount to an aggravated felony because there is insufficient evidence that the victim of her false representations suffered losses in excess of $10,000. She says that the restitution order can only be \"attributed\" to the larceny charge, and thus there was no single conviction based on fraud that resulted in the requisite amount of loss.</p>\n<p>We have previously held that the government meets its burden when \"the record of conviction,\" which includes \"an official record of plea,\" <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 57 (1st Cir.2006), provides clear and convincing evidence that the alien's conviction \"<i>involved</i> a loss to victim(s) of more than $10,000,\" <i>id.</i> at 60 (emphasis added). The IJ in this case found that the false representation conviction \"involved\" losses of the requisite amount, and we owe substantial deference to that factual finding, <i>see </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 216.</p>\n<p>The IJ's finding was based on evidence in the record of conviction that a single course of conduct underlay both charges. In other words, de Vega engaged in a single scheme, resulting in two separate criminal charges, which caused the victim to lose over $27,000. The IJ noted, in reaching this decision, that one complaint charged both crimes and the two crimes appear to have occurred during the same dates. On the Tender of Plea agreement, the defendant submitted her recommendations for the terms of her plea. She included a bracket symbol around her two recommendations, suggesting that the terms of the plea could be read as a whole rather than piecemeal. Furthermore, she suggested restitution for the larceny charge, but also proposed, specifically as to the false representation charge, that the sentence be \"subject to continuation of restitution not paid\" and that \"restitution to be determined based upon Probation [Office]'s determination of her ability to pay.\" This notation, made on behalf of defendant by her counsel, strongly supports the IJ's inference that the two charges were factually interrelated and that the restitution order reflected the total loss to the victim.</p>\n<p>The Tender of Plea form also included the judge's final decision as to the appropriate sentence. While de Vega made discrete (though overlapping) recommendations for the two charges, the judge imposed a single sentence without any separation or distinction between the two charges. Nothing in the record suggests that the loss was the result only of the larceny and not of the false representations; rather, the record demonstrates that the losses suffered by Massachusetts were the result of one course of conduct that gave rise to two interrelated charges.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the evidence contained in the record clearly and convincingly supports the IJ's finding that de Vega was convicted of a crime, false representations, for which fraud was a necessary element, that involved losses to the victim of more than $10,000, amounting to an aggravated felony. Therefore, the denial of her petition for cancellation of removal was justified.</p>\n<p><i>Petition denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Under the revised statute, an alien is \"admitted\" to the United States if she enters lawfully after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p>[2]  De Vega was convicted under Mass.

Our court has not previously addressed this question, although the other courts of appeals that have confronted it have upheld the BIA's interpretation of IIRIRA. Most recently, the Fifth Circuit held that \"IIRIRA superseded the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine. . . . The plain language of the statute does not allow for the exception found by the Court in <i>Fleuti.</i>\" <i>Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"45530\"><a href=\"/opinion/45530/malagon-de-fuentes-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 501 (5th Cir.2006) (footnote omitted). The Fifth Circuit also noted that its decision was consistent with those of other circuits. <i>Id.</i> at 501-02 (citing <i>Tapia v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784405\"><a href=\"/opinion/784405/octavio-tapia-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span>, 799 (7th Cir.2003); <i>Tineo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784259\"><a href=\"/opinion/784259/carlos-tineo-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-usa-james-w-ziglar/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 394 (3d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>We agree with the BIA and our sister circuits. The current version of the INA deems a lawful permanent resident, who leaves the United States and then returns, to be \"seeking admission\" if that person fits within any of the six categories enumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C). The purpose, duration, and nature of the LPR's departure from the United States  the elements of the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine  are irrelevant to the legal determination of whether she must undergo the admission process upon her return. Although we find the statute plain on its face, the same result would obtain if we thought the statute unclear. We would then defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984). Therefore, the IJ did not err in deciding that de Vega could not rely on the <i>Fleuti</i> doctrine to mitigate the consequences of her departure from the country.</p>\n<p>Second, de Vega claims that she was not convicted of an aggravated felony, and thus the IJ erred in finding her ineligible for cancellation of removal, a form of relief available only to LPRs who have not been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> convicted of such a crime. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3) (stating that the Attorney General may grant cancellation of removal only if the alien \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony\"). She contends that there was no conviction at all, and, alternatively, that if there were a conviction, it was not for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p>We think it clear that de Vega was convicted within the meaning of the INA. IIRIRA specifies the criteria necessary for a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where  (i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, and (ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 1101(a)(48)(A). There is no dispute that she admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt. However, she claims that the order requiring her to pay restitution did not constitute a form of \"punishment, penalty, or restraint on [her] liberty.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although the IJ and the BIA implicitly rejected de Vega's argument on this point, neither provided an explanation. We conclude that the particular order in this case was plainly a punishment or penalty. De Vega was required to pay a large sum of money. If she failed to make her payments, her admission could ripen into a guilty plea and she would be subject to further punishment. <i>See Commonwealth v. Aboulmal,</i> No. 02-P-830, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22309058</span></span>, at *2 (Mass.App.Ct.) (\"An admission to sufficient facts may result . . . in a continuance without a finding to a specific date, conditioned on compliance with specific terms. In the event of a violation of those terms, the `admission' remains and may ripen into an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence.\"). Under Massachusetts law, therefore, a continuation, based on an admission of facts sufficient for a finding of guilt and conditioned on payment of restitution, is treated as the legal equivalent of a guilty plea and probationary sentence. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Commonwealth v. Villalobos,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></span>, 119-20 (2002)). Based on the facts of this case and Massachusetts law, we conclude that the restitution order was punitive, and we find no error in the agency's conclusion that, under the INA definition, de Vega was convicted.</p>\n<p>De Vega claims, alternatively, that her conviction was not for an \"aggravated felony,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). The IJ found that de Vega's false representation to the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare amounted to an aggravated felony, under IIRIRA, because it was \"an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\" <i>id.</i> § 1101(a)(43)(M).<sup>[2]</sup> There was no dispute that fraud was a necessary element of the offense; additionally, the IJ found that the victim lost more than $10,000 because the restitution ordered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> was over $27,000, thereby creating the inference that de Vega's misrepresentations caused losses of that amount. The IJ noted that the restitution was technically imposed in response to the larceny charge, which the IJ found not to be an aggravated felony, but held that the distinction was immaterial because the two charges were \"coterminous in terms of the dates of occurrence on the complaint form\" and the sentence imposed \"relate[d] clearly to both counts.\"</p>\n<p>De Vega argues that the false representation charge cannot amount to an aggravated felony because there is insufficient evidence that the victim of her false representations suffered losses in excess of $10,000. She says that the restitution order can only be \"attributed\" to the larceny charge, and thus there was no single conviction based on fraud that resulted in the requisite amount of loss.</p>\n<p>We have previously held that the government meets its burden when \"the record of conviction,\" which includes \"an official record of plea,\" <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2006), provides clear and convincing evidence that the alien's conviction \"<i>involved</i> a loss to victim(s) of more than $10,000,\" <i>id.</i> at 60 (emphasis added). The IJ in this case found that the false representation conviction \"involved\" losses of the requisite amount, and we owe substantial deference to that factual finding, <i>see </i><i>Hoxha,</i> 446 F.3d at 216.</p>\n<p>The IJ's finding was based on evidence in the record of conviction that a single course of conduct underlay both charges. In other words, de Vega engaged in a single scheme, resulting in two separate criminal charges, which caused the victim to lose over $27,000. The IJ noted, in reaching this decision, that one complaint charged both crimes and the two crimes appear to have occurred during the same dates. On the Tender of Plea agreement, the defendant submitted her recommendations for the terms of her plea. She included a bracket symbol around her two recommendations, suggesting that the terms of the plea could be read as a whole rather than piecemeal. Furthermore, she suggested restitution for the larceny charge, but also proposed, specifically as to the false representation charge, that the sentence be \"subject to continuation of restitution not paid\" and that \"restitution to be determined based upon Probation [Office]'s determination of her ability to pay.\" This notation, made on behalf of defendant by her counsel, strongly supports the IJ's inference that the two charges were factually interrelated and that the restitution order reflected the total loss to the victim.</p>\n<p>The Tender of Plea form also included the judge's final decision as to the appropriate sentence. While de Vega made discrete (though overlapping) recommendations for the two charges, the judge imposed a single sentence without any separation or distinction between the two charges. Nothing in the record suggests that the loss was the result only of the larceny and not of the false representations; rather, the record demonstrates that the losses suffered by Massachusetts were the result of one course of conduct that gave rise to two interrelated charges.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the evidence contained in the record clearly and convincingly supports the IJ's finding that de Vega was convicted of a crime, false representations, for which fraud was a necessary element, that involved losses to the victim of more than $10,000, amounting to an aggravated felony. Therefore, the denial of her petition for cancellation of removal was justified.</p>\n<p><i>Petition denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Under the revised statute, an alien is \"admitted\" to the United States if she enters lawfully after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p>[2]  De Vega was convicted under Mass.
