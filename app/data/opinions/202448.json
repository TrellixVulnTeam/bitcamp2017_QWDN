Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Rex Fornaro, on brief pro se.\n     Eugene Sullivan, III, on brief                for   defendant,   appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              October 6, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.     Rex Fornaro has appealed a district court\n\njudgment dismissing his complaint on the basis of a forum selection\n\nclause in a contract (hereinafter, the \"Purchase Agreement\").          \"We\n\nreview a district court's dismissal based on a forum-selection\n\nclause de novo.\"    Silva v. Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., 239 F.3d\n\n385, 387 (1st Cir. 2001).      Upon de novo review, we conclude that\n\nthe motion to dismiss was properly granted and we affirm.1\n\n          The forum selection clause stated, in relevant part:\n\n\n                 Both   parties   agree    that   New\n                 Hampshire law should, does, and will\n                 control the interpretation of this\n                 contract. The jurisdiction of any\n                 lawsuits related to or arising out\n                 of this contract will be in the\n                 courts of Carroll County, New\n                 Hampshire.\n\nOn appeal, Fornaro argues that the district court mistakenly\n\nconstrued this forum selection clause as providing for exclusive\n\njurisdiction in the state courts located in Carroll County, New\n\nHampshire.   However, unlike the example described in Stafford\n\nTech., Inc. v. Camcar Div. of Textron, Inc., 784 A.2d 1198, 1200-01\n\n(N.H. 2001), on which Fornaro relies, the clause at issue in the\n\nPurchase Agreement was not a simple permissive grant of authority\n\nto the courts of Carroll County.       Rather, the clause provided both\n\njurisdictional     authority   and   venue.    It   stated   that   \"[t]he\n\n\n     1\n      Our resolution of this appeal does not require us to resolve\nthe request of Benjamin C. Riggs, Jr. that a sole proprietorship be\nsubstituted as the appellee.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fjurisdiction of any lawsuits related to or arising out of this\n\ncontract will be in the courts of Carroll County, New Hampshire.\"\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                  In   contrast    to  jurisdictional\n                  authority,    forum  selection   is\n                  necessarily exclusive.    In other\n                  words, when parties agree that they\n                  \"will submit\" their dispute to a\n                  specified forum, they do so to the\n                  exclusion of all other forums.\n\nSummit Packaging Sys. Inc. v. Kenyon & Kenyon, 273 F.3d 9, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).   (This statement was made in a diversity case arising\n\nout of New Hampshire, reviewing an arbitration clause that required\n\nthe parties to choose one of the named fora.)\n\n          Fornaro raises an additional argument.        He argues that\n\nthe clause's reference to \"courts\" in the plural encompasses the\n\nfederal district court of New Hampshire because, says Fornaro, that\n\ncourt \"clearly has jurisdiction over matters in Carroll County, New\n\nHampshire.\"   This is, at best, a strained way to describe the\n\nfederal court and one that we do not accept as a reasonable\n\ninterpretation.     It is far more likely that the parties intended\n\nthe phrase \"courts of Carroll County, New Hampshire\" to mean the\n\ncourts that trace their origin to the state, i.e., the Carroll\n\nCounty, New Hampshire state courts, of which there are the Carroll\n\nCounty Superior Court and two District Courts (Northern Carroll\n\nCounty District Court and Southern Carroll County District Court).\n\nSee LFC Lessors, Inc. v. Pacific Sewer Maintenance Corp., 739 F.2d\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f4,    7       (1st    Cir.   1984)   (opining    that   the    phrase    \"courts    of\n\nMassachusetts\" was more likely to have been intended by the parties\n\nto mean the courts that trace their origin to the state, i.e., the\n\nMassachusetts state courts, rather than a reference to all the\n\ncourts physically within the state).\n\n                 Finally, Fornaro rests on this court's own statement.\n\n\"We emphasize, however, that even a mandatory forum-selection\n\nclause does not in fact divest a court of jurisdiction that it\n\notherwise retains.\"            Silva, 239 F.3d at 388 n.6.          But, the cases\n\ncited in the remainder of footnote 6 in Silva actually reinforce\n\nthe result in the instant case.                   The district court was not\n\ndivested of its subject matter jurisdiction (based on diversity) as\n\na    result      of    the   forum   selection    clause.      Rather,    the    forum\n\nselection clause \"merely constitutes a stipulation in which the\n\nparties join in asking the court to give effect to their agreement\n\nby declining to exercise its jurisdiction.\"                 LFC Lessors, 739 F.2d\n\nat 6. As we stated, \"'Exclusive jurisdiction' in this context thus\n\nrefers to the intent of the parties rather than the actual power of\n\nthe court.\"           Silva, 239 F.3d at 388 n.6.           And that, in fact, is\n\nwhat the district court did in the instant case.                         It did not\n\ndismiss         Fornaro's      complaint    for     lack      of   subject      matter\n\njurisdiction.2          It declined to exercise jurisdiction and dismissed\n\n\n          2\n      For this reason, Fornaro's repeated reliance on the\nmagistrate judge's Order of April 12, 2004 is misplaced.      That\nOrder, issued shortly after the case was filed, simply determined,\n\n                                           -4-\n\fon the basis of the forum selection clause, thus giving effect to\n\nthe parties' agreement to litigate their dispute related to or\n\narising out of the Purchase Agreement in the state courts of\n\nCarroll County, New Hampshire.\n\n          The district court judgment entered on October 15, 2004\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nbased solely on the complaint, that the requisites for diversity\njurisdiction had been alleged, thus establishing, on a preliminary\nreview, the appearance of subject matter jurisdiction.         The\ndistrict court's later dismissal based on the forum selection\nclause did not conflict with any determination that subject matter\njurisdiction based on diversity existed.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
