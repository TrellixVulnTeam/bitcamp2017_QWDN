Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Kevin MacMurray on brief for appellant Robert Giancola.\n     Lee Stephen MacPhee, Philip M. Hirshberg and Morrison\nMahoney on brief for appellee JohnsonDiversey.\n     Barry M. Ryan and Doherty Wallace Pillsbury and Murphy on\nbrief for appellee Chemstar Corporation.\n     Kevin M. Carroll and Eric A. Nissen on brief for third-party\nappellee Jose Ribeiro.\n\n\n                              December 1, 2005\n\f           Per curiam.       This is an appeal from the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of this product liability case as a sanction\n\nfor plaintiff's repeated failure to show up at his scheduled\n\ndepositions and to produce relevant documents requested by the\n\ndefense,   despite    warnings      and,   ultimately,      a    court     order\n\nrequiring him to do so.      Essentially for the reasons stated by\n\nthe district court in its thorough and well-reasoned 19-page\n\ndecision, we affirm both the dismissal and the subsequent denial\n\nof plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           We   previously   reserved      judgment    on       the    threshold\n\nquestion, flagged by the clerk's office in an order to show\n\ncause, of whether plaintiff's appeal from the judgment was\n\ntimely.    In the interests of judicial economy, we now by-pass\n\nthat potentially thorny issue to reach the relatively easy merits\n\nof this appeal.      See Rivera-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 207,\n\n209 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 2963 (2005).\n\n           This court's review of discovery sanctions, including\n\nthe choice of sanctions, is highly deferential.                       See, e.g.,\n\nSheppard v. River Valley Fitness One, L.P., 428 f.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     Where, as here, the district court's thorough and\n\nwell-reasoned     decision   demonstrates       that     it      applied     the\n\nappropriate factors and weighed them appropriately, no abuse of\n\ndiscretion can be found.      Id.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            On appeal, plaintiff does not contest the factual\n\nfindings made by the district court or its conclusion that\n\nsanctions were appropriate.      Rather, he focuses on the district\n\ncourt's    choice   of   dismissal     as     the    appropriate   sanction.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that dismissal was excessive because\n\nplaintiff's \"failure to comply [with his discovery obligations]\n\nwas   a   product   of   the   degenerating         relationship   with    his\n\nattorney[,]    [c]ompounded      by     the     District    Court's       order\n\nperpetuating this relationship despite the obvious breakdown.\"\n\nThat argument is unavailing for several reasons.\n\n            First, as a general matter, dismissal is an appropriate\n\nsanction for discovery violations where, as here, the district\n\ncourt had previously warned plaintiff that dismissal was a\n\npossible sanction, HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio\n\nCanas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 918 (1st Cir. 1988), and plaintiff's\n\nnoncompliance was not \"a single isolated mishap,\" id. (quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).           Second, plaintiff's attempt to\n\nblame his misconduct on his former attorney is inapt.              See Link\n\nv. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 634 n.10 (1962); Georcely v.\n\nAshcroft, 375 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2004).             And, third, because\n\nplaintiff did not appeal from the order requiring his counsel to\n\nremain for the duration of discovery, he cannot be heard to\n\ncomplain about that order.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            The denial of plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is\n\nalso affirmed for the same reasons.           In addition, to the extent\n\nthat the motion for reconsideration was premised largely on\n\nchallenges to the district court's factual findings, which are\n\nnot pressed in plaintiff's appellate brief, those challenges are\n\ndeemed abandoned.      United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 2924 (2005).\n\n            Accordingly, the district court's judgment of dismissal\n\nand   denial     of   plaintiff's    motion    for   reconsideration   are\n\naffirmed.
