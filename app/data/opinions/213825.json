Former members of the Central Falls\n\nHigh School boys soccer team appeal from an entry of summary\n\njudgment for the Town of Coventry, Rhode Island, and Coventry\n\npolice officers in this civil rights case. This dispute arises out\n\nof a police search of team members that followed a heated soccer\n\nmatch between Central Falls High School and Coventry High School in\n\nCoventry in 2006.        Police searched all individual Central Falls\n\nteam members for items purportedly missing from the Coventry locker\n\nroom in the presence of an abusive crowd of Coventry students and\n\nadults.      Though   the     Central   Falls    coach    told   the   police   he\n\nconsented to the search of his players, both he and the players\n\nassert that he was coerced into doing so by the police.\n\n           Lead plaintiff Juan Lopera and other former members of\n\nthe Central Falls team brought suit for damages and injunctive\n\nrelief in April 2008, alleging violations of their constitutional\n\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as\n\nviolations     of   Rhode    Island   state   law.       The   defendant     police\n\nofficers asserted a defense of qualified immunity.                 The district\n\ncourt held that the players failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether (1) the police officers were not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity with respect to their claims under\n\nthe Fourth Amendment and state privacy law, or (2) the police had\n\nengaged   in    racial      discrimination      in   violation   of    the    Equal\n\nProtection Clause or Rhode Island statutes prohibiting racial\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fprofiling and intimidation.   Lopera v. Town of Coventry, 652 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 203, 213-17 (D.R.I. 2009).   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          We review the facts in the light most favorable to Lopera\n\nand the other plaintiffs, the parties opposing summary judgment.\n\nOn September 28, 2006, the Central Falls High School soccer team\n\ntraveled to Coventry for a match against Coventry High School.\n\nBefore the game, four or five Central Falls players used the\n\nrestrooms in the Coventry locker room.    They were not alone.    A\n\nsecurity guard accompanied the boys into the locker room.        The\n\nlocker room is usually open and unlocked and could be easily\n\naccessed, including by unauthorized persons.\n\n          The locker room is apparently used by all Coventry teams\n\nand recently had been used by Coventry's football team.   After the\n\nsoccer match, a group of approximately twenty football players1\n\nconfronted the Central Falls coach, Robert Marchand, as he walked\n\nbehind his players toward the team bus.     In profane terms, the\n\nCoventry students accused the Central Falls players of stealing\n\niPods and cell phones from the Coventry locker room.\n\n          The Central Falls players allege that they encountered\n\nhostile racism during their match with the Coventry soccer team and\n\nduring the remainder of their time in Coventry.    Central Falls is\n\na racially diverse community, and the Central Falls team consisted\n\n\n     1\n          This crowd apparently did not include any soccer players.\n\n                               -3-\n\fentirely   of   Spanish-speaking   Hispanic   players,   save   for   one\n\nPortuguese player.    Coventry, by contrast, is predominantly non-\n\nHispanic and white, and its high school reflected this.               The\n\nCentral Falls players allege that Coventry players uttered racial\n\nepithets during the game, calling them \"spics\" and demanding that\n\nthey speak English.   They allege that Coventry students and adults\n\nmade similar remarks during the series of events that followed the\n\ngame.\n\n           After the Coventry football players confronted Coach\n\nMarchand with the purported thefts, he told them that he would\n\nhandle the situation. The football players followed him toward the\n\nCentral Falls bus.      Before the group reached the bus, Coach\n\nMarchand told the players to wait. Coach Marchand then boarded the\n\nbus, where his team was waiting.         Coach Marchand informed the\n\nplayers of the accusations and told them that he knew they had not\n\ntaken the items.    Nonetheless, he and an assistant coach searched\n\nthe players' bags.     If an iPod or cell phone was found, Coach\n\nMarchand asked for proof that it belonged to the player.              The\n\nsearch lasted approximately twenty to twenty-five minutes.        Coach\n\nMarchand testified that when it was completed, he was \"completely\n\nsatisfied\" that his players did not possess the items.\n\n           After he completed the search, Coach Marchand left the\n\nbus to speak with the Coventry Athletic Director, who was waiting\n\noutside.   By this time, Coach Marchand testified, a crowd of fifty\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\for sixty Coventry students and adults had gathered around the bus.\n\nAccording to Coach Marchand, members of the crowd yelled that they\n\nknew his players had the items.            He testified that students and\n\nadults in the crowd stated that the players were \"from the ghetto,\"\n\nknew how to \"hide things\" and \"lie good,\" and could not be trusted.\n\nThe players recounted similar accusations and vitriol, including\n\nracial slurs like \"spic.\"        At one point, a member of the crowd\n\napparently tried to board the bus to conduct his own search.         Coach\n\nMarchand testified that members of the crowd demanded a search of\n\nhis own bags.     He also testified that members of the crowd stated\n\nthat they would not let the Central Falls players leave until the\n\nitems had been found.\n\n              Coach Marchand told the Coventry Athletic Director that\n\nhe had checked \"everything\" on the bus, and that his players did\n\nnot have the purportedly missing items.          Coach Marchand also told\n\nthe Athletic Director that he was welcome to do his own search,\n\nwhich   the    Athletic   Director   declined    as   unnecessary.   Coach\n\nMarchand testified that as he and the Athletic Director puzzled\n\nover how to \"satisfy all [the] constituencies here,\" he began to\n\nworry that violence might ensue.\n\n              At this point, three or four Coventry police cruisers\n\narrived on the scene with their lights and sirens activated.          The\n\npolice had received calls reporting a supposed ongoing physical\n\naltercation.      The officers boxed in the Central Falls bus with\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftheir cruisers so that it could not move.                    According to the\n\nplayers, by this time the crowd had also formed a semi-circle\n\naround the bus, blocking its path out of the parking lot.\n\n              Once it became clear that no physical altercation was\n\ntaking      place,   the   police    discussed   the   situation   with   Coach\n\nMarchand and the Coventry Athletic Director.                   Coach Marchand\n\nexplained to the officers that the Coventry students had alleged\n\nthefts and that his players \"were prime suspects.\"                 He told the\n\nofficers that he had searched each student's bags on the bus and\n\ndid   not    find    the   purportedly    missing   items.     Coach   Marchand\n\nexpressed fear of the crowd, asking the police, \"what am I going to\n\ndo, what are they going to do to us[?]\"                After a pause, Coach\n\nMarchand testified, the police responded by asking him if they\n\ncould search the players.           Coach Marchand verbally agreed.\n\n              Coach Marchand did not testify that the officers said or\n\ndid anything coercive.        Coach Marchand testified that the officers\n\nacted courteously and told unruly members of the crowd to be quiet.\n\nAccording to Coach Marchand, the police \"decided their best thing\n\nwas to [do the] search themselves to appease the masses\" who were\n\n\"crying for our heads.\" In his testimony, he described his consent\n\nas the way to \"take the high road, take the safe road,\" even though\n\nhe knew his players did not have the items.                  We must take this\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftestimony as true on this motion for summary judgment.2   The police\n\ntestified that the crowd was angry and unruly, consistent with the\n\nplayers' testimony. They also testified that they did not hear any\n\nracial epithets from members of the crowd, which is not the\n\nplaintiffs' testimony.\n\n          After agreeing to the search, Coach Marchand returned to\n\nthe bus and told his players that the crowd would not let them go\n\nuntil the police searched them.     The police then told the players\n\nto get off the bus with all of their belongings and line up with\n\ntheir bags between their legs.      The players complied, lining up\n\nwith their backs against the bus.    An officer then told the players\n\nthat if any of them had the missing items, they would be arrested\n\nif they did not immediately step forward.    When none of the players\n\nstepped forward, the officers began a search.         Coach Marchand\n\ntestified that the officers placed each player's bag on the hood of\n\na cruiser and looked through it.    A few players testified that some\n\nplayers were also subjected to pat down searches.         During the\n\nsearch, the crowd was about six to ten feet away from the players.\n\n          The search lasted for about 45 minutes to an hour.     The\n\npolice officers testified that they did not obtain descriptions of\n\nthe type of iPods or cell phones alleged to be missing, other than\n\n\n\n     2\n          One officer testified that Coach Marchand suggested the\nsearch and that they conducted the search because it would\n\"expedite the process and eliminate them all as suspects.\" These\nare disputed facts and for these purposes we do not accept them.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthat one phone may have been a \"flip phone.\"        When the police\n\nlocated an iPod or a cell phone on a player, they required that the\n\nplayer prove that the item belonged to him.      In some cases, the\n\nplayers identified items stored on the devices and allowed the\n\nofficers to search the devices.        In other cases, the officers\n\ndisplayed the devices to members of the crowd and asked if they\n\nwere the missing devices. During the course of the search, members\n\nof the crowd alleged that additional items were missing, like books\n\nand money.\n\n          The players testified that the crowd continued to harass\n\nthem during the search.    One player testified that, during the\n\nsearch, members of the crowd called the players \"spics.\"    Another\n\ntestified that members of the crowd stated that the Central Falls\n\nteam should not be in Coventry or playing Coventry High School\n\ngiven the race of its players.   Members of the crowd photographed\n\nthe Central Falls students during the search with their cell phone\n\ncameras. Marchand testified that although the officers reprimanded\n\nunruly members of the crowd during the search, they did not take\n\nadequate actions to disperse the crowd or move it away from the\n\nbus.\n\n          There was testimony that during the search, one Coventry\n\nofficer told one of the players that he thought the search was\n\n\"stupid\" because the coach had already searched the players and\n\nbecause a security guard had accompanied the players in the locker\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\froom.       Another officer, hearing the comment, laughed.   The police\n\nrequired all the players to wait outside the bus until every player\n\nhad been searched.       The search did not produce any of the missing\n\nitems.       After it was completed, the police escorted the bus out of\n\ntown in their cruisers.\n\n               Lopera and other members of the Central Falls team filed\n\nsuit in April 2008 against the Town of Coventry and several\n\nindividual Coventry police officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (§ 1983)\n\nand Rhode Island state law.         Under § 1983, the players alleged\n\ndeprivations of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures, as well as their Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights to due process of law and equal protection of the\n\nlaw.3       Under Rhode Island state law, the players alleged violation\n\nof statutes that forbid invasion of privacy, racial profiling, and\n\nethnic intimidation. R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1; id. § 31-21.2; id.\n\n§ 9-1-35.\n\n               The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants on all counts.        First, it held that the officers were\n\nentitled to qualified immunity with respect to the Fourth Amendment\n\nand state privacy claims because (1) it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe officers to believe that Coach Marchand had power to consent to\n\nthe search, and (2) coercion did not vitiate Coach Marchand's\n\n\n        3\n          The players have conceded that their Due Process claim\nwas not intended to allege a violation of their substantive due\nprocess rights and thus overlaps with their Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fconsent.     Second, it held that the players did not introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to support a finding that the police engaged in\n\nracial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nor Rhode Island's statutes prohibiting racial profiling and ethnic\n\nintimidation.   The district court also held on independent grounds\n\nthat the players had not introduced material facts to support their\n\nclaims of supervisory and municipal liability.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           On appeal, the players make two arguments.           First, they\n\nargue that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity for\n\nthe claims under the Fourth Amendment and state privacy law because\n\n(1) a reasonable officer would have believed that Coach Marchand\n\ndid not have authority to consent for his players, and (2) a\n\nreasonable   officer   would   have   believed   that   Coach   Marchand's\n\nconsent was coerced.      Second, they argue that they set forth\n\nmaterial facts to support the reasonable inference that the actions\n\nof the officers were impermissibly motivated by race in violation\n\nof the Equal Protection Clause and Rhode Island state law.             The\n\nplayers do not challenge the district court's rulings on municipal\n\nand supervisory liability.\n\n           In their answer to the players' complaint, the defendant\n\nofficers asserted qualified immunity against all claims.                 In\n\nasserting this defense before the district court and before this\n\ncourt, the officers focused their argument on whether it was\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fclearly established that Coach Marchand could consent on behalf of\n\nhis students in loco parentis.     The district court analyzed this\n\nquestion in a qualified immunity framework, but it appeared to\n\naddress the players' remaining claims outside of that framework.\n\nGiven that the officers have raised a qualified immunity defense to\n\nall of the players' claims, we address each of the players' claims\n\nin the qualified immunity framework.\n\n          This court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo.\n\nSaccucci Auto Group, Inc. v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 617 F.3d 14, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).   We must make all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof the non-moving party and may reverse only if \"the evidence on\n\nrecord 'is sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder\n\nto resolve the issue in favor of either side.'\"     Maymi v. Puerto\n\nRico Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Nat'l\n\nAmusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)).   This standard of review applies to grants of summary\n\njudgment on grounds of qualified immunity.   See Kelley v. LaForce,\n\n288 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).   When a defendant moves for summary\n\njudgment on the basis of qualified immunity, the plaintiff bears\n\nthe burden of showing infringement of a federal right. Quintero de\n\nQuintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nA.        The Doctrine of Qualified Immunity\n\n          Qualified immunity \"protects government officials 'from\n\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.'\" Pearson v. Callahan,\n\n129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n\n800, 818 (1982)).       This circuit follows a two-step analysis under\n\nPearson in discerning whether defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.    We ask \"(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the\n\nplaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2)\n\nif so, whether the right was 'clearly established' at the time of\n\nthe defendant's alleged violation.\"          Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568\n\nF.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            The Supreme Court has held that it is not mandatory for\n\ncourts to follow this two-step test sequentially.         Pearson, 129 S.\n\nCt. at 818-21; see also Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269-270.            A finding\n\nthat a right was not clearly established at the time of the alleged\n\nviolation is sufficient to warrant a finding of qualified immunity.\n\nSee Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 822.         In some cases \"discussion of the\n\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis will result 'in a\n\nsubstantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult\n\nquestions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.'\"\n\nMaldonado, 568 F.3d at 270 (quoting Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818).\n\n            In   this   case,   these   considerations   counsel    that   we\n\nconsider the second prong of the analysis and go no further.           That\n\nprong, we have held, has two aspects: that both (1) the legal\n\ncontours of the right in question and (2) the particular factual\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fviolation   in   question   would   have   been    clear     to   a    reasonable\n\nofficial.    Id. at 269.    Together, these two factors ask whether a\n\nreasonable officer, similarly situated, would have believed that\n\nhis conduct did not violate the Constitution.          Harlow, 457 U.S. at\n\n818-19; Philip v. Cronin, 537 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The qualified immunity defense \"is designed to protect\n\n'all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\n\nlaw.'\"     Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 429 (2007) (quoting\n\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341               (1986)).        A finding of\n\nqualified immunity is warranted if \"a reasonable officer could have\n\nbelieved his conduct was lawful.\"          Olmeda v. Ortíz-Quiñonez, 434\n\nF.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 2006).        Such a finding is not warranted if\n\n\"no reasonable officer could believe\" that his conduct was lawful.\n\nGroh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 564 (2004).                 Put another way,\n\nimmunity will issue when \"officers of reasonable competence could\n\ndisagree\" on the lawfulness of an action, but it will not issue if\n\n\"it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have\n\nconcluded\" that the action was lawful.         Malley, 475 U.S. at 342.\n\n            This is an objective test; it does not look to the\n\ndefendants' subjective beliefs concerning the unlawfulness of their\n\nconduct.    Philip, 537 F.3d at 34.        A \"determination of objective\n\nreasonableness,\" however, \"'will often require examination of the\n\ninformation possessed' by the defendant officials.\"                   Kelley, 288\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fF.3d at 7 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641\n\n(1987)).\n\n            This objective test does not establish that \"an official\n\naction is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in\n\nquestion has previously been held unlawful.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at\n\n640.   The Supreme Court has made clear that \"officials can still be\n\non notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel\n\nfactual circumstances.\"          Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002)\n\n(citing     United    States      v.    Lanier,    520    U.S.       259    (1997)).\n\nNonetheless, unlawfulness must be apparent in light of pre-existing\n\nlaw at the time of the alleged violation.                Anderson, 483 U.S. at\n\n640.    The content of clearly settled law and the belief of a\n\nreasonable       officer   under       the     circumstances     are       questions\n\nappropriately addressed by courts before trial, where possible.\n\nSee Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227-28 (1991); Cox v. Hainey,\n\n391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We    divide   our    discussion      in   this   case    between   the\n\nplayers' claims under the Fourth Amendment and state privacy law\n\nand their claims under the Equal Protection Clause and state laws\n\nforbidding racial profiling and ethnic harassment.\n\nB.          Fourth Amendment and State Privacy Claims\n\n            In their claims under the Fourth Amendment and the state\n\nprivacy statute, the players give two grounds to defeat qualified\n\nimmunity.        First, they argue that all officers of reasonable\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fcompetence would have believed that Coach Marchand did not have\n\nauthority to consent on behalf of the players.              Second, they argue\n\nthat all officers of reasonable competence would have believed that\n\ncoercion vitiated Coach Marchand's purported consent to the search\n\nin this case.\n\n           The district court focused primarily on the players'\n\nfirst argument.       It held that the players failed to introduce a\n\nmaterial   fact    showing    it    was    clearly   established    that   Coach\n\nMarchand could not consent on their behalf under the circumstances.\n\nLopera 652 F. Supp. 2d at 213-16.                In so finding, the district\n\ncourt relied on the apparent uncertainty of prevailing Supreme\n\nCourt doctrine governing in loco parentis searches in schools. Id.\n\nAs to the players' second argument, the district court held that\n\nCoach Marchand's consent was voluntary because he \"understood the\n\nsituation,\"     id.   at   216,    and    gave   consent   \"after   careful   and\n\ndeliberate thought,\"         id. at 217.         The district court did not\n\naddress whether this would have been clear to the officers under\n\nthe circumstances, nor whether it was clearly established that\n\ncoercion vitiates consent.\n\n           1.     Coach Marchand's Authority to Consent\n\n           We may quickly dispose of the players' first argument,\n\nwhich does not require analysis of the intricacies of the in loco\n\nparentis doctrine.         Under the facts alleged by the players, a\n\nreasonable officer could have concluded that Coach Marchand had\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fauthority to consent to a search of his students.      The search did\n\nnot take place at Central Falls High School, but rather on a trip\n\naway from school over which Coach Marchand was undisputedly in\n\ncharge.   When the officers arrived, Coach Marchand told them that\n\nhe had already conducted his own search of his students.    To arrive\n\nat the conclusion that Coach Marchand could not consent, an officer\n\nwould have had to question Coach Marchand's authority to perform\n\nthe first search and, by extension, Coach Marchand's authority to\n\nconsent to a second search by the police.\n\n          We cannot say that no officer of reasonable competence\n\ncould have reached the conclusion that Coach Marchand had authority\n\nto consent. As the players argue, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nlimits on the in loco parentis authority of school officials.     New\n\nJersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 336-37 (1985).    To defeat a finding\n\nof qualified immunity, however, the players must identify authority\n\nsufficiently particularized that the unlawfulness of an act would\n\nhave been apparent to all officers of reasonable competence.\n\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999).       Subsequent decisions\n\nmake clear that T.L.O. has not eliminated a school official's in\n\nloco parentis power to consent on behalf of his students.         See\n\nVernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 654-56 (1995).    The\n\nplayers do not identify a sufficiently particularized decision of\n\nthis court or the Supreme Court that places Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent clearly beyond his authority under the facts they allege.\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f               2.   The Validity of Coach Marchand's Consent\n\n               The players' second argument concerning the validity of\n\nMarchand's consent requires more discussion.                There is no dispute\n\nthat all officers of reasonable competence would have known that\n\ncoercion vitiates consent to a search under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee United States v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nUnder    the    Fourth   Amendment,      consent   may     \"not   be   coerced,    by\n\nexplicit or implicit means, by implied threat or covert force.\"\n\nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 228 (1973).                     As to the\n\nother considerations relevant to the validity of Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent, we reiterate that we may only deny qualified immunity if\n\n\"it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have\n\nconcluded\" that the action was lawful.               Malley, 475 U.S. at 342.\n\nIf \"officers of reasonable competence could disagree\" on the\n\nlawfulness of an action, we must grant qualified immunity.                   Id.\n\n               We first dispose of a legal question about the scope of\n\nthe facts to be considered.            The officers argue that the law under\n\nSchneckloth was not clearly established; they contend that it was\n\nthe crowd, not the officers, who created any coercive atmosphere\n\nand that the coercion must \"emanat[e] from the police officers\n\nthemselves      rather   than    any    subjective    or    outside    influence.\"\n\nCiting the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly, 479\n\nU.S.    157    (1986),   the    officers   argue     that   the   examination      of\n\ncoercion must focus solely on the acts of the officials requesting\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fto perform the search.    We reject this argument for two different\n\nreasons, but nonetheless find for other reasons that defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n            First, Connelly is not clearly established law limiting\n\nSchneckloth.   Second, taking the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiffs, the crowd was not the only source of potential\n\ncoercion.   It is clearly established law under Schneckloth that in\n\nconsidering    the   validity   of   consent,   all   the   surrounding\n\ncircumstances must be considered.       Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 227;\n\nVanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264.      Neither the Supreme Court nor this\n\ncourt has extended the rule in Connelly, a decision under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to Fourth Amendment\n\nconsent cases.\n\n            In Connelly, the defendant claimed that because he heard\n\na \"voice of God\" telling him to confess, his confession in police\n\ncustody was coerced and thus invalid.      Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170-\n\n171.   The Supreme Court held a defendant's mental condition \"by\n\nitself and apart from its relation to official coercion\" cannot\n\n\"dispose of the inquiry into constitutional 'voluntariness'\" under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.        Id. at 164.   It\n\nconcluded that \"coercive police activity is a necessary predicate\n\nto the finding that a confession is not 'voluntary'\" within the\n\nmeaning of that clause.     Id. at 167.    The Court did not address\n\nFourth Amendment searches.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f              We are unaware of any published circuit court decision\n\nthat applies this standard for voluntariness of a confession to\n\nquestions of consent under the Fourth Amendment.                       But see United\n\nStates v. Quezada, No. 91-5004, 1991 WL 191402 (4th Cir. Oct. 24,\n\n1991)   (applying        Connelly     to   a   Fourth      Amendment    search     in    an\n\nunpublished decision).               At least two circuits have expressly\n\ndeclined to do so.         United States v. Montgomery, 621 F.3d 568, 571-\n\n72 (6th Cir. 2010); Tukes v. Dugger, 911 F.2d 508, 516 & n.13 (11th\n\nCir. 1990).        This circuit has continued to apply the requirements\n\nin Schneckloth for consent to a Fourth Amendment search.                                See\n\nVanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264.            Moreover, we are unaware of any lower\n\ncourt decision in this circuit that extends Connelly to Fourth\n\nAmendment searches.          See Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 823.\n\n              Having rejected the defendants' efforts to narrow the\n\nfocus of inquiry, we turn to the articulation of the clearly\n\nestablished law.           In Schneckloth, the Supreme Court held that\n\ncoercion must be discerned by examining \"all the surrounding\n\ncircumstances,\" including \"subtly coercive police questions\" and\n\n\"the    possibly        vulnerable    subjective         state   of   the   person      who\n\nconsents.\"        Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229.                In Ohio v. Robinette,\n\n519 U.S. 33 (1996), the Court repeated that \"[t]he Fourth Amendment\n\ntest    for   a    valid    consent    to      search     is   that   the   consent      be\n\nvoluntary,        and   '[v]oluntariness        is   a    question    of    fact   to    be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fdetermined from all the circumstances.'\"    Id. at 40 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248-49).\n\n            We have held that voluntariness of consent depends on\n\nconsiderations including, but not limited to, \"(i) the consenter's\n\nage, education, past experiences, and intelligence; (ii) whether\n\nlaw   enforcement    officials   advised   the   consenter   of   his\n\nconstitutional right to refuse consent; (iii) the length and\n\nconditions of the consenter's detention and/or questioning; and\n\n(iv) law enforcement officials' use of any inherently coercive\n\ntactics.\"   Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264 n.2 (citing Schneckloth, 412\n\nU.S. at 226).\n\n            A consent is coerced when an individual's \"will ha[s]\n\nbeen overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically\n\nimpaired\" such that he does not face an \"essentially free and\n\nunconstrained choice.\"   United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 424\n\n(1976) (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 225) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     It is seldom the case that \"a single coercive\n\nelement will, standing alone, be enough to invalidate a consent.\"\n\nW. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 8.2(b), at 62 (4th ed. 2004).      An\n\nofficer's failure to inform an individual of her right to refuse\n\nconsent to a search does not necessarily render her consent to such\n\na search coerced.     See Robinette, 519 U.S. at 39-40.      Nor is a\n\nconsent to a search given in police custody necessarily coerced.\n\nWatson, 423 U.S. at 424.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f           Two Supreme Court cases are particularly instructive\n\nhere, but are not cited to us by either side.           The first is United\n\nStates v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194 (2002).            In Drayton, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that among the relevant factors for assessing coercion\n\nis whether the officer requesting the search \"indicated a command\n\nto consent to the search.\"         Id. at 206.     The defendant's consent,\n\nthe Court held, was not a product of coercion because the officer\n\nhad provided him with \"no indication that he was required to\n\nconsent to the search.\"       Id.    The officers had asked whether the\n\ndefendant objected to the search, \"thus indicating to a reasonable\n\nperson that he or she was free to refuse.\"            Id.   The Court noted\n\nthat there had been \"no application of force, no intimidating\n\nmovement, no overwhelming show of force, no brandishing of weapons,\n\nno   blocking   of   exits,   no    threat,   no    command,   not   even   an\n\nauthoritative tone of voice.\"4        Id. at 204.\n\n           The second is Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991).\n\nIn Bostick, the Court addressed whether an officer's request to\n\nsearch a passenger's bags on a commercial bus constituted an\n\nunlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 431. Although\n\n\n\n      4\n          Although this language derives from Drayton's analysis of\nwhether a seizure had occurred in that case, the Court noted that\n\"[i]n circumstances such as these, where the question of\nvoluntariness pervades both the search and seizure inquiries, the\nrespective analyses turn on very similar facts.\" United States v.\nDrayton, 536 U.S. 194, 206 (2002). The Court's analysis of whether\nthe defendant's consent was coerced invoked the factual discussion\nin its analysis of whether the defendant had been seized. Id.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fon its face Bostick is about whether the defendant was seized, it\n\nis relevant.    The Supreme Court's assessment of whether the police\n\nin Bostick seized the defendant turned on whether they had coerced\n\nhim to consent to a search.         Id. at 435-38.       It held that the\n\nappropriate    inquiry    was   whether,   under   the   circumstances,   \"a\n\nreasonable person would feel free to decline the officers' requests\n\nor otherwise terminate the encounter.\"        Id. at 436.    The Court held\n\nthat \"[w]here the encounter takes place is one factor, but it is\n\nnot the only one.\"       Id.\n\n           Against this articulation of the clearly established law,\n\nwe now turn to the facts of this case, taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the players.         The defendants have largely\n\naccepted the plaintiffs' version of the facts for purposes of this\n\nsummary judgment motion, but say that they would present their\n\ndifferent version of the facts at trial.\n\n           The players point to three factual circumstances in\n\narguing that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent was valid.           First, they note that\n\nCoach Marchand explicitly invoked his fear of the crowd, asking the\n\nofficers, \"what are they going to do to us[?]\" shortly before the\n\nofficers requested that Coach Marchand consent to a search of the\n\nplayers.      Second, the players note that the officers did not\n\nactively seek to disperse the crowd, but only told the crowd to\n\nquiet down.      Third, they note that the officers boxed in the\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fCentral Falls bus, which effectively ensured that it could not\n\nleave until the police decided it could leave.\n\n             Although     Coach    Marchand     may   have    subjectively       felt\n\ncoerced by the police and/or the crowd to give his consent, that is\n\nnot the focus of the qualified immunity inquiry. Rather, the focus\n\nis on the viewpoint of an objectively reasonable officer.                            We\n\ncannot   say    that    no     reasonably    competent    officer        would      have\n\nconcluded that Coach Marchand's consent was valid under clearly\n\nestablished Supreme Court case law. The players do not even allege\n\nthat the officers commanded Coach Marchand to consent to a search,\n\nand the facts do not suggest that they did.                   Nor do the players\n\nallege   that     the     officers   threatened       force    or   acted      in    an\n\nintimidating manner during their exchange with Coach Marchand and\n\nthe Coventry Athletic Director.             Indeed, Coach Marchand testified\n\nthat   the     officers      requested    the   search    politely       and     acted\n\ncourteously and professionally throughout their exchanges with him.\n\nThe players do not even allege that the officers spoke to Coach\n\nMarchand with \"an authoritative tone of voice\" when they requested\n\nto do a search.        See Drayton, 536 U.S. at 204.\n\n             Rather,     the    players'     evidence    depicts     a    difficult\n\nsituation in which Coach Marchand faced a genuine choice between\n\nimperfect solutions.           He could either consent to the search or\n\nrequire the police to pursue other legal paths if they wished to\n\nconduct one.      As Coach Marchand said, it was his decision and he\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fdecided \"to take the high road, to take the safe road.\"             Coach\n\nMarchand may have felt that the best way for him to get his players\n\nhome safely and promptly was to submit to a search.        He knew of the\n\nhostile crowd and was convinced that the players did not possess\n\nany of the purportedly missing items.          By the time the police\n\narrived, the Central Falls bus was already late going home, and\n\nCoach   Marchand   could   have   reasonably    believed    that   school\n\nadministrators and the players' parents were or would soon become\n\nworried about their whereabouts.\n\n          These circumstances do not establish that all reasonably\n\ncompetent officers would have concluded that Coach Marchand's will\n\nhad been overborne or that his capacity for self-determination was\n\ncritically impaired.   See Watson, 423 U.S. at 424.        Indeed, Coach\n\nMarchand testified that he \"debated\" telling the officers to get a\n\nsearch warrant, but rejected that option.       Instead, he concluded\n\nthat his role as coach was to ensure first and foremost that the\n\nplayers got home safely. A choice between undesirable options does\n\nnot itself mean the choice was coerced and the consent given was\n\ninvoluntary.   Like the officers in Drayton, the officers posed\n\ntheir search request as a question and did not make any showing\n\nthat it could not be refused.       We cannot say that a reasonably\n\ncompetent officer could only have concluded that Coach Marchand had\n\nno option but to consent due to coercion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f          The factual details the players emphasize, addressed\n\nwithin the totality of the circumstances, do not demand a contrary\n\nconclusion.   Coach Marchand's question, \"what are they going to do\n\nto us[?],\" would have alerted reasonable officers of his concerns\n\nabout the situation. It may also be that reasonable officers would\n\nhave recognized that the perceived threat from the crowd influenced\n\nCoach Marchand's decision.   This does not mean, however, that all\n\nofficers of reasonable competence would have concluded that Coach\n\nMarchand's will had been overborne.     As Coach Marchand testified,\n\nhe considered refusing the search and telling the officers to get\n\na warrant.\n\n          As to the officers' efforts to subdue the crowd, by the\n\ntime the officers spoke with Coach Marchand, they had restrained\n\nthe crowd, told crowd members to cut it out, and established a\n\nbuffer between the crowd and the bus.    It may be that the officers\n\nwould have done better to disperse the crowd altogether. This does\n\nnot mean, however, that the officers are not entitled to immunity.\n\nThe officers could have reasonably thought that they made clear\n\nthat they would prevent the crowd from harming the players as of\n\nthe time they asked Coach Marchand to consent to the search.\n\n          As to the police cruisers, the officers parked in a way\n\nthat boxed in the bus before they became aware of the specific\n\nsituation unfolding around it.    The record is silent on whether\n\nalternatives were available.   More importantly, the officers did\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fnot convey to Coach Marchand that they would not move their\n\ncruisers until he agreed to a search.          Nor were they asked to move\n\nthe cruisers.\n\n            It is true that in a case concerning an involuntary\n\nseizure of a person, the Supreme Court used language that the\n\npolice offered the person \"no choice.\"           Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U.S.\n\n626, 631 (2003).      But the circumstances there were a far cry from\n\nthe choice Coach Marchand faced.              In Kaupp an adolescent was\n\nrousted out of bed in the middle of the night wearing nothing but\n\nunderwear, placed in handcuffs, and taken to a crime scene on his\n\nway   to   be   interviewed    at   law   enforcement    headquarters.   His\n\nstatement of \"Okay\" in response to \"we need to go and talk\" was\n\nclearly not consent.          See id. at 631-32.        Nothing of that sort\n\nhappened here, nor would a reasonable officer have thought it did.\n\n            On the plaintiffs' version of the facts, we cannot say\n\nthat all officers of reasonable competence would have concluded\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent to the search was invalid.           It is not\n\nenough that Coach Marchand described his consent to the search as\n\ncoerced; coercion has a specific legal meaning.               Even if Coach\n\nMarchand felt his consent was coerced within that specific legal\n\nmeaning, this would not be sufficient to overcome the officers'\n\nassertion of qualified immunity.             While a jury might find that\n\nCoach Marchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced, that\n\nis not the issue here; we must look to the view of the reasonable\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fofficer.   See Barton v. Clancy, 632 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\nLike Coach Marchand, the police officers faced a tough decision in\n\na difficult situation.     Whether the officers made the correct\n\ndecision is not the point.\n\nC.         Equal Protection and State Racial Discrimination Claims\n\n           The players argue that they have raised material facts\n\nshowing that the officers' actions were impermissibly motivated by\n\nrace in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Rhode Island\n\nstate laws.   There are disputes over whether the legal contours of\n\nthe rights in question would have been clear to a reasonable\n\nofficer and over whether a reasonable officer would have perceived\n\na violation of recognized rights under the factual circumstances\n\npresent in this case.    We begin with the rights in question and\n\nthen assess the factual circumstances.\n\n           Our analysis under the Equal Protection Clause looks to\n\n\"(1) whether the appellant was treated differently than others\n\nsimilarly situated, and (2) whether such difference was based on an\n\nimpermissible consideration, such as race.\"     Macone v. Town of\n\nWakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).   A plaintiff must show\n\nthat the defendant \"selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\n\naction at least in part because of, not merely in spite of, its\n\nadverse effects\" upon a protected group. In re Subpoena to Witzel,\n\n531 F.3d 113, 119 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Wayte v. United States,\n\n470 U.S. 598, 610 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fintent may be \"inferred from the totality of the relevant facts.\"\n\nDonahue v. City of Boston, 371 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)).\n\n           The players assert that this analysis forbids official\n\nactions that \"effectuate the known discriminatory intention of\n\nothers.\"     Citing United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837 F.2d\n\n1181 (2d Cir. 1987), they argue that a police search that works to\n\neffectuate      such    discriminatory        intentions   voiced   by   a   crowd\n\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause.              See id. at 1226.        We read\n\nthat decision more narrowly; in any event, it is insufficient to\n\nmake plaintiffs' proposition into clearly established law.                     The\n\nplayers do not cite any cases from this court or the Supreme Court\n\nfinding a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the absence\n\nof purposeful discrimination on the part of the relevant officials.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the players have not shown that it is\n\nclearly    established       that      acts     that   effectuate    the     known\n\ndiscriminatory intent of others, without more, violate the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.         See Davis, 426 U.S. at 241-42; McGuire v.\n\nReilly, 386 F.3d 45, 63 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Under our clearly established equal protection analysis,\n\nthe   players    have    failed   to    demonstrate    that   all   officers    of\n\nreasonable competence would have believed that the request for a\n\nsearch of the players produced differential treatment.               Given that\n\nthe public had access to the unlocked Coventry locker room, the\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fplayers argue that the officers had no more reason to search them\n\nthan they had to search the crowd.           Indeed, they argue that the\n\nofficers had even less reason to search the players because the\n\nofficers knew Coach Marchand had already searched them and a\n\nsecurity guard had accompanied them into the locker room.               These\n\nclaims belie the undisputed fact that Coach Marchand identified the\n\nplayers as the \"prime suspects\" in his discussion with the police.\n\nEven if Coach Marchand merely intended to convey the crowd's\n\nopinion, members of the crowd had not been accused of theft.\n\n            Even if we assume that the officers had no more reason to\n\nsearch the players than the crowd, the players fail to produce\n\nsufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to defeat qualified\n\nimmunity.    This court has noted that discriminatory animus seldom\n\n\"wears its garb openly\" and more often comes \"masked\" in \"subtle\n\nforms.\"    Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1067 n.12 (quoting Aman v.\n\nCort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, 1082 (3d Cir. 1996)).\n\nNonetheless, to survive summary judgment, the non-moving party must\n\nmake more than \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, or\n\nunsupported speculation.\"      Pineda v. Toomey, 533 F.3d 50, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).     A non-moving party must \"set forth specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"              Id. at 53-54\n\n(quoting    Anderson   v.   Liberty    Lobby,   Inc.,   477   U.S.   242,   256\n\n(1986)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\f            The players do not present such specific facts on the\n\nissue of racial animus in this case.        They point to the alleged\n\nracial slurs made by the crowd and claim that the officers should\n\nhave ordered the crowd to disperse or move farther away from the\n\nbus.    They also claim that the officers sought to incite the crowd\n\nby displaying some of the players' iPods and cell phones.            But\n\ntestimony from both Coach Marchand and the players contradicts the\n\ninference that racial animus motivated the officers.          No officer\n\nuttered a racial slur.       It is uncontested that the officers acted\n\ncourteously and told members of the crowd to stop jeering at the\n\nplayers.    There is no evidence that all officers of reasonable\n\ncompetence would have believed the search was undertaken because of\n\nthe national origin or race of the players.\n\n            Given this conclusion, the players also cannot defeat the\n\nofficers' qualified immunity defenses against their claims under\n\nRhode    Island's   Racial    Profiling   Prevention   Act   and   Ethnic\n\nIntimidation Statute.    The Racial Profiling Prevention Act covers\n\n\"disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in\n\npart, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual,\" with an\n\nexception not relevant here.        R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-21.2-3.      The\n\nEthnic Intimidation Statute covers behavior \"which would reasonably\n\nbe construed as intended to harass or intimidate [a] person because\n\nof his or her race.\"    R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-35(a).     For the reasons\n\n\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fstated above, the players have not raised a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact that satisfies either of these standards.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          The   record   does   demonstrate,   regrettably,   that   the\n\nplayers were subject to ethnic animosity from Coventry inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the plaintiffs do not raise sufficiently material facts to\n\nsurvive summary judgment, the Town and its voters may wish to take\n\nsteps to prevent recurrences of such behavior.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n                -Opinion Dissenting in Part Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\f             THOMPSON, Circuit Judge, (Dissenting in part).          I agree\n\nwith my colleagues that a reasonable officer could have believed\n\nthat Coach Marchand had in loco parentis authority to consent to\n\nthe search of the players and that their equal protection claims\n\nmust fail.    My colleagues and I part company, however, on the issue\n\nof   qualified   immunity.    Because       I   cannot   subscribe    to   the\n\nmajority’s    determination   that    the   officers     were   entitled    to\n\nqualified immunity because they could reasonably have believed that\n\nCoach Marchand voluntarily consented to the search of his students,\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             The appellants, a team of young Hispanic soccer players\n\nfrom Central Falls, Rhode Island were subjected to shockingly\n\ndisgraceful and humiliating conduct by the police and their fellow\n\ncitizens alike while visiting another high school in Coventry,\n\nRhode Island.5    After playing a tense game against Coventry’s team,\n\nthe Central Falls players were surrounded by a mob seething with\n\nracial animosity and casting false accusations of theft.             When the\n\npolice arrived and observed the crowd's obstruction of the bus,\n\nthey parked their cruisers in front of and behind the Central Falls\n\nteam’s bus, trapping them with their antagonists.               Then, rather\n\nthan take any action to meaningfully investigate any accusations or\n\n\n\n      5\n          The record reflects that the Central Falls players were\nbi-lingual.\n\n                                 -32-\n\fpacify   the    crowd,    which   continued    to    simmer    menacingly,      the\n\nofficers questioned the Central Falls team and sought its coach’s\n\npermission to search their belongings.\n\n           My colleagues think that a reasonable officer would be\n\nunaware of the duress this state of affairs would inspire in the\n\nteam’s coach.     In my view, however, the officers’ request of Coach\n\nMarchand while he was surrounded by an angry mob and unable to\n\ndepart with his players left little room for choice.                         He was\n\nsubjected to coercion which, though subtler than a peremptory\n\ncommand and more courteous than the irate mob, could hardly be\n\nplainer.       This    coercion   vitiated    any   consent     he   could    give,\n\nrendering the subsequent search unlawful.\n\n           The basic factual scenario is not largely disputed by the\n\nparties and my colleagues and I recognize that all reasonable\n\ninferences     drawn    from   the   facts   are    to   be   construed   in    the\n\nplaintiffs' favor.6       Maj. Op. at 3.     The officers invoked qualified\n\nimmunity as a defense to their actions.             My colleagues set out the\n\nrelevant law, see Maj. Op. at 11-14, which I accept and reprise\n\nbriefly.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          In their brief, the defendant officers note that if the\ncase were to go to trial they would dispute both the number of\nspectators alleged to be watching the exchange as well as the\nplaintiffs' reference to the spectators as a \"mob.\"\n\n                                      -33-\n\f                                        II.\n\n             “Qualified immunity balances two important interests -\n\nthe need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise\n\npower   irresponsibly      and   the    need     to    shield   officials    from\n\nharassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their\n\nduties reasonably.”        Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815\n\n(2009).\n\n             To defeat the immunity, the players must show that (1)\n\nthe officers “violated [their] constitutionally protected right”\n\nand (2) “the particular right . . . was clearly established at the\n\ntime of the violation.”      Raiche v. Pietroski, 623 F.3d 30, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).        Further, “in applying the second prong, we must\n\nconsider two subsidiary issues: (a) the clarity of the law in\n\ngeneral at the time of the alleged violation; and (b) the clarity\n\nof the law as applied to the case” - simply put, we ask “whether a\n\nreasonable     [officer]    in   the     defendant’s       shoes   ‘would    have\n\nunderstood that his conduct violated the [players’] constitutional\n\nrights.’”     Id. at 35-36 (quoting Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d\n\n263, 269 (1st Cir. 2009)).       In undertaking this inquiry, we do not\n\nconsider     the   defendants'      subjective        beliefs   concerning    the\n\nunlawfulness of their conduct.          See Philip v. Cronin, 537 F.3d 26,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 2008).      Instead, this inquiry is based on an objective\n\ntest    -   what   a   reasonable      officer    would    have    known.     Id.\n\nNonetheless, “[a] determination of objective reasonableness ‘will\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\foften require examination of the information possessed’ by the\n\ndefendant officials.\"     Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987)).\n\n          In   granting   qualified    immunity   to   the   officers, my\n\ncolleagues analyzed only the second prong of the test, as permitted\n\nby Pearson.    Maj. Op. at 12.        Because I would deny qualified\n\nimmunity, however, I must address both aspects of the analysis.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          The first prong of the qualified immunity test asks\n\nwhether a violation of constitutional rights actually occurred.\n\nRaiche, 623 F.3d at 35.       It has long been recognized that the\n\nFourth Amendment bars all warrantless searches “subject only to a\n\nfew specifically established . . . exceptions” such as the presence\n\nof probable cause, exigent circumstances, or valid consent.           See\n\nKatz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 357 n.19, 358 n.22\n\n(1967).   Accordingly, absent such an exception to the warrant\n\nrequirement the officers' search of the Central Falls players was\n\nimproper and a clear violation of the players' constitutional right\n\nto be free from warrantless searches.\n\n          The officers rely only upon Coach Marchand’s consent to\n\nvalidate their search.      Of course, the consent must have been\n\nvoluntarily given.   Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548\n\n(1968).   That is, it must not have been the product of “duress or\n\ncoercion,” Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248 (1973), or\n\n\n                                 -35-\n\fintimidation, Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986), either\n\nexpress or implied.       See United States v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259,\n\n264-65 (1st Cir. 2008).         Because, as discussed below, I believe\n\nthat a reasonable officer would have known that Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent to the search of his players was coerced, the first prong\n\nof the qualified immunity test is easily satisfied: there was an\n\nactual violation in the form of an unconstitutional search.\n\n                                        B.\n\n           The second prong of the qualified immunity inquiry asks\n\nwhether   it   was    clear,    both   legally       and   factually,       that    the\n\nofficers’ search was non-consensual.             Raiche, 623 F.3d at 35.            My\n\ncolleagues and I agree that it is clearly established under the\n\nFourth Amendment that voluntary consent is required to validate a\n\nsuspicionless,       warrantless    search     and    that    \"all       officers   of\n\nreasonable competence would have known that coercion vitiates\n\nconsent to a search under the Fourth Amendment.\"                    Maj. Op. at 17.\n\nWe also agree that the presence of coercion is determined by an\n\nopen-ended     test      that      considers         “‘all        the    surrounding\n\ncircumstances,’ including ‘subtly coercive police questions’ and\n\n‘the   possibly   vulnerable       subjective     state      of    the    person    who\n\nconsents.’” Maj. Op. at 19 (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229).\n\nWhere we disagree is whether the facts of this particular case,\n\napplied to that law, clearly make out a violation of the players’\n\nFourth Amendment rights.           Ultimately, my colleagues \"cannot say\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\fthat all officers of reasonable competence,\" confronted with the\n\nfacts of this case,    \"would have concluded that Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent to the search was invalid.\"           Maj. Op. at 26.        On the\n\ncontrary, I believe that the players’ rights were violated, and\n\nthat a reasonable officer would have concluded that the search was\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n                                    1.\n\n           In analyzing the second prong of the qualified immunity\n\ntest we must ask whether a reasonable officer in the defendants’\n\nposition would have known that Coach Marchand felt coerced into\n\nconsenting to the search.      The central question, then, is how the\n\nreasonable   officer   would   have   assessed    the   voluntariness    of\n\nMarchand’s consent.\n\n           As we have explained, “[v]oluntariness is a question of\n\nfact that turns on [a] comprehensive assessment of the totality of\n\nthe    circumstances   attending      the    interaction   between     [the\n\nindividual] and the searching officers.”          Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at\n\n264.    Threats, intimidation, and coercion are all factors to\n\nconsider in analyzing the totality of the circumstances, but they\n\nare not the only ones. See, e.g., United States v. Pérez-Montañez,\n\n202 F.3d 434, 438 (1st Cir. 2000).           Indeed, in considering the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, no single coercive element will\n\nusually suffice to end the analysis.        See Maj. Op. at 20 (citing W.\n\nLaFave, Search and Seizure         § 8.2(b), at 62 (4th ed. 2004)).\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fInstead, we must look to the circumstances surrounding Marchand's\n\nconsent and determine whether they establish that a reasonable\n\nofficer could have concluded that he gave it voluntarily.                     See\n\nUnited   States   v.    Twomey,    884   F.2d   46,   51     (1st    Cir.    1989)\n\n(explaining that we must look to \"all the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe securing of the consent\" when determining the voluntariness\n\nthereof).\n\n            Moreover,     the     determination       of     an     individual’s\n\nvoluntariness in consenting to a search is a subjective, fact-\n\nintensive endeavor that “turns not on whether a ‘reasonable’ person\n\nin the [individual’s] position would have felt compelled to consent\n\nto a police officer’s request to search, but, rather, on whether\n\nthe [individual] [him]self actually felt compelled to consent.”\n\nUnited States v. Hall, 969 F.2d 1102, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1992); accord\n\nSchneckloth, 412 U.S. at 226; Twomey, 884 F.2d at 51.                Consent is\n\ncoerced when an individual's \"will ha[s] been overborne and his\n\ncapacity for self-determination critically impaired\" to the point\n\nthat he does not face an \"essentially free and unconstrained\n\nchoice.\"      United     States     v.   Watson,      423     U.S.    411,     424\n\n(1976)(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Throughout this inquiry, we must recall that on summary\n\njudgment, when assessing the factual circumstances in which an\n\nindividual consented to a search and the possible assumptions a\n\nreasonable    officer    might    have   made   about       the   corresponding\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fvoluntariness, “we are required to draw every reasonable inference\n\nin favor of the nonmoving party” – here the Central Falls players.\n\nDennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 549 F.3d 851, 858 (1st Cir. 2008);\n\nsee also Vera v. McHugh, 622 F.3d 17, 27 n. 11 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(recalling \"our duty to take the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the nonmoving party on summary judgment\").      This is a tough\n\ncase, but in my view the balance tips against qualified immunity.\n\n                                 2.\n\n             Having set out the relevant law, I turn now to the\n\nfactual analysis.\n\n            The majority justifies its determination that Marchand’s\n\nconsent was valid in large part based on United States v. Drayton,\n\n536 U.S. 194 (2002).    In Drayton, three police officers boarded a\n\nbus as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction.         One\n\nofficer was at the front of the bus, facing the rear, and another\n\nofficer was at the rear of the bus, facing forward.       The third\n\nofficer walked down the bus aisle from the back to the front,\n\nstopping to speak with passengers along the way. Neither the aisle\n\nnor the front exit was ever blocked.     Passengers who declined to\n\nspeak with the officer or who chose to exit the bus were allowed to\n\ndo so.   As the officer approached Drayton's seat, he showed his\n\nbadge and stated that his purpose on the bus was to look for drugs\n\nand guns.    The officer asked if Drayton and his companion, Brown,\n\nhad any bags.    They answered affirmatively, so the officer asked\n\n\n                                -39-\n\ffor permission to search the bags.         Brown agreed and no contraband\n\nwas found.    The officer then asked if he could conduct a patdown of\n\nBrown.    He agreed and was arrested after the patdown revealed\n\ncontraband.     The same is true of Drayton.                 A further search\n\nrevealed that both individuals had cocaine taped between their\n\nshorts.     Drayton and Brown were charged with federal drug crimes\n\nand moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that their consent\n\nto the patdown search was invalid.         The Supreme Court held that the\n\ndefendants’ consent was not a product of coercion because, among\n\nother reasons, there had been \"no threat, no command, [and] not\n\neven an authoritative tone of voice.\"           Id. at 204.\n\n             Relying on Drayton, my colleagues place great stock in\n\nthe politeness with which the officers interacted with Coach\n\nMarchand and the students.7        Without a doubt, had the officers\n\ncommanded     Marchand    to   submit,     or   acted   in    a   threatening,\n\ndomineering, boorish, or otherwise inappropriate way, this case\n\nwould be easier.         But the fact that the officers were polite,\n\nparticularly given all else that was occurring at the highly\n\ncharged scene, does not establish that Marchand was not coerced.\n\nThe Supreme Court has explained that subtle and polite coercion is\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Though I would hardly describe the decision to conduct an\ninvasive search of the players in front of a hostile, jeering,\nphoto-taking crowd as “polite,” the players do not appear to\nchallenge this characterization.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fjust as objectionable as more obvious browbeating.     Schneckloth,\n\n412 U.S. at 228.\n\n          Furthermore, we have admonished courts to “go beyond\n\nappearances and inquire whether the consent was a voluntary,\n\nintentional and understood waiver of a known right, or, on the\n\ncontrary, was the product of deceit, duress and coercion, actual or\n\nimplicit.\" United States v. Berkowitz, 429 F.2d 921, 925 (1st Cir.\n\n1970)(internal quotation marks omitted).    The \"beyond appearances\"\n\ninquiry is particularly important here: though the police may have\n\nbeen polite and refrained from issuing commands in an authoritative\n\ntone of voice, they nonetheless blocked the bus in, leaving the\n\nplayers no way out, essentially \"appeas[ing] the masses\" who were\n\n\"crying for [the players'] heads.”         Maj. Op. at 6 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also infra at 12-15. Ultimately, the\n\nofficers’ demeanor can be but one factor in our analysis, and\n\ncertainly “not the only one.”    Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429,\n\n437 (1991).\n\n          Similarly, although the majority is correct that the\n\nofficers’ failure to notify Marchand that he could refuse to\n\nconsent is not dispositive, Maj. Op. at 20, it is yet one more\n\nfactor of the many in this narrative that, taken together, militate\n\nagainst qualified immunity in this case. See Schneckloth, 412 U.S.\n\nat 227 (“[T]he failure of the police to advise the accused of his\n\nrights [is] certainly [a] factor[] to be evaluated in assessing the\n\n\n                                -41-\n\f‘voluntariness’ of [his] [consent] . . . .”); see also Drayton, 536\n\nU.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 432)(explaining that one\n\nfactor \"particularly worth noting\" when considering whether consent\n\nto   search     was     coerced   was   that    the   officer    had    advised   the\n\npassenger of his right to refuse to consent).\n\n               Like the issue of politeness and failure to warn an\n\nindividual of his right to refuse consent, police custody is yet\n\nanother factor worthy of consideration.                Watson, 423 U.S. at 424.\n\nTrue, \"custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate\n\n. . . coerced . . . consent to search,\" 423 U.S. at 424, but we\n\nhave       previously    observed   that   \"sensitivity     to    the    heightened\n\npossibility of coercion is appropriate when a[n] [individual's]\n\nconsent is obtained during custody,\" United States v. Barnett, 989\n\nF.2d 546, 555 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               There is no question that Marchand was in police custody\n\nat the time he consented to the search.8              The officers parked their\n\ncruisers in front of and behind the players’ bus, preventing them\n\nfrom leaving.           This alone distinguishes our case from Drayton,\n\nwhich involved “no blocking of exits.”                   536 U.S. at 204. In\n\nDrayton, even though there was an officer at the front of the bus,\n\n\"he said nothing to suggest that people could not exit and . . .\n\n\n\n       8\n          There is no need to determine whether Marchand was in\nlegal custody. By \"custody\" I refer only to the factual scenario\nby which the bus was blocked in by police cruisers, effectively\nblocking any means of exit for the plaintiffs.\n\n                                         -42-\n\fleft the aisle clear.\"       Id. at 205.     This is significantly\n\ndifferent from the facts of the present case where the players' bus\n\nwas completely boxed in by patrol cars.      Surely, no reasonable\n\nofficer could have believed that the plaintiffs felt free to leave.\n\n            Of course, it may be true that the officers trapped the\n\nplayers with the crowd before they were aware of the nature of the\n\ncontroversy and of the danger, fear, and concomitant coercion they\n\nwould cause by doing so.   See Maj. Op. at 25.   But this is beside\n\nthe point: at the time the officers sought Marchand's permission to\n\nsearch the players a reasonable officer would certainly have been\n\naware, at that crucial moment, that the positioning of their\n\ncruisers left the players with no way out.   Cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU.S. 1, 21-22 (1968) (explaining in analogous context that in\n\nevaluating the reasonableness of a search or seizure, courts look\n\nto the state of the facts \"at the moment of the seizure or the\n\nsearch\").    Regardless, Marchand’s fearful inquiry of the officers\n\nin response to their request for consent (“[w]hat [is the crowd]\n\ngoing to do to us?”) should have made apparent the fear elicited in\n\nhim by being blocked in with the crowd.\n\n            The majority states that \"[t]he officers could have\n\nreasonably thought that they made clear [to Coach Marchand] that\n\nthey would   prevent the crowd from harming [his] players . . . .\"\n\nMaj. Op. at 25.    This conclusion is incredible - particularly in\n\nlight of the fact that the officers never responded to Marchand's\n\n\n                                -43-\n\finitial inquiry regarding the crowd's behavior. In addition, there\n\nwere only four officers on the scene, yet they were responsible for\n\ncontrolling an angry, boisterous, irrational crowd of approximately\n\nfifty to sixty people.          With a mere six to ten feet buffer between\n\nthe    hostile    crowd   and    the   players,   I   cannot   fathom   how   any\n\nreasonable officer would think that the defendants made clear to\n\nCoach Marchand that he and his players would go unharmed. The\n\nmajority points out that \"the officers did not convey to Coach\n\nMarchand that they would not move their cruisers until he agreed to\n\na search\" and that the officers “were [not] . . . asked to move the\n\ncruisers.\"       Maj. Op. at 26.       That may very well be the case,        but\n\nso too is the converse - the officers never offered nor took any\n\naction to move their cruisers on their own before soliciting Coach\n\nMarchand's permission.\n\n            Nevertheless, Marchand's fearful inquiry shows that he\n\nfelt threatened and intimidated by the crowd.                That Marchand did\n\nnot translate his fear and intimidation of the crowd into a\n\nparticularized request - for example, by asking the officers to\n\nmove their cruisers or asking if there were any other options other\n\nthan consenting to a search of his players - does not eliminate\n\nthis    factor    from    consideration.       As     the   Supreme   Court   has\n\nexplained, “the crucial test is whether, taking into account all of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct\n\nwould have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fliberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.”\n\nBostick, 501 U.S. at 437 (emphasis added)(internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Any officer should have recognized that Coach Marchand\n\ndid not feel at liberty to leave.\n\n            The majority acknowledges that \"the players' evidence\n\ndepicts a difficult situation in which Coach Marchand faced a\n\ngenuine choice between imperfect solutions,\"           Maj. Op. at 23, but\n\nnonetheless decides that \"these circumstances do not establish . .\n\n. that Coach Marchand's will had been overborne or that his\n\ncapacity for self-determination was critically impaired.\"              Id. at\n\n24.   To support this conclusion the majority notes that Coach\n\nMarchand testified at his deposition that he \"'debated' telling the\n\nofficers to get a search warrant, but rejected that option,\" after\n\nweighing    his   alternatives,   Maj.    Op.    at   24,   and    ultimately\n\n“concluded that his role as coach was to ensure first and foremost\n\nthat [his] players got home safely”         Id.       But Coach Marchand’s\n\nthought    process,   and   the   actions   he    “debated”       taking,   are\n\ncompletely irrelevant.      Marchand's testimony was given after the\n\nfact and was not communicated to any officer at the scene of the\n\nincident.    The hypothetical reasonable officer cannot read minds;\n\ntherefore, in analyzing whether such an officer would have known\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent was coerced, it is simply common\n\nsense that only facts actually communicated to or observed by the\n\nofficer are relevant.\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\f          My colleagues are apparently of two minds on this issue:\n\nthough they initially rely on Marchand’s uncorroborated description\n\nof his internal thought process in an effort to negate the coercion\n\nhe suffered, they later recognize that his subjective, unexpressed\n\nthoughts and feelings are irrelevant when dismissing Marchand’s\n\ntestimony that he felt coerced into consenting. see Maj. Op. at 26\n\n(\"It is not enough that Coach Marchand described his consent to the\n\nsearch as coerced; . . . [w]hile a jury might find that Coach\n\nMarchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced that is not\n\nthe issue here; we must look to the view of the reasonable\n\nofficer.\").   As I have previously discussed, Marchand's objective\n\nmanifestations   of   coercion   were    amply   supported   by   evidence\n\navailable to the officers.       In analyzing the coercive atmosphere\n\nunder which Marchand gave his consent, I would consider only those\n\nfacts available to a reasonable officer at the time of the search.\n\n          If more were needed, and I doubt that there is, the\n\nofficers exacerbated the situation by “ma[king] little to no effort\n\nto quell or disperse the crowd, even as [it] verbally assailed the\n\nplayers[,] shouting racist epithets and accusations of theft.”\n\nLopera v. Town of Coventry, 652 F. Supp. 2d 203, 210 (D.R.I. 2009).\n\nWith the possibly violent assembly looming, the officers questioned\n\nMarchand. Taking the crowd’s word over Marchand’s, they elected to\n\npursue a search of the Central Falls students before adequately\n\n\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fcalming   the   mob   or   even   ascertaining   what,   if    anything,   had\n\nactually been stolen.\n\n            My colleagues, in further reliance on Drayton, note that\n\nthere was no testimony that the request to search was made in “an\n\nauthoritative tone of voice.”        Maj. Op. at 23 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       But tone of voice cannot be dispositive of the\n\ncoercion inquiry.      Al Capone said you can get more with a kind word\n\nand a gun than with just a kind word; a mob can be just as\n\n“convincing” as a gun.\n\n            The officers knew that Marchand felt threatened by the\n\ncrowd.      They knew he had already capitulated to the intense\n\ncoercion and intimidation exerted by the mob, delaying his team’s\n\ndeparture for about a half-hour to engage in a search that he knew\n\nbeforehand would be futile in order to satisfy the crowd’s demands.\n\nStill, the officers did practically nothing to assuage that fear or\n\nmitigate the coercion, and indeed kept the players’ bus trapped\n\nwith the crowd for more than ten minutes before capitalizing on\n\nMarchand’s weakened state to elicit consent for a duplicative\n\nsearch.   Without a doubt, such behavior is contrary to the general\n\nrecognition that police officers have a duty to protect the public\n\nand public safety.     See, e.g.,    Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151,\n\n1164 (1st Cir. 1989)(referencing district court's assertion in\n\nexcessive    force    case   that   \"the    primary   duty    of   the   police\n\n\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\fdepartments and policemen is to protect and preserve life and\n\nproperty and the public peace\")(emphasis added).\n\n            It is inappropriate to create an artificial dichotomy\n\nbetween the coercion applied by the officers and that applied by\n\nthe crowd they failed to adequately control, and then to omit the\n\nlatter from consideration.        To do so subverts the totality-of-the-\n\ncircumstances analysis that is required of us.               Even the majority\n\nrecognizes    this.      In   rejecting       the    officers'   argument    that\n\ncoercion,    in   the   context   of    Fourth       Amendment   analysis,   must\n\n“‘emanat[e] from the police officers themselves rather than any\n\nsubjective or outside influence,’\" the majority noted that clearly\n\nestablished law requires consideration of \"all the surrounding\n\ncircumstances.\" Maj. Op. at 17-18 (citing Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at\n\n227, and concluding that Colorado v. Connelly 479 U.S. 157 (1986),\n\nwhich held that \"coercive police activity is a necessary predicate\n\nto the finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the\n\nmeaning of the Due Process Clause,” id. at 167, does not extend to\n\nFourth Amendment consent cases).\n\n            A reasonable officer in the defendants’ position would\n\nhave known that Marchand, who expressed fear of the crowd, was\n\nunder a significant amount of duress.               This duress was caused both\n\nby the raucous mob hurling menacing accusations, threats, and\n\nracial epithets and the officers themselves, who blocked Marchand’s\n\nteam in with the crowd, failed to take adequate measures to calm or\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fdisperse it, and immediately took its side against Marchand upon\n\narriving, despite lacking any reasoned basis for doing so.               Given\n\nthe officers’ exchange with Marchand, they knew or at least should\n\nhave objectively known, that he felt constrained by their failure\n\nto disperse the crowd or allow the bus to leave and that he feared\n\nthe racial animus in the crowd aimed at his players.                  On these\n\nfacts, a reasonable officer would have known that Marchand believed\n\nhe had no option for getting his students home safely but to\n\nconsent to their demand for a search.             Moreover, a reasonable\n\nofficer would conclude that Marchand’s responsibility for the\n\nsafety of his charges and his increasing tardiness in getting them\n\nhome   would   make    him    particularly   vulnerable   to   this   type    of\n\ncoercion.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            I am gravely concerned that our case law is treading\n\nterribly close to creating \"an impenetrable defense for government\n\nofficals\" and a \"significant risk that qualified immunity will\n\nalways attach.”       Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)(equally divided en banc court)(opinion of Bownes, J.).                 The\n\nFourth Amendment is one of our most precious constitutional rights.\n\nWe should not so comfortably defer to the judgment of government\n\nofficials at the cost of eviscerating such a fundamental right of\n\nour citizens - a right this nation has declared deserves the\n\nhighest protection.          Indeed, our task in undertaking a qualified\n\n\n                                     -49-\n\fimmunity inquiry requires the contrary.                   It is after all \"an\n\nattempt to balance competing values: not only the importance of a\n\ndamages remedy to protect the rights of citizens, but also ‘the\n\nneed to protect officials who are required to exercise their\n\ndiscretion and the related public interest in encouraging the\n\nvigorous exercise of official authority.’\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982)(quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478,\n\n504-06 (1978))(citation omitted).\n\n            With these concerns in mind and taking, as I must, every\n\ninference available in the record in favor of the plaintiffs, I\n\ncannot say that a reasonable officer in the defendants’ position\n\ncould have concluded that Marchand voluntarily consented to the\n\nsearch.     The   Central   Falls       team’s   rights    were   violated;    the\n\nviolation   was    clear;   and     a    reasonable    officer     should     have\n\nrecognized it.      I would vacate the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment and remand for resolution of the factual disputes\n\nupon which the officers’ claim of qualified immunity turns.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -50-\n\f",

Former members of the Central Falls\n\nHigh School boys soccer team appeal from an entry of summary\n\njudgment for the Town of Coventry, Rhode Island, and Coventry\n\npolice officers in this civil rights case. This dispute arises out\n\nof a police search of team members that followed a heated soccer\n\nmatch between Central Falls High School and Coventry High School in\n\nCoventry in 2006.        Police searched all individual Central Falls\n\nteam members for items purportedly missing from the Coventry locker\n\nroom in the presence of an abusive crowd of Coventry students and\n\nadults.      Though   the     Central   Falls    coach    told   the   police   he\n\nconsented to the search of his players, both he and the players\n\nassert that he was coerced into doing so by the police.\n\n           Lead plaintiff Juan Lopera and other former members of\n\nthe Central Falls team brought suit for damages and injunctive\n\nrelief in April 2008, alleging violations of their constitutional\n\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as\n\nviolations     of   Rhode    Island   state   law.

Lopera v. Town of Coventry, 652 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 203, 213-17 (D.R.I. 2009).   We affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          We review the facts in the light most favorable to Lopera\n\nand the other plaintiffs, the parties opposing summary judgment.\n\nOn September 28, 2006, the Central Falls High School soccer team\n\ntraveled to Coventry for a match against Coventry High School.\n\nBefore the game, four or five Central Falls players used the\n\nrestrooms in the Coventry locker room.    They were not alone.    A\n\nsecurity guard accompanied the boys into the locker room.        The\n\nlocker room is usually open and unlocked and could be easily\n\naccessed, including by unauthorized persons.\n\n          The locker room is apparently used by all Coventry teams\n\nand recently had been used by Coventry's football team.   After the\n\nsoccer match, a group of approximately twenty football players1\n\nconfronted the Central Falls coach, Robert Marchand, as he walked\n\nbehind his players toward the team bus.     In profane terms, the\n\nCoventry students accused the Central Falls players of stealing\n\niPods and cell phones from the Coventry locker room.\n\n          The Central Falls players allege that they encountered\n\nhostile racism during their match with the Coventry soccer team and\n\nduring the remainder of their time in Coventry.    Central Falls is\n\na racially diverse community, and the Central Falls team consisted\n\n\n     1\n          This crowd apparently did not include any soccer players.\n\n                               -3-\n\fentirely   of   Spanish-speaking   Hispanic   players,   save   for   one\n\nPortuguese player.    Coventry, by contrast, is predominantly non-\n\nHispanic and white, and its high school reflected this.               The\n\nCentral Falls players allege that Coventry players uttered racial\n\nepithets during the game, calling them \"spics\" and demanding that\n\nthey speak English.   They allege that Coventry students and adults\n\nmade similar remarks during the series of events that followed the\n\ngame.\n\n           After the Coventry football players confronted Coach\n\nMarchand with the purported thefts, he told them that he would\n\nhandle the situation. The football players followed him toward the\n\nCentral Falls bus.      Before the group reached the bus, Coach\n\nMarchand told the players to wait. Coach Marchand then boarded the\n\nbus, where his team was waiting.         Coach Marchand informed the\n\nplayers of the accusations and told them that he knew they had not\n\ntaken the items.    Nonetheless, he and an assistant coach searched\n\nthe players' bags.     If an iPod or cell phone was found, Coach\n\nMarchand asked for proof that it belonged to the player.              The\n\nsearch lasted approximately twenty to twenty-five minutes.        Coach\n\nMarchand testified that when it was completed, he was \"completely\n\nsatisfied\" that his players did not possess the items.\n\n           After he completed the search, Coach Marchand left the\n\nbus to speak with the Coventry Athletic Director, who was waiting\n\noutside.   By this time, Coach Marchand testified, a crowd of fifty\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\for sixty Coventry students and adults had gathered around the bus.\n\nAccording to Coach Marchand, members of the crowd yelled that they\n\nknew his players had the items.            He testified that students and\n\nadults in the crowd stated that the players were \"from the ghetto,\"\n\nknew how to \"hide things\" and \"lie good,\" and could not be trusted.\n\nThe players recounted similar accusations and vitriol, including\n\nracial slurs like \"spic.\"        At one point, a member of the crowd\n\napparently tried to board the bus to conduct his own search.         Coach\n\nMarchand testified that members of the crowd demanded a search of\n\nhis own bags.     He also testified that members of the crowd stated\n\nthat they would not let the Central Falls players leave until the\n\nitems had been found.\n\n              Coach Marchand told the Coventry Athletic Director that\n\nhe had checked \"everything\" on the bus, and that his players did\n\nnot have the purportedly missing items.          Coach Marchand also told\n\nthe Athletic Director that he was welcome to do his own search,\n\nwhich   the    Athletic   Director   declined    as   unnecessary.   Coach\n\nMarchand testified that as he and the Athletic Director puzzled\n\nover how to \"satisfy all [the] constituencies here,\" he began to\n\nworry that violence might ensue.\n\n              At this point, three or four Coventry police cruisers\n\narrived on the scene with their lights and sirens activated.          The\n\npolice had received calls reporting a supposed ongoing physical\n\naltercation.      The officers boxed in the Central Falls bus with\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftheir cruisers so that it could not move.                    According to the\n\nplayers, by this time the crowd had also formed a semi-circle\n\naround the bus, blocking its path out of the parking lot.\n\n              Once it became clear that no physical altercation was\n\ntaking      place,   the   police    discussed   the   situation   with   Coach\n\nMarchand and the Coventry Athletic Director.                   Coach Marchand\n\nexplained to the officers that the Coventry students had alleged\n\nthefts and that his players \"were prime suspects.\"                 He told the\n\nofficers that he had searched each student's bags on the bus and\n\ndid   not    find    the   purportedly    missing   items.     Coach   Marchand\n\nexpressed fear of the crowd, asking the police, \"what am I going to\n\ndo, what are they going to do to us[?]\"                After a pause, Coach\n\nMarchand testified, the police responded by asking him if they\n\ncould search the players.           Coach Marchand verbally agreed.\n\n              Coach Marchand did not testify that the officers said or\n\ndid anything coercive.        Coach Marchand testified that the officers\n\nacted courteously and told unruly members of the crowd to be quiet.\n\nAccording to Coach Marchand, the police \"decided their best thing\n\nwas to [do the] search themselves to appease the masses\" who were\n\n\"crying for our heads.\" In his testimony, he described his consent\n\nas the way to \"take the high road, take the safe road,\" even though\n\nhe knew his players did not have the items.                  We must take this\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftestimony as true on this motion for summary judgment.2   The police\n\ntestified that the crowd was angry and unruly, consistent with the\n\nplayers' testimony. They also testified that they did not hear any\n\nracial epithets from members of the crowd, which is not the\n\nplaintiffs' testimony.\n\n          After agreeing to the search, Coach Marchand returned to\n\nthe bus and told his players that the crowd would not let them go\n\nuntil the police searched them.     The police then told the players\n\nto get off the bus with all of their belongings and line up with\n\ntheir bags between their legs.      The players complied, lining up\n\nwith their backs against the bus.    An officer then told the players\n\nthat if any of them had the missing items, they would be arrested\n\nif they did not immediately step forward.    When none of the players\n\nstepped forward, the officers began a search.         Coach Marchand\n\ntestified that the officers placed each player's bag on the hood of\n\na cruiser and looked through it.    A few players testified that some\n\nplayers were also subjected to pat down searches.         During the\n\nsearch, the crowd was about six to ten feet away from the players.\n\n          The search lasted for about 45 minutes to an hour.     The\n\npolice officers testified that they did not obtain descriptions of\n\nthe type of iPods or cell phones alleged to be missing, other than\n\n\n\n     2\n          One officer testified that Coach Marchand suggested the\nsearch and that they conducted the search because it would\n\"expedite the process and eliminate them all as suspects.\" These\nare disputed facts and for these purposes we do not accept them.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthat one phone may have been a \"flip phone.\"        When the police\n\nlocated an iPod or a cell phone on a player, they required that the\n\nplayer prove that the item belonged to him.      In some cases, the\n\nplayers identified items stored on the devices and allowed the\n\nofficers to search the devices.        In other cases, the officers\n\ndisplayed the devices to members of the crowd and asked if they\n\nwere the missing devices. During the course of the search, members\n\nof the crowd alleged that additional items were missing, like books\n\nand money.\n\n          The players testified that the crowd continued to harass\n\nthem during the search.    One player testified that, during the\n\nsearch, members of the crowd called the players \"spics.\"    Another\n\ntestified that members of the crowd stated that the Central Falls\n\nteam should not be in Coventry or playing Coventry High School\n\ngiven the race of its players.   Members of the crowd photographed\n\nthe Central Falls students during the search with their cell phone\n\ncameras. Marchand testified that although the officers reprimanded\n\nunruly members of the crowd during the search, they did not take\n\nadequate actions to disperse the crowd or move it away from the\n\nbus.\n\n          There was testimony that during the search, one Coventry\n\nofficer told one of the players that he thought the search was\n\n\"stupid\" because the coach had already searched the players and\n\nbecause a security guard had accompanied the players in the locker\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\froom.       Another officer, hearing the comment, laughed.   The police\n\nrequired all the players to wait outside the bus until every player\n\nhad been searched.       The search did not produce any of the missing\n\nitems.       After it was completed, the police escorted the bus out of\n\ntown in their cruisers.\n\n               Lopera and other members of the Central Falls team filed\n\nsuit in April 2008 against the Town of Coventry and several\n\nindividual Coventry police officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (§ 1983)\n\nand Rhode Island state law.         Under § 1983, the players alleged\n\ndeprivations of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures, as well as their Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights to due process of law and equal protection of the\n\nlaw.3       Under Rhode Island state law, the players alleged violation\n\nof statutes that forbid invasion of privacy, racial profiling, and\n\nethnic intimidation. R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1; id. § 31-21.2; id.\n\n§ 9-1-35.\n\n               The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants on all counts.        First, it held that the officers were\n\nentitled to qualified immunity with respect to the Fourth Amendment\n\nand state privacy claims because (1) it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe officers to believe that Coach Marchand had power to consent to\n\nthe search, and (2) coercion did not vitiate Coach Marchand's\n\n\n        3\n          The players have conceded that their Due Process claim\nwas not intended to allege a violation of their substantive due\nprocess rights and thus overlaps with their Fourth Amendment claim.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fconsent.     Second, it held that the players did not introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to support a finding that the police engaged in\n\nracial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n\nor Rhode Island's statutes prohibiting racial profiling and ethnic\n\nintimidation.   The district court also held on independent grounds\n\nthat the players had not introduced material facts to support their\n\nclaims of supervisory and municipal liability.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           On appeal, the players make two arguments.           First, they\n\nargue that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity for\n\nthe claims under the Fourth Amendment and state privacy law because\n\n(1) a reasonable officer would have believed that Coach Marchand\n\ndid not have authority to consent for his players, and (2) a\n\nreasonable   officer   would   have   believed   that   Coach   Marchand's\n\nconsent was coerced.      Second, they argue that they set forth\n\nmaterial facts to support the reasonable inference that the actions\n\nof the officers were impermissibly motivated by race in violation\n\nof the Equal Protection Clause and Rhode Island state law.             The\n\nplayers do not challenge the district court's rulings on municipal\n\nand supervisory liability.\n\n           In their answer to the players' complaint, the defendant\n\nofficers asserted qualified immunity against all claims.                 In\n\nasserting this defense before the district court and before this\n\ncourt, the officers focused their argument on whether it was\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fclearly established that Coach Marchand could consent on behalf of\n\nhis students in loco parentis.     The district court analyzed this\n\nquestion in a qualified immunity framework, but it appeared to\n\naddress the players' remaining claims outside of that framework.\n\nGiven that the officers have raised a qualified immunity defense to\n\nall of the players' claims, we address each of the players' claims\n\nin the qualified immunity framework.\n\n          This court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo.\n\nSaccucci Auto Group, Inc. v.

This circuit follows a two-step analysis under\n\nPearson in discerning whether defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.

Fourth Amendment and State Privacy Claims\n\n            In their claims under the Fourth Amendment and the state\n\nprivacy statute, the players give two grounds to defeat qualified\n\nimmunity.        First, they argue that all officers of reasonable\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fcompetence would have believed that Coach Marchand did not have\n\nauthority to consent on behalf of the players.              Second, they argue\n\nthat all officers of reasonable competence would have believed that\n\ncoercion vitiated Coach Marchand's purported consent to the search\n\nin this case.\n\n           The district court focused primarily on the players'\n\nfirst argument.       It held that the players failed to introduce a\n\nmaterial   fact    showing    it    was    clearly   established    that   Coach\n\nMarchand could not consent on their behalf under the circumstances.\n\nLopera 652 F. Supp. 2d at 213-16.                In so finding, the district\n\ncourt relied on the apparent uncertainty of prevailing Supreme\n\nCourt doctrine governing in loco parentis searches in schools. Id.\n\nAs to the players' second argument, the district court held that\n\nCoach Marchand's consent was voluntary because he \"understood the\n\nsituation,\"     id.   at   216,    and    gave   consent   \"after   careful   and\n\ndeliberate thought,\"         id. at 217.         The district court did not\n\naddress whether this would have been clear to the officers under\n\nthe circumstances, nor whether it was clearly established that\n\ncoercion vitiates consent.\n\n           1.     Coach Marchand's Authority to Consent\n\n           We may quickly dispose of the players' first argument,\n\nwhich does not require analysis of the intricacies of the in loco\n\nparentis doctrine.         Under the facts alleged by the players, a\n\nreasonable officer could have concluded that Coach Marchand had\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fauthority to consent to a search of his students.      The search did\n\nnot take place at Central Falls High School, but rather on a trip\n\naway from school over which Coach Marchand was undisputedly in\n\ncharge.   When the officers arrived, Coach Marchand told them that\n\nhe had already conducted his own search of his students.    To arrive\n\nat the conclusion that Coach Marchand could not consent, an officer\n\nwould have had to question Coach Marchand's authority to perform\n\nthe first search and, by extension, Coach Marchand's authority to\n\nconsent to a second search by the police.\n\n          We cannot say that no officer of reasonable competence\n\ncould have reached the conclusion that Coach Marchand had authority\n\nto consent. As the players argue, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nlimits on the in loco parentis authority of school officials.     New\n\nJersey v.

The Validity of Coach Marchand's Consent\n\n               The players' second argument concerning the validity of\n\nMarchand's consent requires more discussion.

The officers argue that the law under\n\nSchneckloth was not clearly established; they contend that it was\n\nthe crowd, not the officers, who created any coercive atmosphere\n\nand that the coercion must \"emanat[e] from the police officers\n\nthemselves      rather   than    any    subjective    or    outside    influence.\"\n\nCiting the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v.

We reject this argument for two different\n\nreasons, but nonetheless find for other reasons that defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n            First, Connelly is not clearly established law limiting\n\nSchneckloth.   Second, taking the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiffs, the crowd was not the only source of potential\n\ncoercion.   It is clearly established law under Schneckloth that in\n\nconsidering    the   validity   of   consent,   all   the   surrounding\n\ncircumstances must be considered.       Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 227;\n\nVanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264.      Neither the Supreme Court nor this\n\ncourt has extended the rule in Connelly, a decision under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to Fourth Amendment\n\nconsent cases.\n\n            In Connelly, the defendant claimed that because he heard\n\na \"voice of God\" telling him to confess, his confession in police\n\ncustody was coerced and thus invalid.      Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170-\n\n171.   The Supreme Court held a defendant's mental condition \"by\n\nitself and apart from its relation to official coercion\" cannot\n\n\"dispose of the inquiry into constitutional 'voluntariness'\" under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.        Id. at 164.   It\n\nconcluded that \"coercive police activity is a necessary predicate\n\nto the finding that a confession is not 'voluntary'\" within the\n\nmeaning of that clause.     Id. at 167.    The Court did not address\n\nFourth Amendment searches.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f              We are unaware of any published circuit court decision\n\nthat applies this standard for voluntariness of a confession to\n\nquestions of consent under the Fourth Amendment.

In Schneckloth, the Supreme Court held that\n\ncoercion must be discerned by examining \"all the surrounding\n\ncircumstances,\" including \"subtly coercive police questions\" and\n\n\"the    possibly        vulnerable    subjective         state   of   the   person      who\n\nconsents.\"        Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229.

The first is United\n\nStates v.

In Drayton, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that among the relevant factors for assessing coercion\n\nis whether the officer requesting the search \"indicated a command\n\nto consent to the search.\"         Id. at 206.     The defendant's consent,\n\nthe Court held, was not a product of coercion because the officer\n\nhad provided him with \"no indication that he was required to\n\nconsent to the search.\"       Id.    The officers had asked whether the\n\ndefendant objected to the search, \"thus indicating to a reasonable\n\nperson that he or she was free to refuse.\"            Id.   The Court noted\n\nthat there had been \"no application of force, no intimidating\n\nmovement, no overwhelming show of force, no brandishing of weapons,\n\nno   blocking   of   exits,   no    threat,   no    command,   not   even   an\n\nauthoritative tone of voice.\"4        Id. at 204.\n\n           The second is Florida v.

Id. at 431. Although\n\n\n\n      4\n          Although this language derives from Drayton's analysis of\nwhether a seizure had occurred in that case, the Court noted that\n\"[i]n circumstances such as these, where the question of\nvoluntariness pervades both the search and seizure inquiries, the\nrespective analyses turn on very similar facts.\" United States v.\nDrayton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121153\"><a href=\"/opinion/121153/united-states-v-drayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (2002). The Court's analysis of whether\nthe defendant's consent was coerced invoked the factual discussion\nin its analysis of whether the defendant had been seized. Id.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fon its face Bostick is about whether the defendant was seized, it\n\nis relevant.    The Supreme Court's assessment of whether the police\n\nin Bostick seized the defendant turned on whether they had coerced\n\nhim to consent to a search.         Id. at 435-38.       It held that the\n\nappropriate    inquiry    was   whether,   under   the   circumstances,   \"a\n\nreasonable person would feel free to decline the officers' requests\n\nor otherwise terminate the encounter.\"        Id. at 436.    The Court held\n\nthat \"[w]here the encounter takes place is one factor, but it is\n\nnot the only one.\"       Id.\n\n           Against this articulation of the clearly established law,\n\nwe now turn to the facts of this case, taking all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the players.         The defendants have largely\n\naccepted the plaintiffs' version of the facts for purposes of this\n\nsummary judgment motion, but say that they would present their\n\ndifferent version of the facts at trial.\n\n           The players point to three factual circumstances in\n\narguing that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent was valid.           First, they note that\n\nCoach Marchand explicitly invoked his fear of the crowd, asking the\n\nofficers, \"what are they going to do to us[?]\" shortly before the\n\nofficers requested that Coach Marchand consent to a search of the\n\nplayers.      Second, the players note that the officers did not\n\nactively seek to disperse the crowd, but only told the crowd to\n\nquiet down.      Third, they note that the officers boxed in the\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fCentral Falls bus, which effectively ensured that it could not\n\nleave until the police decided it could leave.\n\n             Although     Coach    Marchand     may   have    subjectively       felt\n\ncoerced by the police and/or the crowd to give his consent, that is\n\nnot the focus of the qualified immunity inquiry. Rather, the focus\n\nis on the viewpoint of an objectively reasonable officer.                            We\n\ncannot   say    that    no     reasonably    competent    officer        would      have\n\nconcluded that Coach Marchand's consent was valid under clearly\n\nestablished Supreme Court case law. The players do not even allege\n\nthat the officers commanded Coach Marchand to consent to a search,\n\nand the facts do not suggest that they did.                   Nor do the players\n\nallege   that     the     officers   threatened       force    or   acted      in    an\n\nintimidating manner during their exchange with Coach Marchand and\n\nthe Coventry Athletic Director.             Indeed, Coach Marchand testified\n\nthat   the     officers      requested    the   search    politely       and     acted\n\ncourteously and professionally throughout their exchanges with him.\n\nThe players do not even allege that the officers spoke to Coach\n\nMarchand with \"an authoritative tone of voice\" when they requested\n\nto do a search.        See Drayton, 536 U.S. at 204.\n\n             Rather,     the    players'     evidence    depicts     a    difficult\n\nsituation in which Coach Marchand faced a genuine choice between\n\nimperfect solutions.           He could either consent to the search or\n\nrequire the police to pursue other legal paths if they wished to\n\nconduct one.      As Coach Marchand said, it was his decision and he\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fdecided \"to take the high road, to take the safe road.\"             Coach\n\nMarchand may have felt that the best way for him to get his players\n\nhome safely and promptly was to submit to a search.        He knew of the\n\nhostile crowd and was convinced that the players did not possess\n\nany of the purportedly missing items.          By the time the police\n\narrived, the Central Falls bus was already late going home, and\n\nCoach   Marchand   could   have   reasonably    believed    that   school\n\nadministrators and the players' parents were or would soon become\n\nworried about their whereabouts.\n\n          These circumstances do not establish that all reasonably\n\ncompetent officers would have concluded that Coach Marchand's will\n\nhad been overborne or that his capacity for self-determination was\n\ncritically impaired.   See Watson, 423 U.S. at 424.        Indeed, Coach\n\nMarchand testified that he \"debated\" telling the officers to get a\n\nsearch warrant, but rejected that option.       Instead, he concluded\n\nthat his role as coach was to ensure first and foremost that the\n\nplayers got home safely. A choice between undesirable options does\n\nnot itself mean the choice was coerced and the consent given was\n\ninvoluntary.   Like the officers in Drayton, the officers posed\n\ntheir search request as a question and did not make any showing\n\nthat it could not be refused.       We cannot say that a reasonably\n\ncompetent officer could only have concluded that Coach Marchand had\n\nno option but to consent due to coercion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f          The factual details the players emphasize, addressed\n\nwithin the totality of the circumstances, do not demand a contrary\n\nconclusion.   Coach Marchand's question, \"what are they going to do\n\nto us[?],\" would have alerted reasonable officers of his concerns\n\nabout the situation. It may also be that reasonable officers would\n\nhave recognized that the perceived threat from the crowd influenced\n\nCoach Marchand's decision.   This does not mean, however, that all\n\nofficers of reasonable competence would have concluded that Coach\n\nMarchand's will had been overborne.     As Coach Marchand testified,\n\nhe considered refusing the search and telling the officers to get\n\na warrant.\n\n          As to the officers' efforts to subdue the crowd, by the\n\ntime the officers spoke with Coach Marchand, they had restrained\n\nthe crowd, told crowd members to cut it out, and established a\n\nbuffer between the crowd and the bus.    It may be that the officers\n\nwould have done better to disperse the crowd altogether. This does\n\nnot mean, however, that the officers are not entitled to immunity.\n\nThe officers could have reasonably thought that they made clear\n\nthat they would prevent the crowd from harming the players as of\n\nthe time they asked Coach Marchand to consent to the search.\n\n          As to the police cruisers, the officers parked in a way\n\nthat boxed in the bus before they became aware of the specific\n\nsituation unfolding around it.    The record is silent on whether\n\nalternatives were available.   More importantly, the officers did\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fnot convey to Coach Marchand that they would not move their\n\ncruisers until he agreed to a search.          Nor were they asked to move\n\nthe cruisers.\n\n            It is true that in a case concerning an involuntary\n\nseizure of a person, the Supreme Court used language that the\n\npolice offered the person \"no choice.\"           Kaupp v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127919\"><a href=\"/opinion/127919/kaupp-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (2003).      But the circumstances there were a far cry from\n\nthe choice Coach Marchand faced.              In Kaupp an adolescent was\n\nrousted out of bed in the middle of the night wearing nothing but\n\nunderwear, placed in handcuffs, and taken to a crime scene on his\n\nway   to   be   interviewed    at   law   enforcement    headquarters.   His\n\nstatement of \"Okay\" in response to \"we need to go and talk\" was\n\nclearly not consent.          See id. at 631-32.        Nothing of that sort\n\nhappened here, nor would a reasonable officer have thought it did.\n\n            On the plaintiffs' version of the facts, we cannot say\n\nthat all officers of reasonable competence would have concluded\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent to the search was invalid.           It is not\n\nenough that Coach Marchand described his consent to the search as\n\ncoerced; coercion has a specific legal meaning.               Even if Coach\n\nMarchand felt his consent was coerced within that specific legal\n\nmeaning, this would not be sufficient to overcome the officers'\n\nassertion of qualified immunity.             While a jury might find that\n\nCoach Marchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced, that\n\nis not the issue here; we must look to the view of the reasonable\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fofficer.

They also claim that the officers sought to incite the crowd\n\nby displaying some of the players' iPods and cell phones.            But\n\ntestimony from both Coach Marchand and the players contradicts the\n\ninference that racial animus motivated the officers.          No officer\n\nuttered a racial slur.       It is uncontested that the officers acted\n\ncourteously and told members of the crowd to stop jeering at the\n\nplayers.    There is no evidence that all officers of reasonable\n\ncompetence would have believed the search was undertaken because of\n\nthe national origin or race of the players.\n\n            Given this conclusion, the players also cannot defeat the\n\nofficers' qualified immunity defenses against their claims under\n\nRhode    Island's   Racial    Profiling   Prevention   Act   and   Ethnic\n\nIntimidation Statute.    The Racial Profiling Prevention Act covers\n\n\"disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in\n\npart, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual,\" with an\n\nexception not relevant here.

I agree\n\nwith my colleagues that a reasonable officer could have believed\n\nthat Coach Marchand had in loco parentis authority to consent to\n\nthe search of the players and that their equal protection claims\n\nmust fail.    My colleagues and I part company, however, on the issue\n\nof   qualified   immunity.    Because       I   cannot   subscribe    to   the\n\nmajority’s    determination   that    the   officers     were   entitled    to\n\nqualified immunity because they could reasonably have believed that\n\nCoach Marchand voluntarily consented to the search of his students,\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             The appellants, a team of young Hispanic soccer players\n\nfrom Central Falls, Rhode Island were subjected to shockingly\n\ndisgraceful and humiliating conduct by the police and their fellow\n\ncitizens alike while visiting another high school in Coventry,\n\nRhode Island.5    After playing a tense game against Coventry’s team,\n\nthe Central Falls players were surrounded by a mob seething with\n\nracial animosity and casting false accusations of theft.             When the\n\npolice arrived and observed the crowd's obstruction of the bus,\n\nthey parked their cruisers in front of and behind the Central Falls\n\nteam’s bus, trapping them with their antagonists.               Then, rather\n\nthan take any action to meaningfully investigate any accusations or\n\n\n\n      5\n          The record reflects that the Central Falls players were\nbi-lingual.\n\n                                 -32-\n\fpacify   the    crowd,    which   continued    to    simmer    menacingly,      the\n\nofficers questioned the Central Falls team and sought its coach’s\n\npermission to search their belongings.\n\n           My colleagues think that a reasonable officer would be\n\nunaware of the duress this state of affairs would inspire in the\n\nteam’s coach.     In my view, however, the officers’ request of Coach\n\nMarchand while he was surrounded by an angry mob and unable to\n\ndepart with his players left little room for choice.                         He was\n\nsubjected to coercion which, though subtler than a peremptory\n\ncommand and more courteous than the irate mob, could hardly be\n\nplainer.       This    coercion   vitiated    any   consent     he   could    give,\n\nrendering the subsequent search unlawful.\n\n           The basic factual scenario is not largely disputed by the\n\nparties and my colleagues and I recognize that all reasonable\n\ninferences     drawn    from   the   facts   are    to   be   construed   in    the\n\nplaintiffs' favor.6       Maj.

It has long been recognized that the\n\nFourth Amendment bars all warrantless searches “subject only to a\n\nfew specifically established . . . exceptions” such as the presence\n\nof probable cause, exigent circumstances, or valid consent.

Accordingly, absent such an exception to the warrant\n\nrequirement the officers' search of the Central Falls players was\n\nimproper and a clear violation of the players' constitutional right\n\nto be free from warrantless searches.\n\n          The officers rely only upon Coach Marchand’s consent to\n\nvalidate their search.

Because, as discussed below, I believe\n\nthat a reasonable officer would have known that Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent to the search of his players was coerced, the first prong\n\nof the qualified immunity test is easily satisfied: there was an\n\nactual violation in the form of an unconstitutional search.\n\n                                        B.\n\n           The second prong of the qualified immunity inquiry asks\n\nwhether   it   was    clear,    both   legally       and   factually,       that    the\n\nofficers’ search was non-consensual.             Raiche, 623 F.3d at 35.            My\n\ncolleagues and I agree that it is clearly established under the\n\nFourth Amendment that voluntary consent is required to validate a\n\nsuspicionless,       warrantless    search     and    that    \"all       officers   of\n\nreasonable competence would have known that coercion vitiates\n\nconsent to a search under the Fourth Amendment.\"                    Maj. Op. at 17.\n\nWe also agree that the presence of coercion is determined by an\n\nopen-ended     test      that      considers         “‘all        the    surrounding\n\ncircumstances,’ including ‘subtly coercive police questions’ and\n\n‘the   possibly   vulnerable       subjective     state      of    the    person    who\n\nconsents.’” Maj. Op. at 19 (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229).\n\nWhere we disagree is whether the facts of this particular case,\n\napplied to that law, clearly make out a violation of the players’\n\nFourth Amendment rights.           Ultimately, my colleagues \"cannot say\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\fthat all officers of reasonable competence,\" confronted with the\n\nfacts of this case,    \"would have concluded that Coach Marchand's\n\nconsent to the search was invalid.\"           Maj. Op. at 26.        On the\n\ncontrary, I believe that the players’ rights were violated, and\n\nthat a reasonable officer would have concluded that the search was\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n                                    1.\n\n           In analyzing the second prong of the qualified immunity\n\ntest we must ask whether a reasonable officer in the defendants’\n\nposition would have known that Coach Marchand felt coerced into\n\nconsenting to the search.      The central question, then, is how the\n\nreasonable   officer   would   have   assessed    the   voluntariness    of\n\nMarchand’s consent.\n\n           As we have explained, “[v]oluntariness is a question of\n\nfact that turns on [a] comprehensive assessment of the totality of\n\nthe    circumstances   attending      the    interaction   between     [the\n\nindividual] and the searching officers.”          Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at\n\n264.

Drayton,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121153\"><a href=\"/opinion/121153/united-states-v-drayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).    In Drayton, three police officers boarded a\n\nbus as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction.         One\n\nofficer was at the front of the bus, facing the rear, and another\n\nofficer was at the rear of the bus, facing forward.       The third\n\nofficer walked down the bus aisle from the back to the front,\n\nstopping to speak with passengers along the way. Neither the aisle\n\nnor the front exit was ever blocked.     Passengers who declined to\n\nspeak with the officer or who chose to exit the bus were allowed to\n\ndo so.   As the officer approached Drayton's seat, he showed his\n\nbadge and stated that his purpose on the bus was to look for drugs\n\nand guns.    The officer asked if Drayton and his companion, Brown,\n\nhad any bags.    They answered affirmatively, so the officer asked\n\n\n                                -39-\n\ffor permission to search the bags.         Brown agreed and no contraband\n\nwas found.    The officer then asked if he could conduct a patdown of\n\nBrown.    He agreed and was arrested after the patdown revealed\n\ncontraband.     The same is true of Drayton.                 A further search\n\nrevealed that both individuals had cocaine taped between their\n\nshorts.     Drayton and Brown were charged with federal drug crimes\n\nand moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that their consent\n\nto the patdown search was invalid.         The Supreme Court held that the\n\ndefendants’ consent was not a product of coercion because, among\n\nother reasons, there had been \"no threat, no command, [and] not\n\neven an authoritative tone of voice.\"           Id. at 204.\n\n             Relying on Drayton, my colleagues place great stock in\n\nthe politeness with which the officers interacted with Coach\n\nMarchand and the students.7        Without a doubt, had the officers\n\ncommanded     Marchand    to   submit,     or   acted   in    a   threatening,\n\ndomineering, boorish, or otherwise inappropriate way, this case\n\nwould be easier.         But the fact that the officers were polite,\n\nparticularly given all else that was occurring at the highly\n\ncharged scene, does not establish that Marchand was not coerced.\n\nThe Supreme Court has explained that subtle and polite coercion is\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Though I would hardly describe the decision to conduct an\ninvasive search of the players in front of a hostile, jeering,\nphoto-taking crowd as “polite,” the players do not appear to\nchallenge this characterization.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fjust as objectionable as more obvious browbeating.     Schneckloth,\n\n412 U.S. at 228.\n\n          Furthermore, we have admonished courts to “go beyond\n\nappearances and inquire whether the consent was a voluntary,\n\nintentional and understood waiver of a known right, or, on the\n\ncontrary, was the product of deceit, duress and coercion, actual or\n\nimplicit.\" United States v. Berkowitz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291391\"><a href=\"/opinion/291391/united-states-v-samuel-berkowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 925 (1st Cir.\n\n1970)(internal quotation marks omitted).    The \"beyond appearances\"\n\ninquiry is particularly important here: though the police may have\n\nbeen polite and refrained from issuing commands in an authoritative\n\ntone of voice, they nonetheless blocked the bus in, leaving the\n\nplayers no way out, essentially \"appeas[ing] the masses\" who were\n\n\"crying for [the players'] heads.”         Maj. Op. at 6 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also infra at 12-15. Ultimately, the\n\nofficers’ demeanor can be but one factor in our analysis, and\n\ncertainly “not the only one.”    Florida v. Bostick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112631\"><a href=\"/opinion/112631/florida-v-bostick/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n437 (1991).\n\n          Similarly, although the majority is correct that the\n\nofficers’ failure to notify Marchand that he could refuse to\n\nconsent is not dispositive, Maj. Op. at 20, it is yet one more\n\nfactor of the many in this narrative that, taken together, militate\n\nagainst qualified immunity in this case. See Schneckloth, 412 U.S.\n\nat 227 (“[T]he failure of the police to advise the accused of his\n\nrights [is] certainly [a] factor[] to be evaluated in assessing the\n\n\n                                -41-\n\f‘voluntariness’ of [his] [consent] . . . .”); see also Drayton, 536\n\nU.S. at 202 (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 432)(explaining that one\n\nfactor \"particularly worth noting\" when considering whether consent\n\nto   search     was     coerced   was   that    the   officer    had    advised   the\n\npassenger of his right to refuse to consent).\n\n               Like the issue of politeness and failure to warn an\n\nindividual of his right to refuse consent, police custody is yet\n\nanother factor worthy of consideration.                Watson, 423 U.S. at 424.\n\nTrue, \"custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate\n\n. . . coerced . . . consent to search,\" 423 U.S. at 424, but we\n\nhave       previously    observed   that   \"sensitivity     to    the    heightened\n\npossibility of coercion is appropriate when a[n] [individual's]\n\nconsent is obtained during custody,\" United States v.

This alone distinguishes our case from Drayton,\n\nwhich involved “no blocking of exits.”                   536 U.S. at 204. In\n\nDrayton, even though there was an officer at the front of the bus,\n\n\"he said nothing to suggest that people could not exit and . . .\n\n\n\n       8\n          There is no need to determine whether Marchand was in\nlegal custody. By \"custody\" I refer only to the factual scenario\nby which the bus was blocked in by police cruisers, effectively\nblocking any means of exit for the plaintiffs.\n\n                                         -42-\n\fleft the aisle clear.\"       Id. at 205.     This is significantly\n\ndifferent from the facts of the present case where the players' bus\n\nwas completely boxed in by patrol cars.      Surely, no reasonable\n\nofficer could have believed that the plaintiffs felt free to leave.\n\n            Of course, it may be true that the officers trapped the\n\nplayers with the crowd before they were aware of the nature of the\n\ncontroversy and of the danger, fear, and concomitant coercion they\n\nwould cause by doing so.   See Maj. Op. at 25.   But this is beside\n\nthe point: at the time the officers sought Marchand's permission to\n\nsearch the players a reasonable officer would certainly have been\n\naware, at that crucial moment, that the positioning of their\n\ncruisers left the players with no way out.   Cf. Terry v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1968) (explaining in analogous context that in\n\nevaluating the reasonableness of a search or seizure, courts look\n\nto the state of the facts \"at the moment of the seizure or the\n\nsearch\").    Regardless, Marchand’s fearful inquiry of the officers\n\nin response to their request for consent (“[w]hat [is the crowd]\n\ngoing to do to us?”) should have made apparent the fear elicited in\n\nhim by being blocked in with the crowd.\n\n            The majority states that \"[t]he officers could have\n\nreasonably thought that they made clear [to Coach Marchand] that\n\nthey would   prevent the crowd from harming [his] players . . . .\"\n\nMaj. Op. at 25.    This conclusion is incredible - particularly in\n\nlight of the fact that the officers never responded to Marchand's\n\n\n                                -43-\n\finitial inquiry regarding the crowd's behavior. In addition, there\n\nwere only four officers on the scene, yet they were responsible for\n\ncontrolling an angry, boisterous, irrational crowd of approximately\n\nfifty to sixty people.          With a mere six to ten feet buffer between\n\nthe    hostile    crowd   and    the   players,   I   cannot   fathom   how   any\n\nreasonable officer would think that the defendants made clear to\n\nCoach Marchand that he and his players would go unharmed. The\n\nmajority points out that \"the officers did not convey to Coach\n\nMarchand that they would not move their cruisers until he agreed to\n\na search\" and that the officers “were [not] . . . asked to move the\n\ncruisers.\"       Maj. Op. at 26.       That may very well be the case,        but\n\nso too is the converse - the officers never offered nor took any\n\naction to move their cruisers on their own before soliciting Coach\n\nMarchand's permission.\n\n            Nevertheless, Marchand's fearful inquiry shows that he\n\nfelt threatened and intimidated by the crowd.                That Marchand did\n\nnot translate his fear and intimidation of the crowd into a\n\nparticularized request - for example, by asking the officers to\n\nmove their cruisers or asking if there were any other options other\n\nthan consenting to a search of his players - does not eliminate\n\nthis    factor    from    consideration.       As     the   Supreme   Court   has\n\nexplained, “the crucial test is whether, taking into account all of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct\n\nwould have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fliberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.”\n\nBostick, 501 U.S. at 437 (emphasis added)(internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Any officer should have recognized that Coach Marchand\n\ndid not feel at liberty to leave.\n\n            The majority acknowledges that \"the players' evidence\n\ndepicts a difficult situation in which Coach Marchand faced a\n\ngenuine choice between imperfect solutions,\"           Maj. Op. at 23, but\n\nnonetheless decides that \"these circumstances do not establish . .\n\n. that Coach Marchand's will had been overborne or that his\n\ncapacity for self-determination was critically impaired.\"              Id. at\n\n24.   To support this conclusion the majority notes that Coach\n\nMarchand testified at his deposition that he \"'debated' telling the\n\nofficers to get a search warrant, but rejected that option,\" after\n\nweighing    his   alternatives,   Maj.    Op.    at   24,   and    ultimately\n\n“concluded that his role as coach was to ensure first and foremost\n\nthat [his] players got home safely”         Id.       But Coach Marchand’s\n\nthought    process,   and   the   actions   he    “debated”       taking,   are\n\ncompletely irrelevant.      Marchand's testimony was given after the\n\nfact and was not communicated to any officer at the scene of the\n\nincident.    The hypothetical reasonable officer cannot read minds;\n\ntherefore, in analyzing whether such an officer would have known\n\nthat Coach Marchand's consent was coerced, it is simply common\n\nsense that only facts actually communicated to or observed by the\n\nofficer are relevant.\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\f          My colleagues are apparently of two minds on this issue:\n\nthough they initially rely on Marchand’s uncorroborated description\n\nof his internal thought process in an effort to negate the coercion\n\nhe suffered, they later recognize that his subjective, unexpressed\n\nthoughts and feelings are irrelevant when dismissing Marchand’s\n\ntestimony that he felt coerced into consenting. see Maj. Op. at 26\n\n(\"It is not enough that Coach Marchand described his consent to the\n\nsearch as coerced; . . . [w]hile a jury might find that Coach\n\nMarchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced that is not\n\nthe issue here; we must look to the view of the reasonable\n\nofficer.\").   As I have previously discussed, Marchand's objective\n\nmanifestations   of   coercion   were    amply   supported   by   evidence\n\navailable to the officers.       In analyzing the coercive atmosphere\n\nunder which Marchand gave his consent, I would consider only those\n\nfacts available to a reasonable officer at the time of the search.\n\n          If more were needed, and I doubt that there is, the\n\nofficers exacerbated the situation by “ma[king] little to no effort\n\nto quell or disperse the crowd, even as [it] verbally assailed the\n\nplayers[,] shouting racist epithets and accusations of theft.”\n\nLopera v. Town of Coventry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2371527\"><a href=\"/opinion/2371527/lopera-v-town-of-coventry/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (D.R.I. 2009).\n\nWith the possibly violent assembly looming, the officers questioned\n\nMarchand. Taking the crowd’s word over Marchand’s, they elected to\n\npursue a search of the Central Falls students before adequately\n\n\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fcalming   the   mob   or   even   ascertaining   what,   if    anything,   had\n\nactually been stolen.\n\n            My colleagues, in further reliance on Drayton, note that\n\nthere was no testimony that the request to search was made in “an\n\nauthoritative tone of voice.”        Maj. Op. at 23 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       But tone of voice cannot be dispositive of the\n\ncoercion inquiry.      Al Capone said you can get more with a kind word\n\nand a gun than with just a kind word; a mob can be just as\n\n“convincing” as a gun.\n\n            The officers knew that Marchand felt threatened by the\n\ncrowd.      They knew he had already capitulated to the intense\n\ncoercion and intimidation exerted by the mob, delaying his team’s\n\ndeparture for about a half-hour to engage in a search that he knew\n\nbeforehand would be futile in order to satisfy the crowd’s demands.\n\nStill, the officers did practically nothing to assuage that fear or\n\nmitigate the coercion, and indeed kept the players’ bus trapped\n\nwith the crowd for more than ten minutes before capitalizing on\n\nMarchand’s weakened state to elicit consent for a duplicative\n\nsearch.   Without a doubt, such behavior is contrary to the general\n\nrecognition that police officers have a duty to protect the public\n\nand public safety.     See, e.g.,    Bordanaro v. McLeod, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520992\"><a href=\"/opinion/520992/rose-bordanaro-v-john-mcleod-appeal-of-city-of-everett-edward-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1164 (1st Cir. 1989)(referencing district court's assertion in\n\nexcessive    force    case   that   \"the    primary   duty    of   the   police\n\n\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\fdepartments and policemen is to protect and preserve life and\n\nproperty and the public peace\")(emphasis added).\n\n            It is inappropriate to create an artificial dichotomy\n\nbetween the coercion applied by the officers and that applied by\n\nthe crowd they failed to adequately control, and then to omit the\n\nlatter from consideration.
