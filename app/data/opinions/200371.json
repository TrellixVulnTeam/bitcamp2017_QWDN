The facts underlying this section\n\n2255 action, recounted in detail in prior opinions,1 can be briefly\n\nsummarized. About eight years ago, on January 25, 1995, a shooting\n\noccurred in the early morning hours in Boston, and there ensued a\n\npolice chase of several suspects in a Lexus. Eventually, the Lexus\n\nwas trapped in a dead-end street.       Pulling up on the left side of\n\nthe Lexus--the first of many pursuing police vehicles--was an\n\nunmarked police car with two plainclothes officers.        One of the\n\nofficers, Michael Cox, ran from the car after a suspect named\n\nRobert Brown who was fleeing on foot from the Lexus toward a fence\n\nto the right of the Lexus.\n\n          By this time other police cars were arriving, pulling in\n\nnext to and behind the Lexus.      In this line was a car driven by\n\nOfficer Richard Walker; behind him was one containing Officer\n\nKenneth Conley and his partner.    According to later testimony, Cox\n\nchased Brown to the fence and grabbed at Brown but Brown got over.\n\nAs Cox stood at the fence, he was brutally attacked and beaten by\n\nother arriving police officers who thought he was one of the\n\nsuspects (and who also thought, wrongly, that a policeman had been\n\nshot).   The assaulting officers discovered their mistake and\n\ndispersed, leaving Cox badly injured.\n\n\n     1\n      United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Conley\nI\"), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000); United States v. Conley,\n103 F. Supp. 2d 45 (D. Mass. 2000) (\"Conley II\"); United States v.\nConley, 249 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Conley III\"); Conley v.\nUnited States, 164 F. Supp. 2d 216 (D. Mass. 2001) (\"Conley IV\").\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            In   April   1997,   a    federal     grand    jury   began   an\n\ninvestigation into the assault.       Cox had not seen the officers who\n\nbeat him and, although many officers had been at the scene,\n\ninformation was not readily provided.           In due course, Conley was\n\ncalled before the grand jury.    Conley testified that he had seen no\n\none beating Cox; that he had himself pursued Brown to the fence;\n\nthat he had seen no one between him and Brown and no one grabbing\n\nat Brown; that he had pursued Brown on the other side of the fence;\n\nand that after a chase of about a mile, he had caught and arrested\n\nBrown.     There is little doubt that Conley did chase and catch\n\nBrown, but prosecutors did not believe the rest of his story.\n\n            In August 1997, the grand jury indicted Conley for\n\nperjury and obstructing justice--in substance, for denying that he\n\nsaw Cox pursue Brown to the fence and for denying that he saw Cox\n\nbeing beaten.    18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1623 (2000).          At Conley's trial\n\nin June 1998, three witnesses for the government (Cox, Brown and\n\nWalker) testified that Cox chased Brown to the fence and grabbed at\n\nBrown unsuccessfully as Brown scaled it.            Brown also said that\n\nafter he landed, he saw Conley through the fence and saw other\n\nofficers (but not Conley) beating Cox.          He also identified Conley\n\nas the officer who had chased and arrested him.             Conley did not\n\ntestify.\n\n            The jury convicted Conley of lying, and of obstructing\n\njustice, in testifying that he had seen no one else pursuing Brown\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fto the fence; as for the charge that Conley had lied in denying\n\nseeing Cox being beaten, the jury acquitted Conley.             Conley was\n\nsentenced to just under three years in prison.           The sentence was\n\nstayed, and to date Conley has not served any of this sentence.           No\n\npoliceman was indicted or convicted of the beating, although three\n\nofficers--but not Conley--were found liable to Cox in a civil trial\n\nfollowing Conley's criminal trial.\n\n           On   direct   appeal,   this   court   in   1999   affirmed   the\n\nconviction.     Conley I, 186 F.3d at 26.         After the affirmance,\n\nConley in early 2000 moved for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33.   Conley identified a number of pieces of evidence that he\n\nclaimed were either newly discovered or wrongly withheld by the\n\nprosecution.     Most of the evidence would have been useful (if\n\nuseful at all) to impeach Officer Walker and--in one instance--\n\nBrown.    One other piece of evidence, comprising the civil trial\n\ntestimony of a security guard named Charles Bullard who was riding\n\nwith Cox, might (in Conley's view) have suggested that Cox could\n\nhave ended up behind Conley during the chase to the fence.\n\n           Under Rule 33, a new trial in \"the interests of justice\"\n\nmay be granted liberally on a motion made \"within 7 days\" after the\n\nverdict; but, thereafter, it can be granted solely for newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence (and then only on a motion made within three\n\nyears).   Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.       Further, under the case law, the\n\ndefendant who makes such a motion after seven days bears the heavy\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fburden of showing that the evidence would probably result in an\n\nacquittal upon retrial.     United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017,\n\n1019 (1st Cir. 1980).   But if the new evidence was wrongly withheld\n\nby the government in violation of its obligations under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), it is enough to show that the\n\nevidence undermines confidence in the verdict.     Kyles v. Whitley,\n\n514 U.S. 419, 435 (1995).\n\n          In its decision on the Rule 33 motion in June 2000, the\n\ndistrict court discussed the alleged new evidence at some length\n\nand concluded that material new evidence had first become available\n\nto defense counsel only after trial, Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n51-58; the court was less clear as to whether any had been wrongly\n\nwithheld in violation of Brady.        Id. at 51-52, 54-55.   In any\n\nevent, it ordered a new trial in \"the interests of justice,\"\n\nwithout finding prejudice under either Wright or Brady. Id. at 58.\n\nSomewhat cryptically, the district court stated in conclusion:\n\n          I conclude that the answer to the second\n          question   stated   above   [the   extent   of\n          prejudice] cannot be determined as a matter of\n          law, under . . . [Wright and Brady]. Instead,\n          in the unique circumstances of this case, I\n          conclude that the determination to allow or\n          not to allow a new trial is one committed to\n          an exercise of discretion by the court to\n          which the legal system assigns responsibility\n          for making the determination.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n          On appeal by the government, this court held in May 2001\n\nthat because the motion for a new trial was made more than seven\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdays after the verdict, the district court could not use the\n\ngeneral \"interests of justice\" standard in Rule 33 to bypass the\n\nestablished Wright and Brady prejudice requirements.    Conley III,\n\n249 F.3d at 46.   We understandably said that there was no need for\n\nus to analyze the evidence ourselves under Wright and Brady or to\n\nremand for the district court to do so; our reason was that we read\n\nthe district court's \"as a matter of law\" statement quoted above as\n\nits own ruling that the Wright and Brady tests had not been met.\n\nId.\n\n          Conley then filed the present motion in the district\n\ncourt under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000), based (more or less) on the\n\nsame newly-discovered evidence.    In September 2001, the district\n\ncourt granted the section 2255 motion, setting aside the conviction\n\nand ordering a new trial.   Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 223-24.\n\nIn doing so, the district court said that it was applying the\n\nWright test, which it deemed to have been mandated by this court's\n\nearlier decision on the Rule 33 motion.   Id. at 222.   The district\n\ncourt found expressly that the new evidence was so powerful that it\n\nwould probably cause an acquittal on retrial.     Id. at 223.   The\n\ndistrict court never reached Conley's Brady claim because it found\n\nthat a new trial was required under Wright.   Id. at 222.\n\n          On the government's appeal, a divided panel of this court\n\nagain reversed the district court.    The panel majority said that\n\nthe district court had decided in its earlier Rule 33 decision\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f(Conley II) that the Wright and Brady standards could not be\n\nsatisfied and that, on review (in Conley III), this court had\n\ndeclined    to   remand,   ruling   that   the   sentence   should   now   be\n\nexecuted.    The panel majority therefore held that the district\n\ncourt's ruling on the section 2255 motion was inconsistent with the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine.      Again, the panel declined to address on\n\nthe merits Conley's new evidence claims under Wright and Brady.\n\n            The en banc court then granted Conley's petition for\n\nrehearing, withdrawing (as is customary) the panel decision.               We\n\nnow hold that the law of the case doctrine has no application here\n\nand also that Brady but not Wright applies to new evidence claims\n\nmade in a section 2255 motion.             This leads us to vacate the\n\ndistrict court's section 2255 decision and to remand so that Conley\n\ncan obtain a ruling on his Brady claim.          We decline to decide the\n\nBrady claim ourselves in the first instance.\n\n            We start with the law of the case doctrine on which the\n\ngovernment continues to rely.       The law of the case doctrine has two\n\nbranches: one provides that, subject to exceptions, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 251 (1st Cir. 1993), a court must\n\nrespect and follow its own rulings made at a prior stage in the\n\nsame case; the other branch--sometimes known as the mandate rule--\n\nfar more stringently precludes a lower court from contravening the\n\nrulings of a higher court made at an earlier stage of the same\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcontroversy.2 The difference is cogently described in our recent\n\ndecision in Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 646-48 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          At the time that we decided Conley III, our reading of\n\nthe district court's Rule 33 decision there under review (Conley\n\nII) was surely a plausible one.    The district court had made clear\n\nin its own decision that it was not making a prejudice finding\n\nunder Wright or Brady (\"cannot be determined as a matter of law\")\n\nand it invoked \"the unique circumstances of this case\" to justify\n\nan \"exercise of discretion\" to grant a new trial--without reliance\n\nupon Wright or Brady.   Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 58.   If there\n\nwere prejudice under Wright and Brady--one might ask--why would the\n\ndistrict court have invented its own standard?         And, if the\n\ndistrict court had decided the Wright and Brady issues in Conley\n\nII, law of the case doctrine would constrain its ability to revisit\n\nthe issues now.\n\n          Yet the district court does not think its own opinion in\n\nConley II was intended to resolve the Wright and Brady issues.\n\nInvoking Wright, the district court now reaches a result opposite\n\nto the one we attributed to its Conley II decision; and nothing\n\nsuggests that the district court regards this as a contradiction of\n\n\n\n     2\n      Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983); NLRB v.\nGoodless Bros. Elec. Co., 285 F.3d 102, 107 (1st Cir. 2002); Knapp\nShoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., 72 F.3d 190, 197-98 (1st\nCir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1245 (1996).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fConley II.3       Of course, the district court knows better than we do\n\nwhat it originally meant in Conley II.             See Garrity v. Sununu, 752\n\nF.2d 727, 731 n.4 (1st Cir. 1984).           In hindsight, it is now clear\n\nthat Conley II's language--on which we relied in Conley III--is\n\nambiguous as to whether it represented a finding of no prejudice\n\nunder Wright and Brady.\n\n                What the district court said in Conley II was that the\n\nanswer to the prejudice question under Wright and Brady \"cannot be\n\ndetermined as a matter of law . . . .\"          Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 58.      Although in Conley III we understandably read this to mean\n\nthat there was no such prejudice, the phrase \"as a matter of law\"\n\ncan be used to say that an issue is not susceptible to being\n\nresolved on the existing record and that an evidentiary hearing or\n\nadditional information is needed for its resolution.                  See, e.g.,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).            This is probably the most plausible\n\nreading, for it reconciles the district court's decision in Conley\n\nII with its latest decision.\n\n                This leads us to conclude that the district court's\n\nlatest decision does not impermissibly contradict its own earlier\n\nruling in Conley II: having been told by this court in Conley III\n\nthat       it   could   not   create   its   own     standard   for     \"unique\"\n\n\n\n       3\n      The district court's newest opinion does make a passing\nreference to additional new evidence, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at\n221, but it does not describe any new evidence, let alone hold that\nit is new evidence that tips the balance.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fcircumstances, it has now simply decided an issue (Wright) that it\n\nbypassed in its earlier decision.         But the fact remains that we\n\nourselves in Conley III read Conley II as deciding that prejudice\n\nunder    Wright   and   Brady   could   not   be   established.   Is   our\n\nassumption--even if now seen to be mistaken--itself binding on the\n\ndistrict court under the mandate-rule branch of law of the case?\n\n            One might argue that a prior assumption by an appellate\n\ncourt as to what the district court meant should not be treated as\n\nlaw of the case, which is normally understood as directed to\n\nsubstantive legal rulings.       But an interpretation of a lower court\n\ndecision can be as much a contested issue as the interpretation of\n\na contract.   We are reluctant to agree that such an interpretation\n\n--at least if it was fully litigated and not merely assumed en\n\npassant, see Platoro, Ltd. v. Unidentified Remains of Vessel, 695\n\nF.2d 893, 898 n.4 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 818 (1983)--is\n\nexempt from normal law of the case doctrine.4           There is a better\n\nreason for refusing to perpetuate what now seems to have been a\n\nmistake.\n\n\n\n     4\n      Whether the issue was fully litigated in Conley III could be\ndisputed. The government said that the district court had ruled in\nConley II that no prejudice existed; Conley's counsel urged--much\nless plausibly--that the district court's \"discretionary\" grant of\na new trial rested in substance on Wright or Brady.             The\npossibility that the district court was simply bypassing Wright and\nBrady seems not to have been argued by anyone, perhaps because it\nwould have justified a remand where both sides wished to prevail\noutright--Conley by affirmance and the government by outright\nreversal.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          Law of the case is not a straitjacket but can be avoided\n\n--at the direction of the court that made the invoked ruling--on\n\nseveral different bases.     Ellis, 313 F.3d at 647-48.      Two of the\n\ngrounds permitting a deviation from law of the case are where there\n\nhas been a change in prevailing law or where there is new evidence\n\non the question at issue.     Id.     For example, in United States v.\n\nRobinson, 690 F.2d 869, 872-73 (11th Cir. 1982), the Eleventh\n\nCircuit revisited its own prior reliance on a magistrate judge's\n\nfinding after the latter clarified and expanded upon his ruling.5\n\n          Whether    one   characterizes   the   district   court's   new\n\ndecision as new law or new evidence, it is certainly a new\n\ncircumstance justifying a fresh look by us at the question whether\n\nthe district court previously resolved the Wright and Brady claims\n\non the merits. Having reexamined the matter, we think the district\n\ncourt has not so resolved them, despite our earlier assumption that\n\nit had.   It is equally clear that this court has never decided\n\nthose claims on the merits; instead, we adverted briefly to some of\n\nthe issues raised.    Conley III, 249 F.3d at 43, 46-47.\n\n          This brings us to the substance of the district court's\n\nsection 2255 decision.     In a nutshell, the district court ruled on\n\nthis go-around that \"a new trial is to be allowed under the Wright\n\n\n\n     5\n      Other circuits are in accord on the general principle. See\nBenson v. SI Handling Sys., Inc., 188 F.3d 780, 783 (7th Cir.\n1999); Browning v. Navarro, 887 F.2d 553, 556 (5th Cir. 1989);\nUnited States v. Cirami, 563 F.2d 26 (2d Cir. 1977).\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftest, and because this determination controls the judgment to be\n\nordered, I do not consider further the Brady test.\"   Conley IV, 164\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 222.     It then found that the newly discovered\n\nevidence \"would have greatly enhanced\" the defense case; that it\n\n\"strikes at the heart of the prosecution's case\"; and that Conley\n\nhad shown \"a probable result of acquittal in a new trial.\"   Id. at\n\n223.\n\n           The problem is that new evidence claims under Wright are\n\ncognizable grounds of relief only in post-trial motions for a new\n\ntrial and not under habeas or its section 2255 surrogate. Powerful\n\nnew evidence of innocence can satisfy one of the new \"gatekeeper\"\n\nrequirements for bringing a \"second or successive\" section 2255\n\nmotion, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255; but a traditional habeas ground is\n\nrequired once one gets through the gate.   Merely to claim that new\n\nevidence casts doubt, even grave doubt, on the correctness of a\n\nconviction is not a ground for relief on collateral attack.     See\n\nHerrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 400 (1993); United States v.\n\nEvans, 224 F.3d 670, 673-74 (7th Cir. 2000).6\n\n           Conceivably, the Wright claim could be reawakened if we\n\nwithdrew sua sponte our mandate in Conley III, an issue we asked\n\n\n\n       6\n      It is not clear whether a habeas claim could be based on new\nevidence proving actual innocence, see Herrera, 506 U.S. at 417;\nbut Conley is not close to such a showing. At best, the newly-\ndiscovered evidence, adding everything together, simply increases--\nhow much is debatable--the likelihood that at a new trial a jury\nmight find reasonable doubt of guilt and so acquit.\n\n                               -12-\n\fthe parties to brief.          Although this course might first appear to\n\nbe at odds with Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 554-58 (1998),\n\nwe think that Calderon is distinguishable.             Calderon's holding was\n\nexplicitly directed at the recall of a \"mandate [in a habeas\n\nproceeding in order] to revisit the merits of an earlier decision\n\ndenying habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner . . . .\"                  Id. at\n\n558.       The considerations are somewhat different where, as here, we\n\nare concerned with intra-federal proceedings and, more importantly,\n\nwhere the Conley III mandate was not issued in a habeas proceeding\n\nat all but on direct review of the denial of a new trial motion.\n\n               Nevertheless,     independent     of   Calderon,   recall    of   a\n\nmandate--other       than   to    correct    a    clerical   error--threatens\n\nimportant interests in finality and is a step to be taken only in\n\nthe most unusual circumstances.7             Defense counsel in Conley III\n\nchose in the first instance not to argue for a remand, possibly in\n\npart because of a deliberate tactical choice (see note 4 above).\n\nFurther, so far as we can tell at this stage, the \"new evidence\"\n\nwhile arguably helpful to Conley serves more to raise doubts than\n\nto establish innocence or a \"clear probability\" of an acquittal;\n\nserious doubts may be enough if Brady evidence was withheld but (as\n\nalready explained) is not normally sufficient under Wright.                Given\n\n\n       7\n       See Boston & Me. Corp. v. Town of Hampton, 7 F.3d 281, 283\n(1st Cir. 1993); Fine v. Bellefonte Underwriters Ins. Co., 758 F.2d\n50, 52-54 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 469 U.S. 874 (1985); 16 Wright,\nMiller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3938, at 712 (2d\ned. 1996) (describing \"profound interests in repose\").\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthese circumstances, we do not see how a sua sponte withdrawal of\n\nthe mandate can be justified.\n\n            This leaves open only Conley's claim under Brady, a\n\nsettled basis for collateral attack. See Barrett v. United States,\n\n965 F.2d 1184, 1189 (1st Cir. 1992).     Indeed, claims based on new\n\nevidence wrongfully withheld can prevail on a lesser showing of\n\nprejudice than claims based on newly-discovered evidence (because\n\nthe former assumes government misconduct).       See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Gonzalez, 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).               But, of\n\ncourse, not all newly-discovered evidence fits within Brady:             the\n\nevidence must, at a bare minimum, have been within the government's\n\ngrasp and wrongly withheld from the defense.          Brady, 373 U.S. at\n\n87.   Perhaps some, but seemingly not all, of Conley's new evidence\n\nfalls within this class.\n\n            The government asserts that whether viewed through the\n\nlens of Wright or Brady, the new evidence is so thin that we should\n\nourselves   decide   without   further   ado   that    a   new   trial    is\n\nunjustified. Conley's counsel says that we should affirm the trial\n\njudge's directly contrary assessment, or, in the alternative,\n\nremand the matter to the same district judge, who has already said\n\nthat the new evidence claim under Wright is persuasive and might\n\nwell say the same under Brady.    Although reluctant to prolong this\n\nlong-lived litigation, we have concluded that neither course is\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            The evidence underlying the Brady claim has never been\n\nsystematically assembled and fully analyzed in any court in any of\n\nthe various decisions to date.            There are fragments of discussion\n\nin several of the district court decisions, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 221-23; Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-58; but nowhere are\n\nall   of   the   items    of   supposed    new    evidence   set   forth,   their\n\nsignificance considered, their status assessed under Brady, and a\n\njudgment made (based on a review of all of the evidence in the\n\nentire trial) as to whether the Brady-qualifying items of new\n\nevidence (taken together) undermine confidence in the verdict.\n\n            Save in the most straightforward case, an en banc court\n\nis not the best initial forum for this kind of undertaking.                 Some\n\nBrady issues can require fact-finding as to what the government\n\nknew and when it knew it.              And, where (as here) the case was\n\ncircumstantial      and    much   of      the    evidence    concerns   arguable\n\nimpeachment of key witnesses, en banc review is generally assisted\n\nby having a well-worked-out district court assessment before the\n\nappellate court attempts its own evaluation.\n\n            At the same time, we agree with the government that it is\n\ntime for another district judge to consider the new evidence claim\n\nafresh.     Although this court has clear authority to order that\n\nfurther proceedings be conducted before a different judge, see 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2106 (2000); Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554\n\n(1994), we normally defer to the district court's own reassignment\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fpolicies.8      However,   in   this   instance   the   circumstances   are\n\nunusual: the district judge has now twice said that he believes a\n\nnew trial to be warranted and we have twice reversed or vacated his\n\ndecision for errors of law antecedent to an assessment of the\n\nevidence.\n\n             A third remand would put the district judge in a very\n\nawkward position.    If he ordered a new trial yet again, it might be\n\nthought that he was wedded to an outcome; if he altered his result,\n\nConley might suppose that the judge had yielded to exhaustion or to\n\na supposed message from this court.         We have no doubt about the\n\ngood faith of the district judge, but in the peculiar circumstances\n\nof this case a fresh look is warranted, despite the cost of\n\nrequiring a new district judge to master this record.\n\n             A concluding word should be said about the duration of\n\nthis case, a point emphasized in the prosecution's brief.                 A\n\npattern of long delays in deciding criminal cases, or civil ones\n\nfor that matter, should certainly be a matter of concern for any\n\ncourt.   But in an individual appeal, especially in a criminal case\n\nwith liberty and honor at stake, the main concern is always the\n\nachievement of justice.         Justice includes the interests of the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      In four of the five districts in this circuit, including\nMassachusetts, there are formal district court rules governing\nreassignment, e.g., D. Mass. R. 40.1(i). In all districts, judges\nsometimes ask for reassignment of a remanded case even when not\ncompelled to do so.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fstate as well as the defendant, but just where justice lies in this\n\ncase is less clear than the government may suppose.\n\n           The government's evidence at trial was assuredly adequate\n\nfor conviction, but it was always circumstantial because no one\n\ntestified that he or she saw Conley looking at Cox in pursuit of\n\nBrown and Conley never admitted seeing him.         The inferences for\n\nthis circumstantial case depended importantly on testimony as to\n\nthe position of different actors at different times in a confused\n\nand changing scene in the dark of night.         Whether impeachment or\n\nother evidence was wrongfully withheld and, if so, whether its\n\nexistence shakes confidence in the jury's verdict are questions for\n\nremand, but they are questions worth answering with care, whatever\n\ntime it takes to answer them.\n\n           The district court's order granting the section 2255\n\nmotion is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court\n\nfor reassignment to a new judge in accordance with local procedures\n\nand   thereafter   for   further   proceedings   consistent   with   this\n\nopinion.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          --Dissents Follow--\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, (dissenting).           I start my\n\ndissent with a question that troubles me.        Why did this deliberate\n\nbrutal beating of Officer Cox take place? The government describes\n\nthe beating in its brief, which accurately summarizes the record:\n\n          As Cox was preparing to climb the fence in\n          pursuit of Brown, Cox was struck from behind\n          with a blunt object by police officers who\n          apparently mistook him for a suspect.      The\n          officers beat and kicked Cox repeatedly in the\n          head, back, face, and mouth. Cox then heard\n          an officer shout, \"Stop, Stop, he's a cop.\n          He's a cop,\" and the officers all fled. With\n          no one left to assist him, Cox was forced to\n          use the bumper of a police car to pull himself\n          off the ground. Cox, bleeding and seriously\n          injured, was later taken in an ambulance to a\n          hospital for treatment.\n\n\n          The majority opinion gives a terse summary of the event\n\nthat led to this case:     \"As Cox stood at the fence, he was brutally\n\nattacked and beaten by other arriving police officers who thought\n\nhe was one of the suspects (and also thought, wrongly, that a\n\npoliceman had been shot). The assaulting officers discovered their\n\nmistake and dispersed, leaving Cox badly injured.\"\n\n          Even   if   we   accept   the    hypothesis   that   the   beating\n\nresulted from mistaken identity, my question still remains. Surely\n\nit is not normal or standard police procedure to administer a\n\nbrutal beating to a fleeing felon where no resistance is made.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that Cox fought back.\n\nAll he did was try to protect himself from repeated kicks to the\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fhead.   It is troubling to me that the police acted as barbarians\n\nrather than police officers sworn to uphold the law.\n\n             But, of course, this has nothing to do with the issues\n\nbefore us.    In our quest for justice, however, I think it advisable\n\nto not only address the specific issues in a case but the framework\n\nwhich gave rise to the case.\n\n             My dissent is based on two grounds.       The first is that I\n\nthink the majority opinion has applied the wrong law.             I think the\n\ncase should have been decided on the \"law-of-the-case\" doctrine.\n\nRather than engage in an analysis of that doctrine again, I am\n\nattaching to this a copy of my panel decision setting forth in\n\ndetail why this doctrine should be applied here.\n\n             My   second   reason   for   dissenting   is   the   majority's\n\ndecision to remand. This probably means another appeal and further\n\nconsideration by the court of appeals.        I think that the case ought\n\nto be decided by the en banc court.           The majority sets forth a\n\nnumber of reasons for the remand:\n\n             The evidence underlying the Brady claim has\n             never been systematically assembled and fully\n             analyzed in any court in any of the various\n             decisions to date.    There are fragments of\n             discussion in several of the district court\n             decisions, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 221-\n             23; Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-58; but\n             nowhere are all of the items of supposed new\n             evidence   set   forth,   their   significance\n             considered, their status assessed under Brady,\n             and a judgment made (based on a review of all\n             the evidence in the entire trial) as to\n             whether the Brady-qualifying items of new\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            evidence (taken together) undermine confidence\n            in the verdict.\n\n            Save in the most straightforward case, an en\n            banc court is not the best initial forum for\n            this kind of undertaking. Some Brady issues\n            can require fact-finding as to what the\n            government knew and when it knew it.      And,\n            where (as here) the case was circumstantial\n            and much of the evidence concerns arguable\n            impeachment of key witnesses, en banc review\n            is generally assisted by having a well-worked-\n            out district court assessment before the\n            appellate court attempts its own evaluation.\n\n            With respect, none of the stated reasons are persuasive.\n\nThe majority says that the new evidence has never been fully\n\ncollected and analyzed.    Quite the contrary is true.   There is an\n\nextensive record in this case which is familiar to the en banc\n\ncourt.   The parties themselves agree on which materials constitute\n\nthe newly discovered evidence.     All that is left is an analysis\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).\n\n            The majority also suggests that additional fact-finding\n\nis necessary to determine \"what the government knew and when it\n\nknew it.\"     This is true as a general matter, but is simply not\n\napplicable here.   What the government knew is only relevant to the\n\nfirst prong of the Brady determination, namely whether evidence\n\nfavorable to the accused was suppressed by the government, either\n\nwillfully or inadvertently. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n\n282 (1999).    This case has never hinged on whether the government\n\nsuppressed evidence; in fact, the government concedes in its brief\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthat the evidence was \"inadvertently overlooked . . . in providing\n\ndiscovery.\"\n\n             Instead, the focus of this case is on the final prong of\n\nBrady, which rests on whether there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, had the newly discovered evidence been disclosed to the\n\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n\nSee Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433-34 (1995).                   Deciding\n\nwhether the outcome of a trial would be different is not simply a\n\nfact-bound     issue,     it   is    interlaced      with   a   constitutional\n\ndetermination.      See Brady, 373 U.S. at 86 (explaining that the\n\noverarching issue is whether the government's conduct violates the\n\nDue Process      Clause   of   the   Fourteenth      Amendment).    Thus,   the\n\ncritical question in this case is a matter of law, not fact, and it\n\nis a question that we can decide.             See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 289\n\n(giving no deference to analysis by district court or court of\n\nappeals when examining habeas corpus petition in which defendant\n\nclaims   Brady    material     creates   a    reasonable    probability    of   a\n\ndifferent outcome).\n\n           This brings me to the majority's final reason to remand.\n\nThe majority says that it makes sense to have a district court make\n\nthe   Brady    determination        because    the   government's   case    was\n\ncircumstantial and all the newly discovered evidence relates to\n\nimpeachment of key witnesses.            On its face, this justification\n\nseems persuasive. After all, the district court judge who listened\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fto the witnesses' testimony, saw their demeanor on the stand, and\n\nobserved the jury's reaction seems best positioned to determine\n\nwhether new impeachment evidence would change the result of the\n\ntrial.    But the majority's decision to remand this case to a\n\ndifferent district court judge eviscerates any benefit that might\n\nbe gained from a remand.\n\n            We can determine whether the outcome of the trial would\n\nbe different using circumstantial and impeachment evidence just as\n\nwell as a new district court judge, and considering the appellate\n\nrecord here, with which we are all familiar, in a significantly\n\nshorter time.        Review of circumstantial evidence is part of the\n\ngristmill      for   appellate   courts.      In   addition,    circumstantial\n\nevidence is just as reliable as testimony and, at times, more\n\nreliable because it does not depend on the memory or judgment of\n\nwhat a witness saw and remembered and it is not subject to the\n\nbiases and prejudices that are part of all human beings.\n\n            With respect, I consider a remand an unnecessary waste of\n\ntime and judicial resources.         It is going to take the new district\n\ncourt untold hours to attain a working knowledge of the record,\n\nwhich this court already has.         I also point out that five of the\n\nseven members of the en banc court have had considerable experience\n\nas trial court judges.       This court is well versed in looking at a\n\nrecord   and    deciding   whether    an    outcome   of   a   trial   would   be\n\ndifferent in light of new evidence.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f            It is clear from the appellate record that Kenneth Conley\n\nhas had more than his \"day\" in court.     After being convicted by a\n\njury, Conley appealed.       We upheld the conviction unanimously.\n\nUnited States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1999).       Certiorari\n\nwas denied.    Conley v. United States, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000).   Conley\n\nappealed again, this time on the grounds of newly discovered\n\nevidence.     We unanimously reversed the district court because of\n\nerroneous legal rulings. United States v. Conley, 249 F.3d 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    We ended our opinion by stating:   \"The sentence of the\n\ndistrict court, which we affirmed in our prior opinion, shall be\n\nexecuted.\"     Id. at 47.   The sentence was not executed.      Conley\n\nfiled a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000) motion based on essentially the\n\nsame newly discovered evidence alleged in his prior case.          On\n\nappeal for a third time, we applied the \"law-of-the-case\" doctrine\n\nin a two to one opinion.        Conley's motion for an en banc was\n\ngranted and the majority opinion was recalled.\n\n             I can think of no good reason why we should revisit this\n\ncase, let alone remand it to a different district court judge.\n\nThis court has all it needs to decide the Brady issue itself.       We\n\nhave the entire record and we are familiar with it.         Moreover,\n\nplacing the case in the hands of another district court judge can\n\nbe construed to infer an abdication of our duty of review.         Our\n\nduty is to review the decision of the district court, not to look\n\nto it for help in deciding a difficult legal issue.             Judge\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fTorruella's treatment of the Brady issue is both thorough and\n\ncorrect.   Because I believe this court should decide the Brady\n\nissue itself, and because I agree with the substance of Judge\n\nTorruella's analysis, I concur in his dissent.\n\n           My final comment is a direct reply to the majority's\n\ndiscussion of justice.   Simply put, \"Justice delayed is Justice\n\ndenied.\"   I think this court has a duty to decide this case and\n\nthat a remand is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f                               ATTACHMENT\n\n            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.       This is the third appeal\n\narising from defendant-appellant Kenneth Conley's jury conviction\n\nof perjury in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623 and obstruction of a\n\ngrand jury investigation in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503.            The\n\nconviction followed Conley's testimony before a grand jury, which\n\nwas   investigating   the   alleged   beating   of   plainclothes   police\n\nofficer Michael Cox by other police officers.\n\n            This case first came before us on direct appeal after\n\nConley's conviction.     We affirmed the conviction and the sentence\n\nof thirty-four months, ruling explicitly that the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the conviction. United States v. Conley, 186\n\nF.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1017 (2000)\n\n(Conley I).     Conley then moved for a new trial based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence, violations of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963), and jury misconduct.          The district court granted the\n\nmotion, finding that a new trial was warranted \"in the interests of\n\njustice.\"     United States v. Conley, 103 F. Supp. 2d 45, 57-58 (D.\n\nMass. 2000) (Conley II).      We reversed, ruling that the district\n\ncourt did not apply the correct legal test.             United States v.\n\nConley, 249 F.3d 38, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2001) (Conley III).\n\n            The present appeal arises from a petition under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255, which Conley filed shortly after our opinion in Conley III\n\nhad issued.    The district court set aside Conley's conviction:\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f           The Judgment of Conviction under which\n           Petitioner   is   presently   restrained  was\n           obtained in violation of the Due Process\n           Clause   of  the   Fifth   Amendment  to  the\n           Constitution of the United States in that\n           exculpatory   evidence   was   withheld  from\n           Petitioner during trial, which resulted in a\n           verdict not worthy of confidence.\n\nConley v. United States, 164 F. Supp. 2d 216, 217 (D. Mass. 2001)\n\n(Conley IV).      We reverse the court below.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           We set forth the factual background and much of the\n\nprocedural history of this case in Conley I, 186 F.3d at 11-15, and\n\nConley III, 249 F.3d at 40-44, and need not reiterate it.              Only the\n\nfollowing points bear emphasis:\n\n            In his motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.   33,   Conley    focused   on    three   pieces   of   evidence:         the\n\ngovernment's failure to disclose Charles Bullard's grand jury\n\ntestimony; the government's knowing reliance on Richard Brown's\n\nperjured testimony that the Boston Police Department had brought\n\ndrug charges against him in retaliation for the testimony he gave\n\nat the civil trial; and the government's failure to disclose the\n\ntranscript   of     an   interview   of   Officer   Richard   Walker    by   the\n\nInternal Affairs Division (IAD) of the Boston Police Department, in\n\nwhich Walker made a tentative photo identification of the tall\n\nwhite officer who chased and arrested Brown as an officer other\n\nthan Conley.\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f          The district court's opinion on this motion analyzed\n\nthese three pieces of evidence.   After setting forth the standard\n\nfor a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, United States\n\nv. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980), and a prosecutor's\n\nobligation to disclose exculpatory evidence, Brady, 373 U.S. at 87,\n\nit considered the separate and cumulative effect of the evidence.\n\nConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-55.   The district court determined\n\nthat the government's failure to disclose Bullard's grand jury\n\ntestimony did not violate Brady, and that Officer Walker's IAD\n\ninterview transcript was \"'inconclusive' as to the government's\n\nduty of disclosure and defense counsel's diligence.\"    Conley III,\n\n249 F.3d at 44.   The court went on to frame two questions for its\n\nconsideration:\n\n          [Question One:] Did the prosecution have and\n          withhold information from defense counsel that\n          would have led a reasonable person to expect\n          that a civil trial would occur, similar to the\n          civil trial that did in fact occur after the\n          criminal conviction and sentence in this case,\n          and that the testimony at the civil trial\n          would be substantially as we now know it was\n          in fact?\n\n          [Question Two:] If so, were defense counsel so\n          severely impeded in their preparation of an\n          overall   defense    strategy   and    in    the\n          performance   of   the   function   of    cross-\n          examination of those particular witnesses, out\n          of the larger number of police officers,\n          including   both  uniformed    and   undercover\n          officers, who were in the vicinity of the\n          brutal beating of Michael Cox, an undercover\n          Boston police officer, by a uniformed Boston\n          police officer, that in the interests of\n          justice a new trial should be allowed?\n\n                               -27-\n\fConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 57-58.\n\n          The district court answered the first question in the\n\naffirmative.   The second question, it stated,\n\n          cannot be determined as a matter of law, under\n          the applicable legal standard explained in\n          Part III of this opinion [discussing Wright\n          and Brady, inter alia].      Instead, in the\n          unique circumstances of this case, I conclude\n          that the determination to allow or not to\n          allow a new trial is one committed to an\n          exercise of discretion by the court to which\n          the legal system assigns responsibility for\n          making the determination.\n\nId. at 58 (emphasis added).     The district court then used the\n\ndiscretion it had given itself to order a new trial \"in the\n\ninterests of justice.\"   Id.\n\n          In our review of the district court's opinion on Conley's\n\nmotion for a new trial, we discussed the requirements for a new\n\ntrial based on newly discovered evidence and/or violation of Brady.\n\nConley III, 249 F.3d at 44-45.    We concluded that the district\n\ncourt erred in allowing a new trial \"in the interests of justice\"\n\ninstead of applying either the Wright or Brady standards:\n\n               As we explained supra, a new trial may be\n          ordered in this case only if the standards set\n          forth in Wright and/or Brady are satisfied.\n          Both Wright and Brady require a showing that\n          the evidence was material and that the\n          defendant was prejudiced to some degree. We\n          must defer to the district court's explicit\n          findings   as   to  the   Bullard  and   Brown\n          testimony, as well as to its statement that\n          prejudice could not be determined upon a\n          consideration of the evidence as a whole.\n          Therefore, there is no basis for remanding\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f            this matter, and    we   REVERSE   the   district\n            court's order.\n\nId. at 47 (internal citations omitted).         We directed that the\n\ndistrict court's sentence, which we had affirmed in Conley I, be\n\nexecuted.    Id.\n\n            Only one week after we issued Conley III, Conley brought\n\na motion to set aside conviction under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.        Again,\n\nthe district court held that Conley was entitled to relief from\n\njudgment.    Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 223-24.\n\n            In Conley IV, on appeal before us now, the district court\n\nmade the following findings:\n\n            (1) Richard Walker testified at the trial of\n            defendant Conley that Walker went through a\n            hole in the fence and made his way to the\n            bottom of an incline;\n\n            (2) when at the bottom of the incline he saw\n            two men standing in the street, one tall (six\n            feet or six feet two) and the other shorter\n            (about . . . five nine);\n\n            (3) the prosecutor used this evidence in his\n            closing to suggest that the taller was Conley;\n\n            (4) during testimony of March 27, 1995 to the\n            Internal Affairs Division (IAD) of the Boston\n            Police Department, Walker was shown a group of\n            photographs and with some uncertainty selected\n            two as persons at the bottom of the incline,\n            neither of whom was Conley;\n\n            (5) defendant Conley claims that this evidence\n            was unavailable to Conley and his attorney at\n            the criminal trial;\n\n            (6) this and other material evidence came out\n            in open court in the later trial of a civil\n            action brought by Michael Cox against several\n\n                                 -29-\n\f           officers, including the defendant Conley, in\n           December 1998, some six months after the\n           defendant was convicted in the criminal trial;\n           and\n\n           (7) even though the testimony given at the\n           December 1998 civil trial could not have been\n           withheld by the prosecutor in the criminal\n           trial, because it did not then exist, the\n           defendant Conley argued in his motion for new\n           trial and continues to press the argument now\n           that the prosecutor had withheld, during and\n           before the criminal trial, information that\n           the prosecutor then had about the IAD\n           proceedings, and if the prosecutor had made\n           that information available to Conley and his\n           attorney in time for use during the criminal\n           trial,   it  would   have  made   a  material\n           difference in the defense strategy, including\n           cross-examination.\n\nId. at 221-22.9   The court made no findings concerning the other\n\nevidence at issue in its earlier opinion, i.e., the testimony of\n\nBullard and Brown.\n\n           The district court held that the correct legal standard\n\nwas found in Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.   Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 222.   It then restated the same two questions it had formulated\n\nin Conley II, set forth supra at page 4.   It held:\n\n           The newly discovered evidence, taken together\n           with all the conflicts presented in evidence\n           known to the defense before and during the\n           criminal trial, presents a dramatically more\n           compelling basis for finding that defense\n           counsel's opportunity to present a creditable\n\n\n     9\n      The court stated that it made these findings on an \"enlarged\nrecord,\" suggesting that it was considering more or different\nevidence than it did in its earlier opinion. Conley IV, 164 F.\nSupp. 2d at 222. Nowhere does the court explain what that evidence\nis.\n\n                                -30-\n\f           challenge to the government's case as a\n           wholeand    to   cross-examine    effectively\n           particular witnesses was severely impeded.\n\nId. at 223.\n\n           Based on the factual findings recited supra, the court\n\nconcluded that Conley satisfied the elements of the Wright test.10\n\n           I conclude that the newly discovered evidence\n           is highly probative and neither immaterial nor\n           cumulative in nature. Instead, it is evidence\n           that strikes at the heart of the prosecution's\n           case, one which is largely based on the\n           credibility of its witnesses.     Indeed, the\n           strength of this evidence leads me to find\n           that the defendant has met his burden of\n           showing a probable result of acquittal in a\n           new trial.\n\nId.   The government appeals.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n           Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, a prisoner in federal custody may\n\npetition the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct the\n\nsentence on the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation\n\nof the Constitution or laws of the United States.       Brackett v.\n\nUnited States, 270 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2001).         Claims that\n\npreviously have been addressed on direct review, however, may not\n\n\n\n      10\n       Under Wright, the moving party must demonstrate the following\nfour elements: (1) the evidence claimed to be newly discovered was\nunknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial; (2)\nfailure to learn of the evidence was not attributable to lack of\ndiligence by the defendant; (3) the evidence is material, and not\nmerely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) it will probably result in\nan acquittal upon retrial of defendant. 625 F.2d at 1019; see also\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.\n2001).\n\n                                -31-\n\fbe   readjudicated   collaterally       under   §   2255   absent   equitable\n\nconsiderations, such as actual innocence or cause and prejudice.\n\nWithrow   v.   Williams,   507   U.S.    680,   721   (1993)   (Scalia,   J.,\n\nconcurring); see also United States v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 1990); Tracy v. United States, 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st Cir.\n\n1984)(\"[a]bsent an intervening change in the applicable law, issues\n\nthat have been raised and decided on a motion for a new trial\n\ncannot be reconsidered in a subsequent collateral attack\" (quoting\n\nUnited States v.

United States, 370 F.2d 862, 864 (1st Cir. 1967).\n\n           In a related vein, the doctrine of \"law of the case\" is\n\na prudential principle that \"precludes relitigation of the legal\n\nissues presented in successive stages of a single case once those\n\nissues have been decided.\"       Field v. Mans, 157 F.3d 35, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (quoting Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 167 (1st\n\nCir. 1996)).    \"For a bar to exist, an issue must have been actually\n\nconsidered and decided by the appellate court, or a decision on the\n\nissue must be necessarily inferred from the disposition on appeal.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Commercial Union\n\nIns. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., Ltd., 41 F.3d 764, 770 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)).\n\n           The law of the case doctrine prohibits a litigant from\n\nresurrecting an issue decided by the trial court that either has\n\nnot been challenged on appeal or has been decided on appeal.              Id.\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fat 40; United States v. Rosen, 929 F.2d 839, 842 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1991). Another aspect of the doctrine is the \"mandate\" rule, which\n\nrequires the district court to follow the ruling of the court of\n\nappeals.   Field, 157 F.3d at 40.   We review an application of the\n\nlaw of the case de novo.   Id.\n\n           The district court's conclusion in Conley IV that the\n\nnewly discovered evidence pertaining to Walker satisfied the Wright\n\ncriteria is foreclosed by these doctrines.      First, the district\n\ncourt essentially reversed course as to whether the Walker evidence\n\nfulfilled the requirement of prejudice.    In its previous decision,\n\nit held that the question of prejudice \"cannot be determined as a\n\nmatter of law\" under the standards set forth in Wright and Brady.\n\nConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 58.   That same evidence, it now says,\n\nis sufficient to warrant a new trial under Wright.    Conley IV, 164\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 222.11\n\n           Moreover, the district court's most recent treatment of\n\nthe Walker evidence is at odds with its previous ruling as to at\n\nleast one other key element.     Earlier, it called Walker's IAD\n\n\n     11\n      In its opinion in Conley II, the district court discussed in\nsome depth the testimony of Bullard and Brown, and made clear that\nits holding as to prejudice encompassed the entirety of that newly\ndiscovered and/or disclosed evidence. 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-54.\nThe district court's opinion in Conley IV, however, referenced only\nthe Walker evidence as a basis for its allowance of Conley's § 2255\nmotion. 164 F. Supp. 2d at 221-22.       Although it mentioned the\nBullard and Brown testimony, it did so only in the context of\n\"Background Criminal Proceedings.\" Id. at 218. We read Conley IV,\ntherefore, as premising its determination of a Wright violation\nsolely on the Walker evidence.\n\n                                 -33-\n\ftestimony \"inconclusive\" as to the government's duty of disclosure\n\nand defense counsel's diligence.           Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 55.\n\nIn Conley III, however, the court held that the Walker evidence\n\nsatisfied all of the elements of Wright, including, by inference,\n\nthe requirement that Conley's failure to learn of the evidence was\n\nnot attributable to his lack of diligence.             164 F. Supp. 2d at 223\n\n(discussing Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n\n            In Conley III, we discussed and affirmed the district\n\ncourt's factual findings as to these elements of the Wright test,\n\nand instructed the court to carry out Conley's sentence.               249 F.3d\n\nat 46-47.      That decision binds the district court.             See Withrow,\n\n507 U.S. at 721; Field, 157 F.3d at 40.               Accordingly, we reverse\n\nthe district court's order setting aside Conley's conviction.\n\n            We know of no additional evidence that would explain the\n\ndistrict court's new and contrary conclusions as to prejudice and\n\ndefense counsel's diligence.            While the district court mentions in\n\npassing an \"enlarged record,\" it makes no specific findings that\n\nsupport its about-face.           Furthermore, the legal claims, although\n\nrecast in the form of a § 2255 petition, did not differ from the\n\nclaims before the district court and before us in Conley III.                See\n\nTracy,   739    F.2d   at   682    (a    petitioner   is   still   barred   from\n\nrelitigating the subject matter of claims on collateral review even\n\nif he recasts them in different nomenclature).              Nor was there any\n\nmaterial change in the controlling law following Conley III.                 See\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fid.   Hence, we see no reason not to preclude the district court's\n\nreadjudication of settled issues.\n\n           For   these   reasons,   we     REVERSE   the   decision   of   the\n\ndistrict court.    We remand this case to the Chief Judge of the\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts with instructions\n\nthat Conley's thirty-four-month sentence be executed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).          Although I fully\n\nagree with Judge Bownes's dissenting opinion, I write separately to\n\naddress the majority's decision to remand this case.                In our\n\nattempt to find and apply the proper legal framework with which to\n\nanalyze Conley's new evidence claims, this Court, together with the\n\ndistrict court, has now heard the same arguments made regarding the\n\nsame body of evidence on six separate occasions.           Now, straining\n\nsuch jurisprudential norms as finality and repose to their breaking\n\npoint, the majority elects to remand Conley's new evidence claims\n\n-- claims with which this Court is all too familiar -- to a new\n\ndistrict judge for fresh consideration.      Respectfully, I disagree\n\nwith the majority's decision to remand this case, as well as the\n\nsubstantive reasons for doing so.\n\n          Besides regard for finality, there are three reasons why\n\nthis en banc Court would have been the best forum to hear Conley's\n\nBrady claim. First, we have developed an intimate familiarity with\n\nthe record, a familiarity matched only by Judge Keeton and the\n\nparties themselves.   Second, the record before us is complete: no\n\nadditional   fact-finding   is   required   to   assess    the   merits   of\n\nConley's Brady claim.       Both parties invited us to decide this\n\nmatter and have had full opportunity to collect all of the evidence\n\nrelevant to the consideration of Conley's claims.           Moreover, the\n\nparties agree upon the scope of the evidence to be considered under\n\nBrady and there are no facts in dispute regarding the government's\n\n\n                                  -36-\n\fknowledge or suppression of evidence.           Finally, once the heavy-\n\nlifting is done -- once all the new evidence in question has been\n\nproperly catalogued, labeled and evaluated -- it is evident that\n\nunder Brady, there is simply no basis for remand.\n\n             Therefore, although I am troubled by the majority's\n\nsomewhat tortured efforts to construct an exception to the law of\n\nthe case to apply to this case, I do not focus my dissent on the\n\nmajority's handling of that doctrine.         Instead, I will concentrate\n\non the merits of Conley's Brady claim.         Assuming arguendo that the\n\nlaw of the case does not now bar Conley's claims, and agreeing with\n\nthe majority that Brady, and not Wright, applies to new evidence\n\nclaims made in a section 2255 motion, I dissent today because there\n\nis no purpose to be served by remanding this case to the district\n\ncourt, and no plausible basis upon which, on remand, the district\n\ncourt might grant a new trial.\n\n             Assessing the merits of Conley's Brady claim requires\n\nreconstruction of a good deal of trial testimony, as well as\n\naccounting for all of the items of new evidence that might come\n\nunder the Brady umbrella.         Thus, to establish that Conley's Brady\n\nevidence   does   not    create   a   \"reasonable    probability     that   the\n\nsuppressed    evidence    would    have   produced   a   different   verdict\"\n\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280-81 (1999), I will briefly\n\nsummarize the evidence offered against Conley at trial and assess\n\nany impact the new evidence might have produced.\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f                     I.   The Trial Testimony12\n\n          In his grand jury testimony, Conley testified that he was\n\nthe first officer in pursuit of Robert Brown.     He stated that he\n\nwas forty feet behind Brown and that he climbed over the chain link\n\nfence \"seconds after\" Brown did.   He further testified that he did\n\nnot see Michael Cox or any other plainclothes officer chasing Brown\n\nahead of him.\n\n          The testimony of Michael Cox, Robert Brown, and Richard\n\nWalker conflicts with Conley's account.       As we stated in our\n\noriginal opinion on the sufficiency of the evidence:\n\n                 Both Cox and Walker placed Cox at the\n          exact same place where Conley claims to have\n          climbed over the fence.    According to their\n          testimony . . . Cox was \"right behind\" Brown,\n          approximately three feet behind him, as Brown\n          approached the fence. When Brown reached the\n          fence, Cox was even closer.    At that point,\n          Cox was close enough to make contact with\n          Brown and attempt to pull him back over the\n          fence.   Brown corroborated this version of\n          events when he testified that a black man\n          wearing a \"black hoody\" was behind him as he\n          ran toward the fence and had just started to\n          come over the fence after him when he observed\n          the black man being struck on the head by a\n          police officer.    Brown confirmed that the\n          person behind him was close enough to make\n          contact with his foot as he scaled the fence.\n\n                 Conley's testimony that he scaled the\n          fence \"within seconds\" of seeing Brown go over\n          the fence, and that he scaled the fence in the\n          same location as Brown does not square with\n\n\n     12\n      For a comprehensive summary of the evidence presented at\ntrial, see United States v. Conley, 186 F.3d 7, 7-15, 19-21 (1st\nCir. 1999) (\"Conley I\").\n\n                                -38-\n\f          the testimony of Cox, Walker and Brown.\n          Conley's version of events provides for no\n          reasonable gap in time during which he could\n          have missed observing Cox at the fence.\n          Indeed   Conley   concedes    that   if   the\n          Cox/Walker/Brown version is true, he would\n          have seen Cox at the fence. In reaching its\n          verdict, the jury apparently found the\n          Cox/Walker/Brown version more credible.13\n\nConley I, 186 F.3d at 20.\n\n          The jury found Conley guilty of perjury for denying that\n\nhe saw Cox chase, pursue, and grab hold of Brown as Brown ran\n\ntoward and climbed the fence at Woodruff Way.   The jury acquitted\n\nhim of another count of perjury, finding that his denial of\n\nwitnessing Boston police officers beating Cox was not perjurious.\n\n          This Court affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's findings, concluding that the government had\n\n\"produced ample circumstantial evidence from which a rational jury\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      A word should be added regarding the specific testimony of\nRichard Walker (now the subject of Conley's Brady challenge).\nWalker testified that he observed Cox chasing closely behind Brown,\nsaw Brown scale the fence, and then saw Cox trying to reach for\nhim.   According to Walker, once Brown made it over the fence\nsuccessfully, Walker ran toward a hole in the fence. Walker then\nproceeded through the hole and down an incline, falling a couple of\ntimes. Once on the other side of the fence, he observed two white\nplainclothes police officers standing in the street. One was tall,\nabout 6'2\", and the other was shorter. Walker followed the tall\nofficer in pursuit of the suspect.       At some point during the\npursuit, the taller officer dropped his radio. After Brown had\nbeen apprehended, Walker returned the radio to the tall officer.\nWalker did not attempt to identify the tall white officer at trial,\nbut did testify that the officer was the same height and size as\nConley.\n\n                               -39-\n\fcould     conclude   that    Conley's    statements   were   false   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"14        Conley I, 186 F.3d at 19.\n\n                            II.   The New Evidence\n\n             Conley moved for a new trial on March 24, 2000.           All of\n\nConley's new evidence can be sorted into three categories: (1)\n\nCharles Bullard's grand jury and civil trial testimony [\"Bullard\n\nTestimony\"]; (2) the allegedly perjured testimony of Robert Brown\n\n[\"Brown Testimony\"]; and (3) the statements and testimony of\n\nRichard Walker [\"Walker Evidence\"].            As Conley's Brady claim has\n\ncome into sharper focus, it is now apparent that his hopes for a\n\nnew trial under Brady hinge entirely upon the impeachment value of\n\nthis last category of exhibits, the Walker Evidence.15           However, to\n\nprovide a comprehensive account of all Conley's new evidence, I\n\nwill briefly dispatch the Bullard and Brown testimony before\n\nappraising the weight of the Walker Evidence.\n\n\n     14\n      For this reason, I find the majority's comment that this\nevidence   was  \"adequate   for  conviction,   but  was  always\ncircumstantial\" an extraordinary one considering that the\nsufficiency of the evidence was long ago decided. Although I am\nsure unintended, the comment constitutes an inappropriate\ndiminution of Conley I, which cannot but have an influence on\nfuture proceedings.\n     15\n      Although Conley previously argued that the Bullard and Brown\ntestimony were part of the new evidence justifying a new trial,\nbecause neither the Bullard nor the Brown testimony can reasonably\nbe considered exculpatory, the testimonies' materiality need not be\nassessed under     Brady.     Strickler,   527  U.S.   at   281-82.\nAdditionally, at oral argument Conley's attorney conceded that\nbecause the district court determined that the Bullard and Brown\nevidence was not exculpatory, it was not part of Conley's current\nBrady challenge.\n\n                                        -40-\n\f            A.    The Bullard Testimony\n\n            Charles Bullard was a Boston security guard who was\n\nriding in the same vehicle as Officer Cox when Cox's car came to a\n\nstop at the end of Woodruff Way.              Bullard testified before the\n\ngrand jury but was not called as a witness at trial.               Six months\n\nafter Conley was convicted, Bullard testified in a civil suit\n\nbrought by Michael Cox against several officers.\n\n            In the civil trial, Bullard testified that Cox exited the\n\npassenger side of the unmarked police cruiser and went forward to\n\nthe front of the Lexus.         Bullard testified that he \"lost track of\n\n[Cox] after that,\" and that he never saw Cox run toward the fence.\n\nAccording to Conley (who has argued that Cox did not run directly\n\nto the fence), Bullard's testimony that Cox went to the front of\n\nthe Lexus, and not directly to the fence, contradicted Cox's\n\ntestimony and supported Conley's theory of events.\n\n            Although Bullard's subsequent civil trial testimony is\n\nobviously   not    a   matter   which   the   government   might   have   been\n\nrequired to disclose under Brady, Conley has argued that Bullard's\n\ncivil trial testimony was sufficiently similar to his grand jury\n\ntestimony, such that the grand jury testimony should have been\n\ndisclosed to the defense.          Conley's argument is based upon an\n\naffidavit by Bullard, in which Bullard stated that to the best of\n\nhis recollection, his testimony before the grand jury was the same\n\nas the testimony he gave before the civil trial.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f           The district court concluded that the Bullard Testimony\n\nwas not evidence that the government was required to disclose under\n\nBrady.   United States v. Conley, 103 F.Supp. 2d 45, 51-52 (D.Mass.\n\n2000) (\"Conley II\").    The court found that Bullard's civil trial\n\ntestimony differed from his testimony before the grand jury in\n\nmaterial respects. Specifically, the court noted that in his grand\n\njury testimony, Bullard said nothing about Cox going forward to the\n\nfront of the Lexus; instead, he testified that \"Cox jumped out and\n\nwent toward the right.\"    Id.   Because the Bullard Testimony is in\n\nno way exculpatory, it does not come within the rubric of Brady.\n\nStrickler, 527 U.S. 281-82.\n\n           B.   The Brown Testimony\n\n           Conley claimed that Robert Brown perjured himself at\n\ntrial when he stated that state drug charges pending against him\n\nwere manufactured by Boston police in retaliation for his testimony\n\nagainst Conley. According to the defense, the prosecution elicited\n\nthis testimony in order to lend credibility to Brown by portraying\n\nhim as having suffered for his testimony.       See Conley II, 103\n\nF.Supp. 2d at 52-54 (setting forth the perjury allegation in\n\nconsiderable detail). Conley alleged that the prosecutor solicited\n\nperjurious statements from Brown in direct examination and then\n\nrelied on those statements in his closing argument. Conley has\n\nclaimed that the government knew that Brown's statements were\n\n\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fperjurious because of a federal narcotics investigation against\n\nBrown.\n\n             Although it is difficult to see how the Brown Testimony\n\nmight be brought under the ambit of Brady, that is not an issue\n\nthat    needs     to   be     addressed    now    because   the   district     court\n\ndetermined that Conley failed to show that the Brown Testimony was\n\nperjurious.       Id. at 54.         The court found no evidence that Brown\n\nperjured himself,            and   additionally,    expressed     skepticism      that\n\nevidence of a pending federal drug investigation against Brown\n\nwould have been admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 403, 404(b) and\n\n608(b).     Because the court concluded as a matter of law that there\n\nwas    no   perjury,     there      was   no   exculpatory    evidence    for      the\n\ngovernment to disclose under Brady.\n\n             C.      The Walker Evidence\n\n             At oral argument, the parties made two helpful and\n\nimportant concessions regarding the scope and significance of the\n\nWalker Evidence for Brady analysis purposes.                  For its part, the\n\ngovernment conceded that the Walker Evidence was in its possession\n\nand should have been turned over to the defense under Brady and its\n\nprogeny. Consequently, we are not faced with any dispute regarding\n\nwhat the government knew, or when it knew it.\n\n             Conley's attorney also narrowed the scope of our Brady\n\ninquiry by providing us with what was described as a \"complete\n\ninventory\"      of     the    possible    Brady    material   pertinent      to    the\n\n\n                                          -43-\n\ftestimony of Richard Walker.   Conley has identified four documents\n\nrelating to the Walker's testimony which he claims should have been\n\ndisclosed under Brady.   These are: (1) Walker's March 27, 1995\n\ntestimony to the Internal Affairs Division (\"IAD\") of the Boston\n\nPolice Department (the \"IAD Testimony\"); (2) an internal FBI\n\nmemorandum concerning a proposed polygraph examination of Walker\n\n(\"FBI Memorandum\"); (3) a January 30, 1995 memorandum by Lieutenant\n\nKevin Foley of the BPD Anti-Gang Unit (\"Foley Memorandum\"); and (4)\n\na skeletal BPD report prepared by Walker on February 20, 1995 (the\n\n\"Skeletal Report\").\n\n\n\n\n                                -44-\n\f                  (1)    Walker's IAD Testimony\n\n          On March 27, 1995, IAD agents interviewed Walker about\n\nhis observations on the night of the Cox assault. During the\n\ninterview, Walker was shown a group of photographs in order to\n\nidentify the plainclothes officers Walker observed at the bottom of\n\nthe incline.\n\n          When asked to describe the tall white male he saw at the\n\nbottom of the hill, Walker testified, \"All I know is he was a very\n\ntall white male.        He was medium build. I forget what he was\n\nwearing.\" Walker was then given a group of photographs of officers\n\nfrom the Anti-Gang Unit, a unit that Conley was not in, and asked\n\nhim to try to identify the officers he saw.       During the interview,\n\nWalker identified the photographs of two officers, Joseph Teahan\n\nand   Michael   DeStefano.     He   was   notably   tentative   in   his\n\nidentification, stating, \"Like I said, I'm not sure about these\n\nphotographs, but it looks like the tall officer.\"\n\n          Conley claims that he was prejudiced by the suppression\n\nof the IAD Testimony because access to the testimony would have\n\nenabled him to make an issue of Walker's credibility at trial.       The\n\ntestimony would have allowed him to impeach Walker's memory of\n\nevents, because Walker's subsequent inability to identify the tall\n\nwhite officer conflicts with the inference made at trial that\n\nConley was the tall white officer at the bottom of the hill.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -45-\n\f          In response, the government offers a number of arguments\n\nwhy the IAD Testimony offers no significant impeachment value, and\n\nfurther, why Walker's unimpeached testimony helped, rather than\n\nhurt, the defense's theory of the case.\n\n          First, the government argues that neither Walker nor the\n\ngovernment ever suggested that Walker could identify Conley as the\n\ntall, white officer he observed.       Instead, it was circumstantial\n\nevidence, corroborated by Conley's own testimony, that established\n\nthat the tall, white officer was the same one he chased after and\n\nto whom he returned the dropped radio.\n\n          Second,   the   \"misidentification\"   evidence   would   have\n\nactually weakened the defense offered at trial.       That the tall,\n\nwhite officer described by Walker's testimony was in fact Conley\n\nwas a point defense counsel diligently tried to prove at trial.\n\nPlacing Conley at the bottom of the hill ahead of Walker helped the\n\ndefense by allowing it to argue that Conley would not have had time\n\nto witness Cox's beating before Conley scaled the fence.      Defense\n\ncounsel's closing argument shows that Conley went to great lengths\n\nto use the Walker testimony to prove that Walker observed Conley at\n\nthe bottom of the incline.   Discussing Walker's testimony, defense\n\ncounsel stated, \"I believe from the evidence it is fair to say that\n\nthere can be no doubt in your mind that the tall white officer in\n\nplainclothes was Ken Conley.\"     The defense alluded to the ample\n\n\n\n\n                                -46-\n\fcircumstantial evidence tending to show that the tall, white\n\nofficer was indeed Conley.\n\n          During the chase, the tall white officer\n          dropped his radio.    Officer Walker says he\n          picked it up. And when the tall white officer\n          apprehended the suspect, put the cuffs on him,\n          with Walker assisting, he gave him back his\n          radio, you dropped this.        Walker cannot\n          identify Ken Conley as being that officer. He\n          did not know him, he had not seen him before,\n          and, if you will note, he did not identify him\n          in this courtroom as being that officer. But\n          if you take that testimony in conjunction with\n          [Conley's] Grand Jury testimony that was read\n          to you, you will see that Ken Conley, when he\n          testified before the Grand Jury, said that\n          during the pursuit, I dropped my radio and a\n          black uniformed officer picked it up and gave\n          it to me. There is no doubt that Ken Conley\n          was the tall white officer who apprehended\n          Brown.\n\nTr. IV:51-52 (emphasis added).        According to the government,\n\nwhatever impeachment value the IAD Testimony might have in the\n\nabstract, it was never in Conley's interest to impeach Walker's\n\nability to recall events at Woodruff Way.\n\n          Finally, the government argues that the core of Walker's\n\ntestimony was that he observed Cox running closely behind Brown,\n\nchasing him to the fence and reaching for him.   This testimony was\n\ncorroborated by both Cox and Brown and stood in stark contrast to\n\nConley's statement that he followed Brown to the fence and did not\n\nobserve anyone chasing after Brown.     Thus, although Walker's IAD\n\nidentifications may have sewn confusion about who was at the bottom\n\n\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fof   the   hill,   it   was    immaterial     to    the    essence   of   Walker's\n\ncorroborated testimony.\n\n                    (2)   The FBI Memorandum\n\n            The second document in Conley's Brady claim is an FBI\n\nmemorandum concerning a proposed polygraph examination of Walker\n\nregarding inconsistent statements he made in his accounts of the\n\nassault. At Walker's first interview with IAD on February 23, 1995\n\n(properly disclosed to the defense), Walker stated three times that\n\nhe saw someone he believed to be a police officer running behind\n\nCox as Cox chased the suspect to the fence.               However, in subsequent\n\ntestimony (also disclosed), Walker made no mention of seeing anyone\n\nrunning behind Cox.\n\n            When the federal investigation began and the government\n\nreviewed Walker's IAD interview on April 9, 1997, investigators met\n\nwith Walker and questioned him about the discrepancy.                 After that\n\ninterview,     investigators         prepared      a   memorandum     requesting\n\npermission    to   polygraph       Walker   regarding      the   inconsistencies.\n\nWalker agreed      to   take   a    polygraph      examination.      However,   an\n\nattorney representing Walker later notified the FBI that Walker\n\nwould decline to take the polygraph.\n\n             The FBI Memorandum, which was not turned over to the\n\ndefense, related: (1) Walker's initial willingness to submit to a\n\npolygraph examination; (2) his present belief that he did not see\n\nanyone running behind Cox; (3) that when investigators confronted\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fhim about the inconsistency between his present belief and his\n\nprior statements, he explained that because of his friendship with\n\nCox, he must have \"convinced himself that he actually saw someone\n\nor something\" when in fact he did not; and (4) that Walker\n\n\"suggested that perhaps if he was hypnotised [sic] he might truly\n\nrecall what was going on versus what he indicates was tunnel\n\nvision.\"\n\n            Most of these facts ((1)-(3)) were thoroughly elicited in\n\nWalker's testimony before the federal grand jury on June 5, 1997.\n\nThere, Walker testified that he did not see anyone running behind\n\nCox.    During his grand jury testimony, Walker's IAD interview was\n\nread back to him at length, and Walker was asked to explain the\n\ndiscrepancy   between    his   grand   jury   testimony   and    his   prior\n\ninconsistent statements. Walker acknowledged the inconsistency and\n\nexplained his prior statements by asserting that he was probably\n\nmotivated by a feeling of guilt \"for not seeing more than [he]\n\nsaw.\"\n\n           Because Conley had access to the IAD interviews, as well\n\nas Walker's grand jury testimony, the defense was in possession of\n\nnearly all the information contained in the FBI Memorandum.              It\n\nalready    possessed    substantial    information   regarding    Walker's\n\ninconsistent statements and his explanation of the discrepancy\n\nbetween those statements.      The only information Conley would have\n\ngleaned from the disclosure of the FBI memorandum that he was not\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\falready in possession of was (1) that Walker consented to submit to\n\na polygraph examination (which he later refused to take); and (2)\n\nthe FBI's notes regarding Walker's cryptic statement that if\n\nhypnotized, he might be better able to explain the discrepancy\n\nbetween his inconsistent statements.\n\n                   (3)   The Foley Memorandum\n\n           Conley also alleges that a January 30, 1995 memorandum by\n\nLieutenant Kevin Foley of the BPD Anti-Gang Unit is Brady material\n\nthat must be considered in his challenge.       The three-page memo,\n\nprepared less than a week after the Cox assault, summarizes facts\n\nthat Foley believed justified launching an investigation into the\n\nassault.\n\n           According to Conley, the Foley Memorandum states that\n\nOfficers Ryan and Teahan came upon Cox lying on a patch of ice as\n\nthey were returning to their police cars -- not when they arrived\n\non Woodruff way.    This statement would support the defense view\n\nthat it was actually Ryan and Teahan who Walker encountered at the\n\nbottom of the hill, not Conley.\n\n           The government argues that the Foley Memorandum    proves\n\nvery little.    First, the government notes that nowhere in the\n\nreport, written five days after the incident, does Foley indicate\n\nthat he spoke with members of the Gang Unit, much less Teahan or\n\nRyan in particular.      Thus, whether Teahan and Ryan even gave a\n\nconflicting account of their actions, or to whom, is not shown by\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\fthe memorandum.       Second, because Officers Teahan and Ryan gave\n\nsworn testimony at trial and to previous grand juries contending\n\nthat they drove down the cul-de-sac and spotted Cox lying on the\n\nground, it is immaterial whether Lieutenant Foley believes they\n\nwere actually returning to their vehicle.\n\n                  (4)    Walker's Skeletal Report\n\n          The final piece of evidence in Conley's Brady claim is\n\nWalker's February 20, 1995 report of events, which he was ordered\n\nto write by his commanding officer.              According to Conley, the\n\nreport is significant because it was prepared by Walker almost\n\ncontemporaneously with the assault, yet it lacks any of the facts\n\nhe recounted at trial.        The report is indeed skeletal, containing\n\nonly a few sentences of text explaining the events on Woodruff Way.\n\nConley argues that its omissions could have been usefully exploited\n\nduring cross examination.\n\n          The government contends that although the skeletal report\n\ndoes not contain any details, its usefulness for impeaching Walker\n\nwould be greatly diminished by the fact that in the same memo in\n\nwhich Walker was instructed to write the report, he was ordered to\n\nappear for an interview with IAD three days later.                    At that\n\ninterview,   Walker    gave    a     highly   detailed   accounting   of   his\n\nobservations.\n\n                              III.    Discussion\n\n\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\f           Assuming that the four pieces of Walker Evidence should\n\nhave been disclosed under Brady, the withholding of evidence does\n\nnot warrant reversal except upon a showing of prejudice, that is,\n\nunless there is a \"reasonable probability that the suppressed\n\nevidence would have produced a different verdict.\"              Strickler, 527\n\nU.S. at 281.    In this context, \"reasonable probability\" means a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. See\n\nBagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).\n\n           Failure to provide impeachment evidence, if the evidence\n\nis powerful enough, can be prejudicial and grounds for a new trial.\n\nUnited States v. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 126 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   This is particularly true where the evidence is highly\n\nimpeaching or when the witness's testimony is uncorroborated and\n\nessential to the conviction. Id.; see Giglio v. United States, 405\n\nU.S. 150 (1972).      On the other hand, impeachment evidence that is\n\nmerely   cumulative    or    collateral    is    insufficient    to   establish\n\nprejudice under Brady. See United States v. Dumas, 207 F.3d 11, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Considered       collectively,       the   Walker   Evidence   could\n\npossibly have been employed at trial to impeach Walker's ability to\n\naccurately recall the events on Woodruff Way by showing: (1) that\n\nhe was unable to identify the officers at the bottom of the hill;\n\n(2) that he made prior inconsistent statements about someone\n\nchasing behind Cox; (3) that perhaps if he was \"hypnotized,\" he\n\n\n                                    -52-\n\fmight be able to recall events more clearly; and (4) that he\n\nprepared an early report which was bereft of any details of the\n\nevents from the night of January 25, 1995.   Additionally, Walker's\n\nrefusal to submit to a polygraph examination might, if admissible,\n\nhave impeached his overall reliability.\n\n          The question is whether this evidence \"can reasonably be\n\ntaken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\n\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\"      Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435;\n\nUnited States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 156 (1st Cir. 2000).    The\n\nundisclosed impeachment evidence is, for the most part, minor and\n\ncumulative.   It is undisputed that Conley was in possession of\n\nWalker's prior inconsistent statements regarding seeing someone\n\nchasing behind Cox.16   Moreover, Conley was fully aware of the fact\n\nthat Walker was unable to identify the tall, white officer at the\n\nbottom of the hill.     Brady does not protect a defendant who is\n\naware of essential facts that would allow him to take advantage of\n\nthe exculpatory evidence at issue. See United States v. Hicks, 848\n\nF.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1988); Coleman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417, 438\n\n(6th Cir. 1990); United States v. Grossman, 843 F.2d 78, 85 (2d\n\nCir. 1988); Lugo v. Muñoz, 682 F.2d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\nSetting aside information in the Walker Evidence that Conley\n\n\n     16\n      Indeed, Conley not only possessed evidence of Walker's prior\ninconsistent statements and chose not to impeach Walker with them\nat trial, the record indicates that the defense actually objected\nto the government's attempt to introduce Walker's prior\ninconsistent statements. See Tr. II at 51-52.\n\n                                -53-\n\falready had knowledge of, Conley is only left with Walker's cryptic\n\nhypnotism statement, his skeletal police report, and his refusal to\n\nsubmit to a polygraph examination.17\n\n           Such weak impeachment evidence is not sufficient to\n\nwarrant   the   drastic   remedy   of    a   new   trial.    While    Walker's\n\nstatement that if hypnotized, \"he might truly recall what was going\n\non,\" does support the notion that he was uncertain about his memory\n\nof the events on Woodruff Way; this does not undercut Walker's\n\ntestimony (corroborated by Cox and Brown) that he saw Cox chasing\n\nBrown to the fence and that as Brown scaled the fence, Cox tried to\n\nreach for him.       Moreover, in the face of Walker's many detailed\n\nstatements (one of which was given three days after the memorandum\n\nwas prepared) the fact that his February 20, 1995 memorandum is\n\nskeletal is immaterial.\n\n           Since it was never in Conley's interest to impeach the\n\ncredibility     of   Richard   Walker,   the   exculpatory    value    of   the\n\nhypnotism statement and skeletal report is de minimus.                  During\n\ncross examination and closing arguments, the defense attempted to\n\ndemonstrate circumstantially (through evidence of the dropped and\n\nrecovered radio) that Conley was the officer Walker saw at the\n\n\n\n     17\n      Conley has not shown how Walker's refusal to submit to a\npolygraph examination would have been admissible at trial. See\ndeVries v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 716 F.2d 939, 945\n(1st Cir. 1983) (holding that evidence of a witnesses's refusal to\ntake a polygraph exam is inadmissible); Aetna Ins. Co. v. Barnett\nBros. Inc., 289 F.2d 30, 34 (8th Cir. 1961).\n\n                                    -54-\n\fbottom of the hill.         This is not a strategy that Conley was stuck\n\nwith for lack of better evidence: Conley possessed -- and elected\n\nnot to use -- ample impeachment evidence undercutting Walker's\n\ntestimony.      Conley      had evidence that: (1) Walker and Cox were\n\nfriends; (2) that Walker felt guilty about not seeing more; (3)\n\nthat this guilt led to Walker making prior inconsistent statements;\n\nand (4) that Walker believed that an \"Officer Ryan\" (rather than\n\nConley) was the officer who arrested Brown.              Instead of using this\n\nevidence, Conley chose to rely on Walker's testimony to establish\n\nthat Conley was down the hill, and therefore could not have\n\nobserved the beating, and further, that like Walker, Conley had\n\n\"tunnel vision\" so he was not lying when he said he did not see Cox\n\nchasing Brown.      Therefore, Conley's argument that he would have\n\nused   the     Walker    Evidence     to   undercut    Walker's   testimony   is\n\nunavailing.\n\n                                IV.    Conclusion\n\n             Conley's Brady claim should not be remanded to the\n\ndistrict court.         Both parties have requested that this Court make\n\nthe    final    Brady     assessment,      and   the   straightforward   Brady\n\nmateriality issue presented here -- whether the existence of\n\nwithheld Walker documents shakes confidence in the jury verdict --\n\nis highly amenable to resolution by this en banc Court.\n\n             I cannot conceive how any court could find that the\n\nnondisclosure of the Walker Evidence undermines confidence in the\n\n\n                                        -55-\n\foutcome of Conley's trial.       The impeachment evidence contained in\n\nthe four documents was largely minor and cumulative; much of the\n\ninformation was already known to the defense. Finally, none of the\n\nnew   evidence   undercuts   Walker's     core   testimony   at    trial    --\n\ncorroborated by Cox and Brown -- that Walker observed Cox running\n\nto the fence right behind Brown.          The majority's decision today\n\nneedlessly postpones the inevitable day when this Court or another\n\nfinally concludes that there is no reasonable probability that, had\n\nthe   Walker   Evidence   been   properly   disclosed,   the      results   of\n\nConley's trial would have been different.        I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -56-\n\f",

The facts underlying this section\n\n2255 action, recounted in detail in prior opinions,1 can be briefly\n\nsummarized. About eight years ago, on January 25, 1995, a shooting\n\noccurred in the early morning hours in Boston, and there ensued a\n\npolice chase of several suspects in a Lexus. Eventually, the Lexus\n\nwas trapped in a dead-end street.       Pulling up on the left side of\n\nthe Lexus--the first of many pursuing police vehicles--was an\n\nunmarked police car with two plainclothes officers.        One of the\n\nofficers, Michael Cox, ran from the car after a suspect named\n\nRobert Brown who was fleeing on foot from the Lexus toward a fence\n\nto the right of the Lexus.\n\n          By this time other police cars were arriving, pulling in\n\nnext to and behind the Lexus.      In this line was a car driven by\n\nOfficer Richard Walker; behind him was one containing Officer\n\nKenneth Conley and his partner.    According to later testimony, Cox\n\nchased Brown to the fence and grabbed at Brown but Brown got over.\n\nAs Cox stood at the fence, he was brutally attacked and beaten by\n\nother arriving police officers who thought he was one of the\n\nsuspects (and who also thought, wrongly, that a policeman had been\n\nshot).   The assaulting officers discovered their mistake and\n\ndispersed, leaving Cox badly injured.\n\n\n     1\n      United States v.

Cox had not seen the officers who\n\nbeat him and, although many officers had been at the scene,\n\ninformation was not readily provided.           In due course, Conley was\n\ncalled before the grand jury.    Conley testified that he had seen no\n\none beating Cox; that he had himself pursued Brown to the fence;\n\nthat he had seen no one between him and Brown and no one grabbing\n\nat Brown; that he had pursued Brown on the other side of the fence;\n\nand that after a chase of about a mile, he had caught and arrested\n\nBrown.     There is little doubt that Conley did chase and catch\n\nBrown, but prosecutors did not believe the rest of his story.\n\n            In August 1997, the grand jury indicted Conley for\n\nperjury and obstructing justice--in substance, for denying that he\n\nsaw Cox pursue Brown to the fence and for denying that he saw Cox\n\nbeing beaten.    18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1623 (2000).          At Conley's trial\n\nin June 1998, three witnesses for the government (Cox, Brown and\n\nWalker) testified that Cox chased Brown to the fence and grabbed at\n\nBrown unsuccessfully as Brown scaled it.            Brown also said that\n\nafter he landed, he saw Conley through the fence and saw other\n\nofficers (but not Conley) beating Cox.          He also identified Conley\n\nas the officer who had chased and arrested him.             Conley did not\n\ntestify.\n\n            The jury convicted Conley of lying, and of obstructing\n\njustice, in testifying that he had seen no one else pursuing Brown\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fto the fence; as for the charge that Conley had lied in denying\n\nseeing Cox being beaten, the jury acquitted Conley.             Conley was\n\nsentenced to just under three years in prison.           The sentence was\n\nstayed, and to date Conley has not served any of this sentence.           No\n\npoliceman was indicted or convicted of the beating, although three\n\nofficers--but not Conley--were found liable to Cox in a civil trial\n\nfollowing Conley's criminal trial.\n\n           On   direct   appeal,   this   court   in   1999   affirmed   the\n\nconviction.     Conley I, 186 F.3d at 26.         After the affirmance,\n\nConley in early 2000 moved for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33.   Conley identified a number of pieces of evidence that he\n\nclaimed were either newly discovered or wrongly withheld by the\n\nprosecution.     Most of the evidence would have been useful (if\n\nuseful at all) to impeach Officer Walker and--in one instance--\n\nBrown.    One other piece of evidence, comprising the civil trial\n\ntestimony of a security guard named Charles Bullard who was riding\n\nwith Cox, might (in Conley's view) have suggested that Cox could\n\nhave ended up behind Conley during the chase to the fence.\n\n           Under Rule 33, a new trial in \"the interests of justice\"\n\nmay be granted liberally on a motion made \"within 7 days\" after the\n\nverdict; but, thereafter, it can be granted solely for newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence (and then only on a motion made within three\n\nyears).   Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.       Further, under the case law, the\n\ndefendant who makes such a motion after seven days bears the heavy\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fburden of showing that the evidence would probably result in an\n\nacquittal upon retrial.

Supp. 2d at\n\n51-58; the court was less clear as to whether any had been wrongly\n\nwithheld in violation of Brady.        Id. at 51-52, 54-55.   In any\n\nevent, it ordered a new trial in \"the interests of justice,\"\n\nwithout finding prejudice under either Wright or Brady. Id. at 58.\n\nSomewhat cryptically, the district court stated in conclusion:\n\n          I conclude that the answer to the second\n          question   stated   above   [the   extent   of\n          prejudice] cannot be determined as a matter of\n          law, under . . . [Wright and Brady]. Instead,\n          in the unique circumstances of this case, I\n          conclude that the determination to allow or\n          not to allow a new trial is one committed to\n          an exercise of discretion by the court to\n          which the legal system assigns responsibility\n          for making the determination.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n          On appeal by the government, this court held in May 2001\n\nthat because the motion for a new trial was made more than seven\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdays after the verdict, the district court could not use the\n\ngeneral \"interests of justice\" standard in Rule 33 to bypass the\n\nestablished Wright and Brady prejudice requirements.    Conley III,\n\n249 F.3d at 46.   We understandably said that there was no need for\n\nus to analyze the evidence ourselves under Wright and Brady or to\n\nremand for the district court to do so; our reason was that we read\n\nthe district court's \"as a matter of law\" statement quoted above as\n\nits own ruling that the Wright and Brady tests had not been met.\n\nId.\n\n          Conley then filed the present motion in the district\n\ncourt under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000), based (more or less) on the\n\nsame newly-discovered evidence.    In September 2001, the district\n\ncourt granted the section 2255 motion, setting aside the conviction\n\nand ordering a new trial.   Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 223-24.\n\nIn doing so, the district court said that it was applying the\n\nWright test, which it deemed to have been mandated by this court's\n\nearlier decision on the Rule 33 motion.   Id. at 222.   The district\n\ncourt found expressly that the new evidence was so powerful that it\n\nwould probably cause an acquittal on retrial.     Id. at 223.   The\n\ndistrict court never reached Conley's Brady claim because it found\n\nthat a new trial was required under Wright.   Id. at 222.\n\n          On the government's appeal, a divided panel of this court\n\nagain reversed the district court.    The panel majority said that\n\nthe district court had decided in its earlier Rule 33 decision\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f(Conley II) that the Wright and Brady standards could not be\n\nsatisfied and that, on review (in Conley III), this court had\n\ndeclined    to   remand,   ruling   that   the   sentence   should   now   be\n\nexecuted.    The panel majority therefore held that the district\n\ncourt's ruling on the section 2255 motion was inconsistent with the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine.      Again, the panel declined to address on\n\nthe merits Conley's new evidence claims under Wright and Brady.\n\n            The en banc court then granted Conley's petition for\n\nrehearing, withdrawing (as is customary) the panel decision.               We\n\nnow hold that the law of the case doctrine has no application here\n\nand also that Brady but not Wright applies to new evidence claims\n\nmade in a section 2255 motion.             This leads us to vacate the\n\ndistrict court's section 2255 decision and to remand so that Conley\n\ncan obtain a ruling on his Brady claim.          We decline to decide the\n\nBrady claim ourselves in the first instance.\n\n            We start with the law of the case doctrine on which the\n\ngovernment continues to rely.       The law of the case doctrine has two\n\nbranches: one provides that, subject to exceptions, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (1st Cir. 1993), a court must\n\nrespect and follow its own rulings made at a prior stage in the\n\nsame case; the other branch--sometimes known as the mandate rule--\n\nfar more stringently precludes a lower court from contravening the\n\nrulings of a higher court made at an earlier stage of the same\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcontroversy.2 The difference is cogently described in our recent\n\ndecision in Ellis v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646-48 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          At the time that we decided Conley III, our reading of\n\nthe district court's Rule 33 decision there under review (Conley\n\nII) was surely a plausible one.    The district court had made clear\n\nin its own decision that it was not making a prejudice finding\n\nunder Wright or Brady (\"cannot be determined as a matter of law\")\n\nand it invoked \"the unique circumstances of this case\" to justify\n\nan \"exercise of discretion\" to grant a new trial--without reliance\n\nupon Wright or Brady.   Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 58.   If there\n\nwere prejudice under Wright and Brady--one might ask--why would the\n\ndistrict court have invented its own standard?         And, if the\n\ndistrict court had decided the Wright and Brady issues in Conley\n\nII, law of the case doctrine would constrain its ability to revisit\n\nthe issues now.\n\n          Yet the district court does not think its own opinion in\n\nConley II was intended to resolve the Wright and Brady issues.\n\nInvoking Wright, the district court now reaches a result opposite\n\nto the one we attributed to its Conley II decision; and nothing\n\nsuggests that the district court regards this as a contradiction of\n\n\n\n     2\n      Arizona v.

In hindsight, it is now clear\n\nthat Conley II's language--on which we relied in Conley III--is\n\nambiguous as to whether it represented a finding of no prejudice\n\nunder Wright and Brady.\n\n                What the district court said in Conley II was that the\n\nanswer to the prejudice question under Wright and Brady \"cannot be\n\ndetermined as a matter of law . . . .\"          Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 58.      Although in Conley III we understandably read this to mean\n\nthat there was no such prejudice, the phrase \"as a matter of law\"\n\ncan be used to say that an issue is not susceptible to being\n\nresolved on the existing record and that an evidentiary hearing or\n\nadditional information is needed for its resolution.                  See, e.g.,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).            This is probably the most plausible\n\nreading, for it reconciles the district court's decision in Conley\n\nII with its latest decision.\n\n                This leads us to conclude that the district court's\n\nlatest decision does not impermissibly contradict its own earlier\n\nruling in Conley II: having been told by this court in Conley III\n\nthat       it   could   not   create   its   own     standard   for     \"unique\"\n\n\n\n       3\n      The district court's newest opinion does make a passing\nreference to additional new evidence, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at\n221, but it does not describe any new evidence, let alone hold that\nit is new evidence that tips the balance.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fcircumstances, it has now simply decided an issue (Wright) that it\n\nbypassed in its earlier decision.         But the fact remains that we\n\nourselves in Conley III read Conley II as deciding that prejudice\n\nunder    Wright   and   Brady   could   not   be   established.   Is   our\n\nassumption--even if now seen to be mistaken--itself binding on the\n\ndistrict court under the mandate-rule branch of law of the case?\n\n            One might argue that a prior assumption by an appellate\n\ncourt as to what the district court meant should not be treated as\n\nlaw of the case, which is normally understood as directed to\n\nsubstantive legal rulings.       But an interpretation of a lower court\n\ndecision can be as much a contested issue as the interpretation of\n\na contract.   We are reluctant to agree that such an interpretation\n\n--at least if it was fully litigated and not merely assumed en\n\npassant, see Platoro, Ltd. v.

The government said that the district court had ruled in\nConley II that no prejudice existed; Conley's counsel urged--much\nless plausibly--that the district court's \"discretionary\" grant of\na new trial rested in substance on Wright or Brady.             The\npossibility that the district court was simply bypassing Wright and\nBrady seems not to have been argued by anyone, perhaps because it\nwould have justified a remand where both sides wished to prevail\noutright--Conley by affirmance and the government by outright\nreversal.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          Law of the case is not a straitjacket but can be avoided\n\n--at the direction of the court that made the invoked ruling--on\n\nseveral different bases.

Powerful\n\nnew evidence of innocence can satisfy one of the new \"gatekeeper\"\n\nrequirements for bringing a \"second or successive\" section 2255\n\nmotion, see 28 U.S.C. § 2255; but a traditional habeas ground is\n\nrequired once one gets through the gate.

Although this course might first appear to\n\nbe at odds with Calderon v.

Calderon's holding was\n\nexplicitly directed at the recall of a \"mandate [in a habeas\n\nproceeding in order] to revisit the merits of an earlier decision\n\ndenying habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner . . . .\"                  Id. at\n\n558.       The considerations are somewhat different where, as here, we\n\nare concerned with intra-federal proceedings and, more importantly,\n\nwhere the Conley III mandate was not issued in a habeas proceeding\n\nat all but on direct review of the denial of a new trial motion.\n\n               Nevertheless,     independent     of   Calderon,   recall    of   a\n\nmandate--other       than   to    correct    a    clerical   error--threatens\n\nimportant interests in finality and is a step to be taken only in\n\nthe most unusual circumstances.7             Defense counsel in Conley III\n\nchose in the first instance not to argue for a remand, possibly in\n\npart because of a deliberate tactical choice (see note 4 above).\n\nFurther, so far as we can tell at this stage, the \"new evidence\"\n\nwhile arguably helpful to Conley serves more to raise doubts than\n\nto establish innocence or a \"clear probability\" of an acquittal;\n\nserious doubts may be enough if Brady evidence was withheld but (as\n\nalready explained) is not normally sufficient under Wright.

Indeed, claims based on new\n\nevidence wrongfully withheld can prevail on a lesser showing of\n\nprejudice than claims based on newly-discovered evidence (because\n\nthe former assumes government misconduct).

But, of\n\ncourse, not all newly-discovered evidence fits within Brady:             the\n\nevidence must, at a bare minimum, have been within the government's\n\ngrasp and wrongly withheld from the defense.          Brady, 373 U.S. at\n\n87.   Perhaps some, but seemingly not all, of Conley's new evidence\n\nfalls within this class.\n\n            The government asserts that whether viewed through the\n\nlens of Wright or Brady, the new evidence is so thin that we should\n\nourselves   decide   without   further   ado   that    a   new   trial    is\n\nunjustified. Conley's counsel says that we should affirm the trial\n\njudge's directly contrary assessment, or, in the alternative,\n\nremand the matter to the same district judge, who has already said\n\nthat the new evidence claim under Wright is persuasive and might\n\nwell say the same under Brady.    Although reluctant to prolong this\n\nlong-lived litigation, we have concluded that neither course is\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            The evidence underlying the Brady claim has never been\n\nsystematically assembled and fully analyzed in any court in any of\n\nthe various decisions to date.            There are fragments of discussion\n\nin several of the district court decisions, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 221-23; Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-58; but nowhere are\n\nall   of   the   items    of   supposed    new    evidence   set   forth,   their\n\nsignificance considered, their status assessed under Brady, and a\n\njudgment made (based on a review of all of the evidence in the\n\nentire trial) as to whether the Brady-qualifying items of new\n\nevidence (taken together) undermine confidence in the verdict.\n\n            Save in the most straightforward case, an en banc court\n\nis not the best initial forum for this kind of undertaking.                 Some\n\nBrady issues can require fact-finding as to what the government\n\nknew and when it knew it.              And, where (as here) the case was\n\ncircumstantial      and    much   of      the    evidence    concerns   arguable\n\nimpeachment of key witnesses, en banc review is generally assisted\n\nby having a well-worked-out district court assessment before the\n\nappellate court attempts its own evaluation.\n\n            At the same time, we agree with the government that it is\n\ntime for another district judge to consider the new evidence claim\n\nafresh.     Although this court has clear authority to order that\n\nfurther proceedings be conducted before a different judge, see 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2106 (2000); Liteky v.

If he ordered a new trial yet again, it might be\n\nthought that he was wedded to an outcome; if he altered his result,\n\nConley might suppose that the judge had yielded to exhaustion or to\n\na supposed message from this court.         We have no doubt about the\n\ngood faith of the district judge, but in the peculiar circumstances\n\nof this case a fresh look is warranted, despite the cost of\n\nrequiring a new district judge to master this record.\n\n             A concluding word should be said about the duration of\n\nthis case, a point emphasized in the prosecution's brief.                 A\n\npattern of long delays in deciding criminal cases, or civil ones\n\nfor that matter, should certainly be a matter of concern for any\n\ncourt.   But in an individual appeal, especially in a criminal case\n\nwith liberty and honor at stake, the main concern is always the\n\nachievement of justice.         Justice includes the interests of the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      In four of the five districts in this circuit, including\nMassachusetts, there are formal district court rules governing\nreassignment, e.g., D. Mass. R. 40.1(i). In all districts, judges\nsometimes ask for reassignment of a remanded case even when not\ncompelled to do so.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fstate as well as the defendant, but just where justice lies in this\n\ncase is less clear than the government may suppose.\n\n           The government's evidence at trial was assuredly adequate\n\nfor conviction, but it was always circumstantial because no one\n\ntestified that he or she saw Conley looking at Cox in pursuit of\n\nBrown and Conley never admitted seeing him.         The inferences for\n\nthis circumstantial case depended importantly on testimony as to\n\nthe position of different actors at different times in a confused\n\nand changing scene in the dark of night.         Whether impeachment or\n\nother evidence was wrongfully withheld and, if so, whether its\n\nexistence shakes confidence in the jury's verdict are questions for\n\nremand, but they are questions worth answering with care, whatever\n\ntime it takes to answer them.\n\n           The district court's order granting the section 2255\n\nmotion is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court\n\nfor reassignment to a new judge in accordance with local procedures\n\nand   thereafter   for   further   proceedings   consistent   with   this\n\nopinion.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          --Dissents Follow--\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, (dissenting).           I start my\n\ndissent with a question that troubles me.        Why did this deliberate\n\nbrutal beating of Officer Cox take place? The government describes\n\nthe beating in its brief, which accurately summarizes the record:\n\n          As Cox was preparing to climb the fence in\n          pursuit of Brown, Cox was struck from behind\n          with a blunt object by police officers who\n          apparently mistook him for a suspect.      The\n          officers beat and kicked Cox repeatedly in the\n          head, back, face, and mouth. Cox then heard\n          an officer shout, \"Stop, Stop, he's a cop.\n          He's a cop,\" and the officers all fled. With\n          no one left to assist him, Cox was forced to\n          use the bumper of a police car to pull himself\n          off the ground. Cox, bleeding and seriously\n          injured, was later taken in an ambulance to a\n          hospital for treatment.\n\n\n          The majority opinion gives a terse summary of the event\n\nthat led to this case:     \"As Cox stood at the fence, he was brutally\n\nattacked and beaten by other arriving police officers who thought\n\nhe was one of the suspects (and also thought, wrongly, that a\n\npoliceman had been shot). The assaulting officers discovered their\n\nmistake and dispersed, leaving Cox badly injured.\"\n\n          Even   if   we   accept   the    hypothesis   that   the   beating\n\nresulted from mistaken identity, my question still remains. Surely\n\nit is not normal or standard police procedure to administer a\n\nbrutal beating to a fleeing felon where no resistance is made.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that Cox fought back.\n\nAll he did was try to protect himself from repeated kicks to the\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fhead.   It is troubling to me that the police acted as barbarians\n\nrather than police officers sworn to uphold the law.\n\n             But, of course, this has nothing to do with the issues\n\nbefore us.    In our quest for justice, however, I think it advisable\n\nto not only address the specific issues in a case but the framework\n\nwhich gave rise to the case.\n\n             My dissent is based on two grounds.       The first is that I\n\nthink the majority opinion has applied the wrong law.             I think the\n\ncase should have been decided on the \"law-of-the-case\" doctrine.\n\nRather than engage in an analysis of that doctrine again, I am\n\nattaching to this a copy of my panel decision setting forth in\n\ndetail why this doctrine should be applied here.\n\n             My   second   reason   for   dissenting   is   the   majority's\n\ndecision to remand. This probably means another appeal and further\n\nconsideration by the court of appeals.        I think that the case ought\n\nto be decided by the en banc court.           The majority sets forth a\n\nnumber of reasons for the remand:\n\n             The evidence underlying the Brady claim has\n             never been systematically assembled and fully\n             analyzed in any court in any of the various\n             decisions to date.    There are fragments of\n             discussion in several of the district court\n             decisions, Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 221-\n             23; Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-58; but\n             nowhere are all of the items of supposed new\n             evidence   set   forth,   their   significance\n             considered, their status assessed under Brady,\n             and a judgment made (based on a review of all\n             the evidence in the entire trial) as to\n             whether the Brady-qualifying items of new\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            evidence (taken together) undermine confidence\n            in the verdict.\n\n            Save in the most straightforward case, an en\n            banc court is not the best initial forum for\n            this kind of undertaking. Some Brady issues\n            can require fact-finding as to what the\n            government knew and when it knew it.      And,\n            where (as here) the case was circumstantial\n            and much of the evidence concerns arguable\n            impeachment of key witnesses, en banc review\n            is generally assisted by having a well-worked-\n            out district court assessment before the\n            appellate court attempts its own evaluation.\n\n            With respect, none of the stated reasons are persuasive.\n\nThe majority says that the new evidence has never been fully\n\ncollected and analyzed.    Quite the contrary is true.   There is an\n\nextensive record in this case which is familiar to the en banc\n\ncourt.   The parties themselves agree on which materials constitute\n\nthe newly discovered evidence.     All that is left is an analysis\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1963).\n\n            The majority also suggests that additional fact-finding\n\nis necessary to determine \"what the government knew and when it\n\nknew it.\"     This is true as a general matter, but is simply not\n\napplicable here.   What the government knew is only relevant to the\n\nfirst prong of the Brady determination, namely whether evidence\n\nfavorable to the accused was suppressed by the government, either\n\nwillfully or inadvertently. See Strickler v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n282 (1999).    This case has never hinged on whether the government\n\nsuppressed evidence; in fact, the government concedes in its brief\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthat the evidence was \"inadvertently overlooked . . . in providing\n\ndiscovery.\"\n\n             Instead, the focus of this case is on the final prong of\n\nBrady, which rests on whether there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, had the newly discovered evidence been disclosed to the\n\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n\nSee Kyles v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433-34 (1995).                   Deciding\n\nwhether the outcome of a trial would be different is not simply a\n\nfact-bound     issue,     it   is    interlaced      with   a   constitutional\n\ndetermination.      See Brady, 373 U.S. at 86 (explaining that the\n\noverarching issue is whether the government's conduct violates the\n\nDue Process      Clause   of   the   Fourteenth      Amendment).    Thus,   the\n\ncritical question in this case is a matter of law, not fact, and it\n\nis a question that we can decide.             See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 289\n\n(giving no deference to analysis by district court or court of\n\nappeals when examining habeas corpus petition in which defendant\n\nclaims   Brady    material     creates   a    reasonable    probability    of   a\n\ndifferent outcome).\n\n           This brings me to the majority's final reason to remand.\n\nThe majority says that it makes sense to have a district court make\n\nthe   Brady    determination        because    the   government's   case    was\n\ncircumstantial and all the newly discovered evidence relates to\n\nimpeachment of key witnesses.            On its face, this justification\n\nseems persuasive. After all, the district court judge who listened\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fto the witnesses' testimony, saw their demeanor on the stand, and\n\nobserved the jury's reaction seems best positioned to determine\n\nwhether new impeachment evidence would change the result of the\n\ntrial.    But the majority's decision to remand this case to a\n\ndifferent district court judge eviscerates any benefit that might\n\nbe gained from a remand.\n\n            We can determine whether the outcome of the trial would\n\nbe different using circumstantial and impeachment evidence just as\n\nwell as a new district court judge, and considering the appellate\n\nrecord here, with which we are all familiar, in a significantly\n\nshorter time.        Review of circumstantial evidence is part of the\n\ngristmill      for   appellate   courts.      In   addition,    circumstantial\n\nevidence is just as reliable as testimony and, at times, more\n\nreliable because it does not depend on the memory or judgment of\n\nwhat a witness saw and remembered and it is not subject to the\n\nbiases and prejudices that are part of all human beings.\n\n            With respect, I consider a remand an unnecessary waste of\n\ntime and judicial resources.         It is going to take the new district\n\ncourt untold hours to attain a working knowledge of the record,\n\nwhich this court already has.         I also point out that five of the\n\nseven members of the en banc court have had considerable experience\n\nas trial court judges.       This court is well versed in looking at a\n\nrecord   and    deciding   whether    an    outcome   of   a   trial   would   be\n\ndifferent in light of new evidence.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f            It is clear from the appellate record that Kenneth Conley\n\nhas had more than his \"day\" in court.     After being convicted by a\n\njury, Conley appealed.       We upheld the conviction unanimously.\n\nUnited States v.

We ended our opinion by stating:   \"The sentence of the\n\ndistrict court, which we affirmed in our prior opinion, shall be\n\nexecuted.\"     Id. at 47.   The sentence was not executed.      Conley\n\nfiled a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000) motion based on essentially the\n\nsame newly discovered evidence alleged in his prior case.          On\n\nappeal for a third time, we applied the \"law-of-the-case\" doctrine\n\nin a two to one opinion.        Conley's motion for an en banc was\n\ngranted and the majority opinion was recalled.\n\n             I can think of no good reason why we should revisit this\n\ncase, let alone remand it to a different district court judge.\n\nThis court has all it needs to decide the Brady issue itself.       We\n\nhave the entire record and we are familiar with it.         Moreover,\n\nplacing the case in the hands of another district court judge can\n\nbe construed to infer an abdication of our duty of review.         Our\n\nduty is to review the decision of the district court, not to look\n\nto it for help in deciding a difficult legal issue.

Because I believe this court should decide the Brady\n\nissue itself, and because I agree with the substance of Judge\n\nTorruella's analysis, I concur in his dissent.\n\n           My final comment is a direct reply to the majority's\n\ndiscussion of justice.   Simply put, \"Justice delayed is Justice\n\ndenied.\"   I think this court has a duty to decide this case and\n\nthat a remand is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f                               ATTACHMENT\n\n            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.

The\n\nconviction followed Conley's testimony before a grand jury, which\n\nwas   investigating   the   alleged   beating   of   plainclothes   police\n\nofficer Michael Cox by other police officers.\n\n            This case first came before us on direct appeal after\n\nConley's conviction.

We reverse the court below.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           We set forth the factual background and much of the\n\nprocedural history of this case in Conley I, 186 F.3d at 11-15, and\n\nConley III, 249 F.3d at 40-44, and need not reiterate it.              Only the\n\nfollowing points bear emphasis:\n\n            In his motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.   33,   Conley    focused   on    three   pieces   of   evidence:         the\n\ngovernment's failure to disclose Charles Bullard's grand jury\n\ntestimony; the government's knowing reliance on Richard Brown's\n\nperjured testimony that the Boston Police Department had brought\n\ndrug charges against him in retaliation for the testimony he gave\n\nat the civil trial; and the government's failure to disclose the\n\ntranscript   of     an   interview   of   Officer   Richard   Walker    by   the\n\nInternal Affairs Division (IAD) of the Boston Police Department, in\n\nwhich Walker made a tentative photo identification of the tall\n\nwhite officer who chased and arrested Brown as an officer other\n\nthan Conley.\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f          The district court's opinion on this motion analyzed\n\nthese three pieces of evidence.   After setting forth the standard\n\nfor a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, United States\n\nv. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380303\"><a href=\"/opinion/380303/united-states-v-henry-james-wright-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980), and a prosecutor's\n\nobligation to disclose exculpatory evidence, Brady, 373 U.S. at 87,\n\nit considered the separate and cumulative effect of the evidence.\n\nConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-55.   The district court determined\n\nthat the government's failure to disclose Bullard's grand jury\n\ntestimony did not violate Brady, and that Officer Walker's IAD\n\ninterview transcript was \"'inconclusive' as to the government's\n\nduty of disclosure and defense counsel's diligence.\"    Conley III,\n\n249 F.3d at 44.   The court went on to frame two questions for its\n\nconsideration:\n\n          [Question One:] Did the prosecution have and\n          withhold information from defense counsel that\n          would have led a reasonable person to expect\n          that a civil trial would occur, similar to the\n          civil trial that did in fact occur after the\n          criminal conviction and sentence in this case,\n          and that the testimony at the civil trial\n          would be substantially as we now know it was\n          in fact?\n\n          [Question Two:] If so, were defense counsel so\n          severely impeded in their preparation of an\n          overall   defense    strategy   and    in    the\n          performance   of   the   function   of    cross-\n          examination of those particular witnesses, out\n          of the larger number of police officers,\n          including   both  uniformed    and   undercover\n          officers, who were in the vicinity of the\n          brutal beating of Michael Cox, an undercover\n          Boston police officer, by a uniformed Boston\n          police officer, that in the interests of\n          justice a new trial should be allowed?\n\n                               -27-\n\fConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 57-58.\n\n          The district court answered the first question in the\n\naffirmative.   The second question, it stated,\n\n          cannot be determined as a matter of law, under\n          the applicable legal standard explained in\n          Part III of this opinion [discussing Wright\n          and Brady, inter alia].      Instead, in the\n          unique circumstances of this case, I conclude\n          that the determination to allow or not to\n          allow a new trial is one committed to an\n          exercise of discretion by the court to which\n          the legal system assigns responsibility for\n          making the determination.\n\nId. at 58 (emphasis added).     The district court then used the\n\ndiscretion it had given itself to order a new trial \"in the\n\ninterests of justice.\"   Id.\n\n          In our review of the district court's opinion on Conley's\n\nmotion for a new trial, we discussed the requirements for a new\n\ntrial based on newly discovered evidence and/or violation of Brady.\n\nConley III, 249 F.3d at 44-45.    We concluded that the district\n\ncourt erred in allowing a new trial \"in the interests of justice\"\n\ninstead of applying either the Wright or Brady standards:\n\n               As we explained supra, a new trial may be\n          ordered in this case only if the standards set\n          forth in Wright and/or Brady are satisfied.\n          Both Wright and Brady require a showing that\n          the evidence was material and that the\n          defendant was prejudiced to some degree. We\n          must defer to the district court's explicit\n          findings   as   to  the   Bullard  and   Brown\n          testimony, as well as to its statement that\n          prejudice could not be determined upon a\n          consideration of the evidence as a whole.\n          Therefore, there is no basis for remanding\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f            this matter, and    we   REVERSE   the   district\n            court's order.\n\nId. at 47 (internal citations omitted).         We directed that the\n\ndistrict court's sentence, which we had affirmed in Conley I, be\n\nexecuted.    Id.\n\n            Only one week after we issued Conley III, Conley brought\n\na motion to set aside conviction under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.        Again,\n\nthe district court held that Conley was entitled to relief from\n\njudgment.    Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 223-24.\n\n            In Conley IV, on appeal before us now, the district court\n\nmade the following findings:\n\n            (1) Richard Walker testified at the trial of\n            defendant Conley that Walker went through a\n            hole in the fence and made his way to the\n            bottom of an incline;\n\n            (2) when at the bottom of the incline he saw\n            two men standing in the street, one tall (six\n            feet or six feet two) and the other shorter\n            (about . . . five nine);\n\n            (3) the prosecutor used this evidence in his\n            closing to suggest that the taller was Conley;\n\n            (4) during testimony of March 27, 1995 to the\n            Internal Affairs Division (IAD) of the Boston\n            Police Department, Walker was shown a group of\n            photographs and with some uncertainty selected\n            two as persons at the bottom of the incline,\n            neither of whom was Conley;\n\n            (5) defendant Conley claims that this evidence\n            was unavailable to Conley and his attorney at\n            the criminal trial;\n\n            (6) this and other material evidence came out\n            in open court in the later trial of a civil\n            action brought by Michael Cox against several\n\n                                 -29-\n\f           officers, including the defendant Conley, in\n           December 1998, some six months after the\n           defendant was convicted in the criminal trial;\n           and\n\n           (7) even though the testimony given at the\n           December 1998 civil trial could not have been\n           withheld by the prosecutor in the criminal\n           trial, because it did not then exist, the\n           defendant Conley argued in his motion for new\n           trial and continues to press the argument now\n           that the prosecutor had withheld, during and\n           before the criminal trial, information that\n           the prosecutor then had about the IAD\n           proceedings, and if the prosecutor had made\n           that information available to Conley and his\n           attorney in time for use during the criminal\n           trial,   it  would   have  made   a  material\n           difference in the defense strategy, including\n           cross-examination.\n\nId. at 221-22.9   The court made no findings concerning the other\n\nevidence at issue in its earlier opinion, i.e., the testimony of\n\nBullard and Brown.\n\n           The district court held that the correct legal standard\n\nwas found in Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.   Conley IV, 164 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 222.   It then restated the same two questions it had formulated\n\nin Conley II, set forth supra at page 4.   It held:\n\n           The newly discovered evidence, taken together\n           with all the conflicts presented in evidence\n           known to the defense before and during the\n           criminal trial, presents a dramatically more\n           compelling basis for finding that defense\n           counsel's opportunity to present a creditable\n\n\n     9\n      The court stated that it made these findings on an \"enlarged\nrecord,\" suggesting that it was considering more or different\nevidence than it did in its earlier opinion.

Nowhere does the court explain what that evidence\nis.\n\n                                -30-\n\f           challenge to the government's case as a\n           wholeand    to   cross-examine    effectively\n           particular witnesses was severely impeded.\n\nId. at 223.\n\n           Based on the factual findings recited supra, the court\n\nconcluded that Conley satisfied the elements of the Wright test.10\n\n           I conclude that the newly discovered evidence\n           is highly probative and neither immaterial nor\n           cumulative in nature. Instead, it is evidence\n           that strikes at the heart of the prosecution's\n           case, one which is largely based on the\n           credibility of its witnesses.     Indeed, the\n           strength of this evidence leads me to find\n           that the defendant has met his burden of\n           showing a probable result of acquittal in a\n           new trial.\n\nId.

We review an application of the\n\nlaw of the case de novo.   Id.\n\n           The district court's conclusion in Conley IV that the\n\nnewly discovered evidence pertaining to Walker satisfied the Wright\n\ncriteria is foreclosed by these doctrines.      First, the district\n\ncourt essentially reversed course as to whether the Walker evidence\n\nfulfilled the requirement of prejudice.    In its previous decision,\n\nit held that the question of prejudice \"cannot be determined as a\n\nmatter of law\" under the standards set forth in Wright and Brady.\n\nConley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 58.   That same evidence, it now says,\n\nis sufficient to warrant a new trial under Wright.    Conley IV, 164\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 222.11\n\n           Moreover, the district court's most recent treatment of\n\nthe Walker evidence is at odds with its previous ruling as to at\n\nleast one other key element.     Earlier, it called Walker's IAD\n\n\n     11\n      In its opinion in Conley II, the district court discussed in\nsome depth the testimony of Bullard and Brown, and made clear that\nits holding as to prejudice encompassed the entirety of that newly\ndiscovered and/or disclosed evidence. 103 F. Supp. 2d at 51-54.\nThe district court's opinion in Conley IV, however, referenced only\nthe Walker evidence as a basis for its allowance of Conley's § 2255\nmotion. 164 F. Supp. 2d at 221-22.       Although it mentioned the\nBullard and Brown testimony, it did so only in the context of\n\"Background Criminal Proceedings.\" Id. at 218. We read Conley IV,\ntherefore, as premising its determination of a Wright violation\nsolely on the Walker evidence.\n\n                                 -33-\n\ftestimony \"inconclusive\" as to the government's duty of disclosure\n\nand defense counsel's diligence.           Conley II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 55.\n\nIn Conley III, however, the court held that the Walker evidence\n\nsatisfied all of the elements of Wright, including, by inference,\n\nthe requirement that Conley's failure to learn of the evidence was\n\nnot attributable to his lack of diligence.             164 F. Supp. 2d at 223\n\n(discussing Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019).\n\n            In Conley III, we discussed and affirmed the district\n\ncourt's factual findings as to these elements of the Wright test,\n\nand instructed the court to carry out Conley's sentence.               249 F.3d\n\nat 46-47.      That decision binds the district court.             See Withrow,\n\n507 U.S. at 721; Field, 157 F.3d at 40.               Accordingly, we reverse\n\nthe district court's order setting aside Conley's conviction.\n\n            We know of no additional evidence that would explain the\n\ndistrict court's new and contrary conclusions as to prejudice and\n\ndefense counsel's diligence.            While the district court mentions in\n\npassing an \"enlarged record,\" it makes no specific findings that\n\nsupport its about-face.           Furthermore, the legal claims, although\n\nrecast in the form of a § 2255 petition, did not differ from the\n\nclaims before the district court and before us in Conley III.                See\n\nTracy,   739    F.2d   at   682    (a    petitioner   is   still   barred   from\n\nrelitigating the subject matter of claims on collateral review even\n\nif he recasts them in different nomenclature).              Nor was there any\n\nmaterial change in the controlling law following Conley III.                 See\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fid.   Hence, we see no reason not to preclude the district court's\n\nreadjudication of settled issues.\n\n           For   these   reasons,   we     REVERSE   the   decision   of   the\n\ndistrict court.    We remand this case to the Chief Judge of the\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts with instructions\n\nthat Conley's thirty-four-month sentence be executed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).          Although I fully\n\nagree with Judge Bownes's dissenting opinion, I write separately to\n\naddress the majority's decision to remand this case.                In our\n\nattempt to find and apply the proper legal framework with which to\n\nanalyze Conley's new evidence claims, this Court, together with the\n\ndistrict court, has now heard the same arguments made regarding the\n\nsame body of evidence on six separate occasions.           Now, straining\n\nsuch jurisprudential norms as finality and repose to their breaking\n\npoint, the majority elects to remand Conley's new evidence claims\n\n-- claims with which this Court is all too familiar -- to a new\n\ndistrict judge for fresh consideration.      Respectfully, I disagree\n\nwith the majority's decision to remand this case, as well as the\n\nsubstantive reasons for doing so.\n\n          Besides regard for finality, there are three reasons why\n\nthis en banc Court would have been the best forum to hear Conley's\n\nBrady claim. First, we have developed an intimate familiarity with\n\nthe record, a familiarity matched only by Judge Keeton and the\n\nparties themselves.   Second, the record before us is complete: no\n\nadditional   fact-finding   is   required   to   assess    the   merits   of\n\nConley's Brady claim.       Both parties invited us to decide this\n\nmatter and have had full opportunity to collect all of the evidence\n\nrelevant to the consideration of Conley's claims.           Moreover, the\n\nparties agree upon the scope of the evidence to be considered under\n\nBrady and there are no facts in dispute regarding the government's\n\n\n                                  -36-\n\fknowledge or suppression of evidence.           Finally, once the heavy-\n\nlifting is done -- once all the new evidence in question has been\n\nproperly catalogued, labeled and evaluated -- it is evident that\n\nunder Brady, there is simply no basis for remand.\n\n             Therefore, although I am troubled by the majority's\n\nsomewhat tortured efforts to construct an exception to the law of\n\nthe case to apply to this case, I do not focus my dissent on the\n\nmajority's handling of that doctrine.         Instead, I will concentrate\n\non the merits of Conley's Brady claim.         Assuming arguendo that the\n\nlaw of the case does not now bar Conley's claims, and agreeing with\n\nthe majority that Brady, and not Wright, applies to new evidence\n\nclaims made in a section 2255 motion, I dissent today because there\n\nis no purpose to be served by remanding this case to the district\n\ncourt, and no plausible basis upon which, on remand, the district\n\ncourt might grant a new trial.\n\n             Assessing the merits of Conley's Brady claim requires\n\nreconstruction of a good deal of trial testimony, as well as\n\naccounting for all of the items of new evidence that might come\n\nunder the Brady umbrella.         Thus, to establish that Conley's Brady\n\nevidence   does   not    create   a   \"reasonable    probability     that   the\n\nsuppressed    evidence    would    have   produced   a   different   verdict\"\n\nStrickler v.

The Trial Testimony12\n\n          In his grand jury testimony, Conley testified that he was\n\nthe first officer in pursuit of Robert Brown.     He stated that he\n\nwas forty feet behind Brown and that he climbed over the chain link\n\nfence \"seconds after\" Brown did.   He further testified that he did\n\nnot see Michael Cox or any other plainclothes officer chasing Brown\n\nahead of him.\n\n          The testimony of Michael Cox, Robert Brown, and Richard\n\nWalker conflicts with Conley's account.       As we stated in our\n\noriginal opinion on the sufficiency of the evidence:\n\n                 Both Cox and Walker placed Cox at the\n          exact same place where Conley claims to have\n          climbed over the fence.    According to their\n          testimony . . . Cox was \"right behind\" Brown,\n          approximately three feet behind him, as Brown\n          approached the fence. When Brown reached the\n          fence, Cox was even closer.    At that point,\n          Cox was close enough to make contact with\n          Brown and attempt to pull him back over the\n          fence.   Brown corroborated this version of\n          events when he testified that a black man\n          wearing a \"black hoody\" was behind him as he\n          ran toward the fence and had just started to\n          come over the fence after him when he observed\n          the black man being struck on the head by a\n          police officer.    Brown confirmed that the\n          person behind him was close enough to make\n          contact with his foot as he scaled the fence.\n\n                 Conley's testimony that he scaled the\n          fence \"within seconds\" of seeing Brown go over\n          the fence, and that he scaled the fence in the\n          same location as Brown does not square with\n\n\n     12\n      For a comprehensive summary of the evidence presented at\ntrial, see United States v.

According to Walker, once Brown made it over the fence\nsuccessfully, Walker ran toward a hole in the fence. Walker then\nproceeded through the hole and down an incline, falling a couple of\ntimes.

All of\n\nConley's new evidence can be sorted into three categories: (1)\n\nCharles Bullard's grand jury and civil trial testimony [\"Bullard\n\nTestimony\"]; (2) the allegedly perjured testimony of Robert Brown\n\n[\"Brown Testimony\"]; and (3) the statements and testimony of\n\nRichard Walker [\"Walker Evidence\"].            As Conley's Brady claim has\n\ncome into sharper focus, it is now apparent that his hopes for a\n\nnew trial under Brady hinge entirely upon the impeachment value of\n\nthis last category of exhibits, the Walker Evidence.15           However, to\n\nprovide a comprehensive account of all Conley's new evidence, I\n\nwill briefly dispatch the Bullard and Brown testimony before\n\nappraising the weight of the Walker Evidence.\n\n\n     14\n      For this reason, I find the majority's comment that this\nevidence   was  \"adequate   for  conviction,   but  was  always\ncircumstantial\" an extraordinary one considering that the\nsufficiency of the evidence was long ago decided. Although I am\nsure unintended, the comment constitutes an inappropriate\ndiminution of Conley I, which cannot but have an influence on\nfuture proceedings.\n     15\n      Although Conley previously argued that the Bullard and Brown\ntestimony were part of the new evidence justifying a new trial,\nbecause neither the Bullard nor the Brown testimony can reasonably\nbe considered exculpatory, the testimonies' materiality need not be\nassessed under     Brady.     Strickler,   527  U.S.   at   281-82.\nAdditionally, at oral argument Conley's attorney conceded that\nbecause the district court determined that the Bullard and Brown\nevidence was not exculpatory, it was not part of Conley's current\nBrady challenge.\n\n                                        -40-\n\f            A.    The Bullard Testimony\n\n            Charles Bullard was a Boston security guard who was\n\nriding in the same vehicle as Officer Cox when Cox's car came to a\n\nstop at the end of Woodruff Way.              Bullard testified before the\n\ngrand jury but was not called as a witness at trial.               Six months\n\nafter Conley was convicted, Bullard testified in a civil suit\n\nbrought by Michael Cox against several officers.\n\n            In the civil trial, Bullard testified that Cox exited the\n\npassenger side of the unmarked police cruiser and went forward to\n\nthe front of the Lexus.         Bullard testified that he \"lost track of\n\n[Cox] after that,\" and that he never saw Cox run toward the fence.\n\nAccording to Conley (who has argued that Cox did not run directly\n\nto the fence), Bullard's testimony that Cox went to the front of\n\nthe Lexus, and not directly to the fence, contradicted Cox's\n\ntestimony and supported Conley's theory of events.\n\n            Although Bullard's subsequent civil trial testimony is\n\nobviously   not    a   matter   which   the   government   might   have   been\n\nrequired to disclose under Brady, Conley has argued that Bullard's\n\ncivil trial testimony was sufficiently similar to his grand jury\n\ntestimony, such that the grand jury testimony should have been\n\ndisclosed to the defense.          Conley's argument is based upon an\n\naffidavit by Bullard, in which Bullard stated that to the best of\n\nhis recollection, his testimony before the grand jury was the same\n\nas the testimony he gave before the civil trial.\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f           The district court concluded that the Bullard Testimony\n\nwas not evidence that the government was required to disclose under\n\nBrady.   United States v. Conley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469527\"><a href=\"/opinion/2469527/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51-52 (D.Mass.\n\n2000) (\"Conley II\").    The court found that Bullard's civil trial\n\ntestimony differed from his testimony before the grand jury in\n\nmaterial respects. Specifically, the court noted that in his grand\n\njury testimony, Bullard said nothing about Cox going forward to the\n\nfront of the Lexus; instead, he testified that \"Cox jumped out and\n\nwent toward the right.\"    Id.   Because the Bullard Testimony is in\n\nno way exculpatory, it does not come within the rubric of Brady.\n\nStrickler, 527 U.S. 281-82.\n\n           B.   The Brown Testimony\n\n           Conley claimed that Robert Brown perjured himself at\n\ntrial when he stated that state drug charges pending against him\n\nwere manufactured by Boston police in retaliation for his testimony\n\nagainst Conley. According to the defense, the prosecution elicited\n\nthis testimony in order to lend credibility to Brown by portraying\n\nhim as having suffered for his testimony.       See Conley II, 103\n\nF.Supp. 2d at 52-54 (setting forth the perjury allegation in\n\nconsiderable detail). Conley alleged that the prosecutor solicited\n\nperjurious statements from Brown in direct examination and then\n\nrelied on those statements in his closing argument. Conley has\n\nclaimed that the government knew that Brown's statements were\n\n\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fperjurious because of a federal narcotics investigation against\n\nBrown.\n\n             Although it is difficult to see how the Brown Testimony\n\nmight be brought under the ambit of Brady, that is not an issue\n\nthat    needs     to   be     addressed    now    because   the   district     court\n\ndetermined that Conley failed to show that the Brown Testimony was\n\nperjurious.       Id. at 54.         The court found no evidence that Brown\n\nperjured himself,            and   additionally,    expressed     skepticism      that\n\nevidence of a pending federal drug investigation against Brown\n\nwould have been admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 403, 404(b) and\n\n608(b).     Because the court concluded as a matter of law that there\n\nwas    no   perjury,     there      was   no   exculpatory    evidence    for      the\n\ngovernment to disclose under Brady.\n\n             C.      The Walker Evidence\n\n             At oral argument, the parties made two helpful and\n\nimportant concessions regarding the scope and significance of the\n\nWalker Evidence for Brady analysis purposes.                  For its part, the\n\ngovernment conceded that the Walker Evidence was in its possession\n\nand should have been turned over to the defense under Brady and its\n\nprogeny. Consequently, we are not faced with any dispute regarding\n\nwhat the government knew, or when it knew it.\n\n             Conley's attorney also narrowed the scope of our Brady\n\ninquiry by providing us with what was described as a \"complete\n\ninventory\"      of     the    possible    Brady    material   pertinent      to    the\n\n\n                                          -43-\n\ftestimony of Richard Walker.   Conley has identified four documents\n\nrelating to the Walker's testimony which he claims should have been\n\ndisclosed under Brady.   These are: (1) Walker's March 27, 1995\n\ntestimony to the Internal Affairs Division (\"IAD\") of the Boston\n\nPolice Department (the \"IAD Testimony\"); (2) an internal FBI\n\nmemorandum concerning a proposed polygraph examination of Walker\n\n(\"FBI Memorandum\"); (3) a January 30, 1995 memorandum by Lieutenant\n\nKevin Foley of the BPD Anti-Gang Unit (\"Foley Memorandum\"); and (4)\n\na skeletal BPD report prepared by Walker on February 20, 1995 (the\n\n\"Skeletal Report\").\n\n\n\n\n                                -44-\n\f                  (1)    Walker's IAD Testimony\n\n          On March 27, 1995, IAD agents interviewed Walker about\n\nhis observations on the night of the Cox assault. During the\n\ninterview, Walker was shown a group of photographs in order to\n\nidentify the plainclothes officers Walker observed at the bottom of\n\nthe incline.\n\n          When asked to describe the tall white male he saw at the\n\nbottom of the hill, Walker testified, \"All I know is he was a very\n\ntall white male.        He was medium build. I forget what he was\n\nwearing.\" Walker was then given a group of photographs of officers\n\nfrom the Anti-Gang Unit, a unit that Conley was not in, and asked\n\nhim to try to identify the officers he saw.       During the interview,\n\nWalker identified the photographs of two officers, Joseph Teahan\n\nand   Michael   DeStefano.     He   was   notably   tentative   in   his\n\nidentification, stating, \"Like I said, I'm not sure about these\n\nphotographs, but it looks like the tall officer.\"\n\n          Conley claims that he was prejudiced by the suppression\n\nof the IAD Testimony because access to the testimony would have\n\nenabled him to make an issue of Walker's credibility at trial.       The\n\ntestimony would have allowed him to impeach Walker's memory of\n\nevents, because Walker's subsequent inability to identify the tall\n\nwhite officer conflicts with the inference made at trial that\n\nConley was the tall white officer at the bottom of the hill.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -45-\n\f          In response, the government offers a number of arguments\n\nwhy the IAD Testimony offers no significant impeachment value, and\n\nfurther, why Walker's unimpeached testimony helped, rather than\n\nhurt, the defense's theory of the case.\n\n          First, the government argues that neither Walker nor the\n\ngovernment ever suggested that Walker could identify Conley as the\n\ntall, white officer he observed.       Instead, it was circumstantial\n\nevidence, corroborated by Conley's own testimony, that established\n\nthat the tall, white officer was the same one he chased after and\n\nto whom he returned the dropped radio.\n\n          Second,   the   \"misidentification\"   evidence   would   have\n\nactually weakened the defense offered at trial.       That the tall,\n\nwhite officer described by Walker's testimony was in fact Conley\n\nwas a point defense counsel diligently tried to prove at trial.\n\nPlacing Conley at the bottom of the hill ahead of Walker helped the\n\ndefense by allowing it to argue that Conley would not have had time\n\nto witness Cox's beating before Conley scaled the fence.      Defense\n\ncounsel's closing argument shows that Conley went to great lengths\n\nto use the Walker testimony to prove that Walker observed Conley at\n\nthe bottom of the incline.   Discussing Walker's testimony, defense\n\ncounsel stated, \"I believe from the evidence it is fair to say that\n\nthere can be no doubt in your mind that the tall white officer in\n\nplainclothes was Ken Conley.\"     The defense alluded to the ample\n\n\n\n\n                                -46-\n\fcircumstantial evidence tending to show that the tall, white\n\nofficer was indeed Conley.\n\n          During the chase, the tall white officer\n          dropped his radio.    Officer Walker says he\n          picked it up. And when the tall white officer\n          apprehended the suspect, put the cuffs on him,\n          with Walker assisting, he gave him back his\n          radio, you dropped this.        Walker cannot\n          identify Ken Conley as being that officer. He\n          did not know him, he had not seen him before,\n          and, if you will note, he did not identify him\n          in this courtroom as being that officer. But\n          if you take that testimony in conjunction with\n          [Conley's] Grand Jury testimony that was read\n          to you, you will see that Ken Conley, when he\n          testified before the Grand Jury, said that\n          during the pursuit, I dropped my radio and a\n          black uniformed officer picked it up and gave\n          it to me. There is no doubt that Ken Conley\n          was the tall white officer who apprehended\n          Brown.\n\nTr. IV:51-52 (emphasis added).        According to the government,\n\nwhatever impeachment value the IAD Testimony might have in the\n\nabstract, it was never in Conley's interest to impeach Walker's\n\nability to recall events at Woodruff Way.\n\n          Finally, the government argues that the core of Walker's\n\ntestimony was that he observed Cox running closely behind Brown,\n\nchasing him to the fence and reaching for him.   This testimony was\n\ncorroborated by both Cox and Brown and stood in stark contrast to\n\nConley's statement that he followed Brown to the fence and did not\n\nobserve anyone chasing after Brown.     Thus, although Walker's IAD\n\nidentifications may have sewn confusion about who was at the bottom\n\n\n\n\n                               -47-\n\fof   the   hill,   it   was    immaterial     to    the    essence   of   Walker's\n\ncorroborated testimony.\n\n                    (2)   The FBI Memorandum\n\n            The second document in Conley's Brady claim is an FBI\n\nmemorandum concerning a proposed polygraph examination of Walker\n\nregarding inconsistent statements he made in his accounts of the\n\nassault. At Walker's first interview with IAD on February 23, 1995\n\n(properly disclosed to the defense), Walker stated three times that\n\nhe saw someone he believed to be a police officer running behind\n\nCox as Cox chased the suspect to the fence.               However, in subsequent\n\ntestimony (also disclosed), Walker made no mention of seeing anyone\n\nrunning behind Cox.\n\n            When the federal investigation began and the government\n\nreviewed Walker's IAD interview on April 9, 1997, investigators met\n\nwith Walker and questioned him about the discrepancy.                 After that\n\ninterview,     investigators         prepared      a   memorandum     requesting\n\npermission    to   polygraph       Walker   regarding      the   inconsistencies.\n\nWalker agreed      to   take   a    polygraph      examination.      However,   an\n\nattorney representing Walker later notified the FBI that Walker\n\nwould decline to take the polygraph.\n\n             The FBI Memorandum, which was not turned over to the\n\ndefense, related: (1) Walker's initial willingness to submit to a\n\npolygraph examination; (2) his present belief that he did not see\n\nanyone running behind Cox; (3) that when investigators confronted\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fhim about the inconsistency between his present belief and his\n\nprior statements, he explained that because of his friendship with\n\nCox, he must have \"convinced himself that he actually saw someone\n\nor something\" when in fact he did not; and (4) that Walker\n\n\"suggested that perhaps if he was hypnotised [sic] he might truly\n\nrecall what was going on versus what he indicates was tunnel\n\nvision.\"\n\n            Most of these facts ((1)-(3)) were thoroughly elicited in\n\nWalker's testimony before the federal grand jury on June 5, 1997.\n\nThere, Walker testified that he did not see anyone running behind\n\nCox.    During his grand jury testimony, Walker's IAD interview was\n\nread back to him at length, and Walker was asked to explain the\n\ndiscrepancy   between    his   grand   jury   testimony   and    his   prior\n\ninconsistent statements. Walker acknowledged the inconsistency and\n\nexplained his prior statements by asserting that he was probably\n\nmotivated by a feeling of guilt \"for not seeing more than [he]\n\nsaw.\"\n\n           Because Conley had access to the IAD interviews, as well\n\nas Walker's grand jury testimony, the defense was in possession of\n\nnearly all the information contained in the FBI Memorandum.              It\n\nalready    possessed    substantial    information   regarding    Walker's\n\ninconsistent statements and his explanation of the discrepancy\n\nbetween those statements.      The only information Conley would have\n\ngleaned from the disclosure of the FBI memorandum that he was not\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\falready in possession of was (1) that Walker consented to submit to\n\na polygraph examination (which he later refused to take); and (2)\n\nthe FBI's notes regarding Walker's cryptic statement that if\n\nhypnotized, he might be better able to explain the discrepancy\n\nbetween his inconsistent statements.\n\n                   (3)   The Foley Memorandum\n\n           Conley also alleges that a January 30, 1995 memorandum by\n\nLieutenant Kevin Foley of the BPD Anti-Gang Unit is Brady material\n\nthat must be considered in his challenge.       The three-page memo,\n\nprepared less than a week after the Cox assault, summarizes facts\n\nthat Foley believed justified launching an investigation into the\n\nassault.\n\n           According to Conley, the Foley Memorandum states that\n\nOfficers Ryan and Teahan came upon Cox lying on a patch of ice as\n\nthey were returning to their police cars -- not when they arrived\n\non Woodruff way.    This statement would support the defense view\n\nthat it was actually Ryan and Teahan who Walker encountered at the\n\nbottom of the hill, not Conley.\n\n           The government argues that the Foley Memorandum    proves\n\nvery little.    First, the government notes that nowhere in the\n\nreport, written five days after the incident, does Foley indicate\n\nthat he spoke with members of the Gang Unit, much less Teahan or\n\nRyan in particular.      Thus, whether Teahan and Ryan even gave a\n\nconflicting account of their actions, or to whom, is not shown by\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\fthe memorandum.       Second, because Officers Teahan and Ryan gave\n\nsworn testimony at trial and to previous grand juries contending\n\nthat they drove down the cul-de-sac and spotted Cox lying on the\n\nground, it is immaterial whether Lieutenant Foley believes they\n\nwere actually returning to their vehicle.\n\n                  (4)    Walker's Skeletal Report\n\n          The final piece of evidence in Conley's Brady claim is\n\nWalker's February 20, 1995 report of events, which he was ordered\n\nto write by his commanding officer.              According to Conley, the\n\nreport is significant because it was prepared by Walker almost\n\ncontemporaneously with the assault, yet it lacks any of the facts\n\nhe recounted at trial.        The report is indeed skeletal, containing\n\nonly a few sentences of text explaining the events on Woodruff Way.\n\nConley argues that its omissions could have been usefully exploited\n\nduring cross examination.\n\n          The government contends that although the skeletal report\n\ndoes not contain any details, its usefulness for impeaching Walker\n\nwould be greatly diminished by the fact that in the same memo in\n\nwhich Walker was instructed to write the report, he was ordered to\n\nappear for an interview with IAD three days later.                    At that\n\ninterview,   Walker    gave    a     highly   detailed   accounting   of   his\n\nobservations.\n\n                              III.    Discussion\n\n\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\f           Assuming that the four pieces of Walker Evidence should\n\nhave been disclosed under Brady, the withholding of evidence does\n\nnot warrant reversal except upon a showing of prejudice, that is,\n\nunless there is a \"reasonable probability that the suppressed\n\nevidence would have produced a different verdict.\"              Strickler, 527\n\nU.S. at 281.    In this context, \"reasonable probability\" means a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.

See Tr. II at 51-52.\n\n                                -53-\n\falready had knowledge of, Conley is only left with Walker's cryptic\n\nhypnotism statement, his skeletal police report, and his refusal to\n\nsubmit to a polygraph examination.17\n\n           Such weak impeachment evidence is not sufficient to\n\nwarrant   the   drastic   remedy   of    a   new   trial.    While    Walker's\n\nstatement that if hypnotized, \"he might truly recall what was going\n\non,\" does support the notion that he was uncertain about his memory\n\nof the events on Woodruff Way; this does not undercut Walker's\n\ntestimony (corroborated by Cox and Brown) that he saw Cox chasing\n\nBrown to the fence and that as Brown scaled the fence, Cox tried to\n\nreach for him.       Moreover, in the face of Walker's many detailed\n\nstatements (one of which was given three days after the memorandum\n\nwas prepared) the fact that his February 20, 1995 memorandum is\n\nskeletal is immaterial.\n\n           Since it was never in Conley's interest to impeach the\n\ncredibility     of   Richard   Walker,   the   exculpatory    value    of   the\n\nhypnotism statement and skeletal report is de minimus.                  During\n\ncross examination and closing arguments, the defense attempted to\n\ndemonstrate circumstantially (through evidence of the dropped and\n\nrecovered radio) that Conley was the officer Walker saw at the\n\n\n\n     17\n      Conley has not shown how Walker's refusal to submit to a\npolygraph examination would have been admissible at trial.

This is not a strategy that Conley was stuck\n\nwith for lack of better evidence: Conley possessed -- and elected\n\nnot to use -- ample impeachment evidence undercutting Walker's\n\ntestimony.      Conley      had evidence that: (1) Walker and Cox were\n\nfriends; (2) that Walker felt guilty about not seeing more; (3)\n\nthat this guilt led to Walker making prior inconsistent statements;\n\nand (4) that Walker believed that an \"Officer Ryan\" (rather than\n\nConley) was the officer who arrested Brown.              Instead of using this\n\nevidence, Conley chose to rely on Walker's testimony to establish\n\nthat Conley was down the hill, and therefore could not have\n\nobserved the beating, and further, that like Walker, Conley had\n\n\"tunnel vision\" so he was not lying when he said he did not see Cox\n\nchasing Brown.      Therefore, Conley's argument that he would have\n\nused   the     Walker    Evidence     to   undercut    Walker's   testimony   is\n\nunavailing.\n\n                                IV.    Conclusion\n\n             Conley's Brady claim should not be remanded to the\n\ndistrict court.         Both parties have requested that this Court make\n\nthe    final    Brady     assessment,      and   the   straightforward   Brady\n\nmateriality issue presented here -- whether the existence of\n\nwithheld Walker documents shakes confidence in the jury verdict --\n\nis highly amenable to resolution by this en banc Court.\n\n             I cannot conceive how any court could find that the\n\nnondisclosure of the Walker Evidence undermines confidence in the\n\n\n                                        -55-\n\foutcome of Conley's trial.       The impeachment evidence contained in\n\nthe four documents was largely minor and cumulative; much of the\n\ninformation was already known to the defense. Finally, none of the\n\nnew   evidence   undercuts   Walker's     core   testimony   at    trial    --\n\ncorroborated by Cox and Brown -- that Walker observed Cox running\n\nto the fence right behind Brown.          The majority's decision today\n\nneedlessly postpones the inevitable day when this Court or another\n\nfinally concludes that there is no reasonable probability that, had\n\nthe   Walker   Evidence   been   properly   disclosed,   the      results   of\n\nConley's trial would have been different.        I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -56-\n\f</pre>",
