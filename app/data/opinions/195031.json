The  defendant challenges\n                               \n\nthe twenty-seven month sentence imposed under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  after  he   pleaded  guilty  to  one   count  of\n\ninterstate transportation of stolen property in violation of\n\n18  U.S.C.      2314,   and  four   counts  of   structuring\n\ntransactions to evade reporting requirements in violation of\n\n31  U.S.C.     5324(a)(3).1    On  appeal,  he  asserts  the\n\ndistrict court improperly  (1) included the loss  of eighty-\n\nthree2 computer boards  (\"boards\") as relevant  conduct when\n\ndetermining  his  sentence  and (2)  imposed  a  sentence in\n\nexcess of  Guideline provisions  by calculating  his offense\n\nlevel based upon an inflated value of the victim's loss.  We\n\naffirm.\n\n                            I.  \n\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n     Digital  Equipment  Corporation  (\"DEC\")  employed  the\n\ndefendant  as  a  packaging   engineer  at  its   Westfield,\n\n                    \n\n1The  court  dismissed   six  counts   of  the   Superseding\nIndictment on motion of the United States.\n\n2In  their   briefs,  the   defendant  and   the  government\nmistakenly  stated that  the  number  of  boards  viewed  as\nrelevant conduct was  seventy-three.  At oral  argument, the\ndefendant conceded that  the appropriate number  was eighty-\nthree.\n\n                            -2-\n                             2\n\nMassachusetts plant.  He earned an hourly wage of $15.50 for\n\nan approximate annual salary of $32,240.\n\n     Beginning in 1988 and continuing through 1990 and while\n\nemployed at DEC,  the defendant sold 241  DEC boards without\n\ninvoices,  receipts or  other  documentary  evidence of  the\n\ntransactions to Execudata,  a sole proprietorship owned  and\n\noperated  by Peter  Marcantonio.   From  1989 through  1990,\n\nMarcantonio  wire-transferred  $959,293 to  the  defendant's\n\naccount  at  United Cooperative  Bank  in West  Springfield,\n\nMassachusetts  (\"United Cooperative\")  and  $196,473 to  the\n\ndefendant's  account at First  Union Bank in  Pompano Beach,\n\nFlorida (\"First Union\").   Unlike the defendant, Marcantonio\n\nmaintained business records that included the serial numbers\n\nof the 241 DEC boards.\n\n     After being alerted by United Cooperative of suspicious\n\ncash withdrawals, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") began\n\ninvestigating the defendant's activities.  During the course\n\nof this  investigation, IRS  agents showed  DEC officials  a\n\nlist of serial numbers provided to them by Marcantonio.  DEC\n\nsecurity officers  reviewed the Westfield  plant's inventory\n\nand discovered that  112 of the 241 boards  had been removed\n\nfrom the  stockroom without authorization.   The  government\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nwas unable  to trace  the other 129  boards to  determine if\n\nthey were stolen.  \n\n     After the  grand jury returned a Superseding Indictment\n\non  July 23,  1992,  the defendant  pleaded  guilty to  four\n\ncounts  of   structuring  currency  transactions   to  evade\n\nreporting  requirements  and  to  one  count  of  interstate\n\ntransportation of stolen property.\n\n     At the  defendant's sentencing hearing,  the government\n\nconceded it could  trace to the Westfield  plant's stockroom\n\nonly   112  of  the   241  boards  the   defendant  sold  to\n\nMarcantonio.  The  government also conceded that  a majority\n\nof the  missing  boards were  used.   On  the basis  of  the\n\ngovernment's concessions, the district court found DEC could\n\nnot confirm the  number of missing boards that  were used or\n\nnew.    The  district court  concluded  that  the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines  did not require a precise determination of DEC's\n\nloss and  permitted it to  infer the  amount of loss  on the\n\nbasis  of  reasonable  reliable  information, including  the\n\nscope of the operation.   The district court also noted that\n\nthe probation department  may have had the right  to use the\n\nretail value of  the boards to value DEC's  loss.  The court\n\nfound the  loss was more  than $800,000, but did  not exceed\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n$1,489,746,  the retail  value  suggested  by  DEC  for  new\n\nboards.3   The district  court adopted the  factual findings\n\nand  Sentencing  Guideline  application  in the  presentence\n\nreport and determined that the defendant's offense level was\n\nseventeen  and his  criminal  history category  was I.   See\n                                                            \n\nU.S.S.G.   2B1.2 (1992).4   The defendant was sentenced to a\n\nterm  of twenty-seven months'  imprisonment on one  count of\n\ninterstate transportation of stolen property and to the same\n\nterm  to  be  served concurrently  on  the  four structuring\n\ncounts.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                    \n\n3In  its brief,  the  government  states  that  the  figures\nprovided by DEC reflect the price for new boards.

Relevant Conduct\n\n     The defendant asserts the government failed to prove by\n\na  preponderance of  the evidence  that eighty-three  boards\n\nwere stolen and  the court improperly included  those boards\n\nas  relevant conduct in determining his sentence.  According\n\nto the defendant, there are alternative explanations for the\n\ndisappearance  of the eighty-three boards.  He denies having\n\naccess  to all  areas in  which the  boards were  stored and\n\nrefutes  the hearsay  statements  to  the  contrary  by  DEC\n\nemployees  mentioned in  the presentence  report.   He  also\n\nargues  that at the sentencing hearing, the court implicitly\n\nfound  the eighty-three  boards were  not  stolen.5   Absent\n\n                    \n\n5After the defendant  objected to the contents  of paragraph\n19 of the presentence report, the court stated \"I'm going to\nallow paragraph 19 to remain intact.  Because once again, it\ndoes not reveal that the boards  in fact were stolen.  So  I\ndon't see  any impact  on the  defendant in  that scenario.\"\nWhile the defendant believes that the court implicitly found\nthat the boards were not stolen, the court was not precluded\nfrom  later finding,  on  the  basis  of  other  information\ncontained in the presentence report, that the boards were in\nfact  stolen.   It merely  noted that  paragraph 19  made no\nmention that the eighty-three boards were stolen.  Paragraph\n19 of the presentence report provides:\n     IRS Agents contacted  DEC with the list  of serial\n     numbers  of computer  boards  sold by  Skrodzki to\n     Marcantonio.  After a thorough review of inventory\n     records, DEC security  determined that 112  of the\n     boards including the  29 listed in the  indictment\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nproof the  boards were  stolen, the  defendant contends  the\n\ndistrict  court could not  have considered them  as relevant\n\nconduct.\n\n     The district  court may include  relevant conduct--\"the\n\nsame  course of  conduct or  common  scheme or  plan as  the\n\noffense  of   conviction\"--in  its   determination  of   the\n\napplicable offense level.  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2).  \"For two\n\nor more  offenses to constitute  part of a common  scheme or\n\nplan, they must be substantially connected  to each other by\n\nat least one  common factor, such as common  victims, common\n\naccomplices,  common purpose,  or  similar modus  operandi.\"\n                                                          \n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3, comment. (n.9).  To sentence the defendant\n\nfor relevant conduct,  the court must be  satisfied that the\n\ngovernment  demonstrated by a  preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat  the  defendant   unlawfully  transported  eighty-three\n\nstolen boards.   See  United States  v. Estrada-Molina,  931\n                                                      \n\nF.2d 964, 966 (1st Cir. 1991) (government's demonstration by\n\na  preponderance of  evidence of  defendant's capability  of\n\nproducing   negotiated  but   undelivered  drugs   permitted\n\n                    \n\n     should  still  be  in   DEC  stockrooms.     These\n     stockrooms  are not secure  areas and Skrodzki had\n     access to any equipment  stored in the stockrooms.\n     The computer boards  are no larger than a  11 x 14\n     notebook  and  could  easily  be  concealed  in  a\n     briefcase.   However,  their  retail value  ranges\n     from $1,350 to $18,970 apiece. \n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\ndistrict court to  impose a sentence that  included relevant\n\nconduct).   We review  for clear  error the  court's finding\n\nthat the defendant  transported eighty-three stolen  boards.\n\nSee id.\n       \n\n     District courts are vested with discretion to determine\n\nwhether  to conduct  an evidentiary  hearing  on a  disputed\n\nfactual  issue.  Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(3)(A)  (\"The court\n\nshall  afford the defendant  and the defendant's  counsel an\n\nopportunity to comment  on the [presentence] report  and, in\n\nthe discretion of the court, to introduce testimony or other\n\ninformation  relating  to  any  alleged  factual  inaccuracy\n\ncontained in it.\");  see United States  v.

The  IRS  agents\n\nattempted to verify  the purchases but were unable  to do so\n\nbecause  none of the  fifteen William Harrisons  of Atlanta,\n\nGeorgia, who were contacted had ever heard of the defendant.\n\nThe defendant  also told  IRS agents  that he had  purchased\n\nboards from  American Exchange of  Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nOnce again, investigators were unable to verify the validity\n\nof the  defendant's  explanation  because  no  such  company\n\nexists  in Worcester.   Furthermore, during the  time period\n\nthat he sold  boards to Marcantonio, the  defendant admitted\n\nto structuring  cash withdrawals  so as  to evade  reporting\n\nrequirements.\n\n     On  the basis  of  the  information  contained  in  the\n\npresentence report,  the court could  have reasonably  found\n\nthe government proved by a preponderance of the evidence the\n\neighty-three boards were stolen and the defendant engaged in\n\nthe \"same course of conduct or common scheme or plan  as the\n\noffense of  conviction.\"   See U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(2).

The\n                        \n\ndefendant bears  a heavy  burden of  demonstrating that  the\n\ndistrict  court's finding is  clearly erroneous in  light of\n\nthe   Guideline's  allowance  that  the  loss  need  not  be\n\ndetermined with precision.  \n\n     The presentence  report, the  defendant's objection  to\n\nthe  report, and  the submissions  of  counsel provided  the\n\ndistrict  court with the following information from which it\n\ncould determine  the value of  the loss.  Although  it could\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nnot determine  the  number of  boards  that were  used,  DEC\n\nprovided information  as stated  in  the presentence  report\n\nthat  the  retail value  of  the 112  missing  boards ranged\n\nbetween $1350 and $18,970 per  board.  DEC reported that the\n\nfair  market value of  the twenty-nine boards  the defendant\n\nadmitted  he knew were  stolen and transported  was $278,800\n\nand  the  value  of the  eighty-three  boards  considered as\n\nrelevant  conduct  was  $1,210,946.    The  defendant's bank\n\nstatements also revealed that during the time he sold boards\n\nto  Marcantonio, he  received over  one  million dollars  in\n\npayment.   In his objection  to the presentence  report, the\n\ndefendant   supplied   the  court   with   information  that\n\nMarcantonio sold  used boards  on the  secondary market  for\n\nbetween $5200  and  $6500  per  board.   At  the  sentencing\n\nhearing, defendant's counsel proffered that the proper value\n\nof  the boards was  DEC's cost of  production, approximately\n\n$600 per  board, and the government conceded that a majority\n\nof the boards were used.  \n\n     The district court  had a broad range of  values before\n\nit  and  made  its  determination   on  the  basis  of  that\n\ninformation.  While the district  court did not set forth in\n\ngreat detail the method it used to calculate the loss, there\n\nwas  adequate  evidence  in  the  record  for  the court  to\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\ndetermine  that the  value of  the  missing boards  exceeded\n\n$800,000.   See Colletti, 984  F.2d at 1345.   The court did\n                        \n\nnot need  to value  the boards precisely  and could  use the\n\ninformation  before it  to infer  that the  loss of  the 112\n\nboards  exceeded $800,000.   See U.S.S.G.    2B1.1, comment.\n                                \n\n(n.3).  We  cannot say that the district  court's finding is\n\nclearly erroneous.

He earned an hourly wage of $15.50 for an approximate annual salary of $32,240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1988 and continuing through 1990 and while employed at DEC, the defendant sold 241 DEC boards without invoices, receipts or other documentary evidence of the transactions to Execudata, a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Peter Marcantonio.  From 1989 through 1990, Marcantonio wire-transferred $959,293 to the defendant's account at United Cooperative Bank in West Springfield, Massachusetts (\"United Cooperative\") and $196,473 to the defendant's account at First Union Bank in Pompano Beach, Florida (\"First Union\").  Unlike the defendant, Marcantonio maintained business records that included the serial numbers of the 241 DEC boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being alerted by United Cooperative of suspicious cash withdrawals, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") began investigating the defendant's activities.  During the course of this investigation, IRS agents showed DEC officials a list of serial numbers provided to them by Marcantonio.  DEC security officers reviewed the Westfield plant's inventory and discovered that 112 of the 241 boards had been removed from the stockroom without authorization.  The government was unable to trace the other 129 boards to determine if they were stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the grand jury returned a Superseding Indictment on July 23, 1992, the defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of structuring currency transactions to evade reporting requirements and to one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the defendant's sentencing hearing, the government conceded it could trace to the Westfield plant's stockroom only 112 of the 241 boards the defendant sold to Marcantonio.  The government also conceded that a majority of the missing boards were used.  On the basis of the government's concessions, the district court found DEC could not confirm the number of missing boards that were used or new.  The district court concluded that the Sentencing Guidelines did not require a precise determination of DEC's loss and permitted it to infer the amount of loss on the basis of reasonable reliable information, including the scope of the operation.  The district court also noted that the probation department may have had the right to use the retail value of the boards to value DEC's loss.  The court found the loss was more than $800,000, but did not exceed $1,489,746, the retail value suggested by DEC for new boards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court adopted the factual findings and Sentencing Guideline application in the presentence report and determined that the defendant's offense level was seventeen and his criminal history category was I.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.2 (1992).<sup>4</sup>  The defendant was sentenced to a term of twenty-seven months' imprisonment on one count of interstate transportation of stolen property and to the same term to be served concurrently on the four structuring counts.

Relevant Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant asserts the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that eighty-three boards were stolen and the court improperly included those boards as relevant conduct in determining his sentence.  According to the defendant, there are alternative explanations for the disappearance of the eighty-three boards.  He denies having access to all areas in which the boards were stored and refutes the hearsay statements to the contrary by DEC employees mentioned in the presentence report.  He also argues that at the sentencing hearing, the court implicitly found the eighty-three boards were not stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Absent proof the boards were stolen, the defendant contends the district court could not have considered them as relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may include relevant conduct--\"the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\"--in its determination of the applicable offense level.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  \"For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 9).  To sentence the defendant for relevant conduct, the court must be satisfied that the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant unlawfully transported eighty-three stolen boards.  See United States v. Estrada-Molina, 931 F.2d 964, 966 (1st Cir.1991) (government's demonstration by a preponderance of evidence of defendant's capability of producing negotiated but undelivered drugs permitted district court to impose a sentence that included relevant conduct).

Whether or not it determines that an evidentiary hearing is necessary, \"[i]n resolving any reasonable dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"   U.S.S.G.

Hearsay statements contained in presentence reports, affidavits, documentary exhibits, and submissions of counsel are often a reliable source of information to resolve a dispute.

By expressly adopting the findings contained in the presentence report, the district court chose to credit the presentence report and the information contained therein as having sufficient indicia of reliability.

The court relied on the statements contained in the presentence report to determine whether the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence the eighty-three boards were stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The presentence report mentioned several common factors that connect the twenty-nine boards the defendant knew were stolen and admitted transporting and the eighty-three boards the court included as relevant conduct.  All 112 of the boards were taken from DEC's Westfield plant and the defendant had access to the stockrooms where they were stored.  The defendant sold these same 112 boards to Marcantonio without providing him with any receipts or other documentation.  In exchange for boards, Marcantonio wire-transferred over one million dollars to the defendant's United Cooperative and First Union bank accounts.  When he was questioned by the IRS as to the source of the boards, the defendant explained that he had purchased them from an individual, Bill Harrison of Atlanta, Georgia, but was unable to provide the agents with Harrison's address or phone number, to produce any receipts, or otherwise to verify the purchases.  The IRS agents attempted to verify the purchases but were unable to do so because none of the fifteen William Harrisons of Atlanta, Georgia, who were contacted had ever heard of the defendant.  The defendant also told IRS agents that he had purchased boards from American Exchange of Worcester, Massachusetts.  Once again, investigators were unable to verify the validity of the defendant's explanation because no such company exists in Worcester.  Furthermore, during the time period that he sold boards to Marcantonio, the defendant admitted to structuring cash withdrawals so as to evade reporting requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the information contained in the presentence report, the court could have reasonably found the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence the eighty-three boards were stolen and the defendant engaged in the \"same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"   See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  It properly included the boards as relevant conduct of interstate transportation of stolen property.

Sec. 2B1.1 that stolen gems had an actual market value of $626,000 rather than a discounted value for which the retailer would sell them or the wholesale replacement cost of the gems not clearly erroneous);  see also United States v. Larracuente, 952 F.2d 672, 674-75 (2d Cir.1992) (court correctly found pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B5.3 that value of high quality \"bootlegged\" videotapes was the same as the retail price of licensed copies).  \"The loss need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, comment.  (n. 3);  see Mullins, 992 F.2d at 1479 (citing U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, comment.  (n. 3));  Pavao, 948 F.2d at 77 (same).  The defendant bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court's finding is clearly erroneous in light of the Guideline's allowance that the loss need not be determined with precision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report, the defendant's objection to the report, and the submissions of counsel provided the district court with the following information from which it could determine the value of the loss.  Although it could not determine the number of boards that were used, DEC provided information as stated in the presentence report that the retail value of the 112 missing boards ranged between $1350 and $18,970 per board.  DEC reported that the fair market value of the twenty-nine boards the defendant admitted he knew were stolen and transported was $278,800 and the value of the eighty-three boards considered as relevant conduct was $1,210,946.  The defendant's bank statements also revealed that during the time he sold boards to Marcantonio, he received over one million dollars in payment.  In his objection to the presentence report, the defendant supplied the court with information that Marcantonio sold used boards on the secondary market for between $5200 and $6500 per board.  At the sentencing hearing, defendant's counsel proffered that the proper value of the boards was DEC's cost of production, approximately $600 per board, and the government conceded that a majority of the boards were used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had a broad range of values before it and made its determination on the basis of that information.  While the district court did not set forth in great detail the method it used to calculate the loss, there was adequate evidence in the record for the court to determine that the value of the missing boards exceeded $800,000.  See Colletti, 984 F.2d at 1345.   The court did not need to value the boards precisely and could use the information before it to infer that the loss of the 112 boards exceeded $800,000.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, comment.  (n. 3).  We cannot say that the district court's finding is clearly erroneous.

It merely noted that paragraph 19 made no mention that the eighty-three boards were stolen.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Digital Equipment Corporation (\"DEC\") employed the defendant as a packaging engineer at its Westfield, Massachusetts plant. He earned an hourly wage of $15.50 for an approximate annual salary of $32,240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1988 and continuing through 1990 and while employed at DEC, the defendant sold 241 DEC boards without invoices, receipts or other documentary evidence of the transactions to Execudata, a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Peter Marcantonio.  From 1989 through 1990, Marcantonio wire-transferred $959,293 to the defendant's account at United Cooperative Bank in West Springfield, Massachusetts (\"United Cooperative\") and $196,473 to the defendant's account at First Union Bank in Pompano Beach, Florida (\"First Union\").  Unlike the defendant, Marcantonio maintained business records that included the serial numbers of the 241 DEC boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being alerted by United Cooperative of suspicious cash withdrawals, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") began investigating the defendant's activities.  During the course of this investigation, IRS agents showed DEC officials a list of serial numbers provided to them by Marcantonio.  DEC security officers reviewed the Westfield plant's inventory and discovered that 112 of the 241 boards had been removed from the stockroom without authorization.  The government was unable to trace the other 129 boards to determine if they were stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the grand jury returned a Superseding Indictment on July 23, 1992, the defendant pleaded guilty to four counts of structuring currency transactions to evade reporting requirements and to one count of interstate transportation of stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the defendant's sentencing hearing, the government conceded it could trace to the Westfield plant's stockroom only 112 of the 241 boards the defendant sold to Marcantonio.  The government also conceded that a majority of the missing boards were used.  On the basis of the government's concessions, the district court found DEC could not confirm the number of missing boards that were used or new.  The district court concluded that the Sentencing Guidelines did not require a precise determination of DEC's loss and permitted it to infer the amount of loss on the basis of reasonable reliable information, including the scope of the operation.  The district court also noted that the probation department may have had the right to use the retail value of the boards to value DEC's loss.  The court found the loss was more than $800,000, but did not exceed $1,489,746, the retail value suggested by DEC for new boards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court adopted the factual findings and Sentencing Guideline application in the presentence report and determined that the defendant's offense level was seventeen and his criminal history category was I.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.2 (1992).<sup>4</sup>  The defendant was sentenced to a term of twenty-seven months' imprisonment on one count of interstate transportation of stolen property and to the same term to be served concurrently on the four structuring counts.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Relevant Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant asserts the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that eighty-three boards were stolen and the court improperly included those boards as relevant conduct in determining his sentence.  According to the defendant, there are alternative explanations for the disappearance of the eighty-three boards.  He denies having access to all areas in which the boards were stored and refutes the hearsay statements to the contrary by DEC employees mentioned in the presentence report.  He also argues that at the sentencing hearing, the court implicitly found the eighty-three boards were not stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Absent proof the boards were stolen, the defendant contends the district court could not have considered them as relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may include relevant conduct--\"the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\"--in its determination of the applicable offense level.  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  \"For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (n. 9).  To sentence the defendant for relevant conduct, the court must be satisfied that the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant unlawfully transported eighty-three stolen boards.

The court relied on the statements contained in the presentence report to determine whether the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence the eighty-three boards were stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The presentence report mentioned several common factors that connect the twenty-nine boards the defendant knew were stolen and admitted transporting and the eighty-three boards the court included as relevant conduct.  All 112 of the boards were taken from DEC's Westfield plant and the defendant had access to the stockrooms where they were stored.  The defendant sold these same 112 boards to Marcantonio without providing him with any receipts or other documentation.  In exchange for boards, Marcantonio wire-transferred over one million dollars to the defendant's United Cooperative and First Union bank accounts.  When he was questioned by the IRS as to the source of the boards, the defendant explained that he had purchased them from an individual, Bill Harrison of Atlanta, Georgia, but was unable to provide the agents with Harrison's address or phone number, to produce any receipts, or otherwise to verify the purchases.  The IRS agents attempted to verify the purchases but were unable to do so because none of the fifteen William Harrisons of Atlanta, Georgia, who were contacted had ever heard of the defendant.  The defendant also told IRS agents that he had purchased boards from American Exchange of Worcester, Massachusetts.  Once again, investigators were unable to verify the validity of the defendant's explanation because no such company exists in Worcester.  Furthermore, during the time period that he sold boards to Marcantonio, the defendant admitted to structuring cash withdrawals so as to evade reporting requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the information contained in the presentence report, the court could have reasonably found the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence the eighty-three boards were stolen and the defendant engaged in the \"same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"   See U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  It properly included the boards as relevant conduct of interstate transportation of stolen property.  The defendant has failed to establish that the district court's finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Valuing the loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant next contends the district court improperly inflated the value of the victim's loss and imposed an illegal sentence.  Because DEC does not sell used boards, the defendant asserts no fair market value exists for used boards and therefore the court should have employed the boards' cost of production to value DEC's loss.  According to the defendant, if the court finds that a market value can be established to value DEC's loss, that market value should be based on the secondary market for used boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines.

The defendant bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court's finding is clearly erroneous in light of the Guideline's allowance that the loss need not be determined with precision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report, the defendant's objection to the report, and the submissions of counsel provided the district court with the following information from which it could determine the value of the loss.  Although it could not determine the number of boards that were used, DEC provided information as stated in the presentence report that the retail value of the 112 missing boards ranged between $1350 and $18,970 per board.  DEC reported that the fair market value of the twenty-nine boards the defendant admitted he knew were stolen and transported was $278,800 and the value of the eighty-three boards considered as relevant conduct was $1,210,946.  The defendant's bank statements also revealed that during the time he sold boards to Marcantonio, he received over one million dollars in payment.  In his objection to the presentence report, the defendant supplied the court with information that Marcantonio sold used boards on the secondary market for between $5200 and $6500 per board.  At the sentencing hearing, defendant's counsel proffered that the proper value of the boards was DEC's cost of production, approximately $600 per board, and the government conceded that a majority of the boards were used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had a broad range of values before it and made its determination on the basis of that information.  While the district court did not set forth in great detail the method it used to calculate the loss, there was adequate evidence in the record for the court to determine that the value of the missing boards exceeded $800,000.  See Colletti, 984 F.2d at 1345.   The court did not need to value the boards precisely and could use the information before it to infer that the loss of the 112 boards exceeded $800,000.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2B1.1, comment.  (n. 3).  We cannot say that the district court's finding is clearly erroneous.  For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court dismissed six counts of the Superseding Indictment on motion of the United States</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In their briefs, the defendant and the government mistakenly stated that the number of boards viewed as relevant conduct was seventy-three.

Because once again, it does not reveal that the boards in fact were stolen.  So I don't see any impact on the defendant in that scenario.\"   While the defendant believes that the court implicitly found that the boards were not stolen, the court was not precluded from later finding, on the basis of other information contained in the presentence report, that the boards were in fact stolen.  It merely noted that paragraph 19 made no mention that the eighty-three boards were stolen.  Paragraph 19 of the presentence report provides:</p>\n        <p>IRS Agents contacted DEC with the list of serial numbers of computer boards sold by Skrodzki to Marcantonio.  After a thorough review of inventory records, DEC security determined that 112 of the boards including the 29 listed in the indictment should still be in DEC stockrooms.  These stockrooms are not secure areas and Skrodzki had access to any equipment stored in the stockrooms.  The computer boards are no larger than a 11 X 14 notebook and could easily be concealed in a briefcase.  However, their retail value ranges from $1,350 to $18,970 apiece.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> At the hearing, defense counsel submitted that the defendant was prepared to testify that he did not have free access to the stockroom.
