Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Ryan Thomas Truskoski on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney and Jacqueline D. Novas, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 23, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.     Appellant Yris Quirindongo-Collazo executed\n\nhis plea agreement before Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296\n\n(2004), was decided. He was sentenced after Blakely but before the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005).     While appellant's direct appeal was pending in\n\nthis court, the Booker decision was announced. Appellant now seeks\n\nto set aside his sentence pursuant to Booker.\n\n            In his opening brief to this court, appellant failed to\n\nmention that his plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, and he\n\nfailed to present any argument for setting aside the waiver.\n\nRather, after the government filed its motion for summary dismissal\n\nbased on the waiver, appellant filed a reply brief in which he\n\nattempted to summarily adopt his co-appellant's1 opening brief\n\nargument regarding his appeal waiver, citing Fed. R. App. P. 28(i).\n\nAppellant's opening brief also argues, irrelevantly, that United\n\nStates v. Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005), is wrongly\n\ndecided and that appellant is entitled to de novo or harmless error\n\nreview.\n\n            Under   stare    decisis    principles,   this   panel   cannot\n\noverrule Antonakopoulos, nor is there the least reason here to\n\nconsider doing so.          Quite apart from Antonakopoulos, however,\n\nappellant is entitled to the harmless error standard he seeks.           As\n\nwe stated immediately following the Booker decision, in cases\n\n\n     1\n          United States v. Nisbett-Joseph, Appeal No. 04-1539.\n\n                                       -2-\n\favailable to counsel before appellant's opening brief was filed\n\nwith this court, harmless error review is applied in cases where\n\nthe defendant has properly preserved a claim of Booker error in the\n\ndistrict court.         United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); see also United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d 476,\n\n489 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 279 (2005).                       The record\n\nhere       plainly    shows    that,     at   the    sentencing     hearing,   defense\n\ncounsel2 objected to appellant's sentence on Blakely grounds, and\n\nthe    district        court       assured     appellant     his    objections     were\n\n\"preserved.\"           In    its    opening    brief,    the   government      properly\n\nidentified and argued the harmless error standard of review.\n\n               Before this court can review appellant's sentence under\n\nthe harmless error rubric, however, we must determine whether\n\nappellant's pre-Blakely appeal waiver should be enforced.                       Setting\n\naside the question of whether Rule 28(i) permits an appellant, in\n\nhis reply brief, to adopt an argument presented in a co-appellant's\n\nopening brief, as a general rule we have held that \"legal argument\n\nmade for the first time in an appellant's reply brief comes too\n\nlate and need not be addressed.\"                    United States v. Brennan, 994\n\nF.2d 918, 922 n.7 (1st Cir. 1993).                  Under Massaro v. United States,\n\n538    U.S.    500,    508     (2003),    however,      in   view   of   the   \"obvious\n\ndeficiencies in representation\" in appellate counsel's failure to\n\nmention the appeal waiver or raise the issue of its enforceability\n\n\n       2\n            Different counsel represents appellant in this appeal.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fin appellant's opening brief, we will exercise our discretion to\n\nconsider appellant's late-raised argument that his appeal waiver is\n\nunenforceable.\n\n            After careful review of the record and applying the\n\nthree-part test described in United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14,\n\n25-26 (1st Cir. 2001), we conclude that the appeal waiver is\n\nunenforceable, although not for the reasons argued by appellant.\n\nAs we explained in United States v. Soto-Cruz, 449 F.3d 258, 262\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), the mere fact that Booker was decided after\n\nappellant entered into his appeal waiver does not \"somehow ...\n\nrender the enforcement of his appeal waiver a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"     Where, as here, a defendant has stipulated to the\n\nsentencing facts, agreed to be sentenced pursuant to the then-\n\nmandatory guidelines, and is in fact sentenced as specified in the\n\nplea agreement, the subsequent change in the law announced in\n\nBooker, without more, provides no basis for setting aside the\n\nsentence.    Soto-Cruz, 449 F.3d at 262 (citing United States v.\n\nGriffin, 418 F.3d 881, 882 (8th Cir. 2005) (\"The fact that [the\n\ndefendant] did not anticipate the Blakely or Booker rulings does\n\nnot place the issue outside the scope of the waiver.\")).\n\n            In this case, it is clear from the record that Teeter's\n\nfirst prong has been satisfied. The written plea agreement clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fsets forth the terms of the appeal waiver.3               257 F.3d at 24.\n\nCompliance    with    Teeter's   second   prong   is,   however,   far   more\n\ndoubtful.    Teeter's second prong requires that the district court,\n\nat the change of plea hearing, \"call the waiver to the defendant's\n\nattention and question him closely in order to ensure that he has\n\na full understanding of the waiver provisions and that he has\n\nvoluntarily elected to waive his right of appeal.\"           United States\n\nv. Gil-Quezada, 445 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 24, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N) (requiring such a\n\ncolloquy)).    The transcript of appellant's change of plea hearing\n\nindicates that the magistrate judge asked just one question about\n\nthe appeal waiver, as follows:\n\n              THE MAGISTRATE: Very well, also this plea agreement\n              contains an important section ... and it reads as\n              follows.\n\n\n              \"If the court accepts the terms and conditions within\n              this plea agreement, then you will be waiving and\n              giving up your right to appeal your judgment of\n              conviction and also the sentence imposed by the court\",\n              do you understand that?\n\n              MR. QUIRINDONGO: Yes.\n\nThis is the only mention of the appeal waiver during the change of\n\nplea colloquy.       Moreover, the magistrate judge failed to mention\n\n\n\n     3\n        \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court\naccepts this Plea Agreement and sentences him according to its\nterms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to\nappeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\" The plea agreement\ncontains no exceptions or qualifications to this broad language.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe appeal waiver in her Report and Recommendation to the district\n\ncourt.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing, after defense counsel voiced his\n\nBlakely objections, the judge, defense counsel, the government, and\n\nthe probation officer had an extensive discussion premised on the\n\nassumption that appellant could and would appeal.                    During this\n\ndiscussion, there was no mention by any party of the appeal waiver,\n\nnor of any effect that waiver might have on appellant's right to\n\nappeal. The court described the contemplated appeal as appellant's\n\nunqualified \"right\" and repeatedly stated that the issues were\n\npreserved for appeal so that \"[i]f the defendant wishes to raise\n\nthem on appeal, he is free to do so.\"                     At the close of the\n\nsentencing hearing, directly contrary to Teeter's teaching to avoid\n\n\"blanket assurance[s] about the right to appeal,\" 257 F.3d at 25,\n\nthe court gave detailed instructions pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(c)(5) concerning appellant's appeal rights, including how and\n\nwhen   to   file    a   notice   of    appeal.      The      statements    made   at\n\nappellant's sentencing hearing went well beyond the kinds of\n\ngeneral assurances we have determined in other cases had no effect\n\non a knowing and voluntary waiver.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\nGil-Quezada, 445 F.3d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2006) (judge's general\n\ncomments    at     sentencing    had   no     bearing   on    whether     appellant\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights when he\n\nentered his guilty plea four months earlier); United States v. De-\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fLa-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2002) (judge's comment\n\nthat appellant could appeal \"in some circumstances,\" viewed in\n\ncontext, did not contradict waiver).          We thus conclude that this\n\nis one of those isolated and extraordinary situations where an\n\nappeal waiver was and, in the interest of justice, should be held,\n\nineffective.\n\n      Turning now to the record, we cannot conclude that the Booker\n\nerror in appellant's sentencing was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.      Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 489-90; United States v.\n\nFornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).               \"We must be\n\nconvinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the\n\nGuidelines been advisory.      This is an extremely difficult, but not\n\nimpossible, standard to meet.\" Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 489-90.\n\nThat appellant stipulated to the sentencing facts \"would not be\n\nsufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting\n\nunder an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same\n\nsentence on the basis of those factors,\" id., particularly here,\n\nwhere the stipulated drug quantity attributed to appellant in his\n\nplea agreement exposes him to a mandatory minimum sentence of five\n\nyears, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), and he was sentenced to 121 months\n\n-- the minimum allowed under the then-mandatory guidelines.\n\n      In the very unique circumstances of this case, we therefore\n\ndecline to enforce the appeal waiver.        The conviction is affirmed,\n\nbut   the   sentence   is   vacated    and   the   case   is   remanded   for\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fresentencing.    We intimate no view on whether appellant should\n\nreceive   a   higher   or   lower   sentence   on   remand,   or   on   the\n\nreasonableness of his previous sentence or on any revised sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

Teeter's second prong requires that the district court,\n\nat the change of plea hearing, \"call the waiver to the defendant's\n\nattention and question him closely in order to ensure that he has\n\na full understanding of the waiver provisions and that he has\n\nvoluntarily elected to waive his right of appeal.\"           United States\n\nv.

R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N) (requiring such a\n\ncolloquy)).    The transcript of appellant's change of plea hearing\n\nindicates that the magistrate judge asked just one question about\n\nthe appeal waiver, as follows:\n\n              THE MAGISTRATE: Very well, also this plea agreement\n              contains an important section ... and it reads as\n              follows.\n\n\n              \"If the court accepts the terms and conditions within\n              this plea agreement, then you will be waiving and\n              giving up your right to appeal your judgment of\n              conviction and also the sentence imposed by the court\",\n              do you understand that?\n\n              MR. QUIRINDONGO: Yes.\n\nThis is the only mention of the appeal waiver during the change of\n\nplea colloquy.       Moreover, the magistrate judge failed to mention\n\n\n\n     3\n        \"The defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court\naccepts this Plea Agreement and sentences him according to its\nterms and conditions, defendant waives and surrenders his right to\nappeal the judgment and sentence in this case.\" The plea agreement\ncontains no exceptions or qualifications to this broad language.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe appeal waiver in her Report and Recommendation to the district\n\ncourt.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing, after defense counsel voiced his\n\nBlakely objections, the judge, defense counsel, the government, and\n\nthe probation officer had an extensive discussion premised on the\n\nassumption that appellant could and would appeal.                    During this\n\ndiscussion, there was no mention by any party of the appeal waiver,\n\nnor of any effect that waiver might have on appellant's right to\n\nappeal. The court described the contemplated appeal as appellant's\n\nunqualified \"right\" and repeatedly stated that the issues were\n\npreserved for appeal so that \"[i]f the defendant wishes to raise\n\nthem on appeal, he is free to do so.\"                     At the close of the\n\nsentencing hearing, directly contrary to Teeter's teaching to avoid\n\n\"blanket assurance[s] about the right to appeal,\" 257 F.3d at 25,\n\nthe court gave detailed instructions pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32(c)(5) concerning appellant's appeal rights, including how and\n\nwhen   to   file    a   notice   of    appeal.      The      statements    made   at\n\nappellant's sentencing hearing went well beyond the kinds of\n\ngeneral assurances we have determined in other cases had no effect\n\non a knowing and voluntary waiver.

We thus conclude that this\n\nis one of those isolated and extraordinary situations where an\n\nappeal waiver was and, in the interest of justice, should be held,\n\nineffective.\n\n      Turning now to the record, we cannot conclude that the Booker\n\nerror in appellant's sentencing was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.      Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 489-90; United States v.\n\nFornia-Castillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201662\"><a href=\"/opinion/201662/united-states-v-fornia-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).               \"We must be\n\nconvinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the\n\nGuidelines been advisory.      This is an extremely difficult, but not\n\nimpossible, standard to meet.\" Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 489-90.\n\nThat appellant stipulated to the sentencing facts \"would not be\n\nsufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting\n\nunder an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same\n\nsentence on the basis of those factors,\" id., particularly here,\n\nwhere the stipulated drug quantity attributed to appellant in his\n\nplea agreement exposes him to a mandatory minimum sentence of five\n\nyears, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), and he was sentenced to 121 months\n\n-- the minimum allowed under the then-mandatory guidelines.\n\n      In the very unique circumstances of this case, we therefore\n\ndecline to enforce the appeal waiver.        The conviction is affirmed,\n\nbut   the   sentence   is   vacated    and   the   case   is   remanded   for\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fresentencing.
