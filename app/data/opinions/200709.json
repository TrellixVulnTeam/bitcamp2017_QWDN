José Antonio Fusté,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Archie Jennings with whom Amarilys Arocho and Anita Hill-\nAdames were on brief for appellants.\n     Robert H. Klonoff with whom Salvador Antonetti Zequeira, Luis\nA. Oliver, Rosalie Irizarry Silvestrini, James R. Johnson, L.\nChristine Buchanan, Jones Day, and Fiddler, Gonzalez & Rodriguez,\nP.S.C., were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 28, 2003\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.         Appellants are the widow and\n\ntwo sons of Luis Figueroa Serrano, a longtime heavy smoker who\n\ncollapsed and died suddenly after several years of suffering from\n\nhypertension.1 They brought this diversity action against appellee\n\nR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, invoking Puerto Rico tort law and\n\nalleging    that   the   cigarette   manufacturer   was   responsible   for\n\nFigueroa Serrano's death.         The district court granted summary\n\njudgment on most of appellants' claims, allowing only the sons'\n\nfailure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969 to go to the\n\njury.    After the jury ruled in favor of the sons, the court granted\n\njudgment as a matter of law for Reynolds, concluding that, based on\n\nthe evidence at trial, the jury was compelled to find that the\n\nrisks of cigarette smoking were commonly known during the relevant\n\ntime period.       On appeal, the sons challenge the judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. All three appellants challenge the summary judgment\n\nruling to the extent that it found all post-1969 failure-to-warn\n\nclaims preempted by federal legislation.         Irene Cruz Vargas also\n\nchallenges the court's ruling that the statute of limitations\n\nbarred her claims.       We affirm both of the district court's rulings\n\non the basis of common knowledge, making it unnecessary to reach\n\nappellants' other arguments.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Irene Cruz Vargas is the widow of the decedent; Luis Rogelio\nFigueroa Cruz and Eli Rogelio Figueroa Cruz are the sons.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fI. Background\n\n     The following facts are undisputed. The decedent was a native\n\nSpanish speaker with no written or verbal English proficiency.                He\n\nseldom watched television and rarely, if ever, read newspapers or\n\nmagazines.     Figueroa Serrano was a longtime heavy smoker with a\n\ndocumented    medical   history    of    hypertension,   including     several\n\nhospitalizations occurring between 1994 and his death on October\n\n18, 1999.    At the request of the family, no autopsy was performed.\n\n     Appellants filed this suit against Reynolds in October of\n\n2000, alleging that decedent's smoking was responsible for his\n\nhypertension, which in turn was a substantial factor in his death.\n\nAppellants brought a series of negligence and strict liability\n\nclaims under Puerto Rico law, including failure to warn and design\n\ndefect.     They furthermore argued that Reynolds failed to comply\n\nwith its duty, which they alleged to be implicit in federal\n\nregulation,    to   print   Spanish      language   warnings   on    cigarette\n\npackages sold in Puerto Rico.\n\n     The district court granted Reynolds summary judgment on all of\n\nIrene Cruz Vargas' claims, finding them time-barred.                Cruz Vargas\n\nv. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 218 F. Supp. 2d 109, 116 (D.P.R.\n\n2002).      With respect to the sons' claims, the district court\n\ngranted   Reynolds'     motion    for    summary    judgment   on    claims   of\n\ndefective design and the inherent dangerousness of tobacco and\n\ncigarettes.     Id. at 121.      The court denied Reynolds' motion as to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe failure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969, the date\n\nthat       the   amendments    to   the    Federal   Cigarette      Labeling    and\n\nAdvertising Act went into effect.2              Id. at 117.       The court found\n\nfailure-to-warn       claims    based      on   conduct   after    July   1,   1969\n\npreempted by the Labeling Act.\n\n       The sons proceeded to a jury trial on their remaining claims.\n\nReynolds defended at trial primarily based on evidence that the\n\nrisks of cigarette smoking were common knowledge prior to 1969, and\n\nthus no duty to warn existed.             A jury found in favor of both sons,\n\nawarding each damages in the amount of $500,000.                    The district\n\ncourt subsequently granted Reynolds' motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), finding that appellants\n\nfailed to offer any evidence demonstrating that the ordinary\n\nconsumer lacked knowledge of the health risks and addictive nature\n\nof smoking.       The district court held that the jury was not entitled\n\nto reject the unimpeached, uncontradicted testimony of Reynolds'\n\nexpert witness, who stated his opinion that the Puerto Rican public\n\nwas aware of such hazards prior to July 1, 1969.\n\n       Appellants allege the district court's action was improper\n\nbecause the evidence presented by Reynolds was susceptible to\n\nconflicting inferences. In addition, they contest summary judgment\n\n\n       2\n      The Labeling Act mandated cautionary warnings on cigarette\npackages beginning in 1965. The amendment, effective July 1, 1969,\nboth strengthened the language of the warnings and included\npreemptive language broader in scope than that of the original act.\nSee Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992).\n\n                                          -4-\n\fon two grounds: first, that the court erred in determining that the\n\nclaims accrued at the time appellants learned of Figueroa Serrano's\n\ninjuries, rather than on the actual date of his death; second, that\n\nit further erred in refusing to find that the absence of warnings\n\nin Spanish rendered the required warnings of the Labeling Act\n\nineffectual.\n\n                     II.   Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n      We review the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo.\n\nHochen v. Bobst Group, Inc., 290 F.3d 446, 453 (1st Cir. 2002).               We\n\nexamine the record as a whole, reading the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the jury verdict.            Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\n\nProd., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000).              Although we may not weigh the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, id., we assume the veracity \"of any\n\nadmissions made and stipulations entered into by the party opposing\n\nthe   Rule   50    motion...as    well    as    any   evidence   derived    from\n\ndisinterested       witnesses    that    has    not   been   contradicted    or\n\nimpeached.\"       Quintana-Ruiz v. Hyundai Motor Corp., 303 F.3d 62, 69\n\n(1st Cir. 2002)(quoting Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R.\n\nBottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1998)).              Only if \"applying\n\nthese standards, the evidence does not permit a reasonable jury to\n\nfind in favor\" of appellants will we affirm the district court.\n\nBrennan v. GTE Gov't Systems Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f     A.    Evidence Regarding Common Knowledge\n\n     This case calls for us to evaluate application of the common\n\nknowledge doctrine in the context of tobacco litigation.                  The\n\ndoctrine stems from the principle that a manufacturer cannot be\n\nheld liable under either strict liability or negligence for failure\n\nto warn of a danger commonly known to the public.                 See, e.g.,\n\nGuevara v. Dorsey Labs., Div. of Sandoz, Inc., 845 F.2d 364, 367\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (\"The duty to warn in general is limited to hazards\n\nnot commonly known to the relevant public.\"); Aponte Rivera v.\n\nSears Roebuck, Inc., 44 P.R. Offic. Trans. 7, 144 D.P.R. 830 (1998)\n\n(\"[A] manufacturer need not warn of a hazard if the average\n\nconsumer ordinarily has knowledge of the dangers of the product.\").\n\n     To state a claim for negligence under the law of Puerto Rico,\n\na plaintiff must prove that \"(1) defendant owed a duty to prevent\n\nthe harm by conforming to a reasonable standard of conduct; (2)\n\ndefendant breached that duty through a negligent act or omission;\n\nand (3) the negligent act or omission caused the plaintiff's harm.\"\n\nTokio Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v. Grove Mfg. Co., 958 F.2d 1169, 1171\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).        See also 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141 (1991).      Puerto Rico\n\nhas also adopted, by judicial act and with a slight modification,\n\nthe strict liability principles embodied in section 402A of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts.         Perez-Trujillo v. Volvo Car Corp.,\n\n137 F.3d 50, 53 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998) (clarifying that claimant in\n\nPuerto    Rico   must    show   the   product   was   \"unsafe\"   rather   than\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"unreasonably dangerous\"); Rivera Santana v. Superior Packaging,\n\nInc., 1992 P.R.-Eng. 754830 *3 n.4, 132 D.P.R. 115 (1992) (noting\n\nthat Puerto Rico has adopted U.S. common law products liability\n\nprinciples to \"fill a gap in our body of laws\").\n\n     A products liability plaintiff alleging failure to warn must\n\nprove \"(1) the manufacturer knew, or should have known of the risk\n\ninherent   in   the   product;   (2)    there   were   no   warnings   or\n\ninstructions, or those provided were inadequate; (3) the absence of\n\nwarnings made the product inherently dangerous; (4) the absence of\n\nadequate warnings or instructions was the proximate cause of\n\nplaintiff's injury.\"    Aponte Rivera, 44 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 6.\n\nUnder the common knowledge doctrine, however, a defendant neither\n\nbreaches a duty nor causes the product to be inherently dangerous\n\nwhen the allegedly omitted warning concerns a danger of which the\n\npublic is well aware.\n\n     In an ordinary case on summary judgment or judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, plaintiffs point to evidence suggesting a genuine\n\ndispute of a material fact.      See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986) (standard for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw mirrors that of summary judgment, and thus to withstand a\n\nmotion under either inquiry, the evidence must indicate \"sufficient\n\ndisagreement to require submission to a jury\").        In other cases in\n\nwhich common knowledge was at issue, plaintiffs have successfully\n\ndefended against summary judgment motions by pointing to evidence\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fsuggesting such a genuine dispute.            See, e.g., Tompkin v. American\n\nBrands, 219 F.3d 566, 568-70 (6th Cir. 2000) (plaintiff's expert\n\nreviewed periodicals, polls, and industry and government reports\n\nfrom the relevant time period, concluding that smokers were not\n\nadequately informed of the risks); Little v. Brown & Williamson\n\nTobacco   Corp.,    243    F.   Supp.    2d    480,    492-495   (D.S.C.   2001)\n\n(plaintiff's \"sample authorities,\" including journals, reports and\n\npolls,    created   a    jury   question      regarding    common   knowledge).\n\nAppellants here take a different approach, contending that they did\n\nnot have a burden to produce any evidence at all.                   The crux of\n\nappellants' entreaty on appeal is that neither the strict liability\n\nnor the negligence claim requires any affirmative showing, and thus\n\nthe burden rested entirely on Reynolds.               Whether or not this is a\n\ncorrect view of the law, after searching the record we have found\n\nno evidence which supports appellants' allegations that there was\n\na lack of common knowledge and thus we are compelled to find that\n\nReynolds met its burden in any event.\n\n     Appellants argue that Reynolds' experts presented conflicting\n\ntestimony on common knowledge, which permitted the jury to reach\n\nthe conclusion it did.       This contention, however, is not borne out\n\nby review of the trial transcript.            Reynolds' defense consisted of\n\nthree witnesses.        The testimony of the first two had no relevance\n\nto the specific common knowledge inquiry.               Dr. Herman Melavet, a\n\nmedical internist, testified as to the dispute in the medical\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fcommunity as to the precise causal link, if any, between smoking\n\nand hypertension.           He also suggested that the decedent may have\n\ndied from a dissecting aneurysm.3                  The testimony of Dr. Juan\n\nFumero,         a    psychiatrist,     concerned    contemporary   psychiatric\n\nunderstanding of nicotine dependence.\n\n       Appellants extract a discrete portion from the testimony of\n\nDr. Fumero in support of their argument that the jury was presented\n\nwith       contradictory       evidence    undermining    common    knowledge.\n\nAppellants fault Dr. Fumero for his opinion that regardless of the\n\nterm used to describe a smoking habit, be it \"addiction,\" \"nicotine\n\ndependence,\" or \"substance abuse,\" an individual committed to\n\nquitting will be able to do so.            But to say that one can abandon a\n\nhabit sheds no light on whether the prevalence of the habit was a\n\nmatter generally known.4             Similarly, Dr. Melavet's testimony that\n\n       3\n      As explained above, no autopsy was performed and thus the\ncause of death cannot be precisely ascertained.\n       4\n      Appellants highlight the following portion from Dr. Fumero's\ntestimony on direct examination:\n\n           Q: Is there anything in cigarettes that would render\n           a person unable to understand that he is smoking and to\n           make a decision to quit?\n\n           A:       No, nothing at all.\n\n           Q: There is a term addiction that has been bandied\n           about here which means that a person is not competent\n           to change their behavior that he or she is said to be\n           addicted to?\n\n           A:   No, you can call it addiction; you can call it\n           nicotine dependence; you can call it substance abuse.\n           It doesn't matter how you call it, there is nothing in\n\n                                          -9-\n\fcigarette smoking did not cause hypertension says nothing about the\n\nstate of common knowledge.\n\n     Only Professor Luis Martinez, an expert in Carribean social\n\nhistory, testified on the precise issue of common knowledge, and he\n\nconcluded by stating his opinion that \"the average consumer in\n\nPuerto Rico during the 1950's, during the 1960's\" was aware both of\n\nhealth risks, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, and that\n\n\"smoking was or could be difficult to quit.\"             Appellants contend\n\nthat the jury permissibly rejected Martinez' testimony as biased\n\nand incredible.     Appellants' bias argument relies on the U.S.\n\nSupreme   Court's   decision   in   Sonnentheil    v.    Christian   Morlein\n\nBrewing Co., 172 U.S. 401 (1899), which held that \"the mere fact\n\nthat a witness is interested in the result of the suit is deemed\n\nsufficient to require the credibility of his testimony to be\n\nsubmitted as a question of fact.\"          Id. at 408.    Case law in this\n\ncircuit, however, clarifies that mere payment to an expert by a\n\nparty does not raise a question of bias.          Quintana-Ruiz, 303 F.3d\n\nat 76 (finding that witnesses' status as \"paid outside experts\" did\n\nnot gainsay credibility).5\n\n\n\n\n         it that can impair you from quitting if you choose to\n         quit.\n\n     5\n      Appellants' attempt to bring Martinez' testimony under the\nrubric of Sonnentheil by alleging a \"fraudulent tinge\" finds no\nsupport in the record.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f     Martinez' testimony is furthermore neither improbable nor\n\ncontradicted, thus falling under the established principle that\n\n\"testimony concerning a simple fact, capable of contradiction, not\n\nincredible, and standing uncontradicted, unimpeached, or in no way\n\ndiscredited by cross-examination, must be permitted to stand.\" Id.\n\nat 75 (quoting Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Howell, 401\n\nF.2d 752, 754 (10th Cir. 1968)).      Martinez' research followed an\n\naccepted method of historical analysis and drew on a breadth of\n\nsources — such as newspapers, polls, surveys, school curricula,\n\nfilms, and reports by various public interest organizations —\n\ncontemporaneous with the time period at issue in the case.6    Given\n\nhis explanation of the sources and method, Martinez' opinions are\n\nnot improbable or unbelievable, and the transcript reveals no\n\ninconsistencies in his direct testimony.\n\n     Cross examination neither brought to light any contradictions\n\nundermining Martinez' opinion nor revealed information suggesting\n\n     6\n      In total, Professor Martinez' presentation included 58 slides\nsummarizing his sources. A sampling of the sources on addiction\nand health risks, all dating from the 1950s and 1960s, includes:\narticles from the Spanish language Reader's Digest, including\n\"Nicotine, the Smoking Enigma,\" \"How I Quit Smoking,\" \"Dreadful\nLung Cancer on the Rise;\" a 1961 article in the San Juan Star\ntitled \"Two City Studies Show Death Rate Higher for Smokers;\" two\neditorial cartoons from the daily newspapers El Mundo and El\nImparcial (one relating to addiction, the other to health risks);\nan ad in El Imparcial about the difficulties of quitting, an\narticle in El Mundo lamenting \"how difficult it is to quit!\" and\nseveral other El Mundo articles discussing a major study of the\nrisks of smoking, completed in 1957, that spurred increased\ngovernment interest in further investigation. He also testified to\nextensive coverage in newspapers following the release in 1964 of\na key Surgeon General's report on smoking hazards.\n\n                               -11-\n\fa lack of common knowledge.         In an effort to discredit Martinez'\n\nsources,     appellants'   counsel       suggested    that    the   semantical\n\ndistinction     between    a    \"poll\"    and    a   \"survey\"    had   factual\n\nsignificance.      Martinez,      however,      effectively     explained   his\n\nunderstanding of the difference between the two without raising\n\ndoubt as to the validity of either, and further clarified the\n\nlegitimacy of population sampling in the surveys and polls on which\n\nhe relied.     Counsel also probed issues regarding the circulation\n\nand availability of newspapers and magazines in Figueroa Serrano's\n\nneighborhood in particular, but the court sustained an objection to\n\nthis line of questioning as improperly suggesting that common\n\nknowledge has a subjective component.7\n\n     In a final effort to salvage the verdict, appellants rely on\n\nan instruction that they claim allowed the jury to disregard\n\nMartinez' testimony. The jury was told that \"[y]ou should consider\n\neach expert opinion received in evidence and give it such weight as\n\nyou think it deserves.         You should bear in mind that the opinions\n\n\n     7\n      Courts construing Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of\nTorts, which is applicable here, have found the determination of\ncommon knowledge to be purely objective.      See e.g. McLennan v.\nAmerican Eurocopter Corp., 245 F.3d 403, 428 (5th Cir. 2001)\n(\"Whether information about a risk is common knowledge is an\nobjective inquiry and the user's knowledge is not dispositive on\nthe issue.\"); Insolia v. Philip Morris, Inc., 216 F.3d 596, 599\n(7th Cir. 2000) (section 402A involves an objective test \"and is\nnot dependent upon the knowledge of the particular injured\nconsumer\");   Little,    243  F.   Supp.    2d   at   492   (D.S.C.\n2001)(\"[Plaintiff's] knowledge or lack of knowledge concerning the\ndangers of cigarettes is irrelevant for purposes of this\nanalysis.\").\n\n                                     -12-\n\fof experts do not bind the Court, and they do not bind you.\"\n\nConstruing this language as carte blanche for a total rejection of\n\nMartinez' testimony is a misreading of our precedent. For it makes\n\nclear      that   the     jury   could   not     reject       the   substantive,\n\nuncontradicted     and     unimpeached   evidence      upon    which   Martinez'\n\nopinion was based.        See C. Wright & A. Miller, 9A Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure §2527, at 286 n.9 (1995 & Supp. 2003) (citing\n\nQuintana-Ruiz, 303 F.3d at 75, as holding that the jury must accept\n\nthe uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of even an interested\n\nwitness).      While the instruction permitted the jury, in the event\n\nof conflicting evidence, to reject Professor Martinez' resolution\n\nof the conflict, it did not allow the jury to reject the only\n\nevidence presented on the issue for no apparent reason.\n\n          Like the testimony in Quintana-Ruiz, Martinez' presentation\n\nwas     not   \"improbable,       inconsistent,    or      otherwise    facially\n\nunbelievable.\"          Because Martinez' testimony as to the nature,\n\ncontent and variety of dissemination of information about the\n\nperils of smoking was uncontradicted and suffered no obvious defect\n\ninviting impeachment, the jury had no basis to find other than that\n\ncommon knowledge of smoking's hazards existed in Puerto Rico before\n\nJuly 1, 1969.8\n\n\n\n      8\n      Our references to common knowledge are not without limit of\ntime. We hold only that the evidence at trial required the jury to\nfind that common knowledge existed at least by the mid-1960s, the\nearliest time at which decedent may have begun smoking.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f     C.   Exclusion of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report\n\n     To the extent appellants' case lacked critical evidence on the\n\ncommon knowledge issue, appellants argue this stemmed from refusal\n\nof the district court to admit a 1988 Surgeon General's report on\n\nthe addictiveness of nicotine. When pressed by the judge regarding\n\nthe relevance of the 1988 report to claims prior to July 1, 1969,\n\nappellants' counsel offered only that \"in regard to the issue\n\nregarding addiction, Your Honor, the matter concerning [decedent]\n\nis that over the years he did become addicted in 1988.       It settled\n\nthat issue.\"   Appellants urge us to consider additional remarks in\n\nthe proffer which merely indicated that in 1964 addiction and\n\ndependence were used interchangeably and that the 1988 report\n\nstandardized   the   definition.9      They   now   claim   the   report\n\ndemonstrates that the addictive nature of smoking could not have\n\nbeen common knowledge until at least 1988. Contrary to appellants'\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Counsel's complete proffer was:\n     \"Well in regard to the issue regarding addiction, Your\n     Honor, the matter concerning Mr. Luis Serrano is that\n     over the years he did become addicted in 1988.       It\n     settled that issue. What counsel is speaking of, there\n     was a change in the definition of the Surgeon General's\n     Report from 1964 regarding addiction versus defendant's\n     dependence. Sometimes they used it interchangeably back\n     in 1964. The World Health Organization indicated that\n     they believed that cigarette smoking was addictive or\n     people became dependent upon it over those years. They\n     asked for some more studies, and they came out with the\n     report in 1988.\"\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fargument, these further remarks by no means signify that common\n\nknowledge did not exist until 1988.\n\n     Moreover, counsel's offer of proof did not reveal that this\n\nwas the intended purpose behind admitting the report.             The issue\n\nwas thus not preserved.       See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181,\n\n1194 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Tate v. Robbins & Meyers, Inc., 790\n\nF.2d 10, 12 (1986) (\"[I]f evidence is excluded because it is\n\ninadmissible for its only articulated purpose, the proponent of the\n\nevidence cannot challenge the ruling on appeal on the ground that\n\nthe evidence could have rightly been admitted for another purpose.\"\n\n(citations omitted)).     The district court properly perceived the\n\npotential for jury confusion, given that the trial was limited to\n\nclaims prior to July 1, 1969.      Counsel had the opportunity to allay\n\nsuch concerns and enunciate a specific relevant use for the report,\n\nbut failed to do so.10\n\n     In   conclusion,    we   affirm   the   district   court's   grant   of\n\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of Reynolds.            Based on the\n\nevidence presented, no reasonable jury could have found a lack of\n\ncommon knowledge during the relevant time period regarding the\n\nhealth hazards and habit-forming nature of cigarettes.\n\n     10\n      Despite appellants' urging, the decision in Perez-Trujillo\nv. Volvo Car Corp., 137 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 1998), in which we\nvacated the district court's exclusion of eyewitness testimony,\ndoes not suggest an opposite result.      Exclusion of eyewitness\ntestimony contemporaneous in time with the exact events at issue is\ndistinguishable from exclusion of this report on general subject\nmatter published nearly twenty years after the relevant time period\nin the case.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f         III.    Demand for New Trial on Post-1969 Claims\n\n     Appellants also appeal from the grant of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Reynolds on post-1969 failure-to-warn claims, which the\n\ndistrict court   found   preempted by the terms of the Labeling Act.\n\nCruz Vargas, 218 F. Supp. 2d at 117.     As with judgment as a matter\n\nof law, we review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty. Sparks v. Fidelity Nat'l. Title Ins. Co., 294 F.3d 259, 265\n\n(1st Cir. 2002). Furthermore, we may affirm the district court \"on\n\nany ground revealed by the record.\" Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter,\n\n339 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     Appellants offer the intriguing suggestion that our preemption\n\nanalysis consider the \"linguistic particularity\" of Puerto Rico in\n\ngiving effect to the clearly expressed Congressional intent that\n\nwarnings required by the Labeling Act be deemed adequate to inform\n\nthe public of cigarettes' hazards.      See 15 U.S.C. §1331(1) (1998).\n\nReynolds, on the other hand, points to case law analyzing the\n\npreemptive scope of the Labeling Act and argues that any state law\n\ntort action based on inadequate package warnings falls under the\n\nrubric of these decisions.    See Medtronic Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S.\n\n470, 488 n.9 (1996) (text of the Labeling Act \"specified the\n\nprecise warning to smokers that Congress deemed both necessary and\n\nsufficient\"); Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 524\n\n(1992) (failure-to-warn claims preempted to the extent such claims\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\frequire a showing that advertisement or promotion of cigarettes\n\nrequired \"additional, or more clearly stated, warnings\"); Palmer v.\n\nLiggett Group, Inc., 825 F.2d 620, 629 (1st Cir. 1987) (describing\n\n\"state      tort     liability\"    as     \"seriously     disruptive      to   the\n\ncongressionally calibrated balance of national interests\").                    We\n\nneed     not    decide,    however,     if     appellants'    argument   defeats\n\npreemption because we have already determined that the jury was\n\nrequired       to   believe   Reynolds'      uncontradicted    and   unimpeached\n\ntestimony on the existence of common knowledge in Puerto Rico prior\n\nto July 1, 1969.          It is thus axiomatic that proof of such common\n\nknowledge also stymies all subsequent failure-to-warn claims.11\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law in favor\n\nof Reynolds.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      In any event, we suggest that the argument regarding the\nlanguage of warnings is best entertained by Congress, and not the\ncourts. See Aponte Rivera, 44 P.R. Offic. Trans. 10, 144 D.P.R.\n830 (P.R. 1998),(Negrón Garcia, J., dissenting) (\"[I]t is incumbent\nupon the Legislative Assembly and the Secretary of Health, not upon\nthis Court, to make the pertinent standardization [of the language\nof warnings], to set it forth in a statute or regulation, and to\ndefine what are sufficient instructions and warnings.\"); Ramirez v.\nPlough, 6 Cal. 4th 539, 550 (1994) (\"Defining the circumstances\nunder which warnings or other information should be provided in a\nlanguage other than English is a task for which legislative and\nadministrative bodies are particularly well suited.\").\n\n                                        -17-\n\f",

Reynolds Tobacco Company, invoking Puerto Rico tort law and alleging that the cigarette manufacturer was responsible for Figueroa Serrano's death. The district court granted summary judgment on most of appellants' claims, allowing only the sons' failure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969 to go to the jury. After the jury ruled in favor of the sons, the court granted judgment as a matter of law for Reynolds, concluding that, based on the evidence at trial, the jury was compelled to find that the risks of cigarette smoking were commonly known during the relevant time period. On appeal, the sons challenge the judgment as a matter of law. All three appellants challenge the summary judgment ruling to the extent that it found all post-1969 failure-to-warn claims preempted by federal legislation. Irene Cruz Vargas also challenges the court's ruling that the statute of limitations barred her claims. We affirm both of the district court's rulings on the basis of common knowledge, making it unnecessary to reach appellants' other arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed. The decedent was a native Spanish speaker with no written or verbal English proficiency. He seldom watched television and rarely, if ever, read newspapers or magazines. Figueroa Serrano was a longtime heavy smoker with a documented medical history of hypertension, including several hospitalizations occurring between 1994 and his death on October 18, 1999. At the request of the family, no autopsy was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed this suit against Reynolds in October of 2000, alleging that decedent's smoking was responsible for his hypertension, which in turn was a substantial factor in his death. Appellants brought a series of negligence and strict liability claims under Puerto Rico law, including failure to warn and design defect. They furthermore argued that Reynolds failed to comply with its duty, which they alleged to be implicit in federal regulation, to print Spanish language warnings on cigarette packages sold in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Reynolds summary judgment on all of Irene Cruz Vargas' claims, finding them time-barred. <i>Cruz Vargas v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 218 F.Supp.2d 109, 116 (D.P.R.2002). With respect to the sons' claims, the district court granted Reynolds' motion for summary judgment on claims of defective design and the inherent dangerousness of tobacco and cigarettes. <i>Id.</i> at 121. The court denied Reynolds' motion as to the failure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969, the date that the amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act went into effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> at 117. The court found failure-to-warn claims based on conduct after July 1, 1969 preempted by the Labeling Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sons proceeded to a jury trial on their remaining claims. Reynolds defended at trial primarily based on evidence that the risks of cigarette smoking were common knowledge prior to 1969, and thus no duty to warn existed. A jury found in favor of both sons, awarding each damages in the amount of $500,000. The district court subsequently granted Reynolds' motion for judgment as a matter of law, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), finding that appellants failed to offer any evidence demonstrating that the ordinary consumer lacked knowledge of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking. The district court held that the jury was not entitled to reject the unimpeached, uncontradicted testimony of Reynolds' expert witness, who stated his opinion that the Puerto Rican public was aware of such hazards prior to July 1, 1969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants allege the district court's action was improper because the evidence presented by Reynolds was susceptible to conflicting inferences. In addition, they contest summary judgment on two grounds: first, that the court erred in determining that the claims accrued at the time appellants learned of Figueroa Serrano's injuries, rather than on the actual date of his death; second, that it further erred in refusing to find that the absence of warnings in Spanish rendered the required warnings of the Labeling Act ineffectual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Judgment as a Matter of Law</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo. <i>Hochen v. Bobst Group, Inc.,</i> 290 F.3d 446, 453 (1st Cir.2002). We examine the record as a whole, reading the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Although we may not weigh the credibility of witnesses, <i>id.,</i> we assume the veracity \"of any admissions made and stipulations entered into by the party opposing the Rule 50 motion ... as well as any evidence derived from disinterested witnesses that has not been contradicted or impeached.\" <i>Quintana-Ruiz v. Hyundai Motor Corp.,</i> 303 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.2002) (<i>quoting Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co.,</i> 152 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1998)). Only if \"applying these standards, the evidence does not permit a reasonable jury to find in favor\" of appellants will we affirm the district court. <i>Brennan v. GTE Gov't Systems Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Evidence Regarding Common Knowledge</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case calls for us to evaluate application of the common knowledge doctrine in the context of tobacco litigation. The doctrine stems from the principle that a manufacturer cannot be held liable under either strict liability or negligence for failure to warn of a danger commonly known to the public. <i>See, e.g., Guevara v. Dorsey Labs., Div. of Sandoz, Inc.,</i> 845 F.2d 364, 367 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The duty to warn in general is limited to hazards not commonly known to the relevant public.\"); <i>Aponte Rivera v. Sears Roebuck,</i> 44 P.R. Offic. Trans. 7, 144 D.P.R. 830 (1998) (\"[A] manufacturer need not warn of a hazard if the average consumer ordinarily has knowledge of the dangers of the product.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a claim for negligence under the law of Puerto Rico, a plaintiff must prove that \"(1) defendant owed a duty to prevent the harm by conforming to a reasonable standard of conduct; (2) defendant breached that duty through a negligent act or omission; and (3) the negligent act or omission caused the plaintiff's harm.\" <i>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Grove Mfg. Co.,</i> 958 F.2d 1169, 1171 (1st Cir. 1992). <i>See also</i> 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141 (1991). Puerto Rico has also adopted, by judicial act and with a slight modification, the strict liability principles embodied in section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. <i>Perez-Trujillo v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 137 F.3d 50, 53 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (clarifying that claimant in Puerto Rico must show the product was \"unsafe\" rather than \"unreasonably dangerous\"); <i>Rivera Santana v. Superior Packaging, Inc.,</i> 1992 P.R.Eng. 754830 *3 n. 4, 132 D.P.R. 115 (1992) (noting that Puerto Rico has adopted U.S. common law products liability principles to \"fill a gap in our body of laws\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A products liability plaintiff alleging failure to warn must prove \"(1) the manufacturer knew, or should have known of the risk inherent in the product; (2) there were no warnings or instructions, or those provided were inadequate; (3) the absence of warnings made the product inherently dangerous; (4) the absence of adequate warnings or instructions was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury.\" <i>Aponte Rivera,</i> 44 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 6. Under the common knowledge doctrine, however, a defendant neither breaches a duty nor causes the product to be inherently dangerous when the allegedly omitted warning concerns a danger of which the public is well aware.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an ordinary case on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law, plaintiffs point to evidence suggesting a genuine dispute of a material fact. <i>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (standard for judgment as a matter of law mirrors that of summary judgment, and thus to withstand a motion under either inquiry, the evidence must indicate \"sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury\"). In other cases in which common knowledge was at issue, plaintiffs have successfully defended against summary judgment motions by pointing to evidence suggesting such a genuine dispute. <i>See, e.g., Tompkin v. American Brands,</i> 219 F.3d 566, 568-70 (6th Cir.2000) (plaintiff's expert reviewed periodicals, polls, and industry and government reports from the relevant time period, concluding that smokers were not adequately informed of the risks); <i>Little v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 243 F.Supp.2d 480, 492-495 (D.S.C.2001) (plaintiff's \"sample authorities,\" including journals, reports and polls, created a jury question regarding common knowledge). Appellants here take a different approach, contending that they did not have a burden to produce any evidence at all. The crux of appellants' entreaty on appeal is that neither the strict liability nor the negligence claim requires any affirmative showing, and thus the burden rested entirely on Reynolds. Whether or not this is a correct view of the law, after searching the record we have found no evidence which supports appellants' allegations that there was a lack of common knowledge and thus we are compelled to find that Reynolds met its burden in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that Reynolds' experts presented conflicting testimony on common knowledge, which permitted the jury to reach the conclusion it did. This contention, however, is not borne out by review of the trial transcript. Reynolds' defense consisted of three witnesses. The testimony of the first two had no relevance to the specific common knowledge inquiry. Dr. Herman Melavet, a medical internist, testified as to the dispute in the medical community as to the precise causal link, if any, between smoking and hypertension. He also suggested that the decedent may have died from a dissecting aneurysm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The testimony of Dr. Juan Fumero, a psychiatrist, concerned contemporary psychiatric understanding of nicotine dependence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants extract a discrete portion from the testimony of Dr. Fumero in support of their argument that the jury was presented with contradictory evidence undermining common knowledge. Appellants fault Dr. Fumero for his opinion that regardless of the term used to describe a smoking habit, be it \"addiction,\" \"nicotine dependence,\" or \"substance abuse,\" an individual committed to quitting will be able to do so. But to say that one can abandon a habit sheds no light on whether the prevalence of the habit was a matter generally known.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Similarly, Dr. Melavet's testimony that cigarette smoking did not cause hypertension says nothing about the state of common knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only Professor Luis Martinez, an expert in Carribean social history, testified on the precise issue of common knowledge, and he concluded by stating his opinion that \"the average consumer in Puerto Rico during the 1950's, during the 1960's\" was aware both of health risks, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, and that \"smoking was or could be difficult to quit.\" Appellants contend that the jury permissibly rejected Martinez' testimony as biased and incredible. Appellants' bias argument relies on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Sonnentheil v. Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.,</i> 172 U.S. 401, 19 S.Ct. 233, 43 L.Ed. 492 (1899), which held that \"the mere fact that a witness is interested in the result of the suit is deemed sufficient to require the credibility of his testimony to be submitted as a question of fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 408. Case law in this circuit, however, clarifies that mere payment to an expert by a party does not raise a question of bias. <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 76 (finding that witnesses' status as \"paid outside experts\" did not gainsay credibility).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martinez' testimony is furthermore neither improbable nor contradicted, thus falling under the established principle that \"testimony concerning a simple fact, capable of contradiction, not incredible, and standing uncontradicted, unimpeached, or in no way discredited by cross-examination, must be permitted to stand.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75 (quoting <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v. Howell,</i> 401 F.2d 752, 754 (10th Cir.1968)). This rule is particularly applicable to the \"testimony of an expert witness ... where the testimony bears on technical questions ... beyond the competence of lay determination.\" <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 76-77 (quoting <i>Webster v. Offshore Food Serv., Inc.,</i> 434 F.2d 1191, 1193 (5th Cir.1970)(internal citation omitted)(ellipses in original). This is such a case. The \"common knowledge\" defense is assessed objectively<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>, and, despite the nomenclature, it is a technical question involving methods, financing, and sources of research beyond the competence of lay determination, at least when pertaining to history forty or fifty years removed from the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martinez' research followed an accepted method of historical analysis and drew on a breadth of sources &#8212; such as newspapers, polls, surveys, school curricula, films, and reports by various public interest organizations &#8212; contemporaneous with the time period at issue in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Given his explanation of the sources and method, Martinez' opinions are not improbable or unbelievable, and the transcript reveals no inconsistencies in his direct testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross examination neither brought to light any contradictions undermining Martinez' opinion nor revealed information suggesting a lack of common knowledge. In an effort to discredit Martinez' sources, appellants' counsel suggested that the semantical distinction between a \"poll\" and a \"survey\" had factual significance. Martinez, however, effectively explained his understanding of the difference between the two without raising doubt as to the validity of either, and further clarified the legitimacy of population sampling in the surveys and polls on which he relied. Counsel also probed issues regarding the circulation and availability of newspapers and magazines in Figueroa Serrano's neighborhood in particular, but the court sustained an objection to this line of questioning as improperly suggesting that common knowledge has a subjective component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to salvage the verdict, appellants rely on an instruction that they claim allowed the jury to disregard Martinez' testimony. The jury was told that \"[y]ou should consider each expert opinion received in evidence and give it such weight as you think it deserves. You should bear in mind that the opinions of experts do not bind the Court, and they do not bind you.\" Construing this language as carte blanche for a total rejection of Martinez' testimony is a misreading of our precedent. For it makes clear that the jury could not reject the substantive, uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence upon which Martinez' opinion was based. <i>See</i> C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, 9A <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2527, at 286 n. 9 (1995 &amp; Supp.2003) (citing <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 75, as holding that the jury must accept the uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of even an interested witness). While the instruction permitted the jury, in the event of conflicting evidence, to reject Professor Martinez' resolution of the conflict, it did not allow the jury to reject the only evidence presented on the issue for no apparent reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the testimony in <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> Martinez' presentation was not \"improbable, inconsistent, or otherwise facially unbelievable.\" Because Martinez' testimony as to the nature, content and variety of dissemination of information about the perils of smoking was uncontradicted and suffered no obvious defect inviting impeachment, the jury had no basis to find other than that common knowledge of smoking's hazards existed in Puerto Rico before July 1, 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Exclusion of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent appellants' case lacked critical evidence on the common knowledge issue, appellants argue this stemmed from refusal of the district court to admit a 1988 Surgeon General's report on the addictiveness of nicotine. When pressed by the judge regarding the relevance of the 1988 report to claims prior to July 1, 1969, appellants' counsel offered only that \"in regard to the issue regarding addiction, Your Honor, the matter concerning [decedent] is that over the years he did become addicted in 1988. It settled that issue.\" Appellants urge us to consider additional remarks in the proffer which merely indicated that in 1964 addiction and dependence were used interchangeably and that the 1988 report standardized the definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> They now claim the report demonstrates that the addictive nature of smoking could not have been common knowledge until at least 1988. Contrary to appellants' argument, these further remarks by no means signify that common knowledge did not exist until 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, counsel's offer of proof did not reveal that this was the intended purpose behind admitting the report. The issue was thus not preserved. <i>See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc.,</i> 21 F.3d 1181, 1194 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Tate v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc.,</i> 790 F.2d 10, 12 (1986) (\"[I]f evidence is excluded because it is inadmissible for its only articulated purpose, the proponent of the evidence cannot challenge the ruling on appeal on the ground that the evidence could have rightly been admitted for another purpose.\" (citations omitted)). The district court properly perceived the potential for jury confusion, given that the trial was limited to claims prior to July 1, 1969. Counsel had the opportunity to allay such concerns and enunciate a specific relevant use for the report, but failed to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we affirm the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of Reynolds.

As with judgment as a matter of law, we review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Sparks v. Fidelity Nat'l.

Reynolds, on the other hand, points to case law analyzing the preemptive scope of the Labeling Act and argues that any state law tort action based on inadequate package warnings falls under the rubric of these decisions. <i>See Medtronic Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 488 n. 9, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (text of the Labeling Act \"specified the precise warning to smokers that Congress deemed both necessary and sufficient\"); <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 524, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (failure-to-warn claims preempted to the extent such claims require a showing that advertisement or promotion of cigarettes required \"additional, or more clearly stated, warnings\"); <i>Palmer v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 825 F.2d 620, 629 (1st Cir.1987) (describing \"state tort liability\" as \"seriously disruptive to the congressionally calibrated balance of national interests\"). We need not decide, however, if appellants' argument defeats preemption because we have already determined that the jury was required to believe Reynolds' uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony on the existence of common knowledge in Puerto Rico prior to July 1, 1969. It is thus axiomatic that proof of such common knowledge also stymies all subsequent failure-to-warn claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law in favor of Reynolds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Irene Cruz Vargas is the widow of the decedent; Luis Rogelio Figueroa Cruz and Eli Rogelio Figueroa Cruz are the sons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Labeling Act mandated cautionary warnings on cigarette packages beginning in 1965.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, invoking Puerto Rico tort law and alleging that the cigarette manufacturer was responsible for Figueroa Serrano's death. The district court granted summary judgment on most of appellants' claims, allowing only the sons' failure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969 to go to the jury. After the jury ruled in favor of the sons, the court granted judgment as a matter of law for Reynolds, concluding that, based on the evidence at trial, the jury was compelled to find that the risks of cigarette smoking were commonly known during the relevant time period. On appeal, the sons challenge the judgment as a matter of law. All three appellants challenge the summary judgment ruling to the extent that it found all post-1969 failure-to-warn claims preempted by federal legislation. Irene Cruz Vargas also challenges the court's ruling that the statute of limitations barred her claims. We affirm both of the district court's rulings on the basis of common knowledge, making it unnecessary to reach appellants' other arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed. The decedent was a native Spanish speaker with no written or verbal English proficiency. He seldom watched television and rarely, if ever, read newspapers or magazines. Figueroa Serrano was a longtime heavy smoker with a documented medical history of hypertension, including several hospitalizations occurring between 1994 and his death on October 18, 1999. At the request of the family, no autopsy was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed this suit against Reynolds in October of 2000, alleging that decedent's smoking was responsible for his hypertension, which in turn was a substantial factor in his death. Appellants brought a series of negligence and strict liability claims under Puerto Rico law, including failure to warn and design defect. They furthermore argued that Reynolds failed to comply with its duty, which they alleged to be implicit in federal regulation, to print Spanish language warnings on cigarette packages sold in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Reynolds summary judgment on all of Irene Cruz Vargas' claims, finding them time-barred. <i>Cruz Vargas v.

With respect to the sons' claims, the district court granted Reynolds' motion for summary judgment on claims of defective design and the inherent dangerousness of tobacco and cigarettes. <i>Id.</i> at 121. The court denied Reynolds' motion as to the failure-to-warn claims arising prior to July 1, 1969, the date that the amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act went into effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> at 117.

Reynolds defended at trial primarily based on evidence that the risks of cigarette smoking were common knowledge prior to 1969, and thus no duty to warn existed. A jury found in favor of both sons, awarding each damages in the amount of $500,000. The district court subsequently granted Reynolds' motion for judgment as a matter of law, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), finding that appellants failed to offer any evidence demonstrating that the ordinary consumer lacked knowledge of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking. The district court held that the jury was not entitled to reject the unimpeached, uncontradicted testimony of Reynolds' expert witness, who stated his opinion that the Puerto Rican public was aware of such hazards prior to July 1, 1969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants allege the district court's action was improper because the evidence presented by Reynolds was susceptible to conflicting inferences. In addition, they contest summary judgment on two grounds: first, that the court erred in determining that the claims accrued at the time appellants learned of Figueroa Serrano's injuries, rather than on the actual date of his death; second, that it further erred in refusing to find that the absence of warnings in Spanish rendered the required warnings of the Labeling Act ineffectual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Judgment as a Matter of Law</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo. <i>Hochen v.

Appellants here take a different approach, contending that they did not have a burden to produce any evidence at all. The crux of appellants' entreaty on appeal is that neither the strict liability nor the negligence claim requires any affirmative showing, and thus the burden rested entirely on Reynolds. Whether or not this is a correct view of the law, after searching the record we have found no evidence which supports appellants' allegations that there was a lack of common knowledge and thus we are compelled to find that Reynolds met its burden in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that Reynolds' experts presented conflicting testimony on common knowledge, which permitted the jury to reach the conclusion it did. This contention, however, is not borne out by review of the trial transcript. Reynolds' defense consisted of three witnesses. The testimony of the first two had no relevance to the specific common knowledge inquiry. Dr. Herman Melavet, a medical internist, testified as to the dispute in the medical community as to the precise causal link, if any, between smoking and hypertension. He also suggested that the decedent may have died from a dissecting aneurysm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The testimony of Dr. Juan Fumero, a psychiatrist, concerned contemporary psychiatric understanding of nicotine dependence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants extract a discrete portion from the testimony of Dr. Fumero in support of their argument that the jury was presented with contradictory evidence undermining common knowledge. Appellants fault Dr. Fumero for his opinion that regardless of the term used to describe a smoking habit, be it \"addiction,\" \"nicotine dependence,\" or \"substance abuse,\" an individual committed to quitting will be able to do so. But to say that one can abandon a habit sheds no light on whether the prevalence of the habit was a matter generally known.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Similarly, Dr. Melavet's testimony that cigarette smoking did not cause hypertension says nothing about the state of common knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only Professor Luis Martinez, an expert in Carribean social history, testified on the precise issue of common knowledge, and he concluded by stating his opinion that \"the average consumer in Puerto Rico during the 1950's, during the 1960's\" was aware both of health risks, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, and that \"smoking was or could be difficult to quit.\" Appellants contend that the jury permissibly rejected Martinez' testimony as biased and incredible. Appellants' bias argument relies on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Sonnentheil v. Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94968\"><a href=\"/opinion/94968/sonnentheil-v-christian-moerlein-brewing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Case law in this circuit, however, clarifies that mere payment to an expert by a party does not raise a question of bias. <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 76 (finding that witnesses' status as \"paid outside experts\" did not gainsay credibility).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martinez' testimony is furthermore neither improbable nor contradicted, thus falling under the established principle that \"testimony concerning a simple fact, capable of contradiction, not incredible, and standing uncontradicted, unimpeached, or in no way discredited by cross-examination, must be permitted to stand.\" <i>Id.</i> at 75 (quoting <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac.

This rule is particularly applicable to the \"testimony of an expert witness ... where the testimony bears on technical questions ... beyond the competence of lay determination.\" <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 76-77 (quoting <i>Webster v.

In an effort to discredit Martinez' sources, appellants' counsel suggested that the semantical distinction between a \"poll\" and a \"survey\" had factual significance. Martinez, however, effectively explained his understanding of the difference between the two without raising doubt as to the validity of either, and further clarified the legitimacy of population sampling in the surveys and polls on which he relied. Counsel also probed issues regarding the circulation and availability of newspapers and magazines in Figueroa Serrano's neighborhood in particular, but the court sustained an objection to this line of questioning as improperly suggesting that common knowledge has a subjective component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final effort to salvage the verdict, appellants rely on an instruction that they claim allowed the jury to disregard Martinez' testimony. The jury was told that \"[y]ou should consider each expert opinion received in evidence and give it such weight as you think it deserves. You should bear in mind that the opinions of experts do not bind the Court, and they do not bind you.\" Construing this language as carte blanche for a total rejection of Martinez' testimony is a misreading of our precedent. For it makes clear that the jury could not reject the substantive, uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence upon which Martinez' opinion was based. <i>See</i> C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, 9A <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 2527, at 286 n. 9 (1995 &amp; Supp.2003) (citing <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> 303 F.3d at 75, as holding that the jury must accept the uncontradicted and unimpeached testimony of even an interested witness). While the instruction permitted the jury, in the event of conflicting evidence, to reject Professor Martinez' resolution of the conflict, it did not allow the jury to reject the only evidence presented on the issue for no apparent reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the testimony in <i>Quintana-Ruiz,</i> Martinez' presentation was not \"improbable, inconsistent, or otherwise facially unbelievable.\" Because Martinez' testimony as to the nature, content and variety of dissemination of information about the perils of smoking was uncontradicted and suffered no obvious defect inviting impeachment, the jury had no basis to find other than that common knowledge of smoking's hazards existed in Puerto Rico before July 1, 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Exclusion of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent appellants' case lacked critical evidence on the common knowledge issue, appellants argue this stemmed from refusal of the district court to admit a 1988 Surgeon General's report on the addictiveness of nicotine.

It settled that issue.\" Appellants urge us to consider additional remarks in the proffer which merely indicated that in 1964 addiction and dependence were used interchangeably and that the 1988 report standardized the definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> They now claim the report demonstrates that the addictive nature of smoking could not have been common knowledge until at least 1988.

It settled that issue. What counsel is speaking of, there was a change in the definition of the Surgeon General's Report from 1964 regarding addiction versus defendant's dependence.
