Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Wendy Sibbison on brief for appellants.\n     Jonathan H. Levy, Attorney, Appellate Staff, Civil Division,\nPeter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Michael J. Sullivan,\nUnited States Attorney, and Mark B. Stern, Attorney, Appellate\nStaff, Civil Division, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 1, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This case involves an effort to\n\nevade the presentment and exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the\n\nFederal Employees Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 8121, 8128,\n\nand bring suit directly in federal court under the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.             Adhering to\n\nthis court's earlier decision in Bruni v. United States, 964 F.2d\n\n76 (1st Cir. 1992), we affirm the district court's dismissal of the\n\nFTCA claims.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            In 2002, Stephen Gill, an attorney, moved his family to\n\nFlorida to work for the United States Navy as a civilian attorney-\n\nadvisor   for   what   he   understood    would   be   a   two-year   period.\n\nInstead, he was given a series of short-term jobs and extensions,\n\nstarting only forty-five days into the job.                The job ended in\n\nJanuary 2003, less than a year after it began.             Gill and his wife\n\nin February 2004 filed claims under the FTCA with the Navy,\n\nalleging that they had suffered emotional distress but no physical\n\ninjuries.    The Navy responded that Gill needed instead to file a\n\nclaim with the Secretary of Labor under the federal workers'\n\ncompensation act, FECA.       He refused to do so1 and, after the six-\n\nmonth FTCA waiting period, the Gills brought suit in district court\n\nfor negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and\n\n\n\n     1\n          The record indicates that Gill failed to file a FECA\nclaim within the three-year period provided by 5 U.S.C. § 8122(a).\n\n                                   -2-\n\floss of consortium, service, and marital society, seeking over $1\n\nmillion in damages.\n\n               Relying on our decision in Bruni, the district court\n\ndismissed the action.             On appeal, the Gills make two arguments\n\nattempting to distinguish Bruni.               First, they argue that Gill was\n\nan independent contractor and not a federal employee for FECA\n\npurposes, and that this issue of status is for the court to\n\ndetermine.        Their     second        argument      is    that   the    FTCA    is   the\n\nappropriate       vehicle      for   claims       for    emotional     damages       absent\n\nphysical injuries.          We reject both arguments.\n\n                                            II.\n\n               We review de novo the district court's ultimate legal\n\nconclusion      on   a   motion      to    dismiss      for   lack    of    jurisdiction.\n\nValentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nWe review for clear error the district court's findings of fact and\n\nits conclusions regarding mixed questions of law and fact.                           Id.\n\n               FECA is a federal workers' compensation scheme designed\n\nto provide redress for work-related injuries.                         The Act provides\n\nthat \"[t]he United States shall pay compensation as specified by\n\nthis       subchapter    for   the    disability        or    death    of    an    employee\n\nresulting from personal injury sustained while in the performance\n\nof his duty.\"2       5 U.S.C. § 8102(a).\n\n\n       2\n          There are exceptions to coverage if the injury or death\nis \"(1) caused by willful misconduct of the employee; (2) caused by\nthe employee's intention to bring about the injury or death of\n\n                                            -3-\n\f           Liability under FECA is \"exclusive and instead of all\n\nother liability of the United States . . . to the employee, his\n\nlegal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any\n\nother   person    otherwise   entitled   to    recover   damages.\"    Id.\n\n§ 8116(c).       The Act specifically excludes liability \"under a\n\nFederal tort liability statute.\"         Id.   As the Supreme Court has\n\nexplained:\n\n           FECA's exclusive liability provision . . . was\n           designed to protect the Government from suits\n           under statutes, such as the Federal Tort\n           Claims Act, that had been enacted to waive the\n           Government's sovereign immunity. In enacting\n           this provision, Congress adopted the principal\n           compromise -- the \"quid pro quo\" -- commonly\n           found in workers' compensation legislation:\n           employees are guaranteed the right to receive\n           immediate, fixed benefits, regardless of fault\n           and without need for litigation, but in return\n           they lose the right to sue the Government.\n\nLockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States, 460 U.S. 190, 193-94\n\n(1983).\n\n           Most importantly, the Act provides that \"[t]he Secretary\n\nof Labor shall administer, and decide all questions arising under,\n\n[FECA].\"     5 U.S.C. § 8145 (emphasis added).           Further, the Act\n\nstates that\n\n           [t]he action of the Secretary or his designee\n           in allowing or denying a payment under this\n           subchapter is --\n\n\n\n\nhimself or of another; or (3) proximately caused by                   the\nintoxication of the injured employee.\" 5 U.S.C. § 8102(a).\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          (1) final and conclusive for all purposes and\n          with respect to all questions of law and fact;\n          and\n\n          (2) not subject to review by another official\n          of the United States or by a court by mandamus\n          or otherwise.\n\nId. § 8128(b) (emphasis added). \"FECA contains an 'unambiguous and\n\ncomprehensive'    provision   barring   any   judicial   review   of   the\n\nSecretary of Labor's determination of FECA coverage.\"       Sw. Marine,\n\nInc. v. Gizoni, 502 U.S. 81, 90 (1991) (quoting Lindahl v. Office\n\nof Pers. Mgmt., 470 U.S. 768, 780 & n.13 (1985)).\n\n          Accordingly, in Bruni this court held that a federal\n\nemployee who brings tort claims against the United States \"must\n\nfirst seek and be denied relief under the FECA unless his/her\n\ninjuries do not present a substantial question of compensability\n\nunder [FECA].\"    964 F.2d at 79.       We held that \"[a] substantial\n\nquestion exists unless it is certain that the Secretary would not\n\nfind coverage.\"    Id.   We also stated that \"[i]n determining . . .\n\nwhether there is a substantial question of compensability under\n\nFECA, we must consider the totality of the circumstances.\"         Id.\n\n          The Gills argue that Bruni is not concerned with either\n\nthe question whether a plaintiff is a federal employee or the\n\nquestion whether a particular type of injury is compensable under\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fFECA,    and    that   these   are   questions   for   the   courts,   not   the\n\nSecretary of Labor, to decide.3\n\n               In Bruni, there was no dispute whether the injured party\n\nhad been a federal employee or an independent contractor; rather,\n\nthe question was whether the injury was sustained while in the\n\nperformance of the job.         Id. at 79.   Similarly, there was no issue\n\nin Bruni as to whether emotional distress claims are covered by\n\nFECA.    Id.     But these distinctions between Bruni and the instant\n\ncase do not make any difference to the jurisdictional inquiry. The\n\nnature of the coverage determination made by the Secretary does not\n\nmatter. The test when the injured party fails to seek relief under\n\nFECA is the same: whether \"it is certain that the Secretary would\n\nnot find coverage.\"       Id.\n\n               With respect to their emotional distress argument, the\n\nGills rely on Sheehan v. United States, 896 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir.),\n\nmodified on other grounds, 917 F.2d 424 (9th Cir. 1990), to support\n\n\n\n     3\n          The Gills argue that employment status is not a\njurisdictional requirement for FTCA claims, and thus the district\ncourt should have resolved this issue in their favor under Rule\n12(b)(6). This argument has no merit. Gill's status as either a\nfederal employee or an independent contractor is pertinent to\nwhether it is certain the Secretary would find coverage under FECA.\nThis, in turn, relates to whether or not the district court had\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the Gills' FTCA claims.        The\ngovernment's motion to dismiss was properly considered under Rule\n12(b)(1). See Muniz-Rivera v. United States, 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st\nCir. 2003); see also Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d\n142, 149 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"When a court is confronted with motions\nto dismiss under both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it ordinarily\nought to decide the former before broaching the latter.\").\n\n                                       -6-\n\fa distinction between questions concerning \"coverage in and of\n\nitself\"4 and questions concerning FECA's \"scope of coverage.\"     Id.\n\nat 1174.   The Gills argue that whether a claim is within the scope\n\nof FECA is a question that must be answered by federal courts,\n\nbecause it is one of jurisdiction.     The Gills suggest that scope of\n\ncoverage questions must be answered by federal courts regardless of\n\nwhether there is a substantial question of FECA coverage.\n\n           First, Sheehan is inapposite.    In Sheehan, the Secretary\n\nof Labor had already concluded that Sheehan's non-physical injuries\n\nwere covered by FECA.5    Id. at 1173.    That case, unlike this one,\n\ndid not concern whether a claim must be presented first to the\n\nSecretary.\n\n           Second, even if Sheehan stood for the proposition that a\n\ncourt, instead of the Secretary of Labor, may make an initial\n\ndetermination of uncertain coverage questions, we would reject\n\nSheehan.     That reasoning is inconsistent with both Bruni and the\n\n\n\n     4\n          The Ninth Circuit noted that questions concerning\n\"coverage in and of itself\" address issues such as whether an\ninjury occurred while an employee was at work and whether an injury\noccurred while plaintiff was an employee. Sheehan, 917 F.2d at\n424.\n     5\n          The Ninth Circuit nonetheless ruled that the Act\nauthorizes compensation only for physical harm, and not for\n\"emotional distress . . . divorced from any claim of physical\nharm.\" Sheehan, 896 F.2d at 1174. The court stated that because\nSheehan's type of claim was not within FECA's scope of coverage,\nFECA was not her exclusive remedy, and the district court should\nnot have dismissed Sheehan's FTCA claim for negligent infliction of\nemotional distress. Id. at 1173-74.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fstatutory assignment of these questions to the Secretary.             Bruni\n\ndid   not   parse   different   types   of   coverage   questions   for   the\n\nSecretary, and its logic prohibits such parsing.            Federal courts\n\nhave subject matter jurisdiction over federal tort claims only when\n\n\"it is certain that the Secretary would not find coverage [under\n\nthe Act].\"     Bruni, 964 F.2d at 79.         Further, the Ninth Circuit\n\nappears to have rejected the Gills' reading of Sheehan.         In a later\n\ncase, the court confined Sheehan to cases where the plaintiff's\n\nclaim \"was not colorable under FECA as a matter of law.\"            Figueroa\n\nv. United States, 7 F.3d 1405, 1408 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n            Bruni accords with the rule in other circuits.             Every\n\ncircuit addressing the issue has held that federal courts lack\n\njurisdiction to decide uncertain questions of FECA coverage. Those\n\nquestions are left to the Secretary.             See Tippetts v. United\n\nStates, 308 F.3d 1091, 1094 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that where\n\nthere is a substantial question of coverage, the district court\n\nlacks jurisdiction pending a determination by the Secretary); Noble\n\nv. United States, 216 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir. 2000) (noting that\n\nFTCA action cannot be considered when there is a substantial\n\nquestion as to FECA coverage); White v. United States, 143 F.3d\n\n232, 234 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"Only if we are certain that the\n\nSecretary of Labor would conclude that the employee's injuries do\n\nnot present a substantial question of coverage under FECA may we\n\nentertain the employee's FTCA claim without the employee first\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fsubmitting the claim to the Secretary of Labor.\"); Figueroa, 7 F.3d\n\nat 1408 (stating that Sheehan did not alter \"the general rule that\n\nwhen a claim arguably falls under FECA, the question of coverage\n\nshould be resolved by the Secretary\"); Heilman v. United States,\n\n731 F.2d 1104, 1110 (3d Cir. 1984) (stating that \"where there is a\n\n'substantial question' regarding FECA coverage, the federal courts\n\nwill not entertain a claim\"); Wallace v. United States, 669 F.2d\n\n947, 951-52 (4th Cir. 1982) (adopting a rule that FTCA action\n\ncannot be filed unless plaintiff's injuries are \"'clearly not\n\ncompensable' under FECA\").\n\n          On the record in this case, it is not certain that the\n\nSecretary would find that Gill was not a federal employee but was\n\nan independent contractor.6   Second, it is not certain that the\n\nSecretary would deny Gill's claim for emotional distress damages on\n\nthe ground that such damages are unavailable under FECA.7\n\n          The United States submitted a declaration and memorandum\n\nof the Deputy Director for Federal Employees' Compensation, who had\n\n\n     6\n          Plaintiffs did not argue that Gill was an independent\ncontractor before the district court, but make this argument on\nappeal. The argument is waived, see Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics,\nInc., 70 F.3d 667, 678 (1st Cir. 1995), and, in any event, must\nfirst be presented to the Secretary of Labor.\n     7\n          To the extent Ninth Circuit law may state that claims of\nemotional distress unaccompanied by physical injury do not present\na substantial question of compensability under FECA, see Moe v.\nUnited States, 326 F.3d 1065, 1068 & n.11 (9th Cir. 2003);\nFigueroa, 7 F.3d at 1408; Sheehan, 896 F.2d at 1174, we note that\nthis position is contrary to the great weight of authority\ndiscussed hereafter in this decision.\n\n                               -9-\n\fresponsibility for administering FECA, stating that he had reviewed\n\nthe Gills' complaint and had concluded, assuming that all factual\n\nstatements      in   the   complaint     were   true,   that   there    was   \"a\n\nsignificant possibility of coverage under the FECA for an emotional\n\ncondition sustained by . . . Gill allegedly related to actions of\n\nthe Department of the Navy . . . with respect to his position . . .\n\nduring the period February 2002 through January 2003.\"             The Deputy\n\nDirector cited numerous decisions by the Employees' Compensation\n\nAppeals Board to explain how he arrived at his conclusion.\n\n              On the second point, the federal courts do not have FTCA\n\njurisdiction over plaintiffs' emotional distress claims because it\n\nis not certain the Secretary would find that FECA denies coverage\n\nfor such claims.      Indeed, the Gills concede that the Secretary of\n\nLabor   has    construed    FECA   to   encompass   work-related       emotional\n\ndistress, without regard to physical injury.               See, e.g., In re\n\nHarris, 42 Empl. Comp. App. Bd. 923, 928 (1991); In re Cutler, 28\n\nEmpl. Comp. App. Bd. 125, 129-30 (1976); see also Spinelli v. Goss,\n\n446 F.3d 159, 160-61 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (stating that the Secretary's\n\ndecision that FECA covered plaintiff's emotional and psychological\n\ninjuries \"settles the matter,\" and holding that dismissal was\n\nappropriate); Bennett v. Barnett, 210 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir. 2000)\n\n(noting that the Secretary took the position that plaintiff's\n\nemotional distress claim was covered by FECA, and holding that the\n\ndistrict court did not have jurisdiction to decide FTCA claim for\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe same injury); Farley v. United States, 162 F.3d 613, 616 (10th\n\nCir. 1998) (concluding that there was a substantial question of\n\ncompensability    under   FECA    based    on   the   recognition   that   the\n\nSecretary has in some instances found FECA coverage for emotional\n\ndistress claims); McDaniel v. United States, 970 F.2d 194, 195, 197\n\n(6th Cir. 1992) (acknowledging the Secretary's determination that\n\nFECA   covered   plaintiff's     \"disabling     emotional   condition,\"    and\n\naffirming dismissal of FTCA action for lack of jurisdiction).\n\n           We affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs'\n\nFTCA action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.                Costs are\n\nawarded to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

We held that \"[a] substantial question exists unless it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage.\" <i>Id.</i> We also stated that \"[i]n determining . . . whether there is a substantial question of compensability under FECA, we must consider the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gills argue that <i>Bruni</i> is not concerned with either the question whether a plaintiff is a federal employee or the question whether a particular type of injury is compensable under FECA, and that these are questions for the courts, not the Secretary of Labor, to decide.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bruni,</i> there was no dispute whether the injured party had been a federal employee or an independent contractor; rather, the question was whether the injury was sustained while in the performance of the job. <i>Id.</i> Similarly, there was no issue in <i>Bruni</i> as to whether emotional distress claims are covered by FECA. <i>Id.</i> But these distinctions between <i>Bruni</i> and the instant case do not make any difference to the jurisdictional inquiry. The nature of the coverage determination made by the Secretary does not matter. The test when the injured party fails to seek relief under FECA is the same: whether \"it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to their emotional distress argument, the Gills rely on <i>Sheehan v. United States,</i> 896 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir.), <i>modified on other grounds,</i> 917 F.2d 424 (9th Cir.1990), to support a distinction between questions concerning \"coverage in and of itself\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and questions concerning FECA's \"scope of coverage.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1174. The Gills argue that whether a claim is within the scope of FECA is a question that must be answered by federal courts, because it is one of jurisdiction. The Gills suggest that scope of coverage questions must be answered by federal courts regardless of whether there is a substantial question of FECA coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, <i>Sheehan</i> is inapposite. In <i>Sheehan,</i> the Secretary of Labor had already concluded that Sheehan's non-physical injuries were covered by FECA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1173. That case, unlike this one, did not concern whether a claim must be presented first to the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if <i>Sheehan</i> stood for the proposition that a court, instead of the Secretary of Labor, may make an initial determination of <i>uncertain</i> coverage questions, we would reject <i>Sheehan.</i> That reasoning is inconsistent with both <i>Bruni</i> and the statutory assignment of these questions to the Secretary. <i>Bruni</i> did not parse different types of coverage questions for the Secretary, and its logic prohibits such parsing. Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over federal tort claims only when \"it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage [under the Act].\" <i>Bruni,</i> 964 F.2d at 79. Further, the Ninth Circuit appears to have rejected the Gills' reading of <i>Sheehan.</i> In a later case, the court confined <i>Sheehan</i> to cases where the plaintiff's claim \"was not colorable under FECA as a matter of law.\" <i>Figueroa v. United States,</i> 7 F.3d 1405, 1408 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bruni</i> accords with the rule in other circuits. Every circuit addressing the issue has held that federal courts lack jurisdiction to decide uncertain questions of FECA coverage. Those questions are left to the Secretary. <i>See Tippetts v. United States,</i> 308 F.3d 1091, 1094 (10th Cir.2002) (holding that where there is a substantial question of coverage, the district court lacks jurisdiction pending a determination by the Secretary); <i>Noble v. United States,</i> 216 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that FTCA action cannot be considered when there is a substantial question as to FECA coverage); <i>White v. United States,</i> 143 F.3d 232, 234 (5th Cir.1998) (\"Only if we are certain that the Secretary of Labor would conclude that the employee's injuries do not present a substantial question of coverage under FECA may we entertain the employee's FTCA claim without the employee first submitting the claim to the Secretary of Labor.\"); <i>Figueroa,</i> 7 F.3d at 1408 (stating that <i>Sheehan</i> did not alter \"the general rule that when a claim arguably falls under FECA, the question of coverage should be resolved by the Secretary\"); <i>Heilman v. United States,</i> 731 F.2d 1104, 1110 (3d Cir.1984) (stating that \"where there is a 'substantial question' regarding FECA coverage, the federal courts will not entertain a claim\"); <i>Wallace v. United States,</i> 669 F.2d 947, 951-52 (4th Cir.1982) (adopting a rule that FTCA action cannot be filed unless plaintiff's injuries are \"`clearly not compensable' under FECA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record in this case, it is not certain that the Secretary would find that Gill was not a federal employee but was an independent contractor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Second, it is not certain that the Secretary would deny Gill's claim for emotional distress damages on the ground that such damages are unavailable under FECA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States submitted a declaration and memorandum of the Deputy Director for Federal Employees' Compensation, who had responsibility for administering FECA, stating that he had reviewed the Gills' complaint and had concluded, assuming that all factual statements in the complaint were true, that there was \"a significant possibility of coverage under the FECA for an emotional condition sustained by . . . Gill allegedly related to actions of the Department of the Navy . . . with respect to his position . . . during the period February 2002 through January 2003.\" The Deputy Director cited numerous decisions by the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board to explain how he arrived at his conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second point, the federal courts do not have FTCA jurisdiction over plaintiffs' emotional distress claims because it is not certain the Secretary would find that FECA denies coverage for such claims. Indeed, the Gills concede that the Secretary of Labor has construed FECA to encompass work-related emotional distress, without regard to physical injury. <i>See, e.g., In re Harris,</i> 42 Empl. Comp. App. Bd. 923, 928 (1991); <i>In re Cutler,</i> 28 Empl. Comp.App. Bd. 125, 129-30 (1976); <i>see also Spinelli v.

Barnett,</i> 210 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that the Secretary took the position that plaintiff's emotional distress claim was covered by FECA, and holding that the district court did not have jurisdiction to decide FTCA claim for the same injury); <i>Farley v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 613, 616 (10th Cir.1998) (concluding that there was a substantial question of compensability under FECA based on the recognition that the Secretary has in some instances found FECA coverage for emotional distress claims); <i>McDaniel v. United States,</i> 970 F.2d 194, 195, 197 (6th Cir.1992) (acknowledging the Secretary's determination that FECA covered plaintiff's \"disabling emotional condition,\" and affirming dismissal of FTCA action for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' FTCA action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

This argument has no merit. Gill's status as either a federal employee or an independent contractor is pertinent to whether it is certain the Secretary would find coverage under FECA. This, in turn, relates to whether or not the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Gills' FTCA claims. The government's motion to dismiss was properly considered under Rule 12(b)(1)<i>See Muniz-Rivera v. United States,</i> 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Deniz v.

We held that \"[a] substantial question exists unless it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage.\" <i>Id.</i> We also stated that \"[i]n determining . . . whether there is a substantial question of compensability under FECA, we must consider the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gills argue that <i>Bruni</i> is not concerned with either the question whether a plaintiff is a federal employee or the question whether a particular type of injury is compensable under FECA, and that these are questions for the courts, not the Secretary of Labor, to decide.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Bruni,</i> there was no dispute whether the injured party had been a federal employee or an independent contractor; rather, the question was whether the injury was sustained while in the performance of the job. <i>Id.</i> Similarly, there was no issue in <i>Bruni</i> as to whether emotional distress claims are covered by FECA. <i>Id.</i> But these distinctions between <i>Bruni</i> and the instant case do not make any difference to the jurisdictional inquiry. The nature of the coverage determination made by the Secretary does not matter. The test when the injured party fails to seek relief under FECA is the same: whether \"it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to their emotional distress argument, the Gills rely on <i>Sheehan v.

The Gills argue that whether a claim is within the scope of FECA is a question that must be answered by federal courts, because it is one of jurisdiction. The Gills suggest that scope of coverage questions must be answered by federal courts regardless of whether there is a substantial question of FECA coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, <i>Sheehan</i> is inapposite. In <i>Sheehan,</i> the Secretary of Labor had already concluded that Sheehan's non-physical injuries were covered by FECA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> at 1173. That case, unlike this one, did not concern whether a claim must be presented first to the Secretary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if <i>Sheehan</i> stood for the proposition that a court, instead of the Secretary of Labor, may make an initial determination of <i>uncertain</i> coverage questions, we would reject <i>Sheehan.</i> That reasoning is inconsistent with both <i>Bruni</i> and the statutory assignment of these questions to the Secretary. <i>Bruni</i> did not parse different types of coverage questions for the Secretary, and its logic prohibits such parsing. Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over federal tort claims only when \"it is <i>certain</i> that the Secretary would not find coverage [under the Act].\" <i>Bruni,</i> 964 F.2d at 79. Further, the Ninth Circuit appears to have rejected the Gills' reading of <i>Sheehan.</i> In a later case, the court confined <i>Sheehan</i> to cases where the plaintiff's claim \"was not colorable under FECA as a matter of law.\" <i>Figueroa v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655550\"><a href=\"/opinion/655550/eladio-t-figueroa-v-united-states-of-america-ad-loizeaux-ge-monroe/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1405</span></a></span>, 1408 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bruni</i> accords with the rule in other circuits.

Gill allegedly related to actions of the Department of the Navy . . . with respect to his position . . . during the period February 2002 through January 2003.\" The Deputy Director cited numerous decisions by the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board to explain how he arrived at his conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second point, the federal courts do not have FTCA jurisdiction over plaintiffs' emotional distress claims because it is not certain the Secretary would find that FECA denies coverage for such claims.
