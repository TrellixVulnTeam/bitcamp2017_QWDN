Justo Arenas, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n            Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Fredeswin Perez Caballero, with whom Jesus Hernandez-Sanchez\nand Hernandez Sanchez Law Firm were on brief, for appellants.\n     Johanna M. Emmanuelli Huertas, with whom Gina Ismalia\nGutiérrez-Galang and Law Office Pedro E. Ortiz Alvarez, were on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n                           January 28, 2005\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           Milton Nieves-Luciano and his\n\nwife and children (collectively \"appellants\") sued the Municipality\n\nof Juana Díaz and its mayor, Ramón Hernández-Torres, (collectively\n\n\"appellees\") for terminating Nieves' public employment on account\n\nof his political affiliation.            In so far as relevant to this\n\nappeal, the complaint alleged violations of the First Amendment and\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.               After discovery,\n\nthe district court awarded appellees summary judgment.             We affirm.\n\n            Nieves is a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").\n\nHe was hired by the Municipality of Juana Díaz in July 1994 under\n\na professional services contract. In 1997, the then mayor of Juana\n\nDíaz created the position of Director of Data Processing.                  This\n\nposition was identified as a trust position, meaning that its\n\noccupant could be terminated at will and without cause.                     The\n\nDirector    of     Data   Processing    was    primarily     responsible    for\n\nimplementing and managing a computerized accounting system for the\n\nmunicipality. Nieves was appointed to the position in August 1997.\n\n            From 1993 through late 2000, the NPP controlled the Juana\n\nDíaz municipal government.             In November 2000, however, power\n\nchanged    hands    as    Hernández-Torres,     a   member   of   the   Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\"), was elected mayor.             On April 11, 2001,\n\nNieves received notice that his appointment as Data Processing\n\nDirector would be terminated immediately.               The letter did not\n\nprovide Nieves with a reason for the termination other than to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstate     that,   because   Nieves   occupied   a   trust   position,   his\n\nemployment could be terminated at any time.\n\n             Subsequently, appellees explained that they terminated\n\nNieves' employment because his position was unnecessary and was\n\ncreated in violation of municipal law.          According to appellees,\n\nevery municipality in Puerto Rico was required to participate in a\n\ncentral accounting system operated by the Office of the Commission\n\nfor Municipal Affairs (the \"OCAM system\").          After the PDP assumed\n\npower, the new government reviewed the utility of several municipal\n\npositions.     As part of this review, the government determined that\n\nthe Director of Data Processing position was duplicative because\n\nthe OCAM system already provided a mandatory accounting system that\n\ncontained essentially the same features as the local system that\n\nNieves had been overseeing.          Appellants brought the underlying\n\nlawsuit to assert that this rationale was a sham and that Nieves\n\nwas terminated on account of his NPP membership.\n\n             At the conclusion of discovery, appellees moved for\n\nsummary judgment on Nieves' First Amendment and due process claims.\n\nThe district court granted the motion on the due process claim\n\nbecause appellants had not produced evidence that Nieves had a\n\nproperty interest in his employment.1      The court, however, rejected\n\nappellees' challenge on the political discrimination claim on the\n\nground that there were disputed material facts concerning the true\n\n\n     1\n         This ruling is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                     -3-\n\freason for the termination.          Specifically, the court stated that\n\nthere    were   disputes      concerning     whether   the    local   system    was\n\nduplicative of the OCAM system, whether Nieves was replaced as the\n\nDirector   of   Data   Processing     by     PDP   members,    and    whether   the\n\nposition was initially created in violation of municipal law.2\n\n            A month after the district court's ruling, appellees\n\nmoved for reconsideration of the denial of their motions for\n\nsummary judgment on the First Amendment claim. On reconsideration,\n\nthe district court determined that appellants' original summary\n\njudgment opposition did not comply with D.P.R. Local R. 311.12\n\nbecause their counter-statement of facts did not contain record\n\ncitations.3     The court also ruled that Nieves' affidavit, which\n\nstated that he had been replaced by PDP members and that Hernández-\n\nTorres   had    said   that    he   wanted    to   \"clean    the   house   of   NPP\n\nemployees,\" was inadmissible because it was not based on personal\n\nknowledge.      As a result, the court granted appellees summary\n\njudgment on the ground that there was no evidence from which a jury\n\ncould conclude that Nieves' termination was at least partially\n\nmotivated by his political affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Because of these disputed facts, the district court also\nrejected Hernández-Torres' claim that he was entitled to summary\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds.\n     3\n      In April 2004, this Rule was recodified as D.P.R. Local R.\n56(c).\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          After the entry of judgment, appellants filed a Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(2) motion seeking relief from judgment because of a\n\nnewly acquired affidavit from one of Nieves' coworkers.                 The\n\naffidavit stated that the affiant had heard Hernández-Torres say\n\nthat he \"would clean the house of NPP employees.\"         The court denied\n\nappellants Rule 60(b)(2) relief on the ground that the affidavit\n\nwas \"not newly discovered evidence\" within the meaning of the Rule.\n\nThis appeal, challenging the summary judgment ruling and the denial\n\nof the motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(2), followed.\n\n             We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the record in the light most hospitable to the\n\nparty opposing summary judgment.       See Padilla-García v. Guillermo\n\nRodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 2000).            Summary judgment is\n\nonly appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n          Before     proceeding   to   the   merits,    we   dispose   of   a\n\nthreshold issue that appellants call \"jurisdictional.\"          Appellants\n\ncontend that the district court was without power to reconsider its\n\ninitial denial of summary judgment on the political discrimination\n\nclaim because appellees did not move for reconsideration within ten\n\ndays as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).                The argument is\n\nmeritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Rule 59(e) provides a party with ten days to move to\n\nalter or amend a judgment, and the district court may not enlarge\n\nthe time frame.   See Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).    But     Rule    59(e)      does   not   apply   to   motions   for\n\nreconsideration of interlocutory orders from which no immediate\n\nappeal may be taken, see United States v. Martin, 226 F.3d 1042,\n\n1048 (9th Cir. 2000), including summary judgment denials, see\n\nPacific Union Conf. of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Marshall, 434 U.S.\n\n1305, 1306 (1977) (Rehnquist,          J., in chambers).       Interlocutory\n\norders such as these \"remain open to trial court reconsideration\"\n\nuntil the entry of judgment.           Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d\n\n29, 38 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Pérez v. Crespo-Guillén, 25 F.3d\n\n40, 42 (1st Cir. 1994)). Thus, the district court could reconsider\n\nits initial summary judgment ruling even though appellees did not\n\nseek reconsideration within ten days of the ruling.\n\n          We turn now to appellants' challenge to the correctness\n\nof the summary judgment ruling. When alleging a claim of political\n\ndiscrimination,    a     plaintiff    bears   the   burden     of   producing\n\nsufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that he\n\nengaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the\n\nchallenged employment action.          See Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family\n\nDept., 377 F.3d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 2004).               The plaintiff must\n\nidentify evidence which, if believed, would permit a factfinder to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconclude    that   the   challenged    employment    action   stemmed     from\n\npolitically based animus.      See LaRoue v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d 659, 661\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            The district court ruled that appellants had failed to\n\nidentify evidence which could support a conclusion that Nieves was\n\nfired because of his NPP membership.         Even if we were to credit\n\nappellants'    inadequately    supported    counter-statement       of   facts\n\n(which the district court declined to do), we see no error in this\n\njudgment.\n\n            Appellants argue that there was a material dispute over\n\nwhether the local accounting system was actually duplicative of the\n\nOCAM system and that this dispute warranted a trial on the First\n\nAmendment claim.     In support of this argument, appellants point to\n\na single sentence in the deposition testimony from an OCAM employee\n\nin which she suggested that, at one point, the local system\n\nprovided a printing feature not available through the OCAM system.\n\nShortly after so testifying, however, the employee clarified that\n\nthe OCAM system was later updated to provide the same feature,\n\nmaking   the   systems    duplicative.      This    clarification    refutes\n\nappellants' argument that there was a genuine dispute over whether\n\nthe local accounting system was duplicative of the OCAM system.4\n\n\n     4\n      Appellants also assert that there was a material dispute over\nwhether the Data Processing Director position was initially created\nin violation of municipal personnel law.       We fail to see the\nmateriality of this alleged dispute. Even if we assumed that the\nposition was properly created at its inception, this would not\n\n                                      -7-\n\f               Appellants next contend that two statements in Nieves'\n\naffidavit were sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material\n\nfact     as     to   whether       discriminatory          animus   prompted      Nieves'\n\ntermination.         The first statement identified PDP members whom\n\n(Nieves claims) replaced him as the Director of Data Processing.\n\nAppellees contend that Nieves was not replaced because the position\n\nwas eliminated. The second statement recited an alleged comment by\n\nHernández-Torres           that    he    planned      to   \"clean   the   house   of   NPP\n\nemployees.\"          The     district      court      treated   these     statements    as\n\ninadmissible because there was no indication that they were based\n\non personal knowledge as is required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n               For purposes of summary judgment, an allegation in an\n\naffidavit        must      be     based     on    personal      knowledge     and      show\n\naffirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the\n\nmatters stated therein.                 See López-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, 230\n\nF.3d 409, 414 (1st Cir. 2000).               Nieves' statements do not meet this\n\nrequirement.            If      Nieves    had    been      replaced,    presumably     the\n\nreplacements did not begin work until after Nieves' employment had\n\nended.        Without further foundation, we cannot assume that Nieves\n\nhad personal knowledge of whether he was replaced and, if so, the\n\nidentity and political affiliations of the replacements. See Perez\n\n\nundermine appellees' primary explanation for terminating Nieves,\ni.e., that the Data Processing Director position was duplicative.\nIn any event, appellants have not identified record evidence that\nthe Data Processing Director position was in fact lawfully created\nin 1997.\n\n                                                -8-\n\fv. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 316 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that\n\nan affidavit attesting to facts that took place before the affiant\n\njoined his    employer   are   not   based   on   the    affiant's   personal\n\nknowledge).   Similarly, there are no foundational facts indicating\n\nthat Nieves personally heard Hernández-Torres say that he planned\n\nto \"clean the house of NPP employees.\"5\n\n           Finally, appellants contend that appellees' failure to\n\nstate the reason for Nieves' termination in the dismissal letter\n\nsuggests impermissible motive because it shows that appellees'\n\nstated reasons for the termination were post hoc justifications.\n\nWe fail to see any logic in the inference that appellants would\n\nhave us draw.   No reasonable fact finder could conclude, in these\n\ncircumstances, that the absence of a contemporaneous explanation in\n\nNieves' dismissal letter was proof of discrimination.                 Such a\n\nconclusion would be the product of unsubstantiated speculation\n\nwhich, of course, can never defeat a properly supported summary\n\njudgment motion.6     See, e.g., Poulis-Minott v. Smith, 388 F.3d 354,\n\n366-67 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           In sum, appellants did not identify competent evidence\n\nshowing   political    animus.       Nor   did    they   identify    evidence\n\n\n\n     5\n      At oral argument, appellants' counsel conceded that Nieves\ndid not actually hear Hernández-Torres make this comment.\n     6\n      In any event, Nieves was not entitled to an explanation for\nhis termination because his employment was terminable at will and\nwithout cause.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdisputing appellees' claim that Nieves was terminated because the\n\nDirector of Data Processing position was duplicative.   Appellants\n\ntherefore failed to meet their initial burden of showing that\n\npolitical affiliation was the substantial or motivating cause of\n\nNieves' termination.   The district court correctly entered summary\n\njudgment on the political discrimination claim. See Angulo-Alvarez\n\nv. Aponte de La Torre, 170 F.3d 246, 250 (1st Cir. 1999).7\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      As noted above, appellants also challenge the district\ncourt's Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) ruling that the proffered\naffidavit from Nieves' coworker (stating that she had heard\nHernández-Torres say that he planned to \"clean the house of NPP\nemployees\") was not newly discovered evidence.         Relief from\njudgment under Rule 60(b) is \"extraordinary in nature\" and \"should\nbe granted sparingly.\" See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15,\n19 (1st Cir. 2002). Among other requirements, the moving party\nmust show that the new evidence would likely change the result of\nthe proceeding.    See United States Steel, Co. v. M. DeMatteo\nConstr. Co., 315 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2002). Here, even if the\naffidavit had been considered, it would have made no difference.\nA generalized statement that the mayor intended to \"clean house\" of\nopposition party members would be insufficient to satisfy\nappellants' summary judgment burden.      See Figueroa-Serrano v.\nRamos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

Appellants brought the underlying\n\nlawsuit to assert that this rationale was a sham and that Nieves\n\nwas terminated on account of his NPP membership.\n\n             At the conclusion of discovery, appellees moved for\n\nsummary judgment on Nieves' First Amendment and due process claims.\n\nThe district court granted the motion on the due process claim\n\nbecause appellants had not produced evidence that Nieves had a\n\nproperty interest in his employment.1      The court, however, rejected\n\nappellees' challenge on the political discrimination claim on the\n\nground that there were disputed material facts concerning the true\n\n\n     1\n         This ruling is not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                     -3-\n\freason for the termination.          Specifically, the court stated that\n\nthere    were   disputes      concerning     whether   the    local   system    was\n\nduplicative of the OCAM system, whether Nieves was replaced as the\n\nDirector   of   Data   Processing     by     PDP   members,    and    whether   the\n\nposition was initially created in violation of municipal law.2\n\n            A month after the district court's ruling, appellees\n\nmoved for reconsideration of the denial of their motions for\n\nsummary judgment on the First Amendment claim. On reconsideration,\n\nthe district court determined that appellants' original summary\n\njudgment opposition did not comply with D.P.R. Local R. 311.12\n\nbecause their counter-statement of facts did not contain record\n\ncitations.3     The court also ruled that Nieves' affidavit, which\n\nstated that he had been replaced by PDP members and that Hernández-\n\nTorres   had    said   that    he   wanted    to   \"clean    the   house   of   NPP\n\nemployees,\" was inadmissible because it was not based on personal\n\nknowledge.      As a result, the court granted appellees summary\n\njudgment on the ground that there was no evidence from which a jury\n\ncould conclude that Nieves' termination was at least partially\n\nmotivated by his political affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Because of these disputed facts, the district court also\nrejected Hernández-Torres' claim that he was entitled to summary\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds.\n     3\n      In April 2004, this Rule was recodified as D.P.R. Local R.\n56(c).\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          After the entry of judgment, appellants filed a Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(2) motion seeking relief from judgment because of a\n\nnewly acquired affidavit from one of Nieves' coworkers.                 The\n\naffidavit stated that the affiant had heard Hernández-Torres say\n\nthat he \"would clean the house of NPP employees.\"         The court denied\n\nappellants Rule 60(b)(2) relief on the ground that the affidavit\n\nwas \"not newly discovered evidence\" within the meaning of the Rule.\n\nThis appeal, challenging the summary judgment ruling and the denial\n\nof the motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(2), followed.\n\n             We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the record in the light most hospitable to the\n\nparty opposing summary judgment.       See Padilla-García v. Guillermo\n\nRodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1st Cir. 2000).            Summary judgment is\n\nonly appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n          Before     proceeding   to   the   merits,    we   dispose   of   a\n\nthreshold issue that appellants call \"jurisdictional.\"          Appellants\n\ncontend that the district court was without power to reconsider its\n\ninitial denial of summary judgment on the political discrimination\n\nclaim because appellees did not move for reconsideration within ten\n\ndays as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).                The argument is\n\nmeritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Rule 59(e) provides a party with ten days to move to\n\nalter or amend a judgment, and the district court may not enlarge\n\nthe time frame.

Thus, the district court could reconsider\n\nits initial summary judgment ruling even though appellees did not\n\nseek reconsideration within ten days of the ruling.\n\n          We turn now to appellants' challenge to the correctness\n\nof the summary judgment ruling. When alleging a claim of political\n\ndiscrimination,    a     plaintiff    bears   the   burden     of   producing\n\nsufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that he\n\nengaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the\n\nchallenged employment action.          See Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family\n\nDept., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir. 2004).               The plaintiff must\n\nidentify evidence which, if believed, would permit a factfinder to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconclude    that   the   challenged    employment    action   stemmed     from\n\npolitically based animus.      See LaRoue v. Ridlon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197044\"><a href=\"/opinion/197044/larou-v-ridlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            The district court ruled that appellants had failed to\n\nidentify evidence which could support a conclusion that Nieves was\n\nfired because of his NPP membership.         Even if we were to credit\n\nappellants'    inadequately    supported    counter-statement       of   facts\n\n(which the district court declined to do), we see no error in this\n\njudgment.\n\n            Appellants argue that there was a material dispute over\n\nwhether the local accounting system was actually duplicative of the\n\nOCAM system and that this dispute warranted a trial on the First\n\nAmendment claim.     In support of this argument, appellants point to\n\na single sentence in the deposition testimony from an OCAM employee\n\nin which she suggested that, at one point, the local system\n\nprovided a printing feature not available through the OCAM system.\n\nShortly after so testifying, however, the employee clarified that\n\nthe OCAM system was later updated to provide the same feature,\n\nmaking   the   systems    duplicative.      This    clarification    refutes\n\nappellants' argument that there was a genuine dispute over whether\n\nthe local accounting system was duplicative of the OCAM system.4\n\n\n     4\n      Appellants also assert that there was a material dispute over\nwhether the Data Processing Director position was initially created\nin violation of municipal personnel law.       We fail to see the\nmateriality of this alleged dispute. Even if we assumed that the\nposition was properly created at its inception, this would not\n\n                                      -7-\n\f               Appellants next contend that two statements in Nieves'\n\naffidavit were sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material\n\nfact     as     to   whether       discriminatory          animus   prompted      Nieves'\n\ntermination.         The first statement identified PDP members whom\n\n(Nieves claims) replaced him as the Director of Data Processing.\n\nAppellees contend that Nieves was not replaced because the position\n\nwas eliminated. The second statement recited an alleged comment by\n\nHernández-Torres           that    he    planned      to   \"clean   the   house   of   NPP\n\nemployees.\"          The     district      court      treated   these     statements    as\n\ninadmissible because there was no indication that they were based\n\non personal knowledge as is required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n               For purposes of summary judgment, an allegation in an\n\naffidavit        must      be     based     on    personal      knowledge     and      show\n\naffirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the\n\nmatters stated therein.                 See López-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199133\"><a href=\"/opinion/199133/lopez-carrasquillo-v-rubianes/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 (1st Cir. 2000).               Nieves' statements do not meet this\n\nrequirement.            If      Nieves    had    been      replaced,    presumably     the\n\nreplacements did not begin work until after Nieves' employment had\n\nended.        Without further foundation, we cannot assume that Nieves\n\nhad personal knowledge of whether he was replaced and, if so, the\n\nidentity and political affiliations of the replacements. See Perez\n\n\nundermine appellees' primary explanation for terminating Nieves,\ni.e., that the Data Processing Director position was duplicative.\nIn any event, appellants have not identified record evidence that\nthe Data Processing Director position was in fact lawfully created\nin 1997.\n\n                                                -8-\n\fv.

Similarly, there are no foundational facts indicating\n\nthat Nieves personally heard Hernández-Torres say that he planned\n\nto \"clean the house of NPP employees.\"5\n\n           Finally, appellants contend that appellees' failure to\n\nstate the reason for Nieves' termination in the dismissal letter\n\nsuggests impermissible motive because it shows that appellees'\n\nstated reasons for the termination were post hoc justifications.\n\nWe fail to see any logic in the inference that appellants would\n\nhave us draw.   No reasonable fact finder could conclude, in these\n\ncircumstances, that the absence of a contemporaneous explanation in\n\nNieves' dismissal letter was proof of discrimination.                 Such a\n\nconclusion would be the product of unsubstantiated speculation\n\nwhich, of course, can never defeat a properly supported summary\n\njudgment motion.6     See, e.g., Poulis-Minott v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201308\"><a href=\"/opinion/201308/poulis-minott-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n366-67 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           In sum, appellants did not identify competent evidence\n\nshowing   political    animus.       Nor   did    they   identify    evidence\n\n\n\n     5\n      At oral argument, appellants' counsel conceded that Nieves\ndid not actually hear Hernández-Torres make this comment.\n     6\n      In any event, Nieves was not entitled to an explanation for\nhis termination because his employment was terminable at will and\nwithout cause.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdisputing appellees' claim that Nieves was terminated because the\n\nDirector of Data Processing position was duplicative.   Appellants\n\ntherefore failed to meet their initial burden of showing that\n\npolitical affiliation was the substantial or motivating cause of\n\nNieves' termination.   The district court correctly entered summary\n\njudgment on the political discrimination claim. See Angulo-Alvarez\n\nv.

R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) ruling that the proffered\naffidavit from Nieves' coworker (stating that she had heard\nHernández-Torres say that he planned to \"clean the house of NPP\nemployees\") was not newly discovered evidence.         Relief from\njudgment under Rule 60(b) is \"extraordinary in nature\" and \"should\nbe granted sparingly.\" See Karak v.
