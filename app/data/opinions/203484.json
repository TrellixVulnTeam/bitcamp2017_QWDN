William C. Hillman, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David M. Rosen, Harmon Law Offices, P.C., and Walter Oney on\nresponse to order to show cause and petition for leave to appeal.\n\n\n\n                          September 17, 2008\n\f            Per    Curiam.            This   is    an   attempted    appeal   from   a\n\nbankruptcy court decision under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2), added by\n\nsection   1233(a)(2)(B)          of    the   Bankruptcy     Abuse    Prevention   and\n\nConsumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\"), Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119\n\nStat. 23, 202-03. That statute permits direct appeals to the court\n\nof appeals, with that court's permission, from bankruptcy court\n\ndecisions       under    certain        circumstances,      including    where    the\n\nbankruptcy court certifies that the appeal satisfies the statutory\n\ncriteria for permitting such a direct appeal.                         See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 158(d)(2)(A).         This is the first such attempted appeal to this\n\ncourt.\n\n            After the bankruptcy court transmitted its certification\n\nof the appeal to this court, we issued an order to show cause why\n\nthe appeal should not be dismissed because (1) no timely notice of\n\nappeal    was     filed,    as        required     by   Interim     Bankruptcy    Rule\n\n8001(f)(1), adopted by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts by Standing Order dated October 11, 2005, and (2) no\n\nauthorization of the direct appeal was sought or obtained from this\n\ncourt, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2)(A).                   In their response\n\nto that order, the defendants conceded that no notice of appeal had\n\nbeen filed in the bankruptcy court1 and that no petition for\n\n\n     1\n      The defendants ask that the bankruptcy court's certification\nbe deemed the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal.\nHowever, because certification of a direct appeal under section\n158(d)(2) does not become effective until a timely appeal has been\ntaken to the bankruptcy appellate panel under sections 158(b) and\n\n                                             -2-\n\fauthorization to appeal had been filed in this court but asked that\n\nthe direct appeal be authorized despite those procedural missteps.\n\n               The answer to the question posed in the show-cause order\n\ndepends      in    the     first   instance           on    whether        the    procedural\n\nrequirements        referenced       in        that    order       are     deemed       to    be\n\njurisdictional or, rather, mere claims-processing rules.                                     See\n\nBowles v. Russell, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 2364-66 (2007).                          Under Bowles,\n\nthat determination depends, in turn, on whether the requirements\n\nare     based      on    statutes,        in     which      case     they        are     deemed\n\njurisdictional, or merely on court-promulgated rules, in which case\n\nthey are not.        Id.     That question has not yet been decided by this\n\nor any other court of appeals, and the answer is not free from\n\ndoubt.\n\n               Without     resolving       that       jurisdictional question, we\n\nexercise our discretion under section 158(d)(2)(A) to deny leave to\n\nappeal. The existence of this serious jurisdictional question, and\n\nthe substantial possibility that jurisdiction would ultimately be\n\nfound lacking, means that allowing the appeal to proceed may not\n\nserve    the      purposes    of   section       158(d)(2),        i.e.,     a    rapid      and\n\ndefinitive resolution of the underlying legal question by this\n\ncourt.    See Weber v. United States Trustee, 484 F.3d 154, 158, 159\n\n(2d   Cir.      2007)    (citing   legislative             history    to    that       effect).\n\n\n\n(c), BAPCPA, § 1233(b)(4)(A); Interim Bankr. R. 8001(f), the\ncertification itself cannot serve as a notice of appeal.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fRather, if, as the bankruptcy court found in certifying this\n\nappeal, there are hundreds of cases pending in the Bankruptcy Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts raising the same issue certified\n\nhere, it would be preferable to resolve that issue in a case not\n\nraising the potentially fatal procedural problems presented here.\n\n            To     avoid   such    problems      in    future     cases,    litigants,\n\nbankruptcy       courts,   and    bankruptcy         appellate    panels    should   be\n\ncareful to follow the procedures set forth in section 158 itself\n\nand in the applicable rules.                  Those rules appear in uncodified\n\nsection 1233(b) of the BAPCPA, Interim Bankruptcy Rule 8001(f)\n\n(adopted    by    standing   order       by    all    bankruptcy    courts    in   this\n\ncircuit),    and    Proposed      Rule    8001(f)      of   the   Federal    Rules   of\n\nBankruptcy Procedure, which will become effective on December                        1,\n\n2008, barring any contrary action by Congress in the meantime.\n\n            The petition is denied, and the appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
