In   June   2002,    four   years   after   his\n\nconviction, the appellant, Josue G. Reyes-Hernandez, filed a motion\n\nin the district court, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)1, seeking\n\nthe return of $1055 that was found in his possession when he was\n\narrested in 1997.      Reyes-Hernandez asserted that the criminal\n\nproceedings against him had concluded, that he was entitled to\n\nlawful possession of the money, and that he had no reason to\n\nbelieve that the government had instituted forfeiture proceedings\n\nwith respect to the $1055. Although served by Reyes-Hernandez, the\n\ngovernment did not respond to the Rule 41(e) motion.         Nonetheless,\n\nsix weeks later, the district court summarily denied it.           Reyes-\n\nHernandez has appealed.\n\n          On appeal, the government has informed this court that it\n\nhas no objection to the return of the $1055 to Reyes-Hernandez.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court's order denying the Rule\n\n41(e) motion and remand for entry of an order granting the Rule\n\n41(e) motion.    Where no forfeiture proceeding with respect to the\n\n$1055 has been instituted, nor is any such proceeding intended to\n\nbe instituted, the government does not convincingly argue that the\n\ndistrict court    lacked   jurisdiction   to    grant   Reyes-Hernandez's\n\nrequested relief.     Similarly unconvincing is the government's\n\n\n     1\n      Effective December 1, 2002, Rule 41 was amended and\nreorganized. What was formerly Rule 41(e) is now found at Rule\n41(g) with minor stylistic changes. We refer to the formulation,\ni.e., Rule 41(e), effective at the time of Reyes-Hernandez's June\n2002 filing.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsuggestion that Reyes-Hernandez should be required to file a\n\nseparate civil action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
