After trial, defendant's counsel failed to file a\n\nnotice of appeal.   Defendant, acting pro se, filed  a series\n                                            \n\nof motions  in the district court  collaterally attacking the\n\nverdict:    a motion  for a  new  trial based  on ineffective\n\nassistance  of counsel;  a motion  for a  new trial  based on\n\nnewly-discovered evidence;  a   2255 petition  to vacate, set\n\naside  or correct sentence; and a motion for return of seized\n\nproperty.  The district court denied all of defendant's post-\n\ntrial  motions, and appeals  from the  denial of  each motion\n\nwere  properly filed.   We  consolidated all the  appeals and\n\nfound  that no  relief was  warranted on  any of  the motions\n\nexcept for the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for\n\nfailure to file a notice  of appeal.  We remanded that  issue\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\nfor determination by  the district court.   United States  v.\n                                                         \n\nTajeddini, 945 F.2d  458, 470 (1st Cir. 1991),  cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n112 S. Ct. 3009 (1992).   After a hearing, the district court\n\nfound that because defendant  had dismissed his counsel prior\n\nto  the expiration  of the  appeal period  there could  be no\n\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  The  court went\n\non  to hold, however, that  defendant while proceeding pro se\n                                                             \n\nhad  inadvertently  failed  to   file  a  timely  appeal  and\n\nreinstated defendant's  right to appeal.   It is  this appeal\n\nthat we now consider.\n\n          There   are  three  issues  before  us  on  appeal:\n\n(1) whether  the prosecutor's  closing  argument was  proper;\n\n(2) whether the  district court erred in  denying defendant's\n\nmotion for a  continuance prior  to the start  of trial;  and\n\n(3) whether  the  district  court  erred  in  admitting  into\n\nevidence a statement by defendant.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          The Facts\n                                   \n\n          We  begin  by  recounting  the  salient   facts  as\n\ndisclosed at  trial and  in a pre-trial  suppression hearing.\n\nDefendant,  his  wife, and  their  two  children, arrived  in\n\nBoston on  October 20, 1988,  after a flight  from Frankfurt,\n\nGermany.  Because  he was a  foreign national, defendant  was\n\nfirst  processed  by Immigration.    His  wife and  children,\n\nAmerican citizens, proceeded  directly to Customs inspection.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nAfter going through  Immigration, defendant  went to  Customs\n\nwhere he was interviewed by Inspector Cheryl B. Gaffney.\n\n          Inspector  Gaffney  asked  defendant  the  standard\n\nCustoms questions:   where he had been  on the trip, where he\n\nlived, how long  he was gone, and  the purpose of  his visit.\n\nIn response,  defendant stated that  he had not  travelled to\n\nIran at any time during  his trip and that he had not been to\n\nIran  in six  or seven  years.   He also  stated that  he was\n\ntravelling alone  and  gave Gaffney  his Customs  Declaration\n\nwhich  indicated  that he  was travelling  alone.   After the\n\ninterview,  defendant  was taken  by  Gaffney and  Inspectors\n\nMcGrath and Bird to another  room for further questioning and\n\na possible search.\n\n          Defendant's wife,  Lori Ann McBride, and  their two\n\nchildren, went  to a  different Customs line  than defendant.\n\nShe was interviewed  by Inspector Pacewicz  to whom she  gave\n\nher  Customs Declaration and  her passport  and those  of her\n\nchildren.   Following  routine  procedures for  international\n\ntravelers,    Pacewicz    made    a   Treasury    Enforcement\n\nCommunications System  check on  McBride to determine  if she\n\nwas  a  fugitive  or  was being  sought  by  law  enforcement\n\nofficials.  The  check showed that  there was an  outstanding\n\nwarrant  for McBride's  arrest  in California  on a  parental\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nkidnapping  charge.1    Defendant  knew  of  the  outstanding\n\nwarrant against his wife.\n\n          After Inspector Pacewicz learned of the warrant, he\n\nasked  McBride and the children to go to a nearby examination\n\ntable.    At  about  the  same  time,  defendant  passed  the\n\nexamination table  under escort  of Inspectors  Gaffney, Bird\n\nand  McGrath.   According to  Pacewicz, McBride  became \"very\n\nnervous\" on seeing defendant.  This prompted Pacewicz to take\n\nher  to a search  room other than the  one to which defendant\n\nwas being escorted.  Almost immediately on entering the room,\n\nMcBride removed five packages from her coat and threw them on\n\nthe table,  saying, \"I don't  know what this is.   My husband\n\nmade me carry them, but I know it was something bad.\"   After\n\nthe    packages  had  been thrown  on  the  table,  Inspector\n\nPacewicz found that the contents tested positive for heroin.\n\n          Sometime later, Special Agent Joseph Desmond of the\n\nDrug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") came to the Customs area.  He\n\ntalked to Inspector Pacewicz  and then talked to McBride  for\n\nabout  fifteen  minutes.    Desmond then  went  to  interview\n\ndefendant.  Before questioning defendant, Desmond advised him\n\nof  his Miranda  rights.   Defendant said  he understood  his\n               \n\nrights, but did not understand why  he or his wife were being\n\n                    \n\n1.  The oldest child of defendant and McBride had been placed\nin  the  custody  of  the  California  Department  of  Social\nServices by the San Diego County, California, Juvenile Court.\nThe arrest warrant was issued after McBride took the child in\nviolation of the custody order. \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nheld.  Desmond then  ended his discussion with  defendant and\n\nbegan  processing McBride and  making arrangements  for their\n\ntwo children.\n\n          While   so  occupied,  Desmond  was  informed  that\n\ndefendant  wanted to see him.  Desmond and defendant then had\n\nan  extended conversation.   Defendant  told Desmond  that he\n\nobtained  the  \"opium\"  in  Germany  from  an  Iranian  named\n\nMohammed Ali  Karabolout.   He said  that he  was to be  paid\n\n$3,000 if he delivered the opium to one  Parviz Parvin in San\n\nFrancisco. Defendant  told Desmond  that Parvin was  a \"large\n\nheroin dealer.\"2\n\n          Desmond talked to defendant again after his arrest.\n\nDefendant repeated what  he had told  him before about  where\n\nand from whom he had obtained the \"opium\" and how much he was\n\nto be paid  for delivering  it.  Desmond  and defendant  then\n\ndiscussed  carrying out a  controlled delivery whereby Parvin\n\nwould be arrested after defendant  made the delivery.   After\n\nconsidering the plan in  detail and after consulting with  an\n\nattorney,  defendant  told Desmond  that he  did not  want to\n\nparticipate in the controlled delivery to Parvin.\n\n                    \n\n2.  On direct  examination at trial, the  defendant testified\nthat he had been temporarily in Iran.  When he and his family\nleft Iran, a friend,  George Shalmarez, who had lived  in the\nUnited  States, drove them from Iran to Turkey.  George asked\ndefendant to  deliver  packages of  \"cancer medicine\"  called\n\"shireb\"  to a sick friend, Parviz  Parvin, in San Francisco.\nGeorge also told him  that Parvin ran a limousine  service in\nSan Francisco and might give him a job as a driver.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          The  district  court held  a  pre-trial suppression\n\nhearing on both McBride's and defendant's motions to suppress\n\ntheir  oral  and  written  statements  and  certain  physical\n\nevidence.   The motions were denied as to defendant, but were\n\npartially granted as to McBride.   After McBride pled guilty,\n\nthe  prosecutor moved  to  admit  certain evidence  including\n\nMcBride's  statement  made when  she  threw  the packages  of\n\ncontraband onto  the table  in the Customs  examination room.\n\nThe  court  suppressed McBride's  statement  and  it was  not\n\nmentioned at  trial although the  Customs inspector described\n\nher actions.\n\n                             III.\n\n                           Analysis\n                                   \n\n          Defendant raises three issues  on appeal.  He first\n\nchallenges parts of the  prosecutor's closing argument on the\n\nfollowing grounds: (1) an impermissible reference to excluded\n\nevidence; (2)  argument of matters based  on the prosecutor's\n\npersonal belief and  opinion and knowledge of  matters not in\n\nevidence; (3) an attempt to inflame passions or  prejudice of\n\nthe jury; and (4) a misrepresentation of defendant's finances\n\nto  suggest a motive for  the crime.   In addition, defendant\n\nappeals  the district  court's  denial of  his  motion for  a\n\ncontinuance, and  the court's  decision to admit  evidence at\n\ntrial which was  not disclosed to defendant until  three days\n\nbefore trial.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nA.  Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n                                 \n\n          Because defendant failed to  object at trial to the\n\nprosecutor's statements  made in closing  argument, we review\n\ndefendant's claims on appeal  under the plain error standard.\n\nUnited States v. Young,  470 U.S. 1, 6, 14-15  (1985); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1154 (1st. Cir.),\n                           \n\ncert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 54 (1991); Fed. R. Crim. P.  52(b)3.\n            \n\nThe plain error exception is  to be used \"`sparingly,  solely\n\nin  circumstances in  which  a miscarriage  of justice  would\n\notherwise result.'\"   Young, 470 U.S.  at 15 (quoting  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Frady, 456  U.S. at  163 n.14).   We  consider the\n                \n\nprosecutor's statements  in the context of  the entire trial.\n\nUnited States  v. Morales-Cartagena,  987 F.2d 849,  854 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir.  1993); United States v.  Smith, 982 F.2d  681, 682 (1st\n                                    \n\nCir.  1993);   Rodriguez-Cardona,  924 F.2d  at 1154.   Three\n                                \n\nsignificant factors guide our evaluation of whether the trial\n\nwas so tainted by prosecutorial misconduct in  argument as to\n\nconstitute  plain  error:     \"(1) whether  the  prosecutor's\n\nconduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the trial\n\ncourt gave a strong  and explicit cautionary instruction; and\n\n(3) whether  it is  likely that  any prejudice  surviving the\n\njudge's instruction  could have  affected the outcome  of the\n\n                    \n\n3.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) provides as follows:\n          Plain  Error.   Plain  errors  or defects\n          affecting   substantial  rights   may  be\n          noticed although they were not brought to\n          the attention of the court.\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\ncase.\"  United  States v.  Hodge-Balwing, 952  F.2d 607,  610\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1991); see also Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d at 954.\n                                           \n\nWith these  tenets in  mind, we  address each  of defendant's\n\nallegations  of misstatement  by the prosecutor  to determine\n\nwhether there  was error,  and then  we assess  the aggregate\n\neffect on the trial as a whole. \n\n     1.  Alleged Reliance on Evidence Excluded From Trial\n                                                         \n\n          Defendant  claims  that  the  prosecutor's  closing\n\nargument relied on evidence  that had been excluded from  the\n\ntrial  as  hearsay.    Before  trial,  the  court  suppressed\n\nMcBride's statement, made  during the Customs  examination as\n\nshe emptied packages  from her  coat onto a  table, \"I  don't\n\nknow what this is.  My husband made me carry them, but I know\n\nit  was something bad.\"   The court found  that the statement\n\nwas  inadmissible  hearsay because  McBride was  available to\n\ntestify, and her  knowledge of the  contents of the  packages\n\nwas being offered to establish defendant's knowledge  through\n\na  statement which  was not  in furtherance of  their alleged\n\nconspiracy. \n\n          At trial,  Customs Inspector  Pacewicz, who  was in\n\nthe search room with  McBride, recounted McBride's actions of\n\nremoving  the packages from her coat, and did not mention her\n\npreviously excluded  statement.  Defendant did  not object to\n\nthis  testimony   and  does  not  now   claim  that  allowing\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nPacewicz's testimony was  error.4   Defendant's complaint  is\n\nwith  the way  the prosecutor  used  the evidence  in closing\n\nargument.   During closing argument, the  prosecutor made the\n\nfollowing references to Inspector Pacewicz's testimony:\n\n             At that time  Inspector Pacewicz  took\n          Lori  Ann  McBride  to another  secondary\n          search room.  As soon as Lori Ann McBride\n          entered  the  secondary  search room  she\n          dumped packages out of her coat. \n\n             I  leave  it to  you, for  example, to\n          decide what, if anything,  that indicates\n          about  what Lori  Ann McBride  might have\n          thought was in those packages.\n\nLater in his argument the prosecutor stated:\n\n             You  heard how  Lori Ann  McBride then\n          pulled the stuff out  of her pockets  and\n          dumped it on the table.   Obviously, very\n          nervous, very agitated.\n\n             The   Customs   Declaration   of   the\n          defendant  says  he is  travelling alone.\n          Was there some understanding between Lori\n          Ann  McBride  and  the  defendant?    The\n          evidence, I suggest,  shows clearly  that\n          there was.\n\n          We note first that  defendant's allegation that the\n\nprosecutor used suppressed  evidence in  closing argument  is\n\nwrong.   The prosecution fully  adhered to the  court's order\n\n                    \n\n4.  Defendant may be arguing, by implication, that  Inspector\nPacewicz's testimony about McBride's actions was inadmissible\nhearsay  evidence of  expressive conduct.   Because defendant\nhas  not directly raised this as an  issue on appeal, we deem\nit waived.   United States  v. Zannino,  895 F.2d 1,  17 (1st\n                                      \nCir.)  (\"It  is  not  enough  merely to  mention  a  possible\nargument  in the most skeletal  way, leaving the  court to do\ncounsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put\nflesh on its bones.\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082 (1990).\n                                   \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nexcluding  McBride's statement.    The  prosecutor's  closing\n\nargument  recounted  McBride's  actions,  not  her suppressed\n\nstatement.  Inspector Pacewicz  also testified to her actions\n\nand not her statement.  \n\n          Defendant alternatively argues that by referring to\n\nMcBride's  actions and  asking  the jury  to draw  inferences\n\nbased on her actions, the prosecutor was attempting to convey\n\nthe message, expressed by McBride's  excluded statement, that\n\ndefendant knew  that the packages contained  contraband.  The\n\nprosecutor's  reference  to   McBride's  actions,   defendant\n\nargues,  should have been  excluded for the  same reason that\n\nthe court excluded her statement.  \n\n          The prosecutor's  argument was not evidence  in the\n\ntrial, as  the district  court properly instructed  the jury.\n\nArgument necessarily presents a partisan view of the evidence\n\nadmitted  at  trial.     Although  the  prosecution  may  not\n\ninterject personal credibility or opinion into argument,  the\n\nprosecutor is entitled, in  closing, to ask the jury  to draw\n\nwarrantable  inferences from  the  evidence  admitted  during\n\ntrial.   Young, 470  U.S. at 7;  United States  v. Mount, 896\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n          The prosecutor asked the jury to consider \"what, if\n\nanything\" McBride's actions indicated about what  she thought\n\nwas in  the packages  which  she threw  on  the table.    The\n\nprosecutor  later  suggested   that  McBride's  actions   and\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nnervousness and defendant's  Customs Declaration that he  was\n\ntravelling  alone indicated an  understanding between McBride\n\nand  defendant.    The  evidence at  trial  established  that\n\nMcBride  threw the  packages  on  the  table in  the  Customs\n\nexamination  room, that  she was  nervous during  the Customs\n\nexamination,  and that  defendant  claimed  to be  travelling\n\nalone.   Therefore,  the prosecutor  asked the  jury  to draw\n\nwarrantable inferences based upon the evidence at  trial.  We\n\nfind  nothing  improper  in  the  prosecutor's  reference  to\n\nMcBride's actions in closing  argument, and therefore we find\n\nno error. \n\n     2.  Argument of Matters Not in Evidence and Personal\n                                                         \n         Opinion\n                \n\n          Next,   defendant   asserts   impropriety  in   the\n\nprosecutor's  reference  to defendant's  decision  not to  go\n\nahead with the controlled delivery in which he had originally\n\nagreed to  participate.5  At trial,  defendant testified that\n\nhis decision not to  cooperate was motivated by his  fear for\n\nthe safety  of his  wife and  family.   On cross-examination,\n\ndefendant  admitted stating to DEA Agent  Desmond in a letter\n\nthat Parvin was \"the Al Capone of San Francisco\" and  that he\n\nknew Parvin  \"to be  the key  of the  whole  drug supply  for\n\n                    \n\n5.  When  asked  by  DEA  Agent Desmond  to  cooperate  in  a\ncontrolled delivery  of  the packages  containing  heroin  to\nParvin,  the  intended recipient  of  the  \"medicine\" in  San\nFrancisco, defendant initially agreed to participate and then\nchanged his mind.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nCalifornia.\"    The  defendant  continued   to  maintain  his\n\ninnocence, however,  claiming  that he  thought the  packages\n\ncontained cancer  medicine for  Parvin, not  heroin.   In his\n\nclosing, the prosecutor made the following remarks:\n\n             Why,  ladies  and gentlemen,  would he\n          not do it,  [the controlled delivery]  if\n          he was confident that at the other end of\n          the  road there  was someone  waiting for\n          cancer medicine  and not  heroin?   If in\n          fact,  someone  was  waiting   there  for\n          cancer and medicine, he could have proved\n          his innocence and surely he knows that in\n          that  instance  he  would not  have  been\n          prosecuted. \n\n          In his  rebuttal, the  prosecutor responded  to the\n\ndefendant's closing thus:\n\n             Mr. Boudreau [the defense lawyer] just\n          said that  I said in my  closing argument\n          that  the  defendant   would  have   been\n          prosecuted  anyway,  even if  he effected\n          the controlled delivery.  That was not my\n          point.    My   point  was  that  if   the\n          defendant is telling the truth,  that the\n          person at  the  other end  of  the  line,\n          Parvis Parvin, was waiting  for medicine,\n          he could  have  proved his  innocence  by\n          effecting the delivery.\n\n             The defendant said he initially agreed\n          to do  it because he wanted  to show that\n          the person  at the other end  of the line\n          was waiting for medicine and  not heroin.\n          Clearly,  the  defendant  could not  have\n          thought that if  he effected the delivery\n          and  the person was, in fact, waiting for\n          medicine and was  sick with cancer,  that\n          he would have been prosecuted. \n\n             I think that,  clearly, he would  not,\n          or  clearly   he  would  not   have  been\n          prosecuted if he had proved his innocence\n          in that manner.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          Although he did not  object at trial, defendant now\n\nopposes the prosecutor's  statements on two bases:   that the\n\nstatements  refer to  matters not  in evidence  and that  the\n\nstatements assert the personal beliefs of the prosecutor.  It\n\nis improper for  a prosecutor, in argument, to refer to or to\n\nseem to rely on matters not  in evidence.  Smith, 982 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n683.  It is also improper for a prosecutor to  insert his own\n\ncredibility or opinions into argument.  Id.;  Mount, 896 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  625.   Defendant contends  that the  prosecutor's remarks\n\nimpermissibly suggested that he knew something not introduced\n\nat trial which determined whether or not defendant would have\n\nbeen  prosecuted and  also interjected  his  personal opinion\n\nabout defendant's actions.  \n\n          The prosecutor may have overstepped  the boundaries\n\nof  permissible argument  by offering  his opinion,  \"I think\n\nthat, clearly he would not, or clearly he would not have been\n\nprosecuted  if he had proved his innocence in that manner.\"6 \n\nIf so, the transgression  does not constitute plain error  in\n\nthe context of the trial as a whole.  The  prosecutor did not\n\nroutinely insert  his personal opinion into  the argument nor\n\ndo  we find  that his  remark was  deliberate.   Although the\n\ncourt  did not  give a cautionary  instruction, we  find that\n\n                    \n\n6.  The prosecutor,  apparently, was  attempting to make  the\npoint that  defendant refused to cooperate  in the controlled\ndelivery to Parvin because he knew that the  circumstances of\nthe delivery would not  clear him of the crimes  charged and,\ntherefore, he would be prosecuted anyway.    \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nlittle,  if  any,  prejudice  resulted.    The  prosecution's\n\nargument about the implications  of defendant's choice not to\n\nparticipate in the controlled delivery was merely  cumulative\n\nof other evidence including defendant's confessions, admitted\n\nat  trial and  argued  in closing,  which showed  defendant's\n\nknowledge that  the packages contained heroin  and not cancer\n\nmedicine.    Therefore,  the   remark  was  not  so  severely\n\nprejudicial as to undermine defendant's substantial rights or\n\nthe fairness of the trial as a whole.      \n\n          Defendant   also   claims  that   the  prosecutor's\n\nargument as quoted above  impermissibly shifted the burden to\n\ndefendant to prove his innocence.  We do not agree.  Further,\n\nthe court  gave a  sufficient  charge on  the presumption  of\n\ninnocence to  dispel any  improper suggestion which  the jury\n\nmight have taken from the argument.7  \n\n     3.  Inflammatory Remarks\n                             \n\n                    \n\n7.  On the government's burden of proof, the court instructed\nas follows:\n             The  law presumes  a  defendant to  be\n          innocent  of a  crime.   Thus, defendant,\n          although accused, begins the trial with a\n          clean  slate,  with  no evidence  against\n          him,  and  the  law  permits  nothing but\n          legal evidence presented before  the jury\n          to be considered in support of any charge\n          against   the   defendant.       So   the\n          presumption   of   innocence   alone   is\n          sufficient to acquit  a defendant  unless\n          the   jurors   are  satisfied   beyond  a\n          reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt\n          after    a    careful    and    impartial\n          consideration of all the evidence  in the\n          case.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Defense  counsel argued in closing that defendant's\n\nfailure to hide the packages of contraband in suitcases or in\n\nhidden compartments indicated his innocence.  The  prosecutor\n\nanswered in rebuttal as follows:\n\n             Finally,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  Mr.\n          Boudreau suggests that the  defendant, if\n          he knew he was  smuggling in heroin would\n          have  found a  secret compartment  in the\n          luggage to  carry the heroin.   I suggest\n          that  the  defendant  did find  a  secret\n          compartment.      He   found   a   secret\n          compartment in his  American wife who  he\n          thought would not be searched because she\n          was  an  American  wife  with  two  small\n          children,   and   that   is  the   secret\n          compartment that he  found and  attempted\n          unsuccessfully to use.\n\nDefendant  now  argues  that the  prosecutor's  references to\n\ndefendant's American wife were intended to inflame the jury's\n                    \n\npassions  and prejudices  against defendant  who is  Iranian.\n\nThere is no doubt  that argument which is intended  to appeal\n\nto emotions rather than to reason is improper.  United States\n                                                             \n\nv. Moreno, No.  92-2018, slip op. at  10-11 (1st Cir. May  6,\n         \n\n1993);  United States v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565, 574 (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1991), cert. denied, 113  S. Ct. 58 (1992); United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nGiry, 818 F.2d 120, 132-33 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n855  (1987).  That is  not the case  here, however.  Although\n\nthe prosecutor's remarks,  taken in isolation, might  suggest\n\nan  appeal to the passions of  the jury, when his remarks are\n\ntaken  in context, any such tactic  vanishes.  The prosecutor\n\nwas countering the defense by arguing that defendant may have\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nassumed that his American  wife would have an  easier passage\n\nthrough  Customs than he  would, and used  that advantage for\n\nsmuggling the  packages of heroin.   Further, the  court gave\n\nthe following cautionary instruction:\n\n             The  fact that  the defendant  in this\n          case  is  not  a  citizen  of the  United\n          States and is by  birth an Iranian should\n          not prejudice you for or against him, but\n          he  should  be  treated  like  any  other\n          defendant,  and  your verdicts  should be\n          based  on  the  evidence  that  has  been\n          introduced before you in this case.\n\nReading the prosecutor's  remarks in context and  in light of\n\nthe defense's closing argument, we find no impropriety in the\n\nstatement.   If  any  prejudice was  communicated, the  court\n\ncautioned  the jury not  to allow  bias about  nationality to\n\ninfluence its decision.   \n\n     4.  Financial Motive for the Crime\n                                       \n\n          In  response to  defendant's claim  that he  had no\n\nmotive  to   commit  the  crime  of   importing  heroin,  the\n\nprosecution argued  that defendant, and his  family, had only\n\n$700 when they  entered the  United States.   The amount  was\n\nbased upon the combined Customs Declarations of defendant and\n\nMcBride.  Defendant admitted that he had been promised $3,000\n\nif  he delivered the  contraband to Parvin.   The prosecution\n\nargued that the promised  payment provided a financial motive\n\nfor defendant to  import the heroin.   Defendant now  asserts\n\nthat he had  $1,456 in  traveller's checks with  him when  he\n\nentered the United States which the government seized when he\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwas arrested. The government notes that after reviewing their\n\nfiles they agree  with defendant.  Defendant argues  that the\n\nprosecution's imputed financial motive was improper given the\n\ntraveller's checks.   Defendant failed to  raise the argument\n\nat trial and failed to  mention the traveller's checks during\n\nhis  testimony at  trial.   There is  no suggestion  that the\n\nprosecution deliberately misrepresented defendant's financial\n\ncondition.  Further,  $3,000 remains  a financial  incentive,\n\nalthough  perhaps of somewhat  less significance.  Therefore,\n\nwe find  the prosecution's  argument of financial  motive was\n\nproper under these circumstances.\n\n     5.  No Plain Error\n                       \n\n          We  have  found   that  the  prosecutor's   closing\n\nargument was, for  the most part, proper.  In  the context of\n\nthe  entire trial, we find  that the aggregate  impact of any\n\nimpropriety was minimal  and did not  cause a miscarriage  of\n\njustice.  Therefore, the trial was not marred by plain error.\n\nB.  Denial of Motion for Continuance\n                                    \n\n          The defendant  appeals the district  court's denial\n\nof  his  motion for  continuance to  allow  time in  which to\n\nobtain  additional  corroborative  evidence.    We previously\n\nconsidered this  issue in  defendant's appeal from  denial of\n\nhis  28  U.S.C.    2255 petition.    At that  time, defendant\n\nclaimed ineffective  assistance of  counsel due, in  part, to\n\nhis  counsel's   failure  to  timely  file   the  motion  for\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\ncontinuance.    After trial  and  before the     2255 appeal,\n\ndefendant obtained from  Iran a police report of  a statement\n\nby Ali Karabolout, one of  the people involved with defendant\n\nin  Iran,  which defendant  had  hoped to  present  at trial.\n\nDefendant  submitted the  police report  to this  court.   We\n\nreviewed   the  substance   of  Karabolout's   statement  and\n\nconcluded that it  was hearsay.   We found that  Karabolout's\n\nstatement was  not against significant penal  interest, as it\n\nwas  more exculpatory  than inculpatory,  and that  it lacked\n\nsufficient  other  indicia  of  reliability  to  obligate the\n\ndistrict court to find  that it fell within any  exception to\n\nthe  hearsay rule.  We concluded that the documents from Iran\n\nwere not  admissible in evidence and,  therefore, late filing\n\nof the  motion for  continuance did not  prejudice defendant.\n\nTajeddini, 945 F.2d at 463-65.  \n         \n\n          Defendant  now  requests  that  we  reconsider  our\n\ndecision on  the ground that we  previously misunderstood the\n\neffect of Iranian law  on Karabolout which would result  from\n\nhis statement to Iranian police.  We decline to do  so.  This\n\nappeal is, of course,  not an appropriate method to  move for\n\nreconsideration of our  previous decision.  See  Fed. R. App.\n                                               \n\nP. 40.8   Further, when a  legal issue has been  presented to\n\n                    \n\n8.  After our decision and the  mandate to the district court\nwas  issued,  the  defendant  filed  several   petitions  for\nextensions  of  time to  file a  motion  for rehearing  and a\nrequest  for recall of  mandate.  His  petitions and requests\nwere denied because  he failed to  demonstrate any errors  in\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nand  decided by this court,  our decision becomes  the law of\n\nthe  case in all  subsequent proceedings on  the same matter.\n\nUnited States  v.

Defendant  makes  no   argument  that  substantially\n\ndifferent  evidence  on  this  issue  was  presented  at  the\n\n                    \n\nour opinion.        \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\ndistrict  court  hearing  prior   to  this  appeal,  or  that\n\ncontrolling  authority has changed  since our  prior opinion.\n\nWe are unconvinced by  defendant's argument that Iranian law,\n\nas  offered  by    defendant,9  requires  us  to  change  our\n\ndecision on  this issue.

The letter  expresses an opinion,  based on a\nletter  from defendant's  attorney, that  the proceedings  in\nIran  against Karabolout were only temporarily suspended, and\nthat Karabolout may be exposed to criminal or civil penalties\nbased  on his statement to  the Iranian police.   Although we\nare not bound by  the rules of evidence in  considering proof\nof foreign  law, the defendant's submission  is inadequate to\ninform this court  of Iranian law allegedly relevant  to this\nmatter. \n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          Rule 16(a)(1), in the version in effect at the time\n\nof defendant's  trial,  required the  government to  disclose\n\ncertain evidence prior to trial:\n\n             Upon  request  of   a  defendant   the\n          government shall permit the  defendant to\n          inspect  and  copy  or  photograph:   any\n          relevant  written or  recorded statements\n          made by the defendant, or copies thereof,\n          within the possession, custody or control\n          of the government, the existence of which\n          is known,  or  by  the  exercise  of  due\n          diligence  may  become   known,  to   the\n          attorney of the government; the substance\n          of   any   oral   statement   which   the\n          government intends to  offer in  evidence\n          at   the  trial  made  by  the  defendant\n          whether   before   or  after   arrest  in\n          response to interrogation  by any  person\n          then  known  by  the  defendant to  be  a\n          government agent . . . .\" \n\nFed.

In  exercising  its  discretion  to  control\n\ndiscovery rule violations,  the district  court must  inquire\n\ninto  the surrounding circumstances  to determine whether the\n\nviolating  party acted in bad  faith.

To\n                  \n\nobtain reversal,  the defendant must prove  that the district\n\ncourt abused  its discretion  which resulted in  prejudice to\n\nthe  defense.

Answering routine questions  of where he\n\nwas arriving from and with  whom he was travelling, defendant\n\nsaid that he had not been in Iran for six or seven years  and\n\nthat  he was travelling alone.  Both of those statements were\n\nfalse.              During a hearing  on preliminary  matters\n\nat the beginning  of the trial, the district court questioned\n\nthe government as to why the statements were not disclosed to\n\ndefense counsel in a timely manner.  The government responded\n\nthat the statements were unknown to them until the day before\n\nthey  were disclosed  to defense  counsel, three  days before\n\ntrial.  The next day, before testimony began, defense counsel\n\nasked  the court  to suppress the  statements on  the grounds\n\nthat  the  late  disclosure,  three days  before  trial,  had\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nprejudiced  his  opportunity  for  a  suppression  hearing.10\n\nThe   district  court  conditionally   ruled  that   the  two\n\nstatements  were admissible.    The court  cautioned that  if\n\ntestimony during  trial showed  that  there was  a basis  for\n\nsuppression, he would  halt the trial and  hold a suppression\n\nhearing.  When the  government alerted the court that  it was\n\nabout  to  elicit  testimony  from  Inspector  Gaffney  about\n\ndefendant's statements, the court directed  the government to\n\nproceed with the questions.  Defense counsel objected and the\n\ncourt overruled the objection without elaboration.\n\n          On  appeal,   defendant   argues  that   the   late\n\ndisclosure of  the statements by the  government deprived him\n\nof  an opportunity to attempt to suppress the statements.  He\n\ncontends  that the  statements  should  have been  suppressed\n\nbecause  he  was  not   given  Miranda  warnings  before  the\n                                      \n\nquestioning  which  produced  the  statements.    Defendant's\n\ntheory is that if the inspector who processed McBride through\n\nCustoms  became aware of the  warrant for her  arrest and her\n\nrelationship to defendant before another inspector questioned\n\ndefendant, then there was a basis for detaining defendant and\n\nhe was entitled to  Miranda warnings before being questioned.\n                           \n\n                    \n\n10.  A  suppression hearing  was held  before trial  on other\nmatters.\n\n                             -24-\n                              24\n\n          The  right  to  Miranda  warnings   attaches  in  a\n                                 \n\ncustodial  or coercive situation.  Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n298,  309 (1985); United States  v.

Neither suspicion  nor probable  cause to\n\narrest, without  action to  restrain the suspect,  invoke the\n\nrequirement for Miranda warnings.  United States v. McDowell,\n                                                            \n\n918  F.2d 1004, 1008 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v.

United States\n                                                             \n\nv.

Even if the  circumstances hypothesized by\n\ndefendant had occurred, defendant was not entitled to Miranda\n                                                             \n\nwarnings   before   answering   routine  Customs   questions.\n\nTherefore, the false statements made by defendant in response\n\nto  the Customs inspector's  questions were properly admitted\n\ninto evidence.   \n\n          There is  no  question  that  the  statements  were\n\ndisclosed  to  defendant  long past  the  discovery deadline.\n\nDefendant does  not argue  that the government  acted in  bad\n\nfaith, however,  and the  court's inquiry concerning  why the\n\ngovernment's disclosure was delayed does  not reveal evidence\n\nof bad faith by the government.  Defendant has not shown that\n\nthe delay prejudiced his defense by impairing his opportunity\n\nto suppress  the statements.   The  court heard testimony  at\n\n                             -25-\n                              25\n\ntrial from the Customs inspectors involved with defendant and\n\nMcBride, and found that a suppression hearing was unnecessary\n\nbefore defendant's  statements were admitted.   Therefore, we\n\nfind no abuse of the court's discretion to control  discovery\n\nviolations  and no  resulting  prejudice  to  the  defendant.\n\nDefendant's  request  that  this  issue be  remanded  to  the\n\ndistrict court for a suppression hearing is denied. \n\n                              Affirmed.\n                                       \n\n                             -26-\n                              26\n",

After trial, defendant's counsel failed to file a\n\nnotice of appeal.

After a hearing, the district court\n\nfound that because defendant  had dismissed his counsel prior\n\nto  the expiration  of the  appeal period  there could  be no\n\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  The  court went\n\non  to hold, however, that  defendant while proceeding pro se\n                                                             \n\nhad  inadvertently  failed  to   file  a  timely  appeal  and\n\nreinstated defendant's  right to appeal.   It is  this appeal\n\nthat we now consider.\n\n          There   are  three  issues  before  us  on  appeal:\n\n(1) whether  the prosecutor's  closing  argument was  proper;\n\n(2) whether the  district court erred in  denying defendant's\n\nmotion for a  continuance prior  to the start  of trial;  and\n\n(3) whether  the  district  court  erred  in  admitting  into\n\nevidence a statement by defendant.\n\n                             II.\n\n                          The Facts\n                                   \n\n          We  begin  by  recounting  the  salient   facts  as\n\ndisclosed at  trial and  in a pre-trial  suppression hearing.\n\nDefendant,  his  wife, and  their  two  children, arrived  in\n\nBoston on  October 20, 1988,  after a flight  from Frankfurt,\n\nGermany.  Because  he was a  foreign national, defendant  was\n\nfirst  processed  by Immigration.    His  wife and  children,\n\nAmerican citizens, proceeded  directly to Customs inspection.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nAfter going through  Immigration, defendant  went to  Customs\n\nwhere he was interviewed by Inspector Cheryl B. Gaffney.\n\n          Inspector  Gaffney  asked  defendant  the  standard\n\nCustoms questions:   where he had been  on the trip, where he\n\nlived, how long  he was gone, and  the purpose of  his visit.\n\nIn response,  defendant stated that  he had not  travelled to\n\nIran at any time during  his trip and that he had not been to\n\nIran  in six  or seven  years.   He also  stated that  he was\n\ntravelling alone  and  gave Gaffney  his Customs  Declaration\n\nwhich  indicated  that he  was travelling  alone.   After the\n\ninterview,  defendant  was taken  by  Gaffney and  Inspectors\n\nMcGrath and Bird to another  room for further questioning and\n\na possible search.\n\n          Defendant's wife,  Lori Ann McBride, and  their two\n\nchildren, went  to a  different Customs line  than defendant.\n\nShe was interviewed  by Inspector Pacewicz  to whom she  gave\n\nher  Customs Declaration and  her passport  and those  of her\n\nchildren.   Following  routine  procedures for  international\n\ntravelers,    Pacewicz    made    a   Treasury    Enforcement\n\nCommunications System  check on  McBride to determine  if she\n\nwas  a  fugitive  or  was being  sought  by  law  enforcement\n\nofficials.  The  check showed that  there was an  outstanding\n\nwarrant  for McBride's  arrest  in California  on a  parental\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nkidnapping  charge.1    Defendant  knew  of  the  outstanding\n\nwarrant against his wife.\n\n          After Inspector Pacewicz learned of the warrant, he\n\nasked  McBride and the children to go to a nearby examination\n\ntable.    At  about  the  same  time,  defendant  passed  the\n\nexamination table  under escort  of Inspectors  Gaffney, Bird\n\nand  McGrath.   According to  Pacewicz, McBride  became \"very\n\nnervous\" on seeing defendant.  This prompted Pacewicz to take\n\nher  to a search  room other than the  one to which defendant\n\nwas being escorted.  Almost immediately on entering the room,\n\nMcBride removed five packages from her coat and threw them on\n\nthe table,  saying, \"I don't  know what this is.   My husband\n\nmade me carry them, but I know it was something bad.\"   After\n\nthe    packages  had  been thrown  on  the  table,  Inspector\n\nPacewicz found that the contents tested positive for heroin.\n\n          Sometime later, Special Agent Joseph Desmond of the\n\nDrug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") came to the Customs area.  He\n\ntalked to Inspector Pacewicz  and then talked to McBride  for\n\nabout  fifteen  minutes.    Desmond then  went  to  interview\n\ndefendant.  Before questioning defendant, Desmond advised him\n\nof  his Miranda  rights.   Defendant said  he understood  his\n               \n\nrights, but did not understand why  he or his wife were being\n\n                    \n\n1.  The oldest child of defendant and McBride had been placed\nin  the  custody  of  the  California  Department  of  Social\nServices by the San Diego County, California, Juvenile Court.\nThe arrest warrant was issued after McBride took the child in\nviolation of the custody order. \n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nheld.  Desmond then  ended his discussion with  defendant and\n\nbegan  processing McBride and  making arrangements  for their\n\ntwo children.\n\n          While   so  occupied,  Desmond  was  informed  that\n\ndefendant  wanted to see him.  Desmond and defendant then had\n\nan  extended conversation.   Defendant  told Desmond  that he\n\nobtained  the  \"opium\"  in  Germany  from  an  Iranian  named\n\nMohammed Ali  Karabolout.   He said  that he  was to be  paid\n\n$3,000 if he delivered the opium to one  Parviz Parvin in San\n\nFrancisco. Defendant  told Desmond  that Parvin was  a \"large\n\nheroin dealer.\"2\n\n          Desmond talked to defendant again after his arrest.\n\nDefendant repeated what  he had told  him before about  where\n\nand from whom he had obtained the \"opium\" and how much he was\n\nto be paid  for delivering  it.  Desmond  and defendant  then\n\ndiscussed  carrying out a  controlled delivery whereby Parvin\n\nwould be arrested after defendant  made the delivery.   After\n\nconsidering the plan in  detail and after consulting with  an\n\nattorney,  defendant  told Desmond  that he  did not  want to\n\nparticipate in the controlled delivery to Parvin.\n\n                    \n\n2.  On direct  examination at trial, the  defendant testified\nthat he had been temporarily in Iran.  When he and his family\nleft Iran, a friend,  George Shalmarez, who had lived  in the\nUnited  States, drove them from Iran to Turkey.  George asked\ndefendant to  deliver  packages of  \"cancer medicine\"  called\n\"shireb\"  to a sick friend, Parviz  Parvin, in San Francisco.\nGeorge also told him  that Parvin ran a limousine  service in\nSan Francisco and might give him a job as a driver.\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n          The  district  court held  a  pre-trial suppression\n\nhearing on both McBride's and defendant's motions to suppress\n\ntheir  oral  and  written  statements  and  certain  physical\n\nevidence.   The motions were denied as to defendant, but were\n\npartially granted as to McBride.   After McBride pled guilty,\n\nthe  prosecutor moved  to  admit  certain evidence  including\n\nMcBride's  statement  made when  she  threw  the packages  of\n\ncontraband onto  the table  in the Customs  examination room.\n\nThe  court  suppressed McBride's  statement  and  it was  not\n\nmentioned at  trial although the  Customs inspector described\n\nher actions.\n\n                             III.\n\n                           Analysis\n                                   \n\n          Defendant raises three issues  on appeal.  He first\n\nchallenges parts of the  prosecutor's closing argument on the\n\nfollowing grounds: (1) an impermissible reference to excluded\n\nevidence; (2)  argument of matters based  on the prosecutor's\n\npersonal belief and  opinion and knowledge of  matters not in\n\nevidence; (3) an attempt to inflame passions or  prejudice of\n\nthe jury; and (4) a misrepresentation of defendant's finances\n\nto  suggest a motive for  the crime.   In addition, defendant\n\nappeals  the district  court's  denial of  his  motion for  a\n\ncontinuance, and  the court's  decision to admit  evidence at\n\ntrial which was  not disclosed to defendant until  three days\n\nbefore trial.\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nA.  Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n                                 \n\n          Because defendant failed to  object at trial to the\n\nprosecutor's statements  made in closing  argument, we review\n\ndefendant's claims on appeal  under the plain error standard.\n\nUnited States v.

Alleged Reliance on Evidence Excluded From Trial\n                                                         \n\n          Defendant  claims  that  the  prosecutor's  closing\n\nargument relied on evidence  that had been excluded from  the\n\ntrial  as  hearsay.    Before  trial,  the  court  suppressed\n\nMcBride's statement, made  during the Customs  examination as\n\nshe emptied packages  from her  coat onto a  table, \"I  don't\n\nknow what this is.  My husband made me carry them, but I know\n\nit  was something bad.\"   The court found  that the statement\n\nwas  inadmissible  hearsay because  McBride was  available to\n\ntestify, and her  knowledge of the  contents of the  packages\n\nwas being offered to establish defendant's knowledge  through\n\na  statement which  was not  in furtherance of  their alleged\n\nconspiracy. \n\n          At trial,  Customs Inspector  Pacewicz, who  was in\n\nthe search room with  McBride, recounted McBride's actions of\n\nremoving  the packages from her coat, and did not mention her\n\npreviously excluded  statement.  Defendant did  not object to\n\nthis  testimony   and  does  not  now   claim  that  allowing\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nPacewicz's testimony was  error.4   Defendant's complaint  is\n\nwith  the way  the prosecutor  used  the evidence  in closing\n\nargument.   During closing argument, the  prosecutor made the\n\nfollowing references to Inspector Pacewicz's testimony:\n\n             At that time  Inspector Pacewicz  took\n          Lori  Ann  McBride  to another  secondary\n          search room.  As soon as Lori Ann McBride\n          entered  the  secondary  search room  she\n          dumped packages out of her coat. \n\n             I  leave  it to  you, for  example, to\n          decide what, if anything,  that indicates\n          about  what Lori  Ann McBride  might have\n          thought was in those packages.\n\nLater in his argument the prosecutor stated:\n\n             You  heard how  Lori Ann  McBride then\n          pulled the stuff out  of her pockets  and\n          dumped it on the table.   Obviously, very\n          nervous, very agitated.\n\n             The   Customs   Declaration   of   the\n          defendant  says  he is  travelling alone.\n          Was there some understanding between Lori\n          Ann  McBride  and  the  defendant?    The\n          evidence, I suggest,  shows clearly  that\n          there was.\n\n          We note first that  defendant's allegation that the\n\nprosecutor used suppressed  evidence in  closing argument  is\n\nwrong.   The prosecution fully  adhered to the  court's order\n\n                    \n\n4.  Defendant may be arguing, by implication, that  Inspector\nPacewicz's testimony about McBride's actions was inadmissible\nhearsay  evidence of  expressive conduct.   Because defendant\nhas  not directly raised this as an  issue on appeal, we deem\nit waived.   United States  v.

The  prosecutor's  closing\n\nargument  recounted  McBride's  actions,  not  her suppressed\n\nstatement.  Inspector Pacewicz  also testified to her actions\n\nand not her statement.  \n\n          Defendant alternatively argues that by referring to\n\nMcBride's  actions and  asking  the jury  to draw  inferences\n\nbased on her actions, the prosecutor was attempting to convey\n\nthe message, expressed by McBride's  excluded statement, that\n\ndefendant knew  that the packages contained  contraband.  The\n\nprosecutor's  reference  to   McBride's  actions,   defendant\n\nargues,  should have been  excluded for the  same reason that\n\nthe court excluded her statement.  \n\n          The prosecutor's  argument was not evidence  in the\n\ntrial, as  the district  court properly instructed  the jury.\n\nArgument necessarily presents a partisan view of the evidence\n\nadmitted  at  trial.     Although  the  prosecution  may  not\n\ninterject personal credibility or opinion into argument,  the\n\nprosecutor is entitled, in  closing, to ask the jury  to draw\n\nwarrantable  inferences from  the  evidence  admitted  during\n\ntrial.   Young, 470  U.S. at 7;  United States  v. Mount, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536973\"><a href=\"/opinion/536973/united-states-v-charles-m-mount/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span>\n                                                        \n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (1st Cir. 1990).  \n\n          The prosecutor asked the jury to consider \"what, if\n\nanything\" McBride's actions indicated about what  she thought\n\nwas in  the packages  which  she threw  on  the table.    The\n\nprosecutor  later  suggested   that  McBride's  actions   and\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\nnervousness and defendant's  Customs Declaration that he  was\n\ntravelling  alone indicated an  understanding between McBride\n\nand  defendant.    The  evidence at  trial  established  that\n\nMcBride  threw the  packages  on  the  table in  the  Customs\n\nexamination  room, that  she was  nervous during  the Customs\n\nexamination,  and that  defendant  claimed  to be  travelling\n\nalone.   Therefore,  the prosecutor  asked the  jury  to draw\n\nwarrantable inferences based upon the evidence at  trial.  We\n\nfind  nothing  improper  in  the  prosecutor's  reference  to\n\nMcBride's actions in closing  argument, and therefore we find\n\nno error. \n\n     2.  Argument of Matters Not in Evidence and Personal\n                                                         \n         Opinion\n                \n\n          Next,   defendant   asserts   impropriety  in   the\n\nprosecutor's  reference  to defendant's  decision  not to  go\n\nahead with the controlled delivery in which he had originally\n\nagreed to  participate.5  At trial,  defendant testified that\n\nhis decision not to  cooperate was motivated by his  fear for\n\nthe safety  of his  wife and  family.   On cross-examination,\n\ndefendant  admitted stating to DEA Agent  Desmond in a letter\n\nthat Parvin was \"the Al Capone of San Francisco\" and  that he\n\nknew Parvin  \"to be  the key  of the  whole  drug supply  for\n\n                    \n\n5.  When  asked  by  DEA  Agent Desmond  to  cooperate  in  a\ncontrolled delivery  of  the packages  containing  heroin  to\nParvin,  the  intended recipient  of  the  \"medicine\" in  San\nFrancisco, defendant initially agreed to participate and then\nchanged his mind.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nCalifornia.\"    The  defendant  continued   to  maintain  his\n\ninnocence, however,  claiming  that he  thought the  packages\n\ncontained cancer  medicine for  Parvin, not  heroin.   In his\n\nclosing, the prosecutor made the following remarks:\n\n             Why,  ladies  and gentlemen,  would he\n          not do it,  [the controlled delivery]  if\n          he was confident that at the other end of\n          the  road there  was someone  waiting for\n          cancer medicine  and not  heroin?   If in\n          fact,  someone  was  waiting   there  for\n          cancer and medicine, he could have proved\n          his innocence and surely he knows that in\n          that  instance  he  would not  have  been\n          prosecuted. \n\n          In his  rebuttal, the  prosecutor responded  to the\n\ndefendant's closing thus:\n\n             Mr. Boudreau [the defense lawyer] just\n          said that  I said in my  closing argument\n          that  the  defendant   would  have   been\n          prosecuted  anyway,  even if  he effected\n          the controlled delivery.  That was not my\n          point.    My   point  was  that  if   the\n          defendant is telling the truth,  that the\n          person at  the  other end  of  the  line,\n          Parvis Parvin, was waiting  for medicine,\n          he could  have  proved his  innocence  by\n          effecting the delivery.\n\n             The defendant said he initially agreed\n          to do  it because he wanted  to show that\n          the person  at the other end  of the line\n          was waiting for medicine and  not heroin.\n          Clearly,  the  defendant  could not  have\n          thought that if  he effected the delivery\n          and  the person was, in fact, waiting for\n          medicine and was  sick with cancer,  that\n          he would have been prosecuted. \n\n             I think that,  clearly, he would  not,\n          or  clearly   he  would  not   have  been\n          prosecuted if he had proved his innocence\n          in that manner.\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\n          Although he did not  object at trial, defendant now\n\nopposes the prosecutor's  statements on two bases:   that the\n\nstatements  refer to  matters not  in evidence  and that  the\n\nstatements assert the personal beliefs of the prosecutor.  It\n\nis improper for  a prosecutor, in argument, to refer to or to\n\nseem to rely on matters not  in evidence.  Smith, 982 F.2d at\n                                                \n\n683.  It is also improper for a prosecutor to  insert his own\n\ncredibility or opinions into argument.  Id.;  Mount, 896 F.2d\n                                                   \n\nat  625.   Defendant contends  that the  prosecutor's remarks\n\nimpermissibly suggested that he knew something not introduced\n\nat trial which determined whether or not defendant would have\n\nbeen  prosecuted and  also interjected  his  personal opinion\n\nabout defendant's actions.  \n\n          The prosecutor may have overstepped  the boundaries\n\nof  permissible argument  by offering  his opinion,  \"I think\n\nthat, clearly he would not, or clearly he would not have been\n\nprosecuted  if he had proved his innocence in that manner.\"6 \n\nIf so, the transgression  does not constitute plain error  in\n\nthe context of the trial as a whole.  The  prosecutor did not\n\nroutinely insert  his personal opinion into  the argument nor\n\ndo  we find  that his  remark was  deliberate.   Although the\n\ncourt  did not  give a cautionary  instruction, we  find that\n\n                    \n\n6.  The prosecutor,  apparently, was  attempting to make  the\npoint that  defendant refused to cooperate  in the controlled\ndelivery to Parvin because he knew that the  circumstances of\nthe delivery would not  clear him of the crimes  charged and,\ntherefore, he would be prosecuted anyway.    \n\n                             -14-\n                              14\n\nlittle,  if  any,  prejudice  resulted.    The  prosecution's\n\nargument about the implications  of defendant's choice not to\n\nparticipate in the controlled delivery was merely  cumulative\n\nof other evidence including defendant's confessions, admitted\n\nat  trial and  argued  in closing,  which showed  defendant's\n\nknowledge that  the packages contained heroin  and not cancer\n\nmedicine.    Therefore,  the   remark  was  not  so  severely\n\nprejudicial as to undermine defendant's substantial rights or\n\nthe fairness of the trial as a whole.      \n\n          Defendant   also   claims  that   the  prosecutor's\n\nargument as quoted above  impermissibly shifted the burden to\n\ndefendant to prove his innocence.  We do not agree.  Further,\n\nthe court  gave a  sufficient  charge on  the presumption  of\n\ninnocence to  dispel any  improper suggestion which  the jury\n\nmight have taken from the argument.7  \n\n     3.  Inflammatory Remarks\n                             \n\n                    \n\n7.  On the government's burden of proof, the court instructed\nas follows:\n             The  law presumes  a  defendant to  be\n          innocent  of a  crime.   Thus, defendant,\n          although accused, begins the trial with a\n          clean  slate,  with  no evidence  against\n          him,  and  the  law  permits  nothing but\n          legal evidence presented before  the jury\n          to be considered in support of any charge\n          against   the   defendant.       So   the\n          presumption   of   innocence   alone   is\n          sufficient to acquit  a defendant  unless\n          the   jurors   are  satisfied   beyond  a\n          reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt\n          after    a    careful    and    impartial\n          consideration of all the evidence  in the\n          case.\n\n                             -15-\n                              15\n\n          Defense  counsel argued in closing that defendant's\n\nfailure to hide the packages of contraband in suitcases or in\n\nhidden compartments indicated his innocence.  The  prosecutor\n\nanswered in rebuttal as follows:\n\n             Finally,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  Mr.\n          Boudreau suggests that the  defendant, if\n          he knew he was  smuggling in heroin would\n          have  found a  secret compartment  in the\n          luggage to  carry the heroin.   I suggest\n          that  the  defendant  did find  a  secret\n          compartment.      He   found   a   secret\n          compartment in his  American wife who  he\n          thought would not be searched because she\n          was  an  American  wife  with  two  small\n          children,   and   that   is  the   secret\n          compartment that he  found and  attempted\n          unsuccessfully to use.\n\nDefendant  now  argues  that the  prosecutor's  references to\n\ndefendant's American wife were intended to inflame the jury's\n                    \n\npassions  and prejudices  against defendant  who is  Iranian.\n\nThere is no doubt  that argument which is intended  to appeal\n\nto emotions rather than to reason is improper.

That is  not the case  here, however.  Although\n\nthe prosecutor's remarks,  taken in isolation, might  suggest\n\nan  appeal to the passions of  the jury, when his remarks are\n\ntaken  in context, any such tactic  vanishes.  The prosecutor\n\nwas countering the defense by arguing that defendant may have\n\n                             -16-\n                              16\n\nassumed that his American  wife would have an  easier passage\n\nthrough  Customs than he  would, and used  that advantage for\n\nsmuggling the  packages of heroin.   Further, the  court gave\n\nthe following cautionary instruction:\n\n             The  fact that  the defendant  in this\n          case  is  not  a  citizen  of the  United\n          States and is by  birth an Iranian should\n          not prejudice you for or against him, but\n          he  should  be  treated  like  any  other\n          defendant,  and  your verdicts  should be\n          based  on  the  evidence  that  has  been\n          introduced before you in this case.\n\nReading the prosecutor's  remarks in context and  in light of\n\nthe defense's closing argument, we find no impropriety in the\n\nstatement.   If  any  prejudice was  communicated, the  court\n\ncautioned  the jury not  to allow  bias about  nationality to\n\ninfluence its decision.   \n\n     4.  Financial Motive for the Crime\n                                       \n\n          In  response to  defendant's claim  that he  had no\n\nmotive  to   commit  the  crime  of   importing  heroin,  the\n\nprosecution argued  that defendant, and his  family, had only\n\n$700 when they  entered the  United States.   The amount  was\n\nbased upon the combined Customs Declarations of defendant and\n\nMcBride.  Defendant admitted that he had been promised $3,000\n\nif  he delivered the  contraband to Parvin.   The prosecution\n\nargued that the promised  payment provided a financial motive\n\nfor defendant to  import the heroin.   Defendant now  asserts\n\nthat he had  $1,456 in  traveller's checks with  him when  he\n\nentered the United States which the government seized when he\n\n                             -17-\n                              17\n\nwas arrested. The government notes that after reviewing their\n\nfiles they agree  with defendant.  Defendant argues  that the\n\nprosecution's imputed financial motive was improper given the\n\ntraveller's checks.   Defendant failed to  raise the argument\n\nat trial and failed to  mention the traveller's checks during\n\nhis  testimony at  trial.   There is  no suggestion  that the\n\nprosecution deliberately misrepresented defendant's financial\n\ncondition.  Further,  $3,000 remains  a financial  incentive,\n\nalthough  perhaps of somewhat  less significance.  Therefore,\n\nwe find  the prosecution's  argument of financial  motive was\n\nproper under these circumstances.\n\n     5.  No Plain Error\n                       \n\n          We  have  found   that  the  prosecutor's   closing\n\nargument was, for  the most part, proper.  In  the context of\n\nthe  entire trial, we find  that the aggregate  impact of any\n\nimpropriety was minimal  and did not  cause a miscarriage  of\n\njustice.  Therefore, the trial was not marred by plain error.\n\nB.  Denial of Motion for Continuance\n                                    \n\n          The defendant  appeals the district  court's denial\n\nof  his  motion for  continuance to  allow  time in  which to\n\nobtain  additional  corroborative  evidence.    We previously\n\nconsidered this  issue in  defendant's appeal from  denial of\n\nhis  28  U.S.C.    2255 petition.    At that  time, defendant\n\nclaimed ineffective  assistance of  counsel due, in  part, to\n\nhis  counsel's   failure  to  timely  file   the  motion  for\n\n                             -18-\n                              18\n\ncontinuance.    After trial  and  before the     2255 appeal,\n\ndefendant obtained from  Iran a police report of  a statement\n\nby Ali Karabolout, one of  the people involved with defendant\n\nin  Iran,  which defendant  had  hoped to  present  at trial.\n\nDefendant  submitted the  police report  to this  court.   We\n\nreviewed   the  substance   of  Karabolout's   statement  and\n\nconcluded that it  was hearsay.   We found that  Karabolout's\n\nstatement was  not against significant penal  interest, as it\n\nwas  more exculpatory  than inculpatory,  and that  it lacked\n\nsufficient  other  indicia  of  reliability  to  obligate the\n\ndistrict court to find  that it fell within any  exception to\n\nthe  hearsay rule.  We concluded that the documents from Iran\n\nwere not  admissible in evidence and,  therefore, late filing\n\nof the  motion for  continuance did not  prejudice defendant.\n\nTajeddini, 945 F.2d at 463-65.  \n         \n\n          Defendant  now  requests  that  we  reconsider  our\n\ndecision on  the ground that we  previously misunderstood the\n\neffect of Iranian law  on Karabolout which would result  from\n\nhis statement to Iranian police.  We decline to do  so.  This\n\nappeal is, of course,  not an appropriate method to  move for\n\nreconsideration of our  previous decision.  See  Fed. R. App.\n                                               \n\nP. 40.8   Further, when a  legal issue has been  presented to\n\n                    \n\n8.  After our decision and the  mandate to the district court\nwas  issued,  the  defendant  filed  several   petitions  for\nextensions  of  time to  file a  motion  for rehearing  and a\nrequest  for recall of  mandate.  His  petitions and requests\nwere denied because  he failed to  demonstrate any errors  in\n\n                             -19-\n                              19\n\nand  decided by this court,  our decision becomes  the law of\n\nthe  case in all  subsequent proceedings on  the same matter.\n\nUnited States  v.

Therefore, our prior  holding that\n\nKarabolout's statement  was inadmissible hearsay  was neither\n\nclearly erroneous nor did it constitute a manifest injustice,\n\nand there is no reason to disturb it.\n\nC.  Delayed Discovery Disclosure\n                                \n\n          Defendant  assigns as  error  the district  court's\n\ndecision to allow the government to introduce statements made\n\nby  defendant to Customs  inspectors although  the statements\n\nwere  not disclosed  to the  defense until three  days before\n\ntrial.    Defendant claims  that the  late disclosure  of the\n\nstatements violated Fed.  R. Crim. P. 16 and  was prejudicial\n\nto his defense.  We disagree.\n\n                    \n\n9.  The defendant has submitted a letter from the director of\nthe  Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the\nEmbassy  of  Pakistan which  is  signed for  the  director by\nsomeone  else.  The letter  expresses an opinion,  based on a\nletter  from defendant's  attorney, that  the proceedings  in\nIran  against Karabolout were only temporarily suspended, and\nthat Karabolout may be exposed to criminal or civil penalties\nbased  on his statement to  the Iranian police.   Although we\nare not bound by  the rules of evidence in  considering proof\nof foreign  law, the defendant's submission  is inadequate to\ninform this court  of Iranian law allegedly relevant  to this\nmatter. \n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          Rule 16(a)(1), in the version in effect at the time\n\nof defendant's  trial,  required the  government to  disclose\n\ncertain evidence prior to trial:\n\n             Upon  request  of   a  defendant   the\n          government shall permit the  defendant to\n          inspect  and  copy  or  photograph:   any\n          relevant  written or  recorded statements\n          made by the defendant, or copies thereof,\n          within the possession, custody or control\n          of the government, the existence of which\n          is known,  or  by  the  exercise  of  due\n          diligence  may  become   known,  to   the\n          attorney of the government; the substance\n          of   any   oral   statement   which   the\n          government intends to  offer in  evidence\n          at   the  trial  made  by  the  defendant\n          whether   before   or  after   arrest  in\n          response to interrogation  by any  person\n          then  known  by  the  defendant to  be  a\n          government agent . . . .\" \n\nFed.

Answering routine questions  of where he\n\nwas arriving from and with  whom he was travelling, defendant\n\nsaid that he had not been in Iran for six or seven years  and\n\nthat  he was travelling alone.  Both of those statements were\n\nfalse.              During a hearing  on preliminary  matters\n\nat the beginning  of the trial, the district court questioned\n\nthe government as to why the statements were not disclosed to\n\ndefense counsel in a timely manner.  The government responded\n\nthat the statements were unknown to them until the day before\n\nthey  were disclosed  to defense  counsel, three  days before\n\ntrial.  The next day, before testimony began, defense counsel\n\nasked  the court  to suppress the  statements on  the grounds\n\nthat  the  late  disclosure,  three days  before  trial,  had\n\n                             -23-\n                              23\n\nprejudiced  his  opportunity  for  a  suppression  hearing.10\n\nThe   district  court  conditionally   ruled  that   the  two\n\nstatements  were admissible.    The court  cautioned that  if\n\ntestimony during  trial showed  that  there was  a basis  for\n\nsuppression, he would  halt the trial and  hold a suppression\n\nhearing.  When the  government alerted the court that  it was\n\nabout  to  elicit  testimony  from  Inspector  Gaffney  about\n\ndefendant's statements, the court directed  the government to\n\nproceed with the questions.  Defense counsel objected and the\n\ncourt overruled the objection without elaboration.\n\n          On  appeal,   defendant   argues  that   the   late\n\ndisclosure of  the statements by the  government deprived him\n\nof  an opportunity to attempt to suppress the statements.  He\n\ncontends  that the  statements  should  have been  suppressed\n\nbecause  he  was  not   given  Miranda  warnings  before  the\n                                      \n\nquestioning  which  produced  the  statements.    Defendant's\n\ntheory is that if the inspector who processed McBride through\n\nCustoms  became aware of the  warrant for her  arrest and her\n\nrelationship to defendant before another inspector questioned\n\ndefendant, then there was a basis for detaining defendant and\n\nhe was entitled to  Miranda warnings before being questioned.\n                           \n\n                    \n\n10.
