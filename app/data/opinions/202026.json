William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Kimberly Homan for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J.

This criminal appeal arises in an\n\nunorthodox procedural posture.      The district court, after granting\n\na midtrial \"partial directed verdict\" on a single-count indictment,\n\nsent the case to the jury.          Once a guilty verdict had been\n\nreturned, the court entered a judgment of conviction and vacated\n\nthe partial directed verdict.         The defendant objects to this\n\nsequence of events on both double jeopardy and due process grounds.\n\nAlthough we reject the defendant's double jeopardy claim, we\n\nnonetheless hold that his right to a fair trial was compromised.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remand for a new\n\ntrial on the original indictment.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The evidence, viewed favorably to the government's theory\n\nof the case, would have allowed the jury to find that Rafael Yeje-\n\nCabrera headed a mammoth drug-trafficking ring.         The organization\n\npurveyed large quantities of cocaine and marijuana in and around\n\nsoutheastern Massachusetts.        At some point, a lengthy federal\n\ninvestigation ensued. The probe reached a crescendo on December 8,\n\n2001, when a tractor-trailer carrying 260 kilograms of cocaine\n\naccidentally backed into a state police cruiser. See United States\n\nv. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2005) (outlining the\n\ncontours   of     the   overall   investigation   and   describing   the\n\ndenouement).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              The jury also could have found that defendant-appellant\n\nJason   Pacheco      was   a    distributor     for,    and   customer    of,   the\n\norganization.        The government contended that he purchased cocaine\n\nfrom Yeje-Cabrera in increments up to one kilogram every few weeks\n\nfor nearly two years and that he took part in other exchanges of\n\nmoney   and     drugs.         During   one    incident   highlighted      by   the\n\ngovernment, a member of the drug ring \"re-rocked\" a kilogram of\n\ncocaine for the defendant and, acting at Yeje-Cabrera's direction,\n\ncharged him a sharply discounted fee for this illicit service.\n\n              The evidence further showed that on December 13, 2001, a\n\nlarge cocaine transaction — involving all or some portion of a\n\ntwenty-five kilogram cache — took place in the defendant's garage.\n\nTwo cars arrived there around 5:30 p.m.                The defendant indicated\n\nthat he wanted the occupants \"to leave right away,\" and he himself\n\nwent outside several minutes later and began pacing between his\n\nhouse   and    the    street.       Yeje-Cabrera       arrived    about   an    hour\n\nafterwards and, around 7:00 p.m., everyone left.                 Officers stopped\n\none of the departing cars and a search revealed $50,000 in cash\n\nhidden in a secret compartment.           Although the officers discovered\n\nno cocaine, a drug dog alerted to one area of the car.                    When law\n\nenforcement agents later procured a warrant and searched the\n\ndefendant's premises, they found a large sum of cash but no drugs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n            On December 20, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted\n\ntwenty-one individuals.            The indictment contained four counts.\n\nPacheco was named only in count 1, which charged him and the others\n\nwith \"conspir[ing] . . . with each other and with persons known and\n\nunknown to the Grand Jury, to possess with intent to distribute,\n\nand to distribute, more than 5 kilograms of cocaine\" in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846.\n\n            All of those accused, save six, pleaded guilty.                     One of\n\nthe   intransigent        six    died   during    the    early       stages    of    the\n\nproceedings.       The defendant and the four remaining accused persons\n\nopted for trial.       Because the court granted a severance, see Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 14, the defendant stood trial alone.\n\n            After the close of the government's case in chief, which\n\nincluded the testimony of three cooperating witnesses who had\n\nthemselves been named in the indictment, the defense took the\n\nposition    that    the    government     had    proved,      at    most,     that   the\n\ndefendant was a member of a small, peripheral conspiracy (not the\n\nmaster     Yeje-Cabrera         conspiracy     charged   in        the   indictment).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the\n\nground that \"there [was] a prejudicial variance between the conduct\n\nalleged in the indictment and the proof offered at trial.\"                           The\n\ndistrict court sensibly deferred ruling on the motion until the\n\nclose of all the evidence.           See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f           The defendant presented evidence and, after both sides\n\nhad rested, the court purported to grant a partial directed verdict\n\nbecause, on the government's \"best evidence,\" the prosecution had\n\nproved   only   that   the   defendant    was   part    of   a   small   \"spoke\"\n\nconspiracy, not part of the large \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-\n\nCabrera.   As a result, no \"reasonably instructed jury could find .\n\n. . that he was in on a conspiracy to gain 260 kilograms\" of\n\ncocaine.    At the same time, the court denied the defendant's\n\ncompanion motion for a required finding of not guilty.\n\n           In its jury instructions, the district court did not\n\nmention its narrowing construction of the charge against the\n\ndefendant but, rather, provided a generic conspiracy instruction\n\nand a special verdict slip requiring a finding on drug quantity.\n\nThe   defendant   objected    in   vain   to    the    mismatch    between   the\n\ninstructions and the court's earlier ruling (but did not suggest\n\nthe possibility of a double jeopardy violation).                 The jury found\n\nthe defendant guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.\n\n           The defendant seasonably moved for a new trial, see Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 33(a), claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that the\n\ndistrict   court's     jury    instructions       did     not     \"sufficiently\n\ndistinguish the separate and particular conspiracy for which the\n\ndefendant was charged from that of the overall 'Yeje-Cabrera'\n\nconspiracy.\"      On August 5, 2003, the district court, with the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fmotion for a new trial still pending, sentenced the defendant to a\n\ntwelve-year incarcerative term.         The court stated that it would\n\nwithhold the entry of judgment until it resolved the pending\n\nmotion.   Something went awry, however, and the clerk entered\n\njudgment on January 23, 2004.        It was not until a month later that\n\nthe court denied the new trial motion.\n\n          The defendant immediately moved for reconsideration. The\n\ndistrict court granted that motion and vacated its earlier order\n\ndenying the new trial motion.        At that time, the court tentatively\n\nconcluded that its so-called partial directed verdict had created\n\na variance between the indictment and the proof.           The court also\n\nstated its belief \"that the [partial directed verdict] order was\n\nerroneously    entered\"    because     the   court   had   overlooked   the\n\ngovernment's evidence of the incident that transpired in the\n\ndefendant's garage.       The court announced that it was considering\n\nwhether it could \"take . . . back\" that erroneous order.\n\n          On June 18, 2004, the district court issued an omnibus\n\nopinion in which it resolved sundry issues concerning the defendant\n\nand certain of his alleged coconspirators (who had been tried\n\nseparately).    As to the defendant, the court concluded that the\n\nthought process underlying its partial directed verdict order\n\nintroduced a fatal variance into the trial, which impaired the\n\ndefendant's substantial rights. See United States v. Green, 346 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 259, 335-37 (D. Mass. 2004).           However, the court then\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fruled that the partial directed verdict was in error because the\n\njury had before it evidence from which it reasonably could have\n\nfound that the defendant was a member of the master Yeje-Cabrera\n\nconspiracy.      See id. at 337-38.            The court went on to determine\n\nthat the jury had not been influenced by the erroneous ruling and\n\nthat, in all events, the defendant had \"waived any procedural\n\nargument that the Court [lacked the authority to] revisit the\n\npartial directed verdict order.\"               Id. at 338.       Consequently, the\n\ncourt vacated the so-called partial directed verdict, denied the\n\ndefendant's motion for a new trial, and allowed the jury's verdict\n\nto stand.      Id.   This timely appeal followed.\n\nIII.    ANALYSIS\n\n              The defendant mounts several challenges to his conviction\n\nand    sentence,     most   of   which   (including       assignments    of   error\n\nrelating to the admission of evidence and aspects of the sentencing\n\nprocess) we need not reach.           The centerpiece of his appeal is a\n\nclaim that the sequence of events described above — the lower\n\ncourt's granting of the so-called partial directed verdict, its\n\nsubsequent submission of the case to the jury, and its eventual\n\nrescission of its original ruling after the entry of judgment —\n\nviolated the Double Jeopardy Clause. His fallback position is that\n\nthe    jury    verdict      cannot   stand      because    the    district    court\n\ntransgressed due process by denying him \"a meaningful opportunity\n\nto present a complete defense.\"           California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f479, 485 (1984).      To this, the defendant adds that the court\n\nconstructively amended the indictment and/or created a material\n\nvariance   between   the   indictment     and    the   proof,   thus   further\n\nprejudicing his rights. We first address the double jeopardy point\n\nand then turn to the fair trial issues.\n\n                           A.   Double Jeopardy.\n\n           The Fifth Amendment declares that no person shall \"be\n\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\n\nlimb.\"     U.S.   Const.   amend.   V.     The    Double   Jeopardy    Clause\n\nencompasses three general protections: \"it shields a defendant from\n\na second prosecution for the same offense after either conviction\n\nor acquittal, and it also prohibits multiple punishments for the\n\nsame offense.\"    United States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); see North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969).             In\n\nthis instance, the defendant invokes the second protective branch;\n\nhe claims that the district court's so-called partial directed\n\nverdict constituted an acquittal and that, therefore, the court\n\nunconstitutionally placed him in additional jeopardy both when it\n\nsent the case to the jury and when it vacated its earlier ruling\n\nafter the entry of judgment.\n\n           When evaluating a double jeopardy claim, a reviewing\n\ncourt first must ask \"whether jeopardy attached in the original\n\n[trial] court proceeding.\"       Gonzalez v. Justices of the Mun. Ct.,\n\n382 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (Gonzalez I), vacated, 125 S. Ct.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f1640   (2005)   (mem.),   reinstated,    420   F.3d   5   (1st   Cir.   2005)\n\n(Gonzalez II).    That query must be answered affirmatively here.\n\n            In a jury case, jeopardy attaches when the jury is\n\nempaneled and sworn.      Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377, 388\n\n(1975).   The district court entered its so-called partial directed\n\nverdict at the close of all the evidence, long after jeopardy had\n\nattached.   But \"the conclusion that jeopardy has attached begins,\n\nrather than ends, the inquiry.\"     Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S.\n\n458, 467 (1973).       Thus, we must take a further step and ask\n\n\"whether the [trial] court terminated jeopardy in a way that\n\nprevents reprosecution.\"     Gonzalez I, 382 F.3d at 8.          We conclude\n\nthat the defendant's claim fails to satisfy this requirement\n\nbecause we cannot say that the district court's so-called partial\n\ndirected verdict was, \"in fact, a judgment of acquittal.\" Smith v.\n\nMassachusetts, 125 S. Ct. 1129, 1134 (2005).          We explain briefly.\n\n            It is beyond cavil that, for double jeopardy purposes,\n\nthe finality accorded to jury verdicts of acquittal extends equally\n\nto judicially rendered judgments of acquittal.            See United States\n\nv. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 573 (1977).            Withal, the\n\nquestion of what constitutes a \"judgment of acquittal\" is not\n\ngoverned either by the form of the trial judge's ruling or by his\n\ncharacterization of it.     See United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82,\n\n96 (1978); Martin Linen, 430 U.S. at 571.             Rather, a reviewing\n\ncourt \"must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\flabel, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or\n\nall of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" Martin Linen,\n\n430 U.S. at 571; see Gonzalez II, 420 F.3d at 8-9.         A resolution in\n\nthe defendant's favor of a necessary factual element of the offense\n\nis   a   definitive    determination    that   the   defendant    cannot    be\n\nconvicted.\n\n            Here, confusion clouds any attempt to decipher the so-\n\ncalled partial directed verdict.             First, the directed verdict\n\ndevice has been alien to federal criminal procedure for over half\n\na century.     Its function was usurped by the introduction of a\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.       See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 (adopted\n\nDec. 26, 1944).       This does not much concern us; the adopted rule\n\nrepresents a \"change of nomenclature,\" not a modification of \"the\n\nnature of the motion.\"         Id. advisory committee's note (1944).\n\nThus, one possible way to understand the district court's partial\n\ndirected verdict would be as a mislabeled judgment of acquittal.\n\n            However,    the   anatomy   of   the   indictment    belies   that\n\nunderstanding.    The indictment charged the defendant in only a\n\nsingle count, yet the district court deemed its order \"partial.\"\n\nIt is surpassingly difficult to conceive, as a theoretical matter,\n\nof a judgment of acquittal on a one-count indictment that leaves a\n\ntriable issue in its wake.         If the order were to be read as a\n\nstraightforward judgment of acquittal, there could be nothing\n\n\"partial\" about it.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          In an effort to reconcile these anomalies, the parties\n\noffer two diametrically different characterizations of the partial\n\ndirected verdict.   Neither explanation is convincing.\n\n          Relying on certain of the district court's statements at\n\ntrial and its later characterizations of its actions, the defendant\n\nclassifies the partial directed verdict as a ruling that \"the\n\ngovernment had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury\n\nfinding beyond a reasonable doubt that Pacheco was a member of the\n\n'Cabrera conspiracy' charged [in the indictment],\" and, therefore,\n\nas a complete resolution of the single count at issue.    We cannot\n\naccept this taxonomy. The partial directed verdict did not reflect\n\na complete acquittal as to the charged conspiracy for at least\n\nthree reasons.   First, if that had been its purport, there is no\n\nearthly reason why it would have been denominated \"partial.\"\n\nSecond, the court, in that event, would not concurrently have\n\ndenied the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty.\n\nAnd, finally, it would then have been pointless to send the case to\n\nthe jury (as the district court did).\n\n          For its part, the government insists that the so-called\n\npartial directed verdict was simply \"a way of limiting the quantity\n\nof cocaine attributable to Pacheco based on his . . . limited role\n\nwithin the Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy.\"    This view assumes that the\n\ncourt entered the order as a result of conflating the issue of\n\nguilt and the issue of drug quantity.   See Derman v. United States,\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"[I]n a drug conspiracy case,\n\nthe jury should determine . . . any facts about the conspiracy that\n\nwill increase the possible penalty . . . beyond the default\n\nstatutory maximum; and the judge should determine, at sentencing,\n\nthe particulars regarding the involvement of each participant in\n\nthe conspiracy.\" (footnote omitted)); see also Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).   But we think it highly unlikely\n\nthat a seasoned judge would confuse these matters, and the judge's\n\nreasoning when he made the ruling indicates that he had placed the\n\nApprendi issues to one side.1   In addition, the court's post-ruling\n\nstatements, while not controlling, do not in any way indicate a\n\nrelationship between the partial directed verdict and drug quantity\n\nper se.   See Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 335-38.\n\n           To sum up, the partial directed verdict was less than a\n\ncomplete acquittal (the defendant's position) but more than a\n\nruling on drug quantity (the government's position).   The district\n\ncourt's action falls somewhere in between those polar extremes.\n\nExactly where is hard to tell because the court's order has a\n\nprotean quality.\n\n           On one hand, the order may be viewed as an attempt to\n\ngrant a partial acquittal, notwithstanding the topography of the\n\nindictment and the court's subsequent actions (e.g., its wide-\n\n\n\n     1\n       When making the partial directed verdict ruling, the court\ntwice advised counsel to \"[f]orget Apprendi for the moment.\"\n\n                                -12-\n\franging jury instructions).      On the other hand — and perhaps more\n\nplausibly — the order may be viewed as an evidentiary comment — a\n\nlimitation on the scope of the conspiracy that the court would\n\nallow the jury to consider.      On that reading, the court may have\n\nbeen ruminating that the jury, if properly instructed, could not\n\nreasonably find that the defendant was a member of the larger \"hub\"\n\nconspiracy but could find that he was a member of the smaller\n\n\"spoke\" conspiracy.    Cf. United States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228, 231\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (noting, as to a larger charged conspiracy and a\n\nsmaller   proven   conspiracy,   that    \"[s]o   long   as   the   statutory\n\nviolation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts\n\nfound are somewhat different than those charged — so long as the\n\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice\").2\n\n           Given these rampant uncertainties, we are reluctant to\n\nsay that the partial directed verdict — a shapeless, inherently\n\nambiguous ruling made without any degree of formality — must be\n\nassumed to represent a resolution, correct or incorrect, of the\n\noffense charged rather than a provisional attempt — later abandoned\n\n\n\n     2\n       We do not need to determine whether the difference between\nthe \"hub\" conspiracy and the \"spoke\" conspiracy resulted in unfair\nprejudice. We include a reference to the variance analysis here,\nhowever, to illustrate that the partial directed verdict plausibly\ncan be viewed as a ruling that contemplated limiting jury\ninstructions which, if properly given, might have cured any\npossible prejudice. See, e.g., United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959\nF.2d 1103, 1115-16 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that, even if a\nvariance did occur, it did not result in prejudice to the defendant\nbecause the court gave a curative jury instruction).\n\n                                  -13-\n\f— to narrow the scope of the facts that the jury could find in\n\ndeciding whether to convict on the offense charged.                  Certainly, no\n\ncase cited by the defendant            treats so fuzzy a ruling as an\n\nacquittal, and what guidance we can glean counsels caution in\n\nexpanding our understanding of an acquittal for double jeopardy\n\npurposes to include such a curious ukase.             Cf. Smith, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1136   (positing    that    the      \"tentative\"      nature    of    a   midtrial\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence ruling would alter the double jeopardy\n\ncalculus).     To take a more aggressive view would make a double\n\njeopardy defense available in any case in which a court succumbs to\n\nthe urge to comment during trial about the sufficiency vel non of\n\nthe evidence.\n\n          We add, moreover, that the core purposes of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause do not seem to be offended by a conservative\n\napproach to such inscrutable statements.                  Affording them a less-\n\nthan-acquittal     status     does    not     arm   the    prosecution    with    an\n\ninstrument of oppression, see Martin Linen, 430 U.S. at 569, but,\n\nrather, serves to promote clarity and formality when a court\n\nundertakes to make a ruling of intended significance.                      In our\n\njudgment, these characteristics — clarity and some degree of\n\nformality — are very desirable in situations like the one presented\n\nhere; an inscrutable comment on evidentiary sufficiency in a\n\nsingle-count    case   that    thereafter       moves      forward    without    any\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fconsistent   follow-up   should   not    be   enough   to    constitute   an\n\nacquittal.\n\n          In all events, we need not answer the double jeopardy\n\nquestion definitively.    Here, the defendant forfeited his double\n\njeopardy claim by failing to raise it at the time the case was\n\nsubmitted to the jury. Under the defendant's reasoning, predicated\n\non his understanding that the partial directed verdict was a full\n\nacquittal, any double jeopardy violation would have matured by that\n\ntime and should have been readily apparent.       Even if the defendant\n\nviewed the partial directed verdict only as an acquittal on the\n\n\"hub\" conspiracy charge, the court's submission of that charge to\n\nthe jury would have been foreclosed (and, therefore, should have\n\nprompted an objection based on double jeopardy).            In either case,\n\na double jeopardy claim should have been interposed while the trial\n\ncourt had an opportunity either to clarify the situation or to take\n\ncorrective action.   See, e.g., United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d\n\n967, 972 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[C]alling a looming error to the trial\n\ncourt's attention affords an opportunity to correct the problem\n\nbefore irreparable harm occurs.\"). Because the defendant failed in\n\nthat regard — he did not advance a double jeopardy theory until\n\nwell after the jury verdict had been returned — appellate review of\n\nthe current claim is limited to plain error.       See United States v.\n\nRivera, 872 F.2d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f           To succeed under plain error review, the defendant must\n\nshow \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and\n\nwhich not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"    United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).   Given the ambiguity that shrouds the\n\ndistrict court's statements and the peculiar nature of its actions,\n\nthe occurrence of a double jeopardy violation was neither clear nor\n\nobvious.   Thus, any error surely was not plain.\n\n                  B.    Fair Trial Considerations.\n\n           At a bare minimum, see supra Part III(A), the lower\n\ncourt's so-called partial directed verdict exemplified its decision\n\nto narrow the scope of the charge lodged against the defendant.\n\nAfter the court took that position, it was perfectly reasonable for\n\nthe defendant to expect the court to instruct the jury only on the\n\n\"spoke\" conspiracy.     The court did just the opposite; it gave a\n\ngeneric conspiracy instruction and made specific references to the\n\n\"hub\" conspiracy (e.g., \"the government claims that . . . Yeje-\n\nCabrera . . . was the top supplier and . . . he had various people\n\nworking with him . . . [and the defendant] would distribute [Yeje-\n\nCabrera's cocaine]\").    The court also told the jury that \"[using]\n\nthe garage . . . to store cocaine . . . would be facilitating the\n\n. . . conspiracy.\"     By that allusion, the court could only have\n\nmeant the \"hub\" conspiracy.\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f               Following the charge, defense counsel objected.                  As the\n\nbasis for the objection, counsel cited the incongruity between the\n\ninstructions as given and the court's earlier grant of a partial\n\ndirected verdict.3          The court declined to modify the instructions.\n\n               Of course, the jurors were not present when the court\n\npartially directed a verdict, nor were they informed of that ruling\n\nat any later time.               This is potentially important because the\n\ndistrict court, when it reversed its field, used the fact that the\n\njury was never privy to the erroneous ruling as one reason why the\n\n\"rather generic jury charge regarding the law of conspiracy\"\n\nallowed the jurors to convict the defendant of membership in the\n\n\"hub\" conspiracy.           Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 338.               We find that\n\nreasoning problematic.\n\n               As the defendant suggests, it is possible to think of\n\nthis       situation   in       terms   of   either   a   material   variance    or   a\n\nconstructive amendment of the indictment. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 858 (1st Cir. 1987) (describing a variance,\n\nin the conspiracy context, as a \"showing that the government proved\n\nunderstandings or agreements different from those charged\" and\n\nexplaining that a defendant can \"upset a conviction\" if prejudice\n\nresults); United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(explaining       that      a    constructive       amendment,   which    embodies    a\n\n\n\n       3\n       As stated earlier, counsel did not interpose a double\njeopardy claim at that point in the proceedings.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fmaterial alteration of the charging terms of the indictment,\n\nwhether literally or in effect, is regarded as prejudicial per se).\n\nEither of these routes, if successfully pursued, would at most earn\n\nthe defendant a retrial, and there is a simpler, more direct route\n\nthat leads to precisely the same result.           As we see it, the\n\ndistrict court abridged the defendant's right to a fair trial when,\n\nafter ruling one way, it proceeded to act in a wholly inconsistent\n\nmanner without any prior notice.\n\n            Fair notice is one of the essentials in a trial, whether\n\nat the outset of the proceedings or at subsequent stages of the\n\ncase.     See, e.g., Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 760-64\n\n(1962).     The concern with fairness (and, hence, with notice) is\n\nheightened    in   criminal   cases.     A   serious   and   prejudicial\n\ninfringement of the right to a fair trail can violate due process.\n\nCf. Neron v. Tierney, 841 F.2d 1197, 1200 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"The Due\n\nProcess Clause guarantees a criminal defendant that his trial will\n\ncomport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness.\" (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).       Where, as here, a court\n\nmakes a ruling that places a criminal defendant on notice of the\n\nparameters of the charge to be put to the jury and subsequently\n\nreneges on that commitment without forewarning the defendant, the\n\ncourt's error is serious and may well be prejudicial.         Cf. In re\n\nFidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., 167 F.3d 735, 737 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(disapproving of \"courts imposing rules of practice without some\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fform of notice that would allow the parties and their counsel to\n\nconform their conduct accordingly\").                In this instance, prejudice\n\nis sufficiently likely to justify a new trial.\n\n           We elaborate briefly. In announcing its partial directed\n\nverdict, the district court led the defendant to believe, at a\n\nminimum, that it was setting a course that would govern the\n\nremainder of the trial — only the \"spoke\" conspiracy would be put\n\nto the jury — and defense counsel was entitled to rely on that\n\nstatement.      The court, however, did not deliver on its implicit\n\npromise;   it   refused,     despite     a    contemporaneous         objection,    to\n\nconform its jury instructions to its earlier statement.                        That\n\naction,    undertaken      without     any      notice         whatever,   offended\n\nfundamental fairness.        See Bae v. Peters, 950 F.2d 469, 478 (7th\n\nCir. 1991) (acknowledging that a due process violation can occur if\n\n\"a   last-minute    change    in   the       charge    .   .    .    prejudice[s]   a\n\ndefendant's opportunity to defend himself\"); cf. Lee County Branch\n\nof the NAACP v. City of Opelika, 748 F.2d 1473, 1480 n.12 (11th\n\nCir. 1984) (observing that \"due process . . . mandate[s] that when\n\nthe rules of the game are changed, the players must be afforded a\n\nfull and fair opportunity to play by the new regulations\" (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n           Having    confirmed       that      an     error     of   constitutional\n\nproportion occurred, we are confined in the remainder of our\n\nanalysis by a special variant of the harmless error standard.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fUnder that formulation, we must order a new trial unless the\n\ngovernment, as the beneficiary of the error, can show beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\n\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967); United States v.\n\nFlores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1372 n.7 (1st Cir. 1992).    This means that\n\nthe government must convince us, beyond any reasonable doubt, that\n\nthe guilty verdict in this case was unaffected by the district\n\ncourt's tergiversation.     The government has not carried that\n\nburden.\n\n           The defendant was at least arguably prejudiced by the\n\ncourt's actions in two ways.       First, the transcript makes it\n\nabundantly clear that defense counsel shaped his summation around\n\nthe narrower charge that the court had led him to believe would be\n\nput to the jury.   That argument focused exclusively on the absence\n\nof credible evidence of the defendant's personal involvement with\n\ncocaine.   The lawyer neither challenged the defendant's putative\n\nmembership in the broader conspiracy nor addressed the concept of\n\nmultiple conspiracies.    Second, defense counsel never requested a\n\nmultiple conspiracy instruction, even though the defendant, so long\n\nas the \"hub\" conspiracy remained in play, may well have been\n\nentitled to one.   See, e.g., United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230,\n\n243 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"If, on the evidence adduced at trial, a\n\nreasonable jury could find more than one . . . illicit agreement,\n\nor could find an agreement different from the one charged, a\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fmultiple conspiracy instruction is proper and should be given if\n\nrequested.\").    We think it quite likely that, had counsel known\n\nthat the court would reverse direction and permit the jury to mull\n\nthe larger \"hub\" conspiracy, he would have pressed for such an\n\ninstruction.\n\n           The short of it is that the defendant tailored his\n\nsummation and his requests for instructions to what the court had\n\nindicated would be the focal point of the jury deliberations.    The\n\ncourt, however, pulled the rug out from under the defense when,\n\nwithout notice or an opportunity for cure, it reverted to a\n\ndifferent, inconsistent focal point.       Had defense counsel been\n\nforewarned, he could have made a much more forceful summation and,\n\nin all probability, received a more favorable charge (one that\n\nincluded   a    multiple   conspiracy   instruction).    Given   the\n\ndisadvantages under which the court's error forced defense counsel\n\nto labor, we are not persuaded that, absent the error, the verdict\n\nwould inevitably have been the same.    The error, therefore, cannot\n\nbe deemed harmless.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       The soundness of the so-called partial directed verdict is\nimmaterial here. Whether or not the court's ruling was correct —\na matter on which we take no view (although we note that the\ndistrict court later said that its pronouncement was incorrect) —\nthe dispositive considerations are that the defendant relied on it\nand that the court acted inconsistently with it.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further. Although double jeopardy does not\n\nbar the further prosecution of this defendant on the conspiracy\n\ncharged in count 1 of the indictment, an error occurred in the\n\ncourse of his trial.   The claim of error was preserved and, under\n\nthe applicable standard, the error was not harmless.   Accordingly,\n\nwe vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the district\n\ncourt for a new trial.   The so-called partial directed verdict is\n\nof no further force or effect and, therefore, the \"scope of the\n\nconspiracy\" issue remains open.\n\n\n\n           Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                   — Concurring Opinion Follows —\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\nI agree with my colleagues in the majority that Jason Pacheco's\n\ntrial for cocaine conspiracy was not conducted in accordance with\n\nthe requirements of the Due Process Clause.   I also agree that this\n\ncase must be remanded to the district court for a new trial.      I\n\nwrite separately because my view of the solution is somewhat\n\ndifferent from that of the majority.\n\n                                I.\n\n          In December 2001, Pacheco was indicted together with\n\ntwenty co-defendants on one count of conspiring to possess cocaine\n\nwith intent to distribute.5    He was tried separately from the\n\nothers.   At trial, the government presented evidence of a complex\n\noperation involving one kingpin, Rafael Yeje-Cabrera, and numerous\n\naides, underlings, couriers, and dealers.     Pacheco's alleged role\n\nwas that of a dealer.\n\n\n\n     5\n       The indictment read as follows:\n     From a date unknown to the Grand Jury, but from at least\n     on or about July 7, 2000, and continuing thereafter until\n     on or about December 20, 2001, at Westport, elsewhere in\n     the District of Massachusetts, in the District of New\n     York, in the District of Arizona, in the District of\n     Tennessee, and elsewhere,\n     [twenty named individuals and],\n     21. JASON PACHECO,\n     defendants herein, did knowingly and intentionally\n     combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with each other\n     and with other persons known and unknown to the Grand\n     Jury, to possess with intent to distribute, and to\n     distribute, more than 5 kilograms of cocaine, a Schedule\n     II controlled substance, in violation of Title 21, United\n     States Code, Section 841(a)(1).\n\n                               -23-\n\f              At   the   close   of   the   evidence,   Pacheco   moved   for   a\n\ndirected verdict, arguing that the prosecution had not carried its\n\nburden of proof.6        The district court denied the motion in part and\n\ngranted it in part, indicating that the government had shown, at\n\nmost, that Pacheco was a participant in a small \"spoke\" conspiracy,\n\nrather than part of the overarching \"hub\" conspiracy headed by\n\nYeje-Cabrera.7       The court's ruling on Pacheco's motion (\"the Rule\n\n29 order\") was entered on the docket.           The judge then submitted the\n\ncase to the jury without telling them anything about his ruling.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty, specifying on the verdict\n\nsheet that they attributed \"more than five kilograms of cocaine\" to\n\nPacheco.8\n\n                                        II.\n\n              On appeal, Pacheco argues that the district court's Rule\n\n29 order acquitted him, at least partially, of the charges against\n\nhim.       The judge's later submission of the case to the jury, the\n\n\n       6\n       The defendant's motion was originally made in written form\nand was entitled \"Motion for a Directed Verdict.\" As the majority\nnotes, the procedural device formerly termed a motion for directed\nverdict has been replaced with the motion for a judgment of\nacquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. The district court and the\nparties used the \"directed verdict\" language as well as referring\ndirectly to Rule 29.\n       7\n       Much evidence about the Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy, which was\nresponsible for hundreds of kilograms of cocaine, had been\nintroduced at trial; the evidence linking Pacheco to any cocaine\nwas much more limited.\n       8\n       The peculiar sequence of motions and orders that followed\nthe jury verdict is ably laid out in the majority opinion.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fargument continues, placed Pacheco in jeopardy for a crime of which\n\nhe had already been acquitted, in violation of the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause.9   We are thus called upon to determine whether and to what\n\ndegree the defendant's jeopardy ended when the district court\n\nentered its order.10   See Gonzalez v. Justices of the Mun. Ct., 382\n\nF.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2004), vacated, 125 S. Ct. 1640 (2005) (mem.),\n\nreinstated, 420 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 2005).      The majority concludes\n\nthat Pacheco's appeal fails because the district court's order did\n\nnot constitute an acquittal, and so the defendant's original\n\njeopardy was never terminated. I reach the same conclusion, but by\n\na different route from that taken by my colleagues.\n\n                                  A.\n\n           The question of how to characterize the district court's\n\norder \"is a difficult one and is probably not susceptible to an\n\nabstract answer unrelated to context.\"   United States v. Oreto, 37\n\nF.3d 739, 748 (1st Cir. 1994).     The majority opinion lists three\n\nreasons for its conclusion: (1) the district court denominated the\n\n\n\n     9\n       \"Subjecting the defendant to post-acquittal factfinding\nproceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\" Smith v. Massachusetts, 125 S. Ct. 1129, 1134\n(2005) (quoting Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140, 145 (1986)).\n     10\n        I note that the ruling was (a) made in response to the\ndefendant's written motion and after a hearing was held, (b)\ndiscussed by the court in the context of Rule 29, and (c) entered\non the docket on March 24, 2003. The fact that the ruling was made\nin response to a formal motion by the defendant is at odds with the\nmajority's characterization of the district court's order as a mere\n\"comment on evidentiary sufficiency.\"\n\n                                 -25-\n\forder as \"partial,\" (2) the court denied the defendant's concurrent\n\nmotion for a required finding of not guilty, and (3) after giving\n\nits order, the court then sent the case to the jury.               All three of\n\nthese reasons boil down to the same idea: the district court acted\n\nlike the order was not a complete acquittal as to the crime\n\ncharged, so there was no acquittal.                 I question at least two\n\naspects of this appraisal.\n\n             First, the fact that the judge sent the case to the jury,\n\nin particular, cannot logically be considered evidence that the\n\nRule    29   order   was   not   an    acquittal.      This   is   because   the\n\ndefendant's argument on appeal is that the act of sending the case\n\nto the jury, itself, constituted a Double Jeopardy violation,\n\nbecause that act followed an acquittal.              To say that because the\n\njudge submitted the defendant to post-order fact-finding by a jury,\n\ntherefore he did not acquit the defendant in the first place, is\n\ncircular reasoning.11\n\n             Second, the majority opinion implies, and I agree, that\n\nit would have been lawful, under the terms of this indictment, for\n\nthe jury to convict the defendant solely of participation in the\n\nsmaller \"spoke\" conspiracy.           See United States v. Miller, 471 U.S.\n\n\n       11\n       There is no doubt that the district court's actions in this\ncase were unusual and perplexing. An unusual turn of events in a\ntrial courtroom does not, of course, preclude a determination that\nthe events did not offend the Constitution.           Nor is the\nconstitutional violation mitigated just because the judge's order\nwas legally erroneous. See Samaria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54,\n64 (1978).\n\n                                       -26-\n\f130, 131 (1985) (upholding conviction \"based on trial proof that\n\nsupports only a significantly narrower and more limited, though\n\nincluded, fraudulent scheme\" than that alleged in the indictment).\n\nSee also United States v. North, 86 Fed. Apex. 427, 433 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (vacated on other grounds, 125 S. Ct. 1022 (2005)) (\"A\n\nperfect alignment between the indictment's charge and the offense\n\nconduct of conviction is not required. . . . as long as the trial\n\nproof corresponds to an offense which was clearly set out in the\n\nindictment.\") (citing Miller, 471 U.S. at 136); United States v.\n\nPartially, 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir. 1999) (approving of jury\n\ninstruction that limited duration of conspiracy to scheme narrower\n\nthan, but included within, scheme alleged in indictment).\n\n            I believe it is inconsistent to argue both that (1) the\n\ndefendant could have been convicted of either conspiracy and (2) it\n\nwas impossible for the district court to have granted a partial\n\nacquittal.   Moreover, \"[the appropriate inquiry is functional, not\n\nsemantic.    Thus, an inquiring court is duty bound to ascertain\n\n'whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,'\" counts as\n\nan acquittal for Double Jeopardy purposes.   Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at\n\n10 (quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564,\n\n571 (1977)). It is therefore inappropriate to rely on the district\n\ncourt's own descriptions of its action as dispositive of the import\n\nof that action.\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f                                  B.\n\n            My analysis of whether the Rule 29 order was an acquittal\n\nbegins with the definition of \"acquittal\" set out by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Martin Linen and recently restated in Smith.      The Court\n\nhas defined an acquittal, for Double Jeopardy purposes, to include\n\na court order that \"actually represents a resolution, correct or\n\nnot, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense\n\ncharged.\"    Smith, 125 S. Ct. at 1134 (quoting Martin Linen, 430\n\nU.S. at 571).   I do not think the district court's partial grant of\n\nthe defendant's motion for a directed verdict, despite the order's\n\nnomenclature and its invocation of Rule 29,12 meets this definition\n\nof acquittal.\n\n            It is evident from the discussion that took place at the\n\nhearing on Pacheco’s motion for a directed verdict that the judge\n\ndrew a distinction between a large \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-\n\nCabrera and a smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy that Pacheco was allegedly\n\ninvolved in.    The judge stated his belief that the prosecution had\n\nfailed to present sufficient evidence to prove Pacheco was a member\n\nof the overarching \"hub\" conspiracy.13    He also presumed that the\n\n\n     12\n       That rule states that \"the court on the defendant's motion\nmust enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the\nevidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 29. The district court evidently intended to act under Rule 29.\nThe judge stated, for example, \"I'm telling you under Rule 29 I'm\ndirecting down to the little [conspiracy].\"\n     13\n       Later, at the sentencing hearing, the judge reiterated, \"[At\ntrial I became satisfied . . . that you were not part of some\n\n                                 -28-\n\foverarching conspiracy could be eliminated from the picture while\n\nleaving the smaller conspiracy charge in place to be sent to the\n\njury.14\n\n               A criminal conspiracy is both defined and confined by the\n\nunlawful agreement at its heart.             See Brakeman v. United States,\n\n317 U.S. 49, 53 (1942); see also United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d\n\n855, 857 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[Conspiracy law, like most criminal law,\n\nfocuses upon the activities of an individual defendant.                   It is\n\ntherefore dangerous to think of a conspiracy as a kind of \"club\"\n\nthat one joins . . . . Instead, the gist of the conspiracy offense\n\nremains the agreement, and it is therefore essential to determine\n\nwhat    kind    of   agreement   or   understanding   existed   as   to    each\n\ndefendant.\") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\nPacheco was tried separately from the other defendants named in the\n\nindictment.       It was up to the jury to determine what sort of any\n\n\n\noverarching 260 kilogram conspiracy.             And that's why I gave the\npartial directed verdict.\"\n       14\n        That this was the judge's view is made clear from the\nfollowing statement made by the judge to the prosecutor:\n\n       THE COURT: Mr. Wilson [(defense counsel)] is not wrong\n       when he talks about conspiracies within conspiracies. On\n       [the government's] best evidence I think we have this.\n       Here is the, what I'll call the Cabrera conspiracy. On\n       your best evidence here's the Pacheco conspiracy. . . .\n       Now, the conspiracy for which Mr. Pacheco is liable, if\n       everything goes your way, is this [spoke] conspiracy.\n       That's what he's in on. . . . [Against his motion for\n       directed verdict that's the conspiracy you've proved.\n       You've proved no more. We're not having any more.\n\n                                      -29-\n\funlawful agreement, if any, Pacheco himself was guilty of making.\n\nAlthough not every conspiracy Pacheco might have participated in\n\nwas covered by the language of the indictment, that language was\n\nbroad enough to cover more than one possible agreement.\n\n            To my mind, the most apt characterization of the \"hub\"\n\nconspiracy and the \"spoke\" conspiracy is to describe them as two\n\ndifferent prosecution theories of the case.         The district court\n\ncould have, and probably intended to, take one of the two theories\n\noff the table for insufficient proof.15          Cf. United States v.\n\nO'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 479 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (describing how\n\ndistrict court ruled the evidence was insufficient to sustain one\n\nof   the   prosecution's   theories   of   the   case   and   accordingly\n\ninstructed the jury on only the remaining theory). It is perfectly\n\nplausible to read Martin Linen's requirement of \"a resolution,\n\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements\" to apply to\n\na discrete prosecutorial theory, as well as to an individual charge\n\nin the indictment.   In the present case, however, the court did not\n\n\n\n     15\n       The district court would also, of course, have been within\nits power to exclude irrelevant evidence (e.g. evidence not going\nto an unlawful agreement made by Pacheco himself) or to knock the\nindictment down to a lesser included charge if it found the\ngovernment had failed to prove the charged offense. See Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 31(c); Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 716-17\n(1989). However, that is not what happened here. The district\ncourt was not persuaded by defense counsel's argument that the\ngovernment had failed to prove the requisite five kilograms of\ncocaine. Counsel and the court discussed, but did not resolve, the\nquestion whether conspiracy to possess 500 grams of cocaine was a\nlesser included offense of the charged five-kilogram conspiracy.\n\n                                 -30-\n\fadequately distinguish the two theories, and the defendant did not\n\npoint us to anyplace in the record where the distinction was laid\n\nout, for us, on appeal, to be able to say that there was an\n\nacquittal on one of the theories.              Practically speaking, I cannot\n\nsee how we could send the case back for a new trial on the \"spoke\"\n\ntheory but not on the \"hub\" theory.             We simply do not know enough\n\nabout the difference between the two alleged conspiracies.\n\n                                        III.\n\n           In    my    view,   a   partial     acquittal     on   a   single-count\n\nindictment is a theoretically possible outcome.               It simply did not\n\nhappen   here.        However,     I   agree   with    the   majority    that   the\n\ntranspiration of events at Jason Pacheco's trial violated the\n\nrequirements of the Due Process Clause.               I therefore concur in the\n\njudgment of the court granting the defendant a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\f",

The district court, after granting a midtrial \"partial directed verdict\" on a single-count indictment, sent the case to the jury. Once a guilty verdict had been returned, the court entered a judgment of conviction and vacated the partial directed verdict. The defendant objects to this sequence of events on both double jeopardy and due process grounds. Although we reject the defendant's double jeopardy claim, we nonetheless hold that his right to a fair trial was compromised. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial on the original indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, viewed favorably to the government's theory of the case, would have allowed the jury to find that Rafael Yeje-Cabrera headed a mammoth drug-trafficking ring. The organization purveyed large quantities of cocaine and marijuana in and around southeastern Massachusetts. At some point, a lengthy federal investigation ensued. The probe reached a crescendo on December 8, 2001, when a tractor-trailer carrying 260 kilograms of cocaine accidentally backed into a state police cruiser. <i>See United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> 430 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2005) (outlining the contours of the overall investigation and describing the denouement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also could have found that defendant-appellant Jason Pacheco was a distributor for, and customer of, the organization. The government contended that he purchased cocaine from Yeje-Cabrera in increments up to one kilogram every few weeks for nearly two years and that he took part in other exchanges of money and drugs. During one incident highlighted by the government, a member of the drug ring \"re-rocked\" a kilogram of cocaine for the defendant and, acting at Yeje-Cabrera's direction, charged him a sharply discounted fee for this illicit service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence further showed that on December 13, 2001, a large cocaine transaction &#8212; involving all or some portion of a twenty-five kilogram cache &#8212; took place in the defendant's garage. Two cars arrived there around 5:30 p.m. The defendant indicated that he wanted the occupants \"to leave right away,\" and he himself went outside several minutes later and began pacing between his house and the street. Yeje-Cabrera arrived about an hour afterwards and, around 7:00 p.m., everyone left. Officers stopped one of the departing cars and a search revealed $50,000 in cash hidden in a secret compartment. Although the officers discovered no cocaine, a drug dog alerted to one area of the car. When law enforcement agents later procured a warrant and searched the defendant's premises, they found a large sum of cash but no drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted twenty-one individuals. The indictment contained four counts. Pacheco was named only in count 1, which charged him and the others with \"conspir[ing] . . . with each other and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, more than 5 kilograms of cocaine\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841 and 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of those accused, save six, pleaded guilty. One of the intransigent six died during the early stages of the proceedings. The defendant and the four remaining accused persons opted for trial. Because the court granted a severance, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, the defendant stood trial alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of the government's case in chief, which included the testimony of three cooperating witnesses who had themselves been named in the indictment, the defense took the position that the government had proved, at most, that the defendant was a member of a small, peripheral conspiracy (not the master Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy charged in the indictment). Accordingly, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that \"there [was] a prejudicial variance between the conduct alleged in the indictment and the proof offered at trial.\" The district court sensibly deferred ruling on the motion until the close of all the evidence. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant presented evidence and, after both sides had rested, the court purported to grant a partial directed verdict because, on the government's \"best evidence,\" the prosecution had proved only that the defendant was part of a small \"spoke\" conspiracy, not part of the large \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-Cabrera. As a result, no \"reasonably instructed jury could find . . . that he was in on a conspiracy to gain 260 kilograms\" of cocaine. At the same time, the court denied the defendant's companion motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its jury instructions, the district court did not mention its narrowing construction of the charge against the defendant but, rather, provided a generic conspiracy instruction and a special verdict slip requiring a finding on drug quantity. The defendant objected in vain to the mismatch between the instructions and the court's earlier ruling (but did not suggest the possibility of a double jeopardy violation). The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant seasonably moved for a new trial, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a), claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that the district court's jury instructions did not \"sufficiently distinguish the separate and particular conspiracy for which the defendant was charged from that of the overall `Yeje-Cabrera' conspiracy.\" On August 5, 2003, the district court, with the motion for a new trial still pending, sentenced the defendant to a twelve-year incarcerative term. The court stated that it would withhold the entry of judgment until it resolved the pending motion. Something went awry, however, and the clerk entered judgment on January 23, 2004. It was not until a month later that the court denied the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant immediately moved for reconsideration. The district court granted that motion and vacated its earlier order denying the new trial motion. At that time, the court tentatively concluded that its so-called partial directed verdict had created a variance between the indictment and the proof. The court also stated its belief \"that the [partial directed verdict] order was erroneously entered\" because the court had overlooked the government's evidence of the incident that transpired in the defendant's garage. The court announced that it was considering whether it could \"take . . . back\" that erroneous order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2004, the district court issued an omnibus opinion in which it resolved sundry issues concerning the defendant and certain of his alleged coconspirators (who had been tried separately). As to the defendant, the court concluded that the thought process underlying its partial directed verdict order introduced a fatal variance into the trial, which impaired the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See United States v. Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d 259, 335-37 (D.Mass.2004). However, the court then ruled that the partial directed verdict was in error because the jury had before it evidence from which it reasonably could have found that the defendant was a member of the master Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy. <i>See id.</i> at 337-38. The court went on to determine that the jury had not been influenced by the erroneous ruling and that, in all events, the defendant had \"waived any procedural argument that the Court [lacked the authority to] revisit the partial directed verdict order.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338. Consequently, the court vacated the so-called partial directed verdict, denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, and allowed the jury's verdict to stand. <i>Id.</i> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant mounts several challenges to his conviction and sentence, most of which (including assignments of error relating to the admission of evidence and aspects of the sentencing process) we need not reach. The centerpiece of his appeal is a claim that the sequence of events described above &#8212; the lower court's granting of the so-called partial directed verdict, its subsequent submission of the case to the jury, and its eventual rescission of its original ruling after the entry of judgment &#8212; violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. His fallback position is that the jury verdict cannot stand because the district court transgressed due process by denying him \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\" <i>California v. Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). To this, the defendant adds that the court constructively amended the indictment and/or created a material variance between the indictment and the proof, thus further prejudicing his rights. We first address the double jeopardy point and then turn to the fair trial issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Double Jeopardy.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment declares that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses three general protections: \"it shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either conviction or acquittal, and it also prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\" <i>United States v. Morris,</i> 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). In this instance, the defendant invokes the second protective branch; he claims that the district court's so-called partial directed verdict constituted an acquittal and that, therefore, the court unconstitutionally placed him in additional jeopardy both when it sent the case to the jury and when it vacated its earlier ruling after the entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When evaluating a double jeopardy claim, a reviewing court first must ask \"whether jeopardy attached in the original [trial] court proceeding.\" <i>Gonzalez v. Justices of the Mun. Ct.,</i> 382 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2004) (<i>Gonzalez I</i>), <i>vacated,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1640, 161 L.Ed.2d 474 (2005) (mem.), <i>reinstated,</i> 420 F.3d 5 (1st Cir.2005) (<i>Gonzalez II</i>). That query must be answered affirmatively here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a jury case, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn. <i>Serfass v. United States,</i> 420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975). The district court entered its so-called partial directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, long after jeopardy had attached. But \"the conclusion that jeopardy has attached begins, rather than ends, the inquiry.\" <i>Illinois v. Somerville,</i> 410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973). Thus, we must take a further step and ask \"whether the [trial] court terminated jeopardy in a way that prevents reprosecution.\" <i>Gonzalez I,</i> 382 F.3d at 8. We conclude that the defendant's claim fails to satisfy this requirement because we cannot say that the district court's so-called partial directed verdict was, \"in fact, a judgment of acquittal.\" <i>Smith v. Massachusetts,</i> 543 U.S. 462, 125 S.Ct. 1129, 1134, 160 L.Ed.2d 914 (2005). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that, for double jeopardy purposes, the finality accorded to jury verdicts of acquittal extends equally to judicially rendered judgments of acquittal. <i>See United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 564, 573, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). Withal, the question of what constitutes a \"judgment of acquittal\" is not governed either by the form of the trial judge's ruling or by his characterization of it. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 96, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978); <i>Martin Linen,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349. Rather, a reviewing court \"must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Martin Linen,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349; <i>see Gonzalez II,</i> 420 F.3d at 8-9. A resolution in the defendant's favor of a necessary factual element of the offense is a definitive determination that the defendant cannot be convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, confusion clouds any attempt to decipher the so-called partial directed verdict. First, the directed verdict device has been alien to federal criminal procedure for over half a century. Its function was usurped by the introduction of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (adopted Dec. 26, 1944). This does not much concern us; the adopted rule represents a \"change of nomenclature,\" not a modification of \"the nature of the motion.\" <i>Id.</i> advisory committee's note (1944). Thus, one possible way to understand the district court's partial directed verdict would be as a mislabeled judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the anatomy of the indictment belies that understanding. The indictment charged the defendant in only a single count, yet the district court deemed its order \"partial.\" It is surpassingly difficult to conceive, as a theoretical matter, of a judgment of acquittal on a one-count indictment that leaves a triable issue in its wake. If the order were to be read as a straightforward judgment of acquittal, there could be nothing \"partial\" about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to reconcile these anomalies, the parties offer two diametrically different characterizations of the partial directed verdict. Neither explanation is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on certain of the district court's statements at trial and its later characterizations of its actions, the defendant classifies the partial directed verdict as a ruling that \"the government had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Pacheco was a member of the `Cabrera conspiracy' charged [in the indictment],\" and, therefore, as a complete resolution of the single count at issue. We cannot accept this taxonomy. The partial directed verdict did not reflect a complete acquittal as to the charged conspiracy for at least three reasons. First, if that had been its purport, there is no earthly reason why it would have been denominated \"partial.\" Second, the court, in that event, would not concurrently have denied the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty. And, finally, it would then have been pointless to send the case to the jury (as the district court did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, the government insists that the so-called partial directed verdict was simply \"a way of limiting the quantity of cocaine attributable to Pacheco based on his . . . limited role within the Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy.\" This view assumes that the court entered the order as a result of conflating the issue of guilt and the issue of drug quantity. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[I]n a drug conspiracy case, the jury should determine . . . any facts about the conspiracy that will increase the possible penalty . . . beyond the default statutory maximum; and the judge should determine, at sentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each participant in the conspiracy.\" (footnote omitted)); <i>see also Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). But we think it highly unlikely that a seasoned judge would confuse these matters, and the judge's reasoning when he made the ruling indicates that he had placed the <i>Apprendi</i> issues to one side.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In addition, the court's post-ruling statements, while not controlling, do not in any way indicate a relationship between the partial directed verdict and drug quantity per se. <i>See Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 335-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the partial directed verdict was less than a complete acquittal (the defendant's position) but more than a ruling on drug quantity (the government's position). The district court's action falls somewhere in between those polar extremes. Exactly where is hard to tell because the court's order has a protean quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On one hand, the order may be viewed as an attempt to grant a partial acquittal, notwithstanding the topography of the indictment and the court's subsequent actions (e.g., its wide-ranging jury instructions). On the other hand &#8212; and perhaps more plausibly &#8212; the order may be viewed as an evidentiary comment &#8212; a limitation on the scope of the conspiracy that the court would allow the jury to consider. On that reading, the court may have been ruminating that the jury, if properly instructed, could not reasonably find that the defendant was a member of the larger \"hub\" conspiracy but could find that he was a member of the smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy. <i>Cf. United States v. Twitty,</i> 72 F.3d 228, 231 (1st Cir.1995) (noting, as to a larger charged conspiracy and a smaller proven conspiracy, that \"[s]o long as the statutory violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts found are somewhat different than those charged &#8212; so long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these rampant uncertainties, we are reluctant to say that the partial directed verdict &#8212; a shapeless, inherently ambiguous ruling made without any degree of formality &#8212; must be assumed to represent a resolution, correct or incorrect, of the offense charged rather than a provisional attempt &#8212; later abandoned &#8212; to narrow the scope of the facts that the jury could find in deciding whether to convict on the offense charged. Certainly, no case cited by the defendant treats so fuzzy a ruling as an acquittal, and what guidance we can glean counsels caution in expanding our understanding of an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes to include such a curious ukase. <i>Cf. Smith,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1136 (positing that the \"tentative\" nature of a midtrial sufficiency-of-the-evidence ruling would alter the double jeopardy calculus). To take a more aggressive view would make a double jeopardy defense available in any case in which a court succumbs to the urge to comment during trial about the sufficiency vel non of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the core purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause do not seem to be offended by a conservative approach to such inscrutable statements. Affording them a less-than-acquittal status does not arm the prosecution with an instrument of oppression, <i>see Martin Linen,</i> 430 U.S. at 569, 97 S.Ct. 1349, but, rather, serves to promote clarity and formality when a court undertakes to make a ruling of intended significance. In our judgment, these characteristics &#8212; clarity and some degree of formality &#8212; are very desirable in situations like the one presented here; an inscrutable comment on evidentiary sufficiency in a single-count case that thereafter moves forward without any consistent follow-up should not be enough to constitute an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not answer the double jeopardy question definitively. Here, the defendant forfeited his double jeopardy claim by failing to raise it at the time the case was submitted to the jury. Under the defendant's reasoning, predicated on his understanding that the partial directed verdict was a full acquittal, any double jeopardy violation would have matured by that time and should have been readily apparent. Even if the defendant viewed the partial directed verdict only as an acquittal on the \"hub\" conspiracy charge, the court's submission of that charge to the jury would have been foreclosed (and, therefore, should have prompted an objection based on double jeopardy). In either case, a double jeopardy claim should have been interposed while the trial court had an opportunity either to clarify the situation or to take corrective action. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[C]alling a looming error to the trial court's attention affords an opportunity to correct the problem before irreparable harm occurs.\"). Because the defendant failed in that regard &#8212; he did not advance a double jeopardy theory until well after the jury verdict had been returned &#8212; appellate review of the current claim is limited to plain error. <i>See United States v. Rivera,</i> 872 F.2d 507, 509 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed under plain error review, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Given the ambiguity that shrouds the district court's statements and the peculiar nature of its actions, the occurrence of a double jeopardy violation was neither clear nor obvious. Thus, any error surely was not plain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Fair Trial Considerations.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bare minimum, <i>see supra</i> Part III(A), the lower court's so-called partial directed verdict exemplified its decision to narrow the scope of the charge lodged against the defendant. After the court took that position, it was perfectly reasonable for the defendant to expect the court to instruct the jury only on the \"spoke\" conspiracy. The court did just the opposite; it gave a generic conspiracy instruction and made specific references to the \"hub\" conspiracy (e.g., \"the government claims that . . . Yeje-Cabrera . . . was the top supplier and . . . he had various people working with him . . . [and the defendant] would distribute [Yeje-Cabrera's cocaine]\"). The court also told the jury that \"[using] the garage . . . to store cocaine . . . would be facilitating the . . . conspiracy.\" By that allusion, the court could only have meant the \"hub\" conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the charge, defense counsel objected. As the basis for the objection, counsel cited the incongruity between the instructions as given and the court's earlier grant of a partial directed verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court declined to modify the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the jurors were not present when the court partially directed a verdict, nor were they informed of that ruling at any later time. This is potentially important because the district court, when it reversed its field, used the fact that the jury was never privy to the erroneous ruling as one reason why the \"rather generic jury charge regarding the law of conspiracy\" allowed the jurors to convict the defendant of membership in the \"hub\" conspiracy. <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 338. We find that reasoning problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the defendant suggests, it is possible to think of this situation in terms of either a material variance or a constructive amendment of the indictment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Glenn,</i> 828 F.2d 855, 858 (1st Cir.1987) (describing a variance, in the conspiracy context, as a \"showing that the government proved understandings or agreements different from those charged\" and explaining that a defendant can \"upset a conviction\" if prejudice results); <i>United States v. Dunn,</i> 758 F.2d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1985) (explaining that a constructive amendment, which embodies a material alteration of the charging terms of the indictment, whether literally or in effect, is regarded as prejudicial per se). Either of these routes, if successfully pursued, would at most earn the defendant a retrial, and there is a simpler, more direct route that leads to precisely the same result. As we see it, the district court abridged the defendant's right to a fair trial when, after ruling one way, it proceeded to act in a wholly inconsistent manner without any prior notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fair notice is one of the essentials in a trial, whether at the outset of the proceedings or at subsequent stages of the case. <i>See, e.g., Russell v. United States,</i> 369 U.S. 749, 760-64, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962). The concern with fairness (and, hence, with notice) is heightened in criminal cases. A serious and prejudicial infringement of the right to a fair trail can violate due process. <i>Cf. Neron v. Tierney,</i> 841 F.2d 1197, 1200 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The Due Process Clause guarantees a criminal defendant that his trial will comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Where, as here, a court makes a ruling that places a criminal defendant on notice of the parameters of the charge to be put to the jury and subsequently reneges on that commitment without forewarning the defendant, the court's error is serious and may well be prejudicial. <i>Cf. In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig.,</i> 167 F.3d 735, 737 n. 1 (1st Cir.1999) (disapproving of \"courts imposing rules of practice without some form of notice that would allow the parties and their counsel to conform their conduct accordingly\"). In this instance, prejudice is sufficiently likely to justify a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elaborate briefly. In announcing its partial directed verdict, the district court led the defendant to believe, at a minimum, that it was setting a course that would govern the remainder of the trial &#8212; only the \"spoke\" conspiracy would be put to the jury &#8212; and defense counsel was entitled to rely on that statement. The court, however, did not deliver on its implicit promise; it refused, despite a contemporaneous objection, to conform its jury instructions to its earlier statement. That action, undertaken without any notice whatever, offended fundamental fairness. <i>See Bae v. Peters,</i> 950 F.2d 469, 478 (7th Cir.1991) (acknowledging that a due process violation can occur if \"a last-minute change in the charge. . . prejudice[s] a defendant's opportunity to defend himself\"); <i>cf. Lee County Branch of the NAACP v. City of Opelika,</i> 748 F.2d 1473, 1480 n. 12 (11th Cir.1984) (observing that \"due process . . . mandate[s] that when the rules of the game are changed, the players must be afforded a full and fair opportunity to play by the new regulations\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having confirmed that an error of constitutional proportion occurred, we are confined in the remainder of our analysis by a special variant of the harmless error standard. Under that formulation, we must order a new trial unless the government, as the beneficiary of the error, can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <i>United States v. Flores,</i> 968 F.2d 1366, 1372 n. 7 (1st Cir.1992). This means that the government must convince us, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the guilty verdict in this case was unaffected by the district court's tergiversation. The government has not carried that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was at least arguably prejudiced by the court's actions in two ways. First, the transcript makes it abundantly clear that defense counsel shaped his summation around the narrower charge that the court had led him to believe would be put to the jury. That argument focused exclusively on the absence of credible evidence of the defendant's personal involvement with cocaine. The lawyer neither challenged the defendant's putative membership in the broader conspiracy nor addressed the concept of multiple conspiracies. Second, defense counsel never requested a multiple conspiracy instruction, even though the defendant, so long as the \"hub\" conspiracy remained in play, may well have been entitled to one. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d 230, 243 (1st Cir.1990) (\"If, on the evidence adduced at trial, a reasonable jury could find more than one . . . illicit agreement, or could find an agreement different from the one charged, a multiple conspiracy instruction is proper and should be given if requested.\"). We think it quite likely that, had counsel known that the court would reverse direction and permit the jury to mull the larger \"hub\" conspiracy, he would have pressed for such an instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the defendant tailored his summation and his requests for instructions to what the court had indicated would be the focal point of the jury deliberations. The court, however, pulled the rug out from under the defense when, without notice or an opportunity for cure, it reverted to a different, inconsistent focal point. Had defense counsel been forewarned, he could have made a much more forceful summation and, in all probability, received a more favorable charge (one that included a multiple conspiracy instruction). Given the disadvantages under which the court's error forced defense counsel to labor, we are not persuaded that, absent the error, the verdict would inevitably have been the same. The error, therefore, cannot be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although double jeopardy does not bar the further prosecution of this defendant on the conspiracy charged in count 1 of the indictment, an error occurred in the course of his trial. The claim of error was preserved and, under the applicable standard, the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the district court for a new trial. The so-called partial directed verdict is of no further force or effect and, therefore, the \"scope of the conspiracy\" issue remains open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> When making the partial directed verdict ruling, the court twice advised counsel to \"[f]orget Apprendi for the moment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We do not need to determine whether the difference between the \"hub\" conspiracy and the \"spoke\" conspiracy resulted in unfair prejudice. We include a reference to the variance analysis here, however, to illustrate that the partial directed verdict plausibly can be viewed as a ruling that contemplated limiting jury instructions which, if properly given, might have cured any possible prejudice<i>See, e.g., United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d 1103, 1115-16 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, even if a variance did occur, it did not result in prejudice to the defendant because the court gave a curative jury instruction).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As stated earlier, counsel did not interpose a double jeopardy claim at that point in the proceedings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The soundness of the so-called partial directed verdict is immaterial here. Whether or not the court's ruling was correct &#8212; a matter on which we take no view (although we note that the district court later said that its pronouncement was incorrect) &#8212; the dispositive considerations are that the defendant relied on it and that the court acted inconsistently with it</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with my colleagues in the majority that Jason Pacheco's trial for cocaine conspiracy was not conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Due Process Clause.

At trial, the government presented evidence of a complex operation involving one kingpin, Rafael Yeje-Cabrera, and numerous aides, underlings, couriers, and dealers. Pacheco's alleged role was that of a dealer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, Pacheco moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the prosecution had not carried its burden of proof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court denied the motion in part and granted it in part, indicating that the government had shown, at most, that Pacheco was a participant in a small \"spoke\" conspiracy, rather than part of the overarching \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-Cabrera.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The court's ruling on Pacheco's motion (\"the Rule 29 order\") was entered on the docket. The judge then submitted the case to the jury without telling them anything about his ruling. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, specifying on the verdict sheet that they attributed \"more than five kilograms of cocaine\" to Pacheco.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Pacheco argues that the district court's Rule 29 order acquitted him, at least partially, of the charges against him. The judge's later submission of the case to the jury, the argument continues, placed Pacheco in jeopardy for a crime of which he had already been acquitted, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We are thus called upon to determine whether and to what degree the defendant's jeopardy ended when the district court entered its order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See Gonzalez v. Justices of the Mun. Ct.,</i> 382 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2004), <i>vacated,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1640, 161 L.Ed.2d 474 (2005) (mem.), <i>reinstated,</i> 420 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 2005). The majority concludes that Pacheco's appeal fails because the district court's order did not constitute an acquittal, and so the defendant's original jeopardy was never terminated. I reach the same conclusion, but by a different route from that taken by my colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of how to characterize the district court's order \"is a difficult one and is probably not susceptible to an abstract answer unrelated to context.\" <i>United States v. Oreto,</i> 37 F.3d 739, 748 (1st Cir.1994). The majority opinion lists three reasons for its conclusion: (1) the district court denominated the order as \"partial,\" (2) the court denied the defendant's concurrent motion for a required finding of not guilty, and (3) after giving its order, the court then sent the case to the jury. All three of these reasons boil down to the same idea: the district court acted like the order was not a complete acquittal as to the crime charged, so there was no acquittal. I question at least two aspects of this appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the fact that the judge sent the case to the jury, in particular, cannot logically be considered evidence that the Rule 29 order was not an acquittal. This is because the defendant's argument on appeal is that the act of sending the case to the jury, itself, constituted a Double Jeopardy violation, because that act <i>followed</i> an acquittal. To say that <i>because</i> the judge submitted the defendant to post-order fact-finding by a jury, <i>therefore</i> he did not acquit the defendant in the first place, is circular reasoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority opinion implies, and I agree, that it would have been lawful, under the terms of this indictment, for the jury to convict the defendant solely of participation in the smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy. <i>See United States v. Miller,</i> 471 U.S. 130, 131, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985) (upholding conviction \"based on trial proof that supports only a significantly narrower and more limited, though included, fraudulent scheme\" than that alleged in the indictment). <i>See also United States v. North,</i> 86 Fed.Appx. 427, 433 (1st Cir.2004) (<i>vacated on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1022, 160 L.Ed.2d 994 (2005)) (\"A perfect alignment between the indictment's charge and the offense conduct of conviction is not required . . . . as long as the trial proof corresponds to an offense which was clearly set out in the indictment.\") (citing <i>Miller,</i> 471 U.S. at 136, 105 S.Ct. 1811); <i>United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir.1999) (approving of jury instruction that limited duration of conspiracy to scheme narrower than, but included within, scheme alleged in indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe it is inconsistent to argue both that (1) the defendant could have been convicted of either conspiracy and (2) it was impossible for the district court to have granted a partial acquittal. Moreover, \"[t]he appropriate inquiry is functional, not semantic. Thus, an inquiring court is duty bound to ascertain `whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,'\" counts as an acquittal for Double Jeopardy purposes. <i>Gonzalez,</i> 382 F.3d at 10 (quoting <i>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977)). It is therefore inappropriate to rely on the district court's own descriptions of its action as dispositive of the import of that action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My analysis of whether the Rule 29 order was an acquittal begins with the definition of \"acquittal\" set out by the Supreme Court in <i>Martin Linen</i> and recently restated in <i>Smith.</i> The Court has defined an acquittal, for Double Jeopardy purposes, to include a court order that \"actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Smith,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1134 (quoting <i>Martin Linen,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349). I do not think the district court's partial grant of the defendant's motion for a directed verdict, despite the order's nomenclature and its invocation of Rule 29,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> meets this definition of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the discussion that took place at the hearing on Pacheco's motion for a directed verdict that the judge drew a distinction between a large \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-Cabrera and a smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy that Pacheco was allegedly involved in. The judge stated his belief that the prosecution had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove Pacheco was a member of the overarching \"hub\" conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> He also presumed that the overarching conspiracy could be eliminated from the picture while leaving the smaller conspiracy charge in place to be sent to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal conspiracy is both defined and confined by the unlawful agreement at its heart. <i>See Braverman v. United States,</i> 317 U.S. 49, 53, 63 S.Ct. 99, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942); <i>see also United States v. Glenn,</i> 828 F.2d 855, 857 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[C]onspiracy law, like most criminal law, focuses upon the activities of an individual defendant. It is therefore dangerous to think of a conspiracy as a kind of \"club\" that one joins. . . . Instead, the gist of the conspiracy offense remains the agreement, and it is therefore essential to determine what kind of agreement or understanding existed as to each defendant.\") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Pacheco was tried separately from the other defendants named in the indictment. It was up to the jury to determine what sort of any unlawful agreement, if any, <i>Pacheco himself</i> was guilty of making. Although not every conspiracy Pacheco might have participated in was covered by the language of the indictment, that language was broad enough to cover more than one possible agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To my mind, the most apt characterization of the \"hub\" conspiracy and the \"spoke\" conspiracy is to describe them as two different prosecution theories of the case. The district court could have, and probably intended to, take one of the two theories off the table for insufficient proof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>Cf. United States v. O'Shea,</i> 426 F.3d 475, 479 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005) (describing how district court ruled the evidence was insufficient to sustain one of the prosecution's theories of the case and accordingly instructed the jury on only the remaining theory). It is perfectly plausible to read <i>Martin Linen</i>'s requirement of \"a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements\" to apply to a discrete prosecutorial theory, as well as to an individual charge in the indictment. In the present case, however, the court did not adequately distinguish the two theories, and the defendant did not point us to anyplace in the record where the distinction was laid out, for us, on appeal, to be able to say that there was an acquittal on one of the theories. Practically speaking, I cannot see how we could send the case back for a new trial on the \"spoke\" theory but not on the \"hub\" theory.

The district court, after granting a midtrial \"partial directed verdict\" on a single-count indictment, sent the case to the jury. Once a guilty verdict had been returned, the court entered a judgment of conviction and vacated the partial directed verdict. The defendant objects to this sequence of events on both double jeopardy and due process grounds. Although we reject the defendant's double jeopardy claim, we nonetheless hold that his right to a fair trial was compromised. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial on the original indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, viewed favorably to the government's theory of the case, would have allowed the jury to find that Rafael Yeje-Cabrera headed a mammoth drug-trafficking ring. The organization purveyed large quantities of cocaine and marijuana in and around southeastern Massachusetts. At some point, a lengthy federal investigation ensued. The probe reached a crescendo on December 8, 2001, when a tractor-trailer carrying 260 kilograms of cocaine accidentally backed into a state police cruiser. <i>See United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201905\"><a href=\"/opinion/201905/united-states-v-yeje-cabrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.2005) (outlining the contours of the overall investigation and describing the denouement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also could have found that defendant-appellant Jason Pacheco was a distributor for, and customer of, the organization. The government contended that he purchased cocaine from Yeje-Cabrera in increments up to one kilogram every few weeks for nearly two years and that he took part in other exchanges of money and drugs. During one incident highlighted by the government, a member of the drug ring \"re-rocked\" a kilogram of cocaine for the defendant and, acting at Yeje-Cabrera's direction, charged him a sharply discounted fee for this illicit service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence further showed that on December 13, 2001, a large cocaine transaction &#8212; involving all or some portion of a twenty-five kilogram cache &#8212; took place in the defendant's garage. Two cars arrived there around 5:30 p.m. The defendant indicated that he wanted the occupants \"to leave right away,\" and he himself went outside several minutes later and began pacing between his house and the street. Yeje-Cabrera arrived about an hour afterwards and, around 7:00 p.m., everyone left. Officers stopped one of the departing cars and a search revealed $50,000 in cash hidden in a secret compartment. Although the officers discovered no cocaine, a drug dog alerted to one area of the car. When law enforcement agents later procured a warrant and searched the defendant's premises, they found a large sum of cash but no drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted twenty-one individuals. The indictment contained four counts. Pacheco was named only in count 1, which charged him and the others with \"conspir[ing] . . . with each other and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, more than 5 kilograms of cocaine\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841 and 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of those accused, save six, pleaded guilty. One of the intransigent six died during the early stages of the proceedings. The defendant and the four remaining accused persons opted for trial. Because the court granted a severance, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, the defendant stood trial alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of the government's case in chief, which included the testimony of three cooperating witnesses who had themselves been named in the indictment, the defense took the position that the government had proved, at most, that the defendant was a member of a small, peripheral conspiracy (not the master Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy charged in the indictment). Accordingly, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that \"there [was] a prejudicial variance between the conduct alleged in the indictment and the proof offered at trial.\" The district court sensibly deferred ruling on the motion until the close of all the evidence. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant presented evidence and, after both sides had rested, the court purported to grant a partial directed verdict because, on the government's \"best evidence,\" the prosecution had proved only that the defendant was part of a small \"spoke\" conspiracy, not part of the large \"hub\" conspiracy headed by Yeje-Cabrera. As a result, no \"reasonably instructed jury could find . . . that he was in on a conspiracy to gain 260 kilograms\" of cocaine. At the same time, the court denied the defendant's companion motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its jury instructions, the district court did not mention its narrowing construction of the charge against the defendant but, rather, provided a generic conspiracy instruction and a special verdict slip requiring a finding on drug quantity. The defendant objected in vain to the mismatch between the instructions and the court's earlier ruling (but did not suggest the possibility of a double jeopardy violation). The jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant seasonably moved for a new trial, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a), claiming, insofar as is relevant here, that the district court's jury instructions did not \"sufficiently distinguish the separate and particular conspiracy for which the defendant was charged from that of the overall `Yeje-Cabrera' conspiracy.\" On August 5, 2003, the district court, with the motion for a new trial still pending, sentenced the defendant to a twelve-year incarcerative term. The court stated that it would withhold the entry of judgment until it resolved the pending motion. Something went awry, however, and the clerk entered judgment on January 23, 2004. It was not until a month later that the court denied the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant immediately moved for reconsideration. The district court granted that motion and vacated its earlier order denying the new trial motion. At that time, the court tentatively concluded that its so-called partial directed verdict had created a variance between the indictment and the proof. The court also stated its belief \"that the [partial directed verdict] order was erroneously entered\" because the court had overlooked the government's evidence of the incident that transpired in the defendant's garage. The court announced that it was considering whether it could \"take . . . back\" that erroneous order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 2004, the district court issued an omnibus opinion in which it resolved sundry issues concerning the defendant and certain of his alleged coconspirators (who had been tried separately). As to the defendant, the court concluded that the thought process underlying its partial directed verdict order introduced a fatal variance into the trial, which impaired the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See United States v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568795/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 335-37 (D.Mass.2004). However, the court then ruled that the partial directed verdict was in error because the jury had before it evidence from which it reasonably could have found that the defendant was a member of the master Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy. <i>See id.</i> at 337-38. The court went on to determine that the jury had not been influenced by the erroneous ruling and that, in all events, the defendant had \"waived any procedural argument that the Court [lacked the authority to] revisit the partial directed verdict order.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338. Consequently, the court vacated the so-called partial directed verdict, denied the defendant's motion for a new trial, and allowed the jury's verdict to stand. <i>Id.</i> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant mounts several challenges to his conviction and sentence, most of which (including assignments of error relating to the admission of evidence and aspects of the sentencing process) we need not reach. The centerpiece of his appeal is a claim that the sequence of events described above &#8212; the lower court's granting of the so-called partial directed verdict, its subsequent submission of the case to the jury, and its eventual rescission of its original ruling after the entry of judgment &#8212; violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. His fallback position is that the jury verdict cannot stand because the district court transgressed due process by denying him \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\" <i>California v.

To this, the defendant adds that the court constructively amended the indictment and/or created a material variance between the indictment and the proof, thus further prejudicing his rights.

In this instance, the defendant invokes the second protective branch; he claims that the district court's so-called partial directed verdict constituted an acquittal and that, therefore, the court unconstitutionally placed him in additional jeopardy both when it sent the case to the jury and when it vacated its earlier ruling after the entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When evaluating a double jeopardy claim, a reviewing court first must ask \"whether jeopardy attached in the original [trial] court proceeding.\" <i>Gonzalez v.

A resolution in the defendant's favor of a necessary factual element of the offense is a definitive determination that the defendant cannot be convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, confusion clouds any attempt to decipher the so-called partial directed verdict. First, the directed verdict device has been alien to federal criminal procedure for over half a century. Its function was usurped by the introduction of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 (adopted Dec. 26, 1944). This does not much concern us; the adopted rule represents a \"change of nomenclature,\" not a modification of \"the nature of the motion.\" <i>Id.</i> advisory committee's note (1944). Thus, one possible way to understand the district court's partial directed verdict would be as a mislabeled judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the anatomy of the indictment belies that understanding. The indictment charged the defendant in only a single count, yet the district court deemed its order \"partial.\" It is surpassingly difficult to conceive, as a theoretical matter, of a judgment of acquittal on a one-count indictment that leaves a triable issue in its wake. If the order were to be read as a straightforward judgment of acquittal, there could be nothing \"partial\" about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to reconcile these anomalies, the parties offer two diametrically different characterizations of the partial directed verdict. Neither explanation is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on certain of the district court's statements at trial and its later characterizations of its actions, the defendant classifies the partial directed verdict as a ruling that \"the government had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Pacheco was a member of the `Cabrera conspiracy' charged [in the indictment],\" and, therefore, as a complete resolution of the single count at issue. We cannot accept this taxonomy. The partial directed verdict did not reflect a complete acquittal as to the charged conspiracy for at least three reasons. First, if that had been its purport, there is no earthly reason why it would have been denominated \"partial.\" Second, the court, in that event, would not concurrently have denied the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty. And, finally, it would then have been pointless to send the case to the jury (as the district court did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, the government insists that the so-called partial directed verdict was simply \"a way of limiting the quantity of cocaine attributable to Pacheco based on his . . . limited role within the Yeje-Cabrera conspiracy.\" This view assumes that the court entered the order as a result of conflating the issue of guilt and the issue of drug quantity. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 42-43 (1st Cir.2002) (\"[I]n a drug conspiracy case, the jury should determine . . . any facts about the conspiracy that will increase the possible penalty . . . beyond the default statutory maximum; and the judge should determine, at sentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each participant in the conspiracy.\" (footnote omitted)); <i>see also Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). But we think it highly unlikely that a seasoned judge would confuse these matters, and the judge's reasoning when he made the ruling indicates that he had placed the <i>Apprendi</i> issues to one side.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In addition, the court's post-ruling statements, while not controlling, do not in any way indicate a relationship between the partial directed verdict and drug quantity per se. <i>See Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 335-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the partial directed verdict was less than a complete acquittal (the defendant's position) but more than a ruling on drug quantity (the government's position). The district court's action falls somewhere in between those polar extremes. Exactly where is hard to tell because the court's order has a protean quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On one hand, the order may be viewed as an attempt to grant a partial acquittal, notwithstanding the topography of the indictment and the court's subsequent actions (e.g., its wide-ranging jury instructions). On the other hand &#8212; and perhaps more plausibly &#8212; the order may be viewed as an evidentiary comment &#8212; a limitation on the scope of the conspiracy that the court would allow the jury to consider. On that reading, the court may have been ruminating that the jury, if properly instructed, could not reasonably find that the defendant was a member of the larger \"hub\" conspiracy but could find that he was a member of the smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy. <i>Cf. United States v. Twitty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196496\"><a href=\"/opinion/196496/united-states-v-twitty/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 231 (1st Cir.1995) (noting, as to a larger charged conspiracy and a smaller proven conspiracy, that \"[s]o long as the statutory violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts found are somewhat different than those charged &#8212; so long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these rampant uncertainties, we are reluctant to say that the partial directed verdict &#8212; a shapeless, inherently ambiguous ruling made without any degree of formality &#8212; must be assumed to represent a resolution, correct or incorrect, of the offense charged rather than a provisional attempt &#8212; later abandoned &#8212; to narrow the scope of the facts that the jury could find in deciding whether to convict on the offense charged. Certainly, no case cited by the defendant treats so fuzzy a ruling as an acquittal, and what guidance we can glean counsels caution in expanding our understanding of an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes to include such a curious ukase. <i>Cf. Smith,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1136 (positing that the \"tentative\" nature of a midtrial sufficiency-of-the-evidence ruling would alter the double jeopardy calculus). To take a more aggressive view would make a double jeopardy defense available in any case in which a court succumbs to the urge to comment during trial about the sufficiency vel non of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the core purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause do not seem to be offended by a conservative approach to such inscrutable statements. Affording them a less-than-acquittal status does not arm the prosecution with an instrument of oppression, <i>see Martin Linen,</i> 430 U.S. at 569, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109631\"><a href=\"/opinion/109631/united-states-v-martin-linen-supply-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span>, but, rather, serves to promote clarity and formality when a court undertakes to make a ruling of intended significance. In our judgment, these characteristics &#8212; clarity and some degree of formality &#8212; are very desirable in situations like the one presented here; an inscrutable comment on evidentiary sufficiency in a single-count case that thereafter moves forward without any consistent follow-up should not be enough to constitute an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not answer the double jeopardy question definitively. Here, the defendant forfeited his double jeopardy claim by failing to raise it at the time the case was submitted to the jury. Under the defendant's reasoning, predicated on his understanding that the partial directed verdict was a full acquittal, any double jeopardy violation would have matured by that time and should have been readily apparent. Even if the defendant viewed the partial directed verdict only as an acquittal on the \"hub\" conspiracy charge, the court's submission of that charge to the jury would have been foreclosed (and, therefore, should have prompted an objection based on double jeopardy). In either case, a double jeopardy claim should have been interposed while the trial court had an opportunity either to clarify the situation or to take corrective action. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[C]alling a looming error to the trial court's attention affords an opportunity to correct the problem before irreparable harm occurs.\"). Because the defendant failed in that regard &#8212; he did not advance a double jeopardy theory until well after the jury verdict had been returned &#8212; appellate review of the current claim is limited to plain error. <i>See United States v. Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521533\"><a href=\"/opinion/521533/united-states-v-ramon-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 509 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed under plain error review, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Given the ambiguity that shrouds the district court's statements and the peculiar nature of its actions, the occurrence of a double jeopardy violation was neither clear nor obvious. Thus, any error surely was not plain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Fair Trial Considerations.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a bare minimum, <i>see supra</i> Part III(A), the lower court's so-called partial directed verdict exemplified its decision to narrow the scope of the charge lodged against the defendant. After the court took that position, it was perfectly reasonable for the defendant to expect the court to instruct the jury only on the \"spoke\" conspiracy. The court did just the opposite; it gave a generic conspiracy instruction and made specific references to the \"hub\" conspiracy (e.g., \"the government claims that . . . Yeje-Cabrera . . . was the top supplier and . . . he had various people working with him . . . [and the defendant] would distribute [Yeje-Cabrera's cocaine]\"). The court also told the jury that \"[using] the garage . . . to store cocaine . . . would be facilitating the . . . conspiracy.\" By that allusion, the court could only have meant the \"hub\" conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the charge, defense counsel objected. As the basis for the objection, counsel cited the incongruity between the instructions as given and the court's earlier grant of a partial directed verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court declined to modify the instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the jurors were not present when the court partially directed a verdict, nor were they informed of that ruling at any later time. This is potentially important because the district court, when it reversed its field, used the fact that the jury was never privy to the erroneous ruling as one reason why the \"rather generic jury charge regarding the law of conspiracy\" allowed the jurors to convict the defendant of membership in the \"hub\" conspiracy. <i>Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d at 338. We find that reasoning problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the defendant suggests, it is possible to think of this situation in terms of either a material variance or a constructive amendment of the indictment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Glenn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494122\"><a href=\"/opinion/494122/united-states-v-kenneth-robert-glenn-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span>, 858 (1st Cir.1987) (describing a variance, in the conspiracy context, as a \"showing that the government proved understandings or agreements different from those charged\" and explaining that a defendant can \"upset a conviction\" if prejudice results); <i>United States v. Dunn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449678\"><a href=\"/opinion/449678/united-states-v-john-f-dunn-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 1985) (explaining that a constructive amendment, which embodies a material alteration of the charging terms of the indictment, whether literally or in effect, is regarded as prejudicial per se). Either of these routes, if successfully pursued, would at most earn the defendant a retrial, and there is a simpler, more direct route that leads to precisely the same result. As we see it, the district court abridged the defendant's right to a fair trial when, after ruling one way, it proceeded to act in a wholly inconsistent manner without any prior notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fair notice is one of the essentials in a trial, whether at the outset of the proceedings or at subsequent stages of the case. <i>See, e.g., Russell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106407\"><a href=\"/opinion/106407/russell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 760-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106407\"><a href=\"/opinion/106407/russell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span> (1962). The concern with fairness (and, hence, with notice) is heightened in criminal cases. A serious and prejudicial infringement of the right to a fair trail can violate due process. <i>Cf. Neron v. Tierney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503069\"><a href=\"/opinion/503069/louis-neron-v-james-e-tierney-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1200 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The Due Process Clause guarantees a criminal defendant that his trial will comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Where, as here, a court makes a ruling that places a criminal defendant on notice of the parameters of the charge to be put to the jury and subsequently reneges on that commitment without forewarning the defendant, the court's error is serious and may well be prejudicial. <i>Cf. In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198332\"><a href=\"/opinion/198332/weisburgh-v-fidelity-magellan/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 737 n. 1 (1st Cir.1999) (disapproving of \"courts imposing rules of practice without some form of notice that would allow the parties and their counsel to conform their conduct accordingly\"). In this instance, prejudice is sufficiently likely to justify a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elaborate briefly. In announcing its partial directed verdict, the district court led the defendant to believe, at a minimum, that it was setting a course that would govern the remainder of the trial &#8212; only the \"spoke\" conspiracy would be put to the jury &#8212; and defense counsel was entitled to rely on that statement. The court, however, did not deliver on its implicit promise; it refused, despite a contemporaneous objection, to conform its jury instructions to its earlier statement. That action, undertaken without any notice whatever, offended fundamental fairness. <i>See Bae v. Peters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572727\"><a href=\"/opinion/572727/jang-han-bae-v-howard-peters-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 478 (7th Cir.1991) (acknowledging that a due process violation can occur if \"a last-minute change in the charge. . . prejudice[s] a defendant's opportunity to defend himself\"); <i>cf. Lee County Branch of the NAACP v.

This means that the government must convince us, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the guilty verdict in this case was unaffected by the district court's tergiversation. The government has not carried that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was at least arguably prejudiced by the court's actions in two ways. First, the transcript makes it abundantly clear that defense counsel shaped his summation around the narrower charge that the court had led him to believe would be put to the jury. That argument focused exclusively on the absence of credible evidence of the defendant's personal involvement with cocaine. The lawyer neither challenged the defendant's putative membership in the broader conspiracy nor addressed the concept of multiple conspiracies. Second, defense counsel never requested a multiple conspiracy instruction, even though the defendant, so long as the \"hub\" conspiracy remained in play, may well have been entitled to one. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Boylan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir.1990) (\"If, on the evidence adduced at trial, a reasonable jury could find more than one . . . illicit agreement, or could find an agreement different from the one charged, a multiple conspiracy instruction is proper and should be given if requested.\"). We think it quite likely that, had counsel known that the court would reverse direction and permit the jury to mull the larger \"hub\" conspiracy, he would have pressed for such an instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the defendant tailored his summation and his requests for instructions to what the court had indicated would be the focal point of the jury deliberations. The court, however, pulled the rug out from under the defense when, without notice or an opportunity for cure, it reverted to a different, inconsistent focal point. Had defense counsel been forewarned, he could have made a much more forceful summation and, in all probability, received a more favorable charge (one that included a multiple conspiracy instruction). Given the disadvantages under which the court's error forced defense counsel to labor, we are not persuaded that, absent the error, the verdict would inevitably have been the same. The error, therefore, cannot be deemed harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

The majority opinion lists three reasons for its conclusion: (1) the district court denominated the order as \"partial,\" (2) the court denied the defendant's concurrent motion for a required finding of not guilty, and (3) after giving its order, the court then sent the case to the jury. All three of these reasons boil down to the same idea: the district court acted like the order was not a complete acquittal as to the crime charged, so there was no acquittal.

This is because the defendant's argument on appeal is that the act of sending the case to the jury, itself, constituted a Double Jeopardy violation, because that act <i>followed</i> an acquittal. To say that <i>because</i> the judge submitted the defendant to post-order fact-finding by a jury, <i>therefore</i> he did not acquit the defendant in the first place, is circular reasoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority opinion implies, and I agree, that it would have been lawful, under the terms of this indictment, for the jury to convict the defendant solely of participation in the smaller \"spoke\" conspiracy. <i>See United States v.

Pacheco was tried separately from the other defendants named in the indictment.

It is perfectly plausible to read <i>Martin Linen</i>'s requirement of \"a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements\" to apply to a discrete prosecutorial theory, as well as to an individual charge in the indictment. In the present case, however, the court did not adequately distinguish the two theories, and the defendant did not point us to anyplace in the record where the distinction was laid out, for us, on appeal, to be able to say that there was an acquittal on one of the theories. Practically speaking, I cannot see how we could send the case back for a new trial on the \"spoke\" theory but not on the \"hub\" theory.

The district court was not persuaded by defense counsel's argument that the government had failed to prove the requisite five kilograms of cocaine.
