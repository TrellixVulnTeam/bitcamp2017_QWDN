A federal statute bars employment\n\nin the Executive Branch of citizens and resident aliens who were\n\nrequired to register for the draft with the Selective Service\n\nSystem and who \"knowingly and willfully\" did not do so before age\n\ntwenty-six.   In the district court, four plaintiffs, who are male\n\nUnited States citizens over age twenty-six, sought to challenge\n\nthis statutory bar on constitutional grounds, failed on the merits,\n\nand now appeal.\n\n          The statutory bar reads as follows:\n\n          An individual--\n\n                  (1) who was born after December 31,\n                  1959, and is or was required to\n                  register under section 3 of the\n                  Military Selective Service Act (50\n                  U.S.C. App. 453); and\n\n                  (2) who is not so registered or\n                  knowingly and willfully did not so\n                  register   before   the  requirement\n                  terminated or became inapplicable to\n                  the individual,\n\n          shall be ineligible for appointment      to   a\n          position in an Executive agency.\n\n5 U.S.C. § 3328(a) (2006).1   Section 3 of the Military Selective\n\nService Act, 62 Stat. 604, 605, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. § 453\n\n(2006), empowers the President to require every male citizen and\n\nmale resident alien between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six to\n\n\n\n     1\n      \"Executive agency\" is defined to mean an \"Executive\ndepartment,   a  Government  corporation, and an independent\nestablishment.\" 5 U.S.C. § 105.\n\n                                -2-\n\fregister for the draft. In 1980, President Carter reinstituted the\n\nregistration requirements for young men.          Proclamation No. 4771,\n\n3 C.F.R. 82 (1981), reprinted as amended in 50 U.S.C. app. § 453\n\napp. at 59-60.\n\n          The Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), which manages\n\ncivil service employment in the Executive Branch, has adopted\n\ncorresponding regulations. 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707 (2010). These\n\nregulations provide that a civil service employee who was required\n\nto register\n\n          will be terminated by his agency under the\n          authority of the statute and these regulations\n          if he has not registered as required, unless\n          he registers or unless, if no longer eligible\n          to register, OPM determines in response to his\n          explanation that his failure to register was\n          neither knowing nor willful.\n\nId. § 300.707.\n\n          Three of the plaintiffs in this case were discharged by\n\ntheir federal agencies when it was discovered that they had not\n\nregistered although required to do so; the fourth resigned when\n\nconfronted    with   his   failure   to    register   and   says   that   his\n\nresignation was forced by the statutory bar.            None of the four\n\npresently challenges the premise that his failure to register was\n\nknowing or willful, and none sought to pursue to the end the\n\nstatutory remedies prescribed for civil service employees who\n\ndispute their removals.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f              Instead, the plaintiffs brought an original action in the\n\ndistrict      court   seeking       reinstatement    and   claiming   that    the\n\nstatutory bar is unconstitutional; the grounds asserted are that it\n\nis both a forbidden bill of attainder under Article I, Section 9,\n\nClause 3 of the Constitution and, because it applies to men but not\n\nwomen,   an    unlawful      discrimination     under   the   equal   protection\n\ncomponent of the Fifth Amendment.               The latter claim has already\n\nbeen rejected by the Supreme Court, Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S.\n\n57 (1981), but the plaintiffs may intend to ask the Court to\n\nrevisit the ruling.\n\n              In the district court, the government asserted that the\n\nclaims were barred because the plaintiffs had a statutory route to\n\ndispute their removals or forced resignation and that this route\n\nwas intended by Congress to be exclusive for cases covered by the\n\nstatutory remedy.          This statutory remedy, which will be described\n\nin more detail hereafter, ordinarily leads through the Merit\n\nSystems Protection Board (\"MSPB\" or \"Board\") and, on judicial\n\nreview, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nThree of the four plaintiffs did not pursue this avenue; one did\n\nbut   abandoned       it    after    an    adverse   decision    by   the    MSPB\n\nadministrative law judge.\n\n              The district court declined to dismiss the action on\n\njurisdictional grounds, initially sided with the plaintiffs on the\n\nbill of attainder issue, and ultimately reversed ground and decided\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fagainst the plaintiffs on their constitutional claims.                    Elgin v.\n\nUnited States, 594 F. Supp. 2d 133 (D. Mass. 2009), vacated, 697\n\nF. Supp. 2d 187 (D. Mass. 2010).          The plaintiffs now seek review in\n\nthis    court;    the    government    continues     to   argue    both   that   the\n\ndistrict court had no jurisdiction and that, if it did, the\n\nstatutory bar is constitutional.              An objection to subject matter\n\njurisdiction takes priority, and we begin (and end) with that\n\nissue.\n\n             Ordinarily, and as a default remedy, a district court has\n\nauthority as a federal court of general jurisdiction--subject to\n\nvarious limitations--to consider claims against federal government\n\nofficials that they are acting unconstitutionally and should be\n\nenjoined.        See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2006); Larson v. Domestic &\n\nForeign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 701-02 (1949). Suits against\n\nthe federal government itself or its departments--the plaintiffs'\n\ntarget here--are complicated by sovereign immunity considerations,\n\nsee, e.g., FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994), but the\n\ngovernment has invoked no such defense in this case, see 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 702; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668 (1974).\n\n             Instead, the government argues the exclusive remedy for\n\nthe    removal    or    forced   resignation    of    the   four    plaintiffs   is\n\nprovided by the Civil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), Pub. L. No. 95-\n\n454,    92   Stat.     1111   (1978)   (codified     as   amended    in   scattered\n\nsections of 5 U.S.C.).           The CSRA scheme, set forth in Title 5,\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fChapter 75, Subchapter II and augmented by regulations, allows\n\ncertain employees in the civil service--including those (such as\n\nthe plaintiffs) in the competitive service--to seek review if they\n\nare removed \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the\n\nservice,\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a); the route prescribed is by appeal to\n\nthe MSPB and, if dissatisfied with the result, appeal to the\n\nFederal Circuit, whose decisions in turn are reviewable by the\n\nSupreme Court.2\n\n           Although the CSRA does not in terms describe this scheme\n\nas exclusive of other remedies, Congress intended the scheme--at\n\nleast where it applies and provides a mechanism for administrative\n\nand   judicial   review   and   relief--to   be   exclusive   of   ordinary\n\ndistrict court actions to challenge a removal.         The Supreme Court\n\nhas suggested that this is so, United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S.\n\n439, 443-55 (1988); see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 388-89\n\n(1983); we have recognized it to be so, Berrios v. Dep't of the\n\nArmy, 884 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1989); and the legislative history\n\nbears out this intention, S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 9-10, 53, 63\n\n(1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2731-32, 2775, 2785.\n\n           The plaintiffs do not contest the view that the statutory\n\nroute, where it applies, is the exclusive remedy for an employee\n\n\n      2\n      See 5 U.S.C. §§ 7511-7514, 7701-7703; 5 C.F.R. §§ 752.401-\n.406, 1201.3, 1201.120.        The remedy extends to \"forced\nresignations\"--the claim made by one of the plaintiffs here--which\nare treated as constructive \"removals.\" See Carrow v. MSPB, 626\nF.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fchallenging removal; but they argue that the government has taken\n\ninconsistent positions and that, in any event, for various reasons\n\nthe statutory remedy is not available to them.                 However, the\n\nstatutory route does in fact give the plaintiffs a route to direct\n\nreview of their constitutional claims by an Article III court;\n\nCongress intended that route to be exclusive in removal cases; and,\n\ndespite some confusion in the precedents, both literal language and\n\nCongress' policy require that result.\n\n           First,    the   plaintiffs   suggest   that   the    government's\n\nobjection is foreclosed because (a) it resisted efforts by one of\n\nthe plaintiffs to raise this very kind of claim through the MSPB\n\nroute, and (b) it has raised the subject matter jurisdiction claim\n\nonly on reconsideration in the district court.           But, as it turns\n\nout, the government is within its rights to raise the objection:\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction claims are not waivable and may be\n\nraised for the first time even on direct appeal, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(h)(3); United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).\n\n           Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a waivable\n\nobjection.   Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Eng. Inc., 603 F.3d\n\n71, 85 (1st Cir. 2010).       But, if the CSRA remedy is available and\n\nintended to be exclusive, it does not prescribe some administrative\n\nstep required before resorting to district court, e.g., Woodford v.\n\nNgo, 548 U.S. 81, 88-89 (2006); rather, the remedy displaces the\n\nplenary   district    court    action   entirely,   just   as    a   statute\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fchanneling agency review to a circuit court displaces a direct\n\nreview action in the district court.                See Whitman v. Dep't of\n\nTransp., 547 U.S. 512, 513-14 (2006) (per curiam).\n\n           Second, the remedy in Chapter 75, Subchapter II applies\n\nto removals \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the\n\nservice,\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a), and the question arises whether\n\nremoval on account of the statutory bar falls in that category.\n\nArguing   that    section     7513(a)    is   limited    to    misconduct,     the\n\nplaintiffs cite Supreme Court language stating that \"Chapter 75 of\n\nthe Act governs adverse action taken against employees for the\n\n'efficiency of the service,' which includes action of the type\n\ntaken   here,    based   on   misconduct,\"     Fausto,    484    U.S.    at    446.\n\nHowever, \"includes\" does not mean \"limited to.\"\n\n           The    CSRA   is   a   successor    to    earlier     civil    service\n\nstatutes, including the Lloyd-La Follette Act, which created the\n\nfirst general statutory protection for civil servants, see Arnett\n\nv.   Kennedy,    416   U.S.   134,   149-50   (1974),    and    used     the   same\n\n\"efficiency of [the] service\" phrase as the substantive standard\n\nfor removal, see Act of Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 389, § 6, 37 Stat. 539,\n\n555 (repealed 1978).          That standard was understood to include\n\nremovals that were based on disqualifying conditions that existed\n\nbefore the employees were hired, and Congress was aware of and\n\nintended to adopt this interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Thus, prior to the CSRA's enactment, the Senate Committee\n\non Governmental Affairs noted that for covered civil service\n\nemployees, \"existing law provides that an individual may be removed\n\nonly for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\"\n\nS. Rep. No. 95-969, at 9 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n2723, 2731.       The committee reported that in 1976, 17,157 federal\n\nemployees had been dismissed under that standard, and it listed\n\neight different categories, including 240 \"[r]emoved because of\n\nsome condition that existed before they were hired.\"                           Id.     In\n\nrecommending section 7513, the committee said that it did not\n\nintend any substantive change to the existing law permitting\n\nremovals    only    for   \"efficiency         of    the   service.\"      Id.    at   50,\n\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2772.\n\n            OPM shares this view of the \"efficiency of the service\"\n\nstandard.     In a related part, 5 C.F.R. pt. 731, OPM regulations\n\ndiscuss the standard for a \"suitability action,\" including a\n\n\"removal,\"    5    C.F.R.      §   731.203;    the    regulations     state     that    a\n\nsuitability action may be taken only to \"protect the integrity or\n\npromote the efficiency of the service,\" id. § 731.201, which\n\nincludes \"[a]ny statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the\n\nlawful   employment       of   the    person       involved   in   the   position      in\n\nquestion,\" id. § 731.202(b)(8).               See also id. § 731.501(a) (right\n\nto appeal suitability action to the MSPB).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f            Third, the plaintiffs question whether the removals in\n\nthis case were intended as removals for the \"efficiency of the\n\nservice.\"    The removal notices, it appears, cited the statutory\n\nbar, 5 U.S.C. § 3328--not Chapter 75, Subchapter II and the\n\n\"efficiency of the service\" phrase--but the legislative history and\n\nregulations make clear that a removal because of a statutory bar is\n\none for the \"efficiency of the service,\" thereby triggering the\n\nopportunity--and obligation--to use the MSPB procedures and to seek\n\njudicial review in the Federal Circuit.\n\n            The plaintiffs' contrary suggestion rests on a misreading\n\nof Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).   There, the\n\nCourt relied on the ground given in a removal notice to conclude\n\nthat the action was taken under the \"efficiency of the service\"\n\nstandard and not on grounds of national security.       Id. at 522 &\n\nn.4, 523.   A national security removal is explicitly exempted from\n\nall \"other statutes\" and review is narrowly limited.        5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 7532; see id. § 7512(A) (exempting a section 7532 removal); Egan,\n\n484 U.S. at 525-26. Here, no such statutory exemption applies, and\n\nthe notice merely particularizes the \"efficiency of the service\"\n\nbasis for the removal.\n\n            Fourth, the MSPB has suggested that a person who was\n\nwrongly hired in the face of an absolute statutory bar was never an\n\n\"employee\" at all because the appointment was void ab initio, and\n\ntherefore, when the error is discovered, the person removed is not\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fa former \"employee\" who can invoke the CSRA.      E.g., Hope v. Dep't\n\nof the Army, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (2008) (citing cases).                 This\n\n\"reasoning,\" see Travaglini v. Dep't of Educ., 18 M.S.P.R. 127,\n\n132-37 (1983), aff'd as modified, 23 M.S.P.R. 417 (1984), underlies\n\nstatements by the Board, occasionally noted but not endorsed by the\n\nFederal Circuit,3 that a removal because of an absolute statutory\n\nbar is outside the Board's authority under the CSRA because the\n\nemployee should not have been hired in the first place.\n\n            This is not the approach taken by modern courts in\n\nconstruing   remedial   statutes,   and   the   government   should    be\n\nembarrassed ever to have taken advantage of such question begging\n\nrhetoric.    The plaintiffs in this case were hired by the federal\n\ngovernment, served (in some cases for many years) as its employees,\n\nexercised official authority, and were then terminated.       The idea\n\nthat Congress would implicitly exclude them from the category of\n\nformer \"employees\" entitled to seek redress under the CSRA--if and\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In Diamond v. U.S. Agency for International Development, 108\nF.3d 312 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the Federal Circuit mentioned the MSPB\nassertion, without passing on its validity, saying only that it did\nnot apply to the case at hand. Id. at 316. In Daneshpayeh v.\nDepartment of the Air Force, No. 93-3476, 1994 WL 18964 (Fed. Cir.\nJan. 26, 1994) (per curiam)--an unpublished, non-precedential\ndecision, see Fed. Cir. R. 32.1, 36--the Federal Circuit affirmed\nan MSPB decision dismissing an appeal based on the supposed rule,\nbut the court noted that the removed person took \"no issue with the\nBoard's recital of the applicable law\" id. at *2, and suggested\ndoubts as to the \"Board's boiler-plate labeling of its decision as\nbased on a 'lack of jurisdiction,'\" id. at *2 n.4.\n\n                                -11-\n\fto the extent that their removal was outside a statutory bar or\n\nthat the bar was itself unconstitutional--beggars belief.\n\n            The CSRA governs \"removals\"; nothing in its language\n\nsuggests that a case involving a statutory bar follows a different\n\nroute; and the legislative history already described refutes any\n\nsuch suggestion.         Of course, if the employee comes within the\n\nstatutory    bar   and    the   statutory    bar    is    constitutional,        the\n\ndischarged employee will not get reinstated; but the proper outcome\n\nshould be a decision denying reinstatement on the merits.                   Thus,\n\nthe statutory route gives the plaintiff a full opportunity to\n\npresent both questions to the Federal Circuit, which is an Article\n\nIII court.\n\n            Fifth, this brings us at last to the question whether\n\nthere is some implied exception to the exclusive CSRA remedy\n\nbecause the challenge in this case is a constitutional one sounding\n\nin equity or because it is a facial constitutional attack rather\n\nthan an \"as-applied\" challenge.             The Supreme Court has already\n\nruled that Bivens-type constitutional claims for damages cannot\n\nbypass   CSRA   limitations,     Lucas,     462    U.S.   at   368;   and   as    to\n\nequitable constitutional claims, there is something of a circuit\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fsplit,4 but this circuit has been firm in treating the CSRA remedy\n\nas exclusive as to equitable constitutional claims as well.\n\n            Thus, this court held in Berrios that an employee fired\n\nby the government could not bring a due process claim and other\n\nfacial and as-applied constitutional claims by an original action\n\nin the district court but had to follow the CSRA scheme through the\n\nMSPB into the Federal Circuit.       884 F.2d at 31.      Another decision\n\nin   this    circuit   reaffirmed   the    general    rule   but    found   it\n\ninapplicable because the employee's classification excluded him\n\nfrom the CSRA remedy.       Pathak v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 274\n\nF.3d 28, 31-33 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Irizarry v. United States,\n\n427 F.3d 76, 77-78 (1st Cir. 2005).        None of our cases has adopted\n\nthe distinction urged nor does it have any obvious basis in policy.\n\n            Constitutional    claims   are   common    in    administrative\n\nproceedings--especially equal protection and procedural due process\n\nclaims--and are part of the ordinary fodder of review in discharge\n\ncases.      Often such claims are made along with factual claims\n\ndenying the conduct alleged against the employee and statutory or\n\nrule-based    claims   as   well.    Congress'   desire      to    consolidate\n\nemployee removal in a single forum was based on the action taken\n\n\n     4\n      Compare Dotson v. Griesa, 398 F.3d 156, 179-82 (2d Cir.\n2005), and Lombardi v. Small Bus. Admin., 889 F.2d 961-62 (10th\nCir. 1989), with Mitchum v. Hurt, 73 F.3d 30, 35-36 (3d Cir. 1996),\nand Hubbard v. EPA, 809 F.2d 1, 11 & n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1986), vacated\nin part on other grounds, Spagnola v. Mathis, 859 F.2d 223 (D.C.\nCir. 1988) (en banc) (per curiam).      The Supreme Court has not\nresolved the question. Whitman, 547 U.S. at 513-14.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fagainst the employee rather than the precise arguments made in\n\ncontesting that action.\n\n           What matters in the end is whether the CSRA process can\n\nafford relief.    The plaintiffs argue that a facial claim attacking\n\nthe underlying statute is one for which the MSPB cannot grant\n\nrelief to them and therefore the premise--that the CSRA remedy is\n\nexclusive where it applies--does not itself apply.             And to show\n\nthat there is no MSPB remedy, the plaintiffs point to statements by\n\nthe MSPB itself that it, \"as an administrative agency, is without\n\nauthority to determine the constitutionality of Federal statutes.\"\n\nBayly v. OPM, 42 M.S.P.R. 524, 525-26 (1990).5\n\n           But while the Board may be powerless to strike down the\n\nstatute, the Federal Circuit on review of the Board may do so,\n\n5 U.S.C. § 7703(c), and, if it agreed with the plaintiffs on the\n\nmerits, remand to the Board to grant relief.           See Shalala v. Ill.\n\nCouncil on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 23-24 (2000); Thunder\n\nBasin Coal Co., 510 U.S. at 215.     Accordingly, the CSRA regime does\n\nprovide   an   opportunity   for   the    plaintiffs   to   obtain   a   full\n\ndetermination of their facial constitutional challenge.              Indeed,\n\neven if the MSPB had the first word on the constitutional issue, it\n\ncertainly would not have the last.\n\n\n     5\n      This self-denying ordinance, distinguishing this subset of\nconstitutional challenges from all others, is widely repeated in\nthe case law, e.g., Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 109 (1977),\nalthough it is \"not mandatory,\" Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich,\n510 U.S. 200, 215 (1994).\n\n                                   -14-\n\f          Plaintiffs object that the Federal Circuit has regularly\n\nsaid that its jurisdiction is coextensive with that of the MSPB as\n\nto the categories of cases that fall within the CSRA.    E.g., Rosano\n\nv. Dep't of the Navy, 699 F.2d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1983).     That\n\nproposition happens to be true as a general statement, but it was\n\nnot made by the Federal Circuit in our context and would make no\n\nsense if it were: for in such cases the MSPB is limited only\n\nbecause of a doctrine that uniquely applies to administrative\n\nagencies and not to the Federal Circuit or any other Article III\n\ncourt.\n\n          The Federal Circuit has never said that it was powerless\n\nto act where a removal occurred and the underlying statute that\n\nprompted the removal was itself unconstitutional. On the contrary,\n\nthat court has said that if a colorable constitutional claim were\n\npresented, it would have to address the issue.      See Riggin v.\n\nOffice of Senate Fair Emp't Practices, 61 F.3d 1563, 1570 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1995) (discussing Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988));\n\nBrockmann v. Dep't of the Air Force, 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1994) (same).   And if it mistakenly held otherwise, the remedy\n\nwould be on certiorari to the Supreme Court.\n\n          The substantive constitutional claims in this case are\n\nunpromising, given that one conflicts with governing Supreme Court\n\nprecedent and the other ignores the fact that the plaintiffs were\n\nfree to avoid the bar by timely registration.           But the CSRA\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fchannels removals covered by the CSRA--and thus the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims--to the Federal Circuit, see Hall v. United States, 617 F.3d\n\n1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2010); that principle serves an important\n\npurpose; the CSRA provides a remedy for a meritorious facial\n\nchallenge; and plaintiffs were obliged to use it.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\ncase remanded for entry of a new judgment denying relief for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction and without prejudice to the pursuit\n\nof remedies under the CSRA to the extent that they may be available\n\nat this late date.   Each side shall bear its owns costs on this\n\nappeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                  --Concurring Opinion Follows--\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge, concurring.                I concur in the\n\nultimate result of this case, but not in the route taken in\n\nreaching it. I would find jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims, but hold that they fail as a matter of law.\n\n                            I.    Jurisdiction\n\n           The majority reaches a reasoned conclusion, but I believe\n\nit falls short in considering fully the question of whether there\n\nis an applicable exception to the CSRA's preclusive effect.               To be\n\nsure, the majority disposes of the plaintiffs' arguments regarding\n\nconstitutional       challenges    generally       and      facial      attacks\n\nspecifically.    It does not, however, take head-on the issue of\n\nwhether federal district court jurisdiction remains intact if the\n\nCSRA does not afford meaningful review to the plaintiffs' colorable\n\nconstitutional claims that sound in equity.6             Because I find that\n\nthe plaintiffs' claims would be unreviewable under the CSRA's\n\nremedial   scheme,    I   would   hold     that   federal    district    court\n\njurisdiction exists, just as our sister circuits have done in\n\ncomparable cases.     See Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps. Local 1 v. Stone,\n\n502 F.3d 1027, 1034-39 (9th Cir. 2007); Mitchum v. Hurt, 73 F.3d\n\n30, 34-36 (3d Cir. 1995); Hubbard v.

Mathis,\n\n859 F.2d 223 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc) (per curiam).\n\n          As set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \"district courts shall\n\nhave original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the\n\nConstitution,    laws,    or   treaties      of   the   United   States.\"      The\n\nplaintiffs' claims arise under the Constitution, namely, the Bill\n\nof Attainder Clause in Article I, Section 9, and the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, which implicitly guarantees equal\n\nprotection.    See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).                The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the CSRA divested the federal district\n\ncourt of its jurisdiction conferred by § 1331.                   See Whitman v.\n\nDep't of Transp., 547 U.S. 512, 514 (2006).\n\n          As explained by the majority, Congress enacted the CSRA\n\nin 1978 as a means to \"'comprehensively overhaul[] the civil\n\nservice system.'\"        United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 443\n\n(1988) (quoting Lindahl v. OPM, 470 U.S. 768, 773 (1985)).                   Prior\n\nto the CSRA, different employees were afforded different processes\n\nof review upon an adverse employment action, resulting in both\n\nfederal court and administrative appeals with \"wide variations\"\n\namong decisions.     Id. at 444-45.          Congress sought to streamline\n\nthese varied decisions by funneling federal employee personnel\n\nactions through the CSRA's administrative process.                Id. at 445.\n\n          Although the CSRA does not explicitly prohibit plenary\n\nactions   in    federal    district    court,       the   Supreme    Court     has\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\finterpreted the statute to have far-reaching preclusive effect. In\n\nBush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983), it held that a federal-employee\n\nplaintiff whose demotion allegedly violated the Constitution could\n\nnot sue for damages, even though, assuming the violation occurred,\n\nhis remedies under the CSRA would not fully compensate him for the\n\nharm he suffered.      Five years later, in United States v. Fausto,\n\n484 U.S. 439, it found that the CSRA prevented a plaintiff from\n\ninitiating suit in federal court for statutory and regulatory\n\nviolations,     even    though   the      plaintiff   was     afforded     no\n\nadministrative review under the statute.\n\n           Despite this line of precedent, the Supreme Court has\n\nconsistently found exceptions to the foreclosure of judicial review\n\nfor colorable constitutional claims sounding in equity, absent\n\nclear congressional intent to the contrary.            The same year it\n\ndecided Fausto, it also decided Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592\n\n(1988),   in   which   a   plaintiff    sought   equitable    relief     when\n\nchallenging    on   both   statutory   and   constitutional   grounds     his\n\ntermination from the CIA due to his homosexuality. The Court found\n\nthe statutory claims unreviewable, but it rejected the government's\n\nargument that the constitutional claims were as well, holding:\n\n           [W]here Congress intends to preclude judicial\n           review of constitutional claims its intent to\n           do so must be clear. . . . We require this\n           heightened showing in part to avoid the\n           \"serious constitutional question\" that would\n           arise if a federal statute were construed to\n           deny any judicial forum for a colorable\n           constitutional claim.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f486 U.S. at 603 (quoting Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians,\n\n476 U.S. 667, 681 n.12 (1986)); see also McNary v. Haitian Refugee\n\nCtr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991) (finding federal question\n\njurisdiction for plaintiffs' constitutional challenges despite\n\ncomprehensive     immigration    statute     due   to     lack   of   meaningful\n\njudicial review under statute and absence of clear congressional\n\nlanguage mandating preclusion); Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361,\n\n373-74 (1974) (holding that statute prohibiting judicial review of\n\ndecisions by the administrator of Veterans Affairs did not provide\n\n\"the   'clear   and   convincing'     evidence     of    congressional    intent\n\nrequired by this Court before a statute will be construed to\n\nrestrict   access     to   judicial   review\"    of     constitutional    claims\n\n(quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967))).\n\n           Because I find that the CSRA's remedial scheme does not\n\nafford   the    plaintiffs    meaningful     review      of   their   colorable\n\nconstitutional claims for equitable relief, I would hold that the\n\nstatute does not bar the present action and the plaintiffs may seek\n\nrelief in federal district court.\n\n           The MSPB is a creation of statute, and its jurisdiction\n\nis limited.     See 5 U.S.C. § 7701(a).      Notwithstanding the question\n\nof whether the MSPB has the power to rule on constitutional issues,\n\nsee Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 215 (1994), it\n\nis undisputed by the parties that the MSPB cannot adjudicate claims\n\npremised on removals due to an \"absolute statutory prohibition\" to\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fappointment.       See, e.g., Hope v. Dep't of the Army, 108 M.S.P.R. 6,\n\n9 (2008); Lovoy v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 94 M.S.P.R. 571,\n\n586 (2003); Daneshpayeh v.

The   MSPB\n\nconsistently dismisses appeals related to terminations pursuant to\n\n§ 3328 on these grounds, a position the government regularly\n\nadvances before the Board and on which it succeeded in the MSPB\n\nappeal by Mr. Elgin, a plaintiff in this matter.             E.g., Charner v.\n\nOPM, No. PH-3443-08-0601-I-2, 2009 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 1296, at *10-11\n\n(Mar. 6, 2009) (unpublished); Whitfield v. Dep't of Interior, No.\n\nDC-0752-09-0094-I-1, 2008 M.S.P.B.

See, e.g., Whitfield, 2008 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 6910, at *1;\n\nClarke v. OPM, No. DA-3443-07-0538-I-1, 2007 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 7101,\n\nat *1 n.1 (Dec. 17, 2007) (unpublished); Belmares-Avalos v.

Moreover, the regulations promulgated by OPM\n\nare entitled \"Statutory Bar to Appointment of Persons Who Fail to\n\nRegister   Under   Selective   Service   Law,\"   and   they   state   that\n\nadministrative review beyond OPM's determination is prohibited.          5\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707; id. at .706(c).7\n\n\n     7\n      The majority states that, to the extent that the MSPB would\nhave found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs'\nclaims because the plaintiffs were terminated pursuant to an\nabsolute statutory prohibition to appointment, the MSPB would be\nwrong because the doctrine has never been endorsed by the Federal\nCircuit and is illogical. I believe that the majority oversteps in\nreaching this conclusion.     First, as cited above, the MSPB\nroutinely holds that it cannot hear appeals contesting removals\nbased on absolute statutory prohibitions to appointment, and this\nprecedent appears firmly established.\n\n      Second, the Federal Circuit has hardly indicated any error in\nthe Board's finding. In Diamond v. U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment, 108 F.3d 312 (Fed. Cir. 1997), it cited with approval\nTravaglini v. Department of Education, 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132 (1983),\none of the leading cases to discuss the doctrine, although it did\nnot apply the doctrine to the case at hand.      In Daneshpayeh v.\nDepartment of the Air Force, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 14360, an\nunreported and non-precedential opinion, the Federal Circuit\naffirmed the MSPB's decision that the Board could not grant relief\nto a federal employee terminated pursuant to an absolute statutory\nprohibition to appointment.    Although the court indicated in a\nfootnote that it may have been incorrect for the MSPB to term this\nholding \"jurisdictional,\" it still found that the Board could not\ngrant relief because the employee's appointment was illegal. It is\n\n                                 -22-\n\f             Because the MSPB has routinely stated that it lacks\n\njurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims on the merits, it\n\nappears to me that the Federal Circuit is without jurisdiction to\n\ndo so as well. The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is derivative of\n\nthe MSPB's jurisdiction, and it is problematic whether the Federal\n\nCircuit has the ability to decide matters beyond that of the Board.\n\nSee Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1991) (\"Since the MSPB had no jurisdiction, the merits of Perez's\n\nchallenge . . . were not before the MSPB for decision; nor are they\n\nbefore us.\"); Carroll v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 703 F.2d\n\n1388, 1390 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (\"'[W]ith respect to cases brought\n\nunder   [5   U.S.C.   §]   7701,   the   scope   of    the   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction of this court is identical to the scope of the\n\njurisdiction of the Board.'\" (quoting Rosano v. Dep't of the Navy,\n\n699 F.2d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1983))).\n\n             The majority places great faith in its presumption that\n\nthe Federal Circuit would either find the MSPB competent to review\n\nthe plaintiffs' claims and remand for a decision on the merits, or\n\nthat it would look beyond its own jurisdictional constraints to\n\nreach the constitutional issues itself.             The evidence to support\n\nthese   assertions,    however,    is    elusive.      First,   although   no\n\n\nimmaterial whether an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment\nis \"jurisdictional\" or simply precludes review; under either\ncircumstance, the Board is unable to hear the merits of a\nplaintiff's claim.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fplaintiff, in this suit or others, who was removed under § 3328 has\n\never sought Federal Circuit review of the MSPB's decision to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the case law and regulations\n\ncited above suggest that such efforts would be futile.                    Time and\n\nagain the MSPB has dismissed these cases, claiming that it is\n\nunable to grant relief, and an appeal to the Federal Circuit seems\n\nalmost certain to result in a simple affirmance.                See Daneshpayeh,\n\n1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 14360.\n\n            Second, the Federal Circuit has never reached beyond the\n\nlimits of the MSPB to hear the merits of a claim otherwise barred\n\nfrom   review.     In   only   one   instance      has   it   hypothesized     the\n\npossibility, and never before has it acted on the idea.                        See\n\nBrockmann v. Dep't of the Air Force, 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1994) (acknowledging Supreme Court precedent supporting review of\n\ncolorable   constitutional      claims      otherwise    barred,    but    finding\n\nprecedent inapplicable because plaintiffs' claims unreviewable by\n\nthe MSPB were not colorable). Indeed, when the Federal Circuit did\n\nconfront    a    plaintiff     covered       by   the    CSRA     who     asserted\n\nconstitutional claims that were beyond MSPB review, it affirmed the\n\ndismissal   of   his    suit   for   lack    of   jurisdiction,     rather    than\n\nproviding a forum for his constitutional claims.

Cir. 2009) (unpublished).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fSuch case law provides little comfort that the plaintiffs in this\n\nmatter would fare any better.8\n\n           To be sure, administrative boards have been declared\n\ncompetent to review constitutional issues otherwise perhaps beyond\n\ntheir scope.    See Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long-Term Care, Inc.,\n\n529 U.S. 1, 20-24 (2000) (interpreting Medicare statute to provide\n\nadministrative review of constitutional claims); Riggin v. Office\n\nof Senate Fair Emp't Practices, 61 F.3d 1563, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1995)\n\n(finding administrative board competent to review constitutional\n\ndue   process      claim).      In   these     instances,     however,     the\n\nadministrative      schemes   at   issue    expressly     precluded   federal\n\ndistrict   court    jurisdiction,    and,    therefore,    would   leave   the\n\nconstitutional claims without any forum were the boards unable to\n\nreview them.    See Shalala, 529 U.S. at 5, 8, 10 (finding Medicare\n\nAct to prohibit expressly federal-question jurisdiction); Riggin,\n\n61 F.3d at 1570 (finding Government Employee Rights Act to prohibit\n\nexpressly the commencement of judicial proceedings).\n\n\n      8\n      The majority suggests that were the Federal Circuit not to\naddress a colorable constitutional claim, the remedy would be on\ncertiorari to the Supreme Court and not via a plenary federal\ndistrict court action. I disagree with the majority because the\ndoctrine obliging review of constitutional claims is relevant only\nwhen review is otherwise unavailable. Here, it appears that review\nunder the CSRA's administrative scheme is foreclosed, and so I do\nnot see why the federal district court is not the proper forum to\nreview the claims. Indeed, the several circuits that have invoked\nthis doctrine in the context of the CSRA have done so despite the\nFederal Circuit's ostensible ability to do the same. See Stone,\n502 F.3d at 1034-39; Mitchum, 73 F.3d at 34-36; Hubbard, 809 F.2d\nat 11-12.\n\n                                     -25-\n\f                  The CSRA contains no such clear prohibition of original\n\nfederal court actions.           Chapter 75 of the CSRA allows an agency to\n\nremove an employee \"only for such cause as will promote the\n\nefficiency of the service,\" and upon such action, the employee \"is\n\nentitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"                          5\n\nU.S.C.       §    7513(a),    (d).      Nowhere     does   the    statute    indicate\n\nexplicitly that a plaintiff may not challenge his termination by\n\nraising colorable constitutional claims in federal court.9\n\n                  Our sister courts in the Ninth, Third, and D.C. Circuits\n\nhave       held    similarly    and     allowed    federal    employees     to   bring\n\nconstitutional claims in district court actions seeking equitable\n\nrelief.          See Stone, 502 F.3d at 1034-39 (holding CSRA did not\n\npreclude          judicial     review     of      plaintiffs'     First     Amendment\n\nconstitutional claims for equitable relief when plaintiffs had no\n\nremedy under the statute); Mitchum, 73 F.3d at 34-36 (finding CSRA\n\nand comparable statutes did not preclude federal district court\n\nreview of plaintiffs' constitutional claims for injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief because CSRA not sufficiently clear to restrict\n\nfederal          power   to   grant   equitable      relief     for   constitutional\n\nviolations); Hubbard, 809 F.2d at 11-12 & n.15 (holding federal\n\n\n       9\n      To the extent that the majority opinion suggests that the\nplaintiffs' claims are not colorable, I disagree.

In Berrios, the\nplaintiff was afforded and took advantage of available CSRA\nremedies, and so the rationale for district court jurisdiction\nwould not apply.

The CSRA does not meet this\n\nstandard.     I would then find that the plaintiffs' claims are\n\nafforded no meaningful review under the CSRA and, therefore, their\n\nclaims are reviewable in federal district court.\n\n                             II. The Merits\n\n            Having   found   jurisdiction,    I   would   dismiss   the\n\nplaintiffs' claims on the merits.\n\nA. Bill of Attainder\n\n            The plaintiffs assert that § 3328 is an unconstitutional\n\nbill of attainder since it legislatively punishes men age twenty-\n\nsix and older who failed to and can no longer register with the\n\nSelective Service System because it prohibits their employment with\n\nan executive agency.    They assert that the statute satisfies the\n\n\n     12\n      Indeed, in Pathak we acknowledged that, despite the CSRA's\nexpansive reach, we might have jurisdiction to review the\nplaintiffs claims, were they colorable. 274 F.3d at 33.\n\n                                  -29-\n\frequirements of a bill of attainder by identifying a class of men\n\nbased on immutable past conduct and operating as a punishment\n\nwithout trial.      I disagree.\n\n               Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the United States\n\nConstitution reads: \"No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law\n\nshall be passed.\" With this clause the Framers \"sought to prohibit\n\nthe ancient practice of the Parliament in England of punishing\n\nwithout    trial    'specifically    designated    persons   or   groups.'\"\n\nSelective Serv. Sys. v. Minn. Pub. Interest Research Grp., 468 U.S.\n\n841, 847 (1984) (quoting United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 447\n\n(1965)).       The constitutional provision safeguards the notion of\n\nseparation of powers by protecting against trial by legislature.\n\nBrown, 381 U.S. at 442. Historically, bills of attainder were acts\n\nsentencing to death one or more specific persons, although the\n\nSupreme Court has read the clause to also outlaw what were known as\n\nbills     of    pains   and   penalties,   which   imposed   less   severe\n\npunishments.      Id. at   441; Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.)\n\n277, 323 (1867).        Targeted parties were typically those \"who had\n\nattempted, or threatened to attempt, to overthrow the government.\"\n\nBrown, 381 U.S. at 441.\n\n               The Supreme Court has struck down statutes on bill of\n\nattainder grounds only five times in the nation's history.             See\n\nCummings, 71 U.S. 277 (targeting Confederate sympathizers); Ex\n\nparte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1867) (same); Pierce v.\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fCarskadon, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 234 (1873) (same); United States v.\n\nLovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946) (targeting \"subversives\"); Brown, 381\n\nU.S. 437 (targeting Communist Party members).             For a statute to\n\nqualify as a bill of attainder it must: (1) specify the affected\n\nperson or group, (2) impose punishment by legislative decree, and\n\n(3) dispense with a judicial trial.        See Selective Serv. Sys., 468\n\nU.S. at 847.     Because I would find that § 3328 does not specify an\n\nidentifiable group or impose punishment, I would hold that the\n\nstatute is not a bill of attainder.\n\n            1.   Specification\n\n            Typical bills of attainder evince specification by naming\n\nthe person to be punished.       The Supreme Court has also recognized\n\nspecification when legislation describes individuals \"in terms of\n\nconduct which, because it is past conduct, operates only as a\n\ndesignation of particular persons.\" Communist Party of the U.S. v.\n\nSubversive Activities Control Bd., 367 U.S. 1, 86 (1961); see also\n\nCummings, 71 U.S. 277 (identifying individuals by past affiliation\n\nwith Confederacy); Ex Parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333 (same).                  In\n\ncontrast,    statutes   of   general      applicability    that   focus   on\n\nprospective conduct have withstood challenges on bill of attainder\n\ngrounds.    See Brown, 381 U.S. at 446, 461; see e.g., Selective\n\nServ. Sys., 468 U.S. at 848-51 (finding statute prospective and\n\ntherefore not bill of attainder); Communist Party, 367 U.S. at 86-\n\n87 (finding statute not bill of attainder because it did not attach\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fto \"past and ineradicable actions,\" but rather \"turn[ed] upon\n\ncontinuingly contemporaneous fact\").\n\n            Section 3328 does not meet the specification requirement\n\nto constitute a bill of attainder because it does not identify\n\nindividuals    for     legislatively      imposed      punishment        based    on\n\nirreversible    past     acts.     Rather,      the    statute    is      entirely\n\nprospective in nature.      President Carter's Proclamation issued on\n\nJuly 2, 1980, dictated that men born on or after January 1, 1960,\n\nare required to register with the Selective Service System.                  Those\n\nborn in the years 1960, 1961, and 1962 had six specified days to\n\nregister.   All men born during or after 1963 have thirty days both\n\nbefore   and    after     their    eighteenth         birthdays     to     comply.\n\nProclamation No. 4771.\n\n            Section 3328 became effective on November 8, 1985.                    On\n\nthis date, the oldest person subject to its provisions would have\n\nbeen twenty-five.        Thus, even if an individual had failed to\n\nsatisfy timely the dictates of President Carter's Proclamation,\n\nunder § 3328, he still had the opportunity to register with the\n\nSelective Service System and avoid disqualification from federal\n\nemployment.    See 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.704(b), 300.705(c); cf. Selective\n\nServ. Sys., 468 U.S. at 849.       As such, § 3328 does not identify any\n\nindividuals    \"'ineluctably      designated     by    the   legislature'        for\n\npunishment\"    because    all    men    can   comply    prospectively.           See\n\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fSelective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 847 (quoting Communist Party, 367\n\nU.S. at 87).\n\n             The Supreme Court found similarly in Selective Service\n\nSystem v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, 468 U.S. at\n\n849-51, when it held that § 12(f) of the Military Selective Service\n\nAct, which denies federal financial assistance to male students who\n\nfail to register for the draft, did not meet the specification\n\nrequirement to constitute a bill of attainder.13 Similar to § 3328,\n\n§ 12(f) was enacted before any men subject to it would have been\n\ntoo    old   to    register      with     the   Selective    Service   System.\n\nBecause § 12(f)'s implementing regulations permitted nonregistrants\n\nto    register    late,   meaning,      after   the   timeline   delineated   in\n\nProclamation 4771, § 12(f) was not retrospective.\n\n             The plaintiffs counter that § 3328 is nevertheless a bill\n\nof attainder because it penalizes an easily identifiable group of\n\nmen age twenty-six and older who are no longer eligible to register\n\nfor the draft.         They argue that Supreme Court precedent and\n\nhistorical       parliamentary     acts     demonstrate     that   legislation\n\nqualifies as a bill of attainder even when punishment occurs post-\n\nenactment and is conditioned on future behavior. They advance that\n\n§ 3328 is such a bill because it makes termination contingent upon\n\nthe subsequent act of failing to register for the draft before\n\n\n       13\n      The Supreme Court also determined that the statute did not\nmeet the punishment requirement. As explained below, I would hold\nthat neither does § 3328.\n\n                                        -33-\n\fturning twenty-six. Relatedly, they also assert that § 3328 should\n\nbe evaluated as a bill of attainder at the time of enforcement\n\nrather than the time of enactment, and that under such analysis,\n\nthe statute meets the specification element because men currently\n\nage twenty-six and older who did not register for the draft\n\nrepresent an easily ascertainable group.\n\n          The plaintiffs' arguments miss the mark. To be sure, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that a statute conditioning punishment on\n\nfuture behavior may still constitute a bill of attainder, but this\n\nassertion is irrelevant.      Such statutes have met the specificity\n\nrequirement because they have identified specific individuals or\n\ngroups based on prior acts, irrespective of also providing these\n\nindividuals with a means to escape punishment through some future\n\nperformance.   See   Brown,    381   U.S.   at   442   (highlighting   that\n\nstatutes meet specification by designation of affected individuals,\n\neven if they provide escape clauses).\n\n          For example, in Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277, the\n\nSupreme Court found invalid a Missouri constitutional amendment\n\nthat prohibited people from engaging in certain professions unless\n\nthey stated under oath that they had not given aid or comfort to\n\nthe Confederacy.14   Although individuals could arguably escape\n\n\n\n\n     14\n      The Constitution extends the prohibition of bills of\nattainder to the states. U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1 (\"No\nState shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder . . . .\").\n\n                                 -34-\n\fpunishment by performing the oath,15 the statute was still a bill\n\nof attainder because it identified the affected group based on\n\nimmutable past conduct, prior sympathy and aid to the Confederate\n\narmy.      Id. at 318 (\"In the first place, [the amendment] is\n\nretrospective; it embraces all the past from this day.\"); see also\n\nEx   Parte    Garland,   71    U.S.   at   377   (involving   federal   statute\n\ndirected at Confederates that contained an escape clause and was\n\nultimately found to be a bill of attainder).                     Section 3328,\n\nhowever, does not identify individuals in this manner because it is\n\nnot directed at people who committed prior acts.              Rather, it is a\n\nbroadly      drawn   statute    of    general    applicability    directed   at\n\nprospective conduct and affecting all men regardless of their past\n\nactions, political affiliations, or ideological beliefs.\n\n              With respect to the plaintiffs' insistence that the court\n\nevaluate § 3328 at the time of enforcement rather than at the time\n\nof enactment, I would reject it. A statute meets the specification\n\nelement if it identifies individuals by name or by description of\n\nprior conduct so that it \"operates only as a designation of\n\n\n\n      15\n      The Supreme Court has noted the elusiveness of escaping\npunishment under the Missouri amendment at issue in Cummings. In\neffect, prior Confederate sympathizers could not evade the\nemployment bar because their only options were to abstain from the\noath and lose their livelihood, or take the oath and perjure\nthemselves. See Selective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 848. To the\nextent that the plaintiffs analogize the Missouri amendment\nto § 3328 in that both provide \"escape clauses,\" § 3328 does not\npresent the double bind at issue in Cummings since men subject to\n§ 3328 can avoid punishment through lawful actions.\n\n                                       -35-\n\fparticular persons.\"      Communist Party, 367 U.S. at 86.              A statute\n\nof   general     applicability       that    affects   individuals      only   upon\n\nenforcement is not a bill of attainder; it is simply an example of\n\nthe quintessential legislation that the Constitution tasks Congress\n\nwith creating.      See Brown, 381 U.S. at 461.\n\n            2.    Punishment\n\n            Even if § 3328 fulfilled the specificity element, I would\n\nstill find that it does not constitute a bill of attainder because\n\nit does not inflict punishment.             Courts evaluate whether a statute\n\nsatisfies the punishment element for bill of attainder purposes by\n\nconsidering: (1) whether the statute falls within the historical\n\nmeaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether, in view of the type\n\nand severity of the burdens imposed, the statute reasonably can be\n\nsaid to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3) whether\n\nthe legislative record demonstrates a congressional intent to\n\npunish.    Selective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 852 (citing Nixon v.\n\nAdmin. of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425, 473, 475-76, 478 (1977)).\n\n\"[O]nly    the    clearest     proof    could     suffice   to     establish   the\n\nunconstitutionality       of     a     statute\"     based     on     impermissible\n\ncongressional motive.          Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 617\n\n(1960).        Further,   \"[e]ach      case    [turns]   on    its    own   highly\n\nparticularized context.\"         Id. at 616.\n\n            Section 3328 does not satisfy any of these punishment\n\nqueries.       It is true that \"a legislative decree of perpetual\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fexclusion\" from specific types of employment meets the historical\n\nunderstanding of a bill of attainder.             Ex parte Garland, 4 U.S. at\n\n377   (1867)     (barring       types    of     employment   for     Confederate\n\nsympathizers); see Cummings, 71 U.S. 277 (same); Lovett, 328 U.S.\n\n303 (barring named individuals from federal employment); Brown, 381\n\nU.S. 437 (barring Community Party members from positions within\n\nlabor unions).     But § 3328 does not act as a perpetual exclusion to\n\nemployment because all men have an opportunity to register for the\n\ndraft.     A statute that allows men to \"'carry the keys of their\n\nprison in their own pockets' . . . does not fall within the\n\nhistorical meaning of forbidden legislative punishment.\" Selective\n\nServ. Sys., 468 U.S. at 853 (quoting Shillitani v. United States,\n\n384 U.S. 364, 368 (1966)).\n\n            Also, it is reasonable to understand § 3328 as a means to\n\nfurther the nonpunitive goal of encouraging Selective Service\n\nSystem registration.        The statute was enacted in conjunction with\n\nfindings that detailed the importance of the draft registration\n\nprogram and an urging from Congress that the President \"recognize\n\n. . . the contribution of our young men to the success of the\n\npeacetime registration program.\"              See Pub. L. No. 99-145 §§ 1621,\n\n1622(a),    99   Stat.   583,    776-77       (1985).   It   also   complements\n\nPresident Carter's directive to executive agencies to \"cooperate\n\nand assist\" in the draft registration requirements.                 Proclamation\n\nNo. 4771.    The conditioning of civil service employment on draft\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fregistration,         then,    acts       as    a     \"rational     means    to     improve\n\ncompliance,\" which is a legitimate nonpunitive objective.                                 See\n\nSelective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 854.\n\n             Finally, I would not find the \"clearest proof\" from the\n\ncongressional record that Congress intended § 3328 to act as a form\n\nof punishment.        Admittedly, Senator Strom Thurmond, the statute's\n\nsponsor, deemed it \"unpatriotic\" to permit nonregistrants to enjoy\n\nthe privileges and benefits of civil service positions.                            131 Cong.\n\nRec. S6627 (1985).        These comments alone, however, do not suffice\n\nas \"'unmistakable evidence of punitive intent which . . . is\n\nrequired before a Congressional enactment of this kind may be\n\nstruck    down.'\"       Selective         Serv.       Sys.,   468   U.S.    at     855    n.15\n\n(alterations in original) (quoting Flemming, 363 U.S. at 619); see\n\nalso Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311 (1979) (\"The\n\nremarks     of   a    single    legislator,           even    the   sponsor,        are   not\n\ncontrolling in analyzing legislative history.\").                            Little other\n\nlegislative history of the statute exists, and what the record does\n\ncontain suggests nonpunitive motives.                    Senator Sam Nunn, the only\n\nother senator who offered substantive remarks during debate on the\n\nlegislation, lent his support to the statute, but underscored the\n\nimportance       of    allowing       a    person       to    register      late    despite\n\nProclamation 4771's mandates.                  131 Cong. Rec. S6627.          His concern\n\nfor   the   ability      of    nonregistrants           to    correct      their    failure\n\ndemonstrates the legislation's goal of encouraging compliance.\n\n\n                                               -38-\n\f            For these reasons, I would find that § 3328 is not a bill\n\nof attainder and affirm the dismissal of this claim.\n\nB.    Equal Protection\n\n            For their second constitutional claim, the plaintiffs\n\ncontend that § 3328 and the Military Selective Service Act on which\n\nit is predicated violate equal protection as guaranteed by the\n\nFifth Amendment because the statutes draw unlawful gender-based\n\ndistinctions.    The plaintiffs acknowledge that the Supreme Court\n\nhas   already   evaluated   the   constitutionality    of   the   Military\n\nSelective Service Act upon an equal protection challenge in Rostker\n\nv. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981).          They argue that Rostker is no\n\nlonger good law, however, due to subsequent precedent from United\n\nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996), which, they posit, altered\n\nthe legal standard governing equal protection claims, and due to\n\ndramatic changes in the roles of women in the military.\n\n            Because Rostker stands on all fours with the present\n\nmatter, I would reject the plaintiffs' challenge.       Despite changes\n\nin the military and the extent, if any, of Virginia's impact on the\n\nequal protection standard as applied here, principles of stare\n\ndecisis would mandate the finding that Rostker is controlling and\n\nthat plaintiffs' claim are meritless.        See Agostini v. Felton, 521\n\nU.S. 203, 237 (1997) (\"We reaffirm that '[i]f a precedent of this\n\nCourt has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on\n\nreasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\fAppeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to\n\nthis Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.'\"\n\n(quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490\n\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989))); see also Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1 (2005)\n\n(reversing Ninth Circuit because its holding was \"quite wrong\" and\n\n\"contravene[d] [] longstanding\" Supreme Court precedent).\n\n            In Rostker, the Supreme Court held that the Military\n\nSelective   Service   Act   does    not    violate   equal   protection   by\n\nrequiring men, but not women, to register for the draft.           It noted\n\nthat Congress is afforded due deference in matters involving\n\nnational defense and the constitutionality of its enactments, and\n\nthe extensive congressional record of the statute demonstrated that\n\nCongress made a \"studied choice\" in excluding women from the\n\nregistration requirements. Id. at 64-69, 72-77. It then held that\n\nthe statute was not an instance of unlawful gender discrimination.\n\nThe government had an important interest in raising and supporting\n\narmies, as detailed in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.\n\nId. at 70-72.   The gender classification excluding women from the\n\ndraft was closely related to this interest because the purpose of\n\nregistration was to facilitate a draft for combat troops, and women\n\nwere ineligible for combat.        Id. at 75-79.     No part of Rostker has\n\nbeen overruled, and its holding would foreclose any review of the\n\nplaintiffs' claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -40-\n\f          To be sure, the current reality of the armed forces\n\nrepresents a marked shift from 1981, when Rostker was decided.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs' complaint, more than 200,000 women\n\npresently serve in the United States military, and women now make\n\nup 15 percent of the armed forces, compared to 8.4 percent in 1980.\n\nLegislation enacted after the decision is Rostker permits women to\n\nserve on Navy combat ships and fly combat aircraft, and a new Navy\n\npolicy will allow women to serve on submarines.      See Pub. L. No.\n\n103-160, § 541, 107 Stat. 1547, 1659 (1993) (repealing ban on\n\nassignment of women to combat ships); Pub. L. No. 102-190, § 531,\n\n105 Stat. 1290, 1365 (1991) (repealing ban on women from serving on\n\naircraft engaged in combat missions); Commander, Submarine Forces\n\nPublic Affairs, Navy Policy Will Allow Women to Serve Aboard\n\nSubmarines,    navy.mil,    (Apr.      29,   2010,      6:35    AM),\n\nhttp://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=52954. Even more,\n\nthe congressional Military Leadership Diversity Commission recently\n\nissued a final report urging Congress to allow women into male-only\n\nland combat units.   From Representation to Inclusion: Diversity\n\nLeadership for the 21st-Century Military, Final Report (Military\n\nLeadership Diversity Comm'n, Arlington, Va.) Mar. 15, 2011, at 71-\n\n74, 127, available at http://mldc.whs.mil/index.php/final-report.\n\n          Despite these developments, women are still precluded\n\nfrom ground combat positions.   Further, Congress has demonstrated\n\nan acute awareness of the gender distinctions in draft registration\n\n\n                                -41-\n\frequirements, and yet it has not amended the statute.         See, e.g.,\n\nPub. L. No. 109-163, § 541(a)(1), 119 Stat. 3136, 3251-52 (2006)\n\n(directing Secretary of Defense to provide advance notice of\n\nchanges to ground combat policy along with \"detailed analysis of\n\nlegal implication of the proposed change with respect to the\n\nconstitutionality of the application of the Military Selective\n\nService Act to males only.\" (internal citation omitted)).        Indeed,\n\nthe House's Armed Service Committee took pains to explain that\n\nrepeals to certain bans on women-in-combat positions should not be\n\n\"construed as tacit committee concurrence in an expansion of the\n\nassignment of women to units or positions whose mission requires\n\nroutine engagement in direct combat on the ground, or be seen as a\n\nsuggestion that selective service registration or conscription\n\ninclude women.\"     H.R. Rep. No. 103-200, pt. 2 (1993).          In any\n\nevent, it would not be for this court to determine what, if any,\n\nimpact these developments had on the continued vitality of Rostker,\n\na task left solely to the Supreme Court.\n\n                          III. Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment.         I\n\nwould   find   jurisdiction   to   hear   the   plaintiffs'   claims   but\n\nultimately affirm their dismissal on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f",

In the district court, four plaintiffs, who are male United States citizens over age twenty-six, sought to challenge this statutory bar on constitutional grounds, failed on the merits, and now appeal.</p>\n<p>The statutory bar reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>An individual</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) who was born after December 31, 1959, and is or was required to register under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 453); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) who is not so registered or knowingly and willfully did not so register before the requirement terminated or became inapplicable to the individual,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>shall be ineligible for appointment to a position in an Executive agency.</blockquote>\n<p>5 U.S.C. § 3328(a) (2006).<sup>[1]</sup> Section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act, 62 Stat. 604, 605, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. § 453 (2006), empowers the President to require every male citizen and male resident alien between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six to register for the draft. In 1980, President Carter reinstituted the registration requirements for young men. Proclamation No. 4771, 3 C.F.R. 82 (1981), <i>reprinted as amended in</i> 50 U.S.C. app. § 453 app. at 59-60.</p>\n<p>The Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), which manages civil service employment in the Executive Branch, has adopted corresponding regulations. 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707 (2010). These regulations provide that a civil service employee who was required to register</p>\n<blockquote>will be terminated by his agency under the authority of the statute and these regulations if he has not registered as required, unless he registers or unless, if no longer eligible to register, OPM determines in response to his explanation that his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 300.707.</p>\n<p>Three of the plaintiffs in this case were discharged by their federal agencies when it was discovered that they had not registered although required to do so; the fourth resigned when confronted with his failure to register and says that his resignation was forced by the statutory bar. None of the four presently challenges the premise that his failure to register was knowing or willful, and none sought to pursue to the end the statutory remedies prescribed for civil service employees who dispute their removals.</p>\n<p>Instead, the plaintiffs brought an original action in the district court seeking reinstatement and claiming that the statutory bar is unconstitutional; the grounds asserted are that it is both a forbidden bill <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> of attainder under Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the Constitution and, because it applies to men but not women, an unlawful discrimination under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. The latter claim has already been rejected by the Supreme Court, <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981), but the plaintiffs may intend to ask the Court to revisit the ruling.</p>\n<p>In the district court, the government asserted that the claims were barred because the plaintiffs had a statutory route to dispute their removals or forced resignation and that this route was intended by Congress to be exclusive for cases covered by the statutory remedy. This statutory remedy, which will be described in more detail hereafter, ordinarily leads through the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\" or \"Board\") and, on judicial review, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Three of the four plaintiffs did not pursue this avenue; one did but abandoned it after an adverse decision by the MSPB administrative law judge.</p>\n<p>The district court declined to dismiss the action on jurisdictional grounds, initially sided with the plaintiffs on the bill of attainder issue, and ultimately reversed ground and decided against the plaintiffs on their constitutional claims. <i>Elgin v. United States,</i> 594 F.Supp.2d 133 (D.Mass. 2009), <i>vacated,</i> 697 F.Supp.2d 187 (D.Mass. 2010). The plaintiffs now seek review in this court; the government continues to argue both that the district court had no jurisdiction and that, if it did, the statutory bar is constitutional. An objection to subject matter jurisdiction takes priority, and we begin (and end) with that issue.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, and as a default remedy, a district court has authority as a federal court of general jurisdictionsubject to various limitationsto consider claims against federal government officials that they are acting unconstitutionally and should be enjoined. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2006); <i>Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 682, 701-02, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949). Suits against the federal government itself or its departmentsthe plaintiffs' target here are complicated by sovereign immunity considerations, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994), but the government has invoked no such defense in this case, <i>see</i> 5 U.S.C. § 702; <i>Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 668, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n<p>Instead, the government argues the exclusive remedy for the removal or forced resignation of the four plaintiffs is provided by the Civil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). The CSRA scheme, set forth in Title 5, Chapter 75, Subchapter II and augmented by regulations, allows certain employees in the civil serviceincluding those (such as the plaintiffs) in the competitive serviceto seek review if they are removed \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a); the route prescribed is by appeal to the MSPB and, if dissatisfied with the result, appeal to the Federal Circuit, whose decisions in turn are reviewable by the Supreme Court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the CSRA does not in terms describe this scheme as exclusive of other remedies, Congress intended the scheme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> at least where it applies and provides a mechanism for administrative and judicial review and reliefto be exclusive of ordinary district court actions to challenge a removal. The Supreme Court has suggested that this is so, <i>United States v. Fausto,</i> 484 U.S. 439, 443-55, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988); <i>see also </i><i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. 367, 388-89, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983); we have recognized it to be so, <i>Berrios v. Dep't of the Army,</i> 884 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1989); and the legislative history bears out this intention, S.Rep. No. 95-969, at 9-10, 53, 63 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2731-32, 2775, 2785.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs do not contest the view that the statutory route, where it applies, is the exclusive remedy for an employee challenging removal; but they argue that the government has taken inconsistent positions and that, in any event, for various reasons the statutory remedy is not available to them. However, the statutory route does in fact give the plaintiffs a route to direct review of their constitutional claims by an Article III court; Congress intended that route to be exclusive in removal cases; and, despite some confusion in the precedents, both literal language and Congress' policy require that result.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiffs suggest that the government's objection is foreclosed because (a) it resisted efforts by one of the plaintiffs to raise this very kind of claim through the MSPB route, and (b) it has raised the subject matter jurisdiction claim only on reconsideration in the district court. But, as it turns out, the government is within its rights to raise the objection: subject matter jurisdiction claims are not waivable and may be raised for the first time even on direct appeal, Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p>Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a waivable objection. <i>Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New Eng. Inc.,</i> 603 F.3d 71, 85 (1st Cir.2010). But, if the CSRA remedy is available and intended to be exclusive, it does not prescribe some administrative step required before resorting to district court, <i>e.g., </i><i>Woodford v. Ngo,</i> 548 U.S. 81, 88-89, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006); rather, the remedy <i>displaces</i> the plenary district court action entirely, just as a statute channeling agency review to a circuit court displaces a direct review action in the district court. <i>See </i><i>Whitman v. Dep't of Transp.,</i> 547 U.S. 512, 513-14, 126 S.Ct. 2014, 164 L.Ed.2d 771 (2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>Second, the remedy in Chapter 75, Subchapter II applies to removals \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a), and the question arises whether removal on account of the statutory bar falls in that category. Arguing that section 7513(a) is limited to misconduct, the plaintiffs cite Supreme Court language stating that \"Chapter 75 of the Act governs adverse action taken against employees for the `efficiency of the service,' which includes action of the type taken here, based on misconduct,\" <i>Fausto,</i> 484 U.S. at 446, 108 S.Ct. 668. However, \"includes\" does not mean \"limited to.\"</p>\n<p>The CSRA is a successor to earlier civil service statutes, including the Lloyd-La Follette Act, which created the first general statutory protection for civil servants, <i>see </i><i>Arnett v. Kennedy,</i> 416 U.S. 134, 149-50, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), and used the same \"efficiency of [the] service\" phrase as the substantive standard for removal, <i>see</i> Act of Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 389, § 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555 (repealed 1978). That standard was understood to include removals that were based on disqualifying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> conditions that existed before the employees were hired, and Congress was aware of and intended to adopt this interpretation.</p>\n<p>Thus, prior to the CSRA's enactment, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs noted that for covered civil service employees, \"existing law provides that an individual may be removed only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\" S.Rep. No. 95-969, at 9 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2731. The committee reported that in 1976, 17,157 federal employees had been dismissed under that standard, and it listed eight different categories, including 240 \"[r]emoved because of some condition that existed before they were hired.\" <i>Id.</i> In recommending section 7513, the committee said that it did not intend any substantive change to the existing law permitting removals only for \"efficiency of the service.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50, <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2772.</p>\n<p>OPM shares this view of the \"efficiency of the service\" standard. In a related part, 5 C.F.R. pt. 731, OPM regulations discuss the standard for a \"suitability action,\" including a \"removal,\" 5 C.F.R. § 731.203; the regulations state that a suitability action may be taken only to \"protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service,\" <i>id.</i> § 731.201, which includes \"[a]ny statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question,\" <i>id.</i> § 731.202(b)(8). <i>See also id.</i> § 731.501(a) (right to appeal suitability action to the MSPB).</p>\n<p>Third, the plaintiffs question whether the removals in this case were intended as removals for the \"efficiency of the service.\" The removal notices, it appears, cited the statutory bar, 5 U.S.C. § 3328not Chapter 75, Subchapter II and the \"efficiency of the service\" phrasebut the legislative history and regulations make clear that a removal because of a statutory bar <i>is</i> one for the \"efficiency of the service,\" thereby triggering the opportunityand obligationto use the MSPB procedures and to seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' contrary suggestion rests on a misreading of <i>Department of the Navy v. Egan,</i> 484 U.S. 518, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988). There, the Court relied on the ground given in a removal notice to conclude that the action was taken under the \"efficiency of the service\" standard and <i>not</i> on grounds of national security. <i>Id.</i> at 522 &amp; n. 4, 523, 108 S.Ct. 818. A national security removal is explicitly exempted from all \"other statutes\" and review is narrowly limited. 5 U.S.C. § 7532; <i>see id.</i> § 7512(A) (exempting a section 7532 removal); <i>Egan,</i> 484 U.S. at 525-26, 108 S.Ct. 818. Here, no such statutory exemption applies, and the notice merely particularizes the \"efficiency of the service\" basis for the removal.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the MSPB has suggested that a person who was wrongly hired in the face of an absolute statutory bar was never an \"employee\" at all because the appointment was void <i>ab initio,</i> and therefore, when the error is discovered, the person removed is not a former \"employee\" who can invoke the CSRA. <i>E.g., </i><i>Hope v. Dep't of the Army,</i> 108 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (2008) (citing cases). This \"reasoning,\" <i>see </i><i>Travaglini v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132-37 (1983), <i>aff'd as modified,</i> 23 M.S.P.R. 417 (1984), underlies statements by the Board, occasionally noted but not endorsed by the Federal Circuit,<sup>[3]</sup> that a removal because of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> an absolute statutory bar is outside the Board's authority under the CSRA because the employee should not have been hired in the first place.</p>\n<p>This is not the approach taken by modern courts in construing remedial statutes, and the government should be embarrassed ever to have taken advantage of such question begging rhetoric. The plaintiffs in this case were hired by the federal government, served (in some cases for many years) as its employees, exercised official authority, and were then terminated. The idea that Congress would implicitly exclude them from the category of former \"employees\" entitled to seek redress under the CSRAif and to the extent that their removal was outside a statutory bar or that the bar was itself unconstitutionalbeggars belief.</p>\n<p>The CSRA governs \"removals\"; nothing in its language suggests that a case involving a statutory bar follows a different route; and the legislative history already described refutes any such suggestion. Of course, <i>if</i> the employee comes within the statutory bar <i>and</i> the statutory bar is constitutional, the discharged employee will not get reinstated; but the proper outcome should be a decision denying reinstatement on the merits. Thus, the statutory route gives the plaintiff a full opportunity to present both questions to the Federal Circuit, which is an Article III court.</p>\n<p>Fifth, this brings us at last to the question whether there is some implied exception to the exclusive CSRA remedy because the challenge in this case is a constitutional one sounding in equity or because it is a facial constitutional attack rather than an \"as-applied\" challenge. The Supreme Court has already ruled that <i>Bivens</i>-type constitutional claims for damages cannot bypass CSRA limitations, <i>Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. at 368, 103 S.Ct. 2404; and as to equitable constitutional claims, there is something of a circuit split,<sup>[4]</sup> but this circuit has been firm in treating the CSRA remedy as exclusive as to equitable constitutional claims as well.</p>\n<p>Thus, this court held in <i>Berrios</i> that an employee fired by the government could not bring a due process claim and other facial and as-applied constitutional claims by an original action in the district court but had to follow the CSRA scheme through the MSPB into the Federal Circuit. 884 F.2d at 31. Another decision in this circuit reaffirmed the general rule but found it inapplicable because the employee's classification excluded him from the CSRA remedy. <i>Pathak v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 274 F.3d 28, 31-33 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>see also </i><i>Irizarry v. United States,</i> 427 F.3d 76, 77-78 (1st Cir.2005). None of our cases has adopted the distinction urged nor does it have any obvious basis in policy.</p>\n<p>Constitutional claims are common in administrative proceedingsespecially equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> protection and procedural due process claimsand are part of the ordinary fodder of review in discharge cases. Often such claims are made along with factual claims denying the conduct alleged against the employee and statutory or rule-based claims as well. Congress' desire to consolidate employee removal in a single forum was based on the action taken against the employee rather than the precise arguments made in contesting that action.</p>\n<p>What matters in the end is whether the CSRA process can afford relief. The plaintiffs argue that a <i>facial</i> claim attacking the underlying statute is one for which the MSPB <i>cannot</i> grant relief to them and therefore the premisethat the CSRA remedy is exclusive where it appliesdoes not itself apply. And to show that there is no MSPB remedy, the plaintiffs point to statements by the MSPB itself that it, \"as an administrative agency, is without authority to determine the constitutionality of Federal statutes.\" <i>Bayly v. OPM,</i> 42 M.S.P.R. 524, 525-26 (1990).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>But while the Board may be powerless to strike down the statute, the Federal Circuit on review of the Board may do so, 5 U.S.C. § 7703(c), and, if it agreed with the plaintiffs on the merits, remand to the Board to grant relief. <i>See </i><i>Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 1, 23-24, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000); <i>Thunder Basin Coal Co.,</i> 510 U.S. at 215, 114 S.Ct. 771. Accordingly, the CSRA regime <i>does</i> provide an opportunity for the plaintiffs to obtain a full determination of their facial constitutional challenge. Indeed, even if the MSPB had the first word on the constitutional issue, it certainly would not have the last.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs object that the Federal Circuit has regularly said that its jurisdiction is coextensive with that of the MSPB as to the categories of cases that fall within the CSRA. <i>E.g., </i><i>Rosano v. Dep't of the Navy,</i> 699 F.2d 1315, 1318 (Fed.Cir.1983). That proposition happens to be true as a general statement, but it was not made by the Federal Circuit in our context and would make no sense if it were: for in such cases the MSPB is limited only because of a doctrine that uniquely applies to administrative agencies and <i>not</i> to the Federal Circuit or any other Article III court.</p>\n<p>The Federal Circuit has never said that it was powerless to act where a removal occurred and the underlying statute that prompted the removal was itself unconstitutional. On the contrary, that court has said that if a colorable constitutional claim were presented, it would have to address the issue. <i>See </i><i>Riggin v. Office of Senate Fair Emp't Practices,</i> 61 F.3d 1563, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1995) (discussing <i>Webster v. Doe,</i> 486 U.S. 592, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988)); <i>Brockmann v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed.Cir.1994) (same). And if it mistakenly held otherwise, the remedy would be on certiorari to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The substantive constitutional claims in this case are unpromising, given that one conflicts with governing Supreme Court precedent and the other ignores the fact that the plaintiffs were free to avoid the bar by timely registration. But the CSRA channels removals covered by the CSRA and thus the plaintiffs' claimsto the Federal Circuit, <i>see </i><i>Hall v. United States,</i> 617 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2010); that principle serves an important purpose; the CSRA provides a remedy for a meritorious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> facial challenge; and plaintiffs were obliged to use it.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is <i>vacated</i> and the case <i>remanded</i> for entry of a new judgment denying relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and without prejudice to the pursuit of remedies under the CSRA to the extent that they may be available at this late date. Each side shall bear its owns costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the ultimate result of this case, but not in the route taken in reaching it. I would find jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' claims, but hold that they fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>The majority reaches a reasoned conclusion, but I believe it falls short in considering fully the question of whether there is an applicable exception to the CSRA's preclusive effect. To be sure, the majority disposes of the plaintiffs' arguments regarding constitutional challenges generally and facial attacks specifically. It does not, however, take head-on the issue of whether federal district court jurisdiction remains intact if the CSRA does not afford meaningful review to the plaintiffs' colorable constitutional claims that sound in equity.<sup>[6]</sup> Because I find that the plaintiffs' claims would be unreviewable under the CSRA's remedial scheme, I would hold that federal district court jurisdiction exists, just as our sister circuits have done in comparable cases. <i>See </i><i>Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps. Local 1 v. Stone,</i> 502 F.3d 1027, 1034-39 (9th Cir.2007); <i>Mitchum v. Hurt,</i> 73 F.3d 30, 34-36 (3d Cir.1995); <i>Hubbard v. EPA,</i> 809 F.2d 1, 11-12 (D.C.Cir.1986), <i>vacated in part on other grounds, </i><i>Spagnola v. Mathis,</i> 859 F.2d 223 (D.C.Cir.1988) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>As set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" The plaintiffs' claims arise under the Constitution, namely, the Bill of Attainder Clause in Article I, Section 9, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which implicitly guarantees equal protection. <i>See </i><i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). The question, then, is whether the CSRA divested the federal district court of its jurisdiction conferred by § 1331. <i>See </i><i>Whitman v. Dep't of Transp.,</i> 547 U.S. 512, 514, 126 S.Ct. 2014, 164 L.Ed.2d 771 (2006).</p>\n<p>As explained by the majority, Congress enacted the CSRA in 1978 as a means to \"`comprehensively overhaul[ ] the civil service system.'\" <i>United States v. Fausto,</i> 484 U.S. 439, 443, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988) (quoting <i>Lindahl v. OPM,</i> 470 U.S. 768, 773, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985)). Prior to the CSRA, different employees were afforded different processes of review upon an adverse employment action, resulting in both federal court and administrative appeals with \"wide variations\" among decisions. <i>Id.</i> at 444-45, 108 S.Ct. 668. Congress sought to streamline these varied decisions by funneling federal employee personnel actions through the CSRA's administrative process. <i>Id.</i> at 445, 108 S.Ct. 668.</p>\n<p>Although the CSRA does not explicitly prohibit plenary actions in federal district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> court, the Supreme Court has interpreted the statute to have far-reaching preclusive effect. In <i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), it held that a federal-employee plaintiff whose demotion allegedly violated the Constitution could not sue for damages, even though, assuming the violation occurred, his remedies under the CSRA would not fully compensate him for the harm he suffered. Five years later, in <i>United States v. Fausto,</i> 484 U.S. 439, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830, it found that the CSRA prevented a plaintiff from initiating suit in federal court for statutory and regulatory violations, even though the plaintiff was afforded no administrative review under the statute.</p>\n<p>Despite this line of precedent, the Supreme Court has consistently found exceptions to the foreclosure of judicial review for colorable constitutional claims sounding in equity, absent clear congressional intent to the contrary. The same year it decided <i>Fausto,</i> it also decided <i>Webster v. Doe,</i> 486 U.S. 592, 108 S.Ct. 2047, 100 L.Ed.2d 632 (1988), in which a plaintiff sought equitable relief when challenging on both statutory and constitutional grounds his termination from the CIA due to his homosexuality. The Court found the statutory claims unreviewable, but it rejected the government's argument that the constitutional claims were as well, holding:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]here Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.... We require this heightened showing in part to avoid the \"serious constitutional question\" that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.</blockquote>\n<p>486 U.S. at 603, 108 S.Ct. 2047 (quoting <i>Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians,</i> 476 U.S. 667, 681 n. 12, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986)); <i>see also </i><i>McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. 479, 496, 111 S.Ct. 888, 112 L.Ed.2d 1005 (1991) (finding federal question jurisdiction for plaintiffs' constitutional challenges despite comprehensive immigration statute due to lack of meaningful judicial review under statute and absence of clear congressional language mandating preclusion); <i>Johnson v. Robison,</i> 415 U.S. 361, 373-74, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (holding that statute prohibiting judicial review of decisions by the administrator of Veterans Affairs did not provide \"the `clear and convincing' evidence of congressional intent required by this Court before a statute will be construed to restrict access to judicial review\" of constitutional claims (quoting <i>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967))).</p>\n<p>Because I find that the CSRA's remedial scheme does not afford the plaintiffs meaningful review of their colorable constitutional claims for equitable relief, I would hold that the statute does not bar the present action and the plaintiffs may seek relief in federal district court.</p>\n<p>The MSPB is a creation of statute, and its jurisdiction is limited. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 7701(a). Notwithstanding the question of whether the MSPB has the power to rule on constitutional issues, <i>see </i><i>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich,</i> 510 U.S. 200, 215, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994), it is undisputed by the parties that the MSPB cannot adjudicate claims premised on removals due to an \"absolute statutory prohibition\" to appointment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Hope v. Dep't of the Army,</i> 108 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (2008); <i>Lovoy v. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 94 M.S.P.R. 571, 586 (2003); <i>Daneshpayeh v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 57 M.S.P.R. 672, 676 (1993), <i>aff'd,</i> No. 93-3476, 1994 U.S.App. LEXIS 14360, 1994 WL 18964 (Fed.Cir. Jan. 26, 1994) (unpublished) (per curiam); <i>Travaglini v. Dep't of</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> <i>Educ.,</i> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132 (1983), <i>aff'd as modified,</i> 23 M.S.P.R. 417, 419-20 (1984).</p>\n<p>Section 3328 is an absolute prohibition to appointment because an individual who knowingly and willfully fails to register with the Selective Service System is barred from all executive agency employment, and he must be terminated if currently employed. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 3328; 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707. The MSPB consistently dismisses appeals related to terminations pursuant to § 3328 on these grounds, a position the government regularly advances before the Board and on which it succeeded in the MSPB appeal by Mr. Elgin, a plaintiff in this matter. <i>E.g., Charner v. OPM,</i> No. PH-3443-08-0601-I-2, 2009 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 1296, at *10-11 (Mar. 6, 2009) (unpublished); <i>Whitfield v. Dep't of Interior,</i> No. DC-0752-09-0094-I-1, 2008 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 6910, at *4, 7 (Dec. 23, 2008) (unpublished); <i>Rivera v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> No. NY-0752-08-0137-I-1, 2008 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 2056, at *7 (Mar. 31, 2008) (unpublished); <i>Elgin v. Dep't of Treasury,</i> No. PH-0752-08-0004-I-1, 2007 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 7502, at *9 (Nov. 16, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>Indeed, the MSPB has often deemed frivolous the assertion that it has jurisdiction over cases contesting removals pursuant to § 3328. <i>See, e.g., Whitfield,</i> 2008 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 6910, at *1; <i>Clarke v. OPM,</i> No. DA-3443-07-0538-I-1, 2007 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 7101, at *1 n. 1 (Dec. 17, 2007) (unpublished); <i>Belmares-Avalos v. OPM,</i> No. CH-300A-07-0351-I-1, 2007 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 4900, at *1 (May 9, 2007) (unpublished). Moreover, the regulations promulgated by OPM are entitled \"Statutory Bar to Appointment of Persons Who Fail to Register Under Selective Service Law,\" and they state that administrative review beyond OPM's determination is prohibited. 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707; <i>id.</i> at .706(c).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Because the MSPB has routinely stated that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims on the merits, it appears to me that the Federal Circuit is without jurisdiction to do so as well. The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is derivative of the MSPB's jurisdiction, and it is problematic whether the Federal Circuit has the ability to decide matters beyond that of the Board. <i>See </i><i>Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\"Since the MSPB had no jurisdiction, the merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> of Perez's challenge ... were not before the MSPB for decision; nor are they before us.\"); <i>Carroll v. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 703 F.2d 1388, 1390 (Fed. Cir.1983) (\"`[W]ith respect to cases brought under [5 U.S.C. §] 7701, the scope of the subject matter jurisdiction of this court is identical to the scope of the jurisdiction of the Board.'\" (quoting <i>Rosano v. Dep't of the Navy,</i> 699 F.2d 1315, 1318 (Fed.Cir.1983))).</p>\n<p>The majority places great faith in its presumption that the Federal Circuit would either find the MSPB competent to review the plaintiffs' claims and remand for a decision on the merits, or that it would look beyond its own jurisdictional constraints to reach the constitutional issues itself. The evidence to support these assertions, however, is elusive. First, although no plaintiff, in this suit or others, who was removed under § 3328 has ever sought Federal Circuit review of the MSPB's decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the case law and regulations cited above suggest that such efforts would be futile. Time and again the MSPB has dismissed these cases, claiming that it is unable to grant relief, and an appeal to the Federal Circuit seems almost certain to result in a simple affirmance. <i>See Daneshpayeh,</i> 1994 WL 18964, 1994 U.S.App. LEXIS 14360.</p>\n<p>Second, the Federal Circuit has never reached beyond the limits of the MSPB to hear the merits of a claim otherwise barred from review. In only one instance has it hypothesized the possibility, and never before has it acted on the idea. <i>See </i><i>Brockmann v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 27 F.3d 544, 546-47 (Fed.Cir.1994) (acknowledging Supreme Court precedent supporting review of colorable constitutional claims otherwise barred, but finding precedent inapplicable because plaintiffs' claims unreviewable by the MSPB were not colorable). Indeed, when the Federal Circuit did confront a plaintiff covered by the CSRA who asserted constitutional claims that were beyond MSPB review, it affirmed the dismissal of his suit for lack of jurisdiction, rather than providing a forum for his constitutional claims. <i>Hubbard v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> 319 Fed.Appx. 912 (Fed.Cir.2009) (unpublished). Such case law provides little comfort that the plaintiffs in this matter would fare any better.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To be sure, administrative boards have been declared competent to review constitutional issues otherwise perhaps beyond their scope. <i>See </i><i>Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 1, 20-24, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000) (interpreting Medicare statute to provide administrative review of constitutional claims); <i>Riggin v. Office of Senate Fair Emp't Practices,</i> 61 F.3d 1563, 1570 (Fed.Cir. 1995) (finding administrative board competent to review constitutional due process claim). In these instances, however, the administrative schemes at issue expressly precluded federal district court jurisdiction, and, therefore, would leave the constitutional claims without any forum were the boards unable to review them. <i>See </i><i>Shalala,</i> 529 U.S. at 5, 8, 10, 120 S.Ct. 1084 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> (finding Medicare Act to prohibit expressly federal-question jurisdiction); <i>Riggin,</i> 61 F.3d at 1570 (finding Government Employee Rights Act to prohibit expressly the commencement of judicial proceedings).</p>\n<p>The CSRA contains no such clear prohibition of original federal court actions. Chapter 75 of the CSRA allows an agency to remove an employee \"only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and upon such action, the employee \"is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a), (d). Nowhere does the statute indicate explicitly that a plaintiff may not challenge his termination by raising colorable constitutional claims in federal court.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Our sister courts in the Ninth, Third, and D.C. Circuits have held similarly and allowed federal employees to bring constitutional claims in district court actions seeking equitable relief. <i>See </i><i>Stone,</i> 502 F.3d at 1034-39 (holding CSRA did not preclude judicial review of plaintiffs' First Amendment constitutional claims for equitable relief when plaintiffs had no remedy under the statute); <i>Mitchum,</i> 73 F.3d at 34-36 (finding CSRA and comparable statutes did not preclude federal district court review of plaintiffs' constitutional claims for injunctive and declaratory relief because CSRA not sufficiently clear to restrict federal power to grant equitable relief for constitutional violations); <i>Hubbard,</i> 809 F.2d at 11-12 &amp; n. 15 (holding federal district court had jurisdiction over First Amendment claim because the \"CSRA does not preclude federal employees from seeking equitable relief against agencies for allegedly unconstitutional personnel actions\"); <i>Spagnola,</i> 859 F.2d at 229-30 (\"[T]ime and again this court has affirmed the right of civil servants to seek equitable relief against their supervisors, and the agency itself, in vindication of their constitutional rights.\").</p>\n<p>The Eleventh, Seventh, and Fourth Circuits have expressly avoided the question of whether the CSRA forecloses equitable relief for colorable constitutional claims; indeed, the Eleventh and Fourth Circuits have distinguished or questioned their prior precedent that suggests preclusion. <i>See </i><i>Hardison v. Cohen,</i> 375 F.3d 1262, 1263, 1266-69 (11th Cir.2004) (acknowledging serious question left unresolved as to whether the CSRA precludes equitable relief for constitutional challenges to terminations and distinguishing prior precedent in <i>Stephens v. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 901 F.2d 1571 (11th Cir. 1990), based on availability of review and type of remedy sought); <i>Paige v. Cisneros,</i> 91 F.3d 40, 44 (7th Cir.1996) (avoiding issue of whether CSRA precludes equitable relief for colorable constitutional claims because claim was not colorable); <i>Bryant v. Cheney,</i> 924 F.2d 525, 527-28 (4th Cir. 1991) (declining to address continued vitality of <i>Pinar v. Dole,</i> 747 F.2d 899 (4th Cir.1984), in light of <i>Webster</i> and circuit split on issue). Indeed, the Supreme Court indicated the significance of this issue in <i>Whitman v. Department of Transportation,</i> 547 U.S. 512, 514, 126 S.Ct. 2014, 164 L.Ed.2d 771 (2006), remanding for a determination as to whether the CSRA removed federal question jurisdiction over constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p>I acknowledge that some of our own precedent and unpublished decisions along with decisions in the Second and Tenth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Circuits<sup>[10]</sup> suggest that the CSRA bars all federal actions related to civil service employment, but those cases are distinguishable. They did not involve the absence of meaningful administrative remedies, <i>Dotson v. Griesa,</i> 398 F.3d 156, 171-72, 182 (2d Cir.2005) (noting lack of CSRA remedies but available relief through comparable statutory scheme); <i>Harvey v.

The CSRA does not meet this standard. I would then find that the plaintiffs' claims are afforded no meaningful review under the CSRA and, therefore, their claims are reviewable in federal district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. The Merits</h2>\n<p>Having found jurisdiction, I would dismiss the plaintiffs' claims on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Bill of Attainder</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs assert that § 3328 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder since it legislatively punishes men age twenty-six and older who failed to and can no longer register with the Selective Service System because it prohibits their employment with an executive agency. They assert that the statute satisfies the requirements of a bill of attainder by identifying a class of men based on immutable past conduct and operating as a punishment without trial. I disagree.</p>\n<p>Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution reads: \"No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\" With this clause the Framers \"sought to prohibit the ancient practice of the Parliament in England of punishing without trial `specifically designated persons or groups.'\" <i>Selective Serv. Sys. v. Minn. Pub. Interest Research Grp.,</i> 468 U.S. 841, 847, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) (quoting <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 381 U.S. 437, 447, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965)). The constitutional provision safeguards the notion of separation of powers by protecting against trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> by legislature. <i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 442, 85 S.Ct. 1707. Historically, bills of attainder were acts sentencing to death one or more specific persons, although the Supreme Court has read the clause to also outlaw what were known as bills of pains and penalties, which imposed less severe punishments. <i>Id.</i> at 441, 85 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Cummings v. Missouri,</i> 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 323, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867). Targeted parties were typically those \"who had attempted, or threatened to attempt, to overthrow the government.\" <i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 441, 85 S.Ct. 1707.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has struck down statutes on bill of attainder grounds only five times in the nation's history. <i>See </i><i>Cummings,</i> 71 U.S. 277 (targeting Confederate sympathizers); <i>Ex parte Garland,</i> 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1867) (same); <i>Pierce v. Carskadon,</i> 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 234, 21 L.Ed. 276 (1873) (same); <i>United States v. Lovett,</i> 328 U.S. 303, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946) (targeting \"subversives\"); <i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. 437, 85 S.Ct. 1707 (targeting Communist Party members). For a statute to qualify as a bill of attainder it must: (1) specify the affected person or group, (2) impose punishment by legislative decree, and (3) dispense with a judicial trial. <i>See </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 847, 104 S.Ct. 3348. Because I would find that § 3328 does not specify an identifiable group or impose punishment, I would hold that the statute is not a bill of attainder.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Specification</h2>\n<p>Typical bills of attainder evince specification by naming the person to be punished. The Supreme Court has also recognized specification when legislation describes individuals \"in terms of conduct which, because it is past conduct, operates only as a designation of particular persons.\" <i>Communist Party of the U.S. v. Subversive Activities Control Bd.,</i> 367 U.S. 1, 86, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961); <i>see also </i><i>Cummings,</i> 71 U.S. 277 (identifying individuals by past affiliation with Confederacy); <i>Ex Parte Garland,</i> 71 U.S. 333 (same). In contrast, statutes of general applicability that focus on prospective conduct have withstood challenges on bill of attainder grounds. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 446, 461, 85 S.Ct. 1707; <i>see e.g., </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 848-51, 104 S.Ct. 3348 (finding statute prospective and therefore not bill of attainder); <i>Communist Party,</i> 367 U.S. at 86-87, 81 S.Ct. 1357 (finding statute not bill of attainder because it did not attach to \"past and ineradicable actions,\" but rather \"turn[ed] upon continuingly contemporaneous fact\").</p>\n<p>Section 3328 does not meet the specification requirement to constitute a bill of attainder because it does not identify individuals for legislatively imposed punishment based on irreversible past acts. Rather, the statute is entirely prospective in nature. President Carter's Proclamation issued on July 2, 1980, dictated that men born on or after January 1, 1960, are required to register with the Selective Service System. Those born in the years 1960, 1961, and 1962 had six specified days to register. All men born during or after 1963 have thirty days both before and after their eighteenth birthdays to comply. Proclamation No. 4771.</p>\n<p>Section 3328 became effective on November 8, 1985. On this date, the oldest person subject to its provisions would have been twenty-five. Thus, even if an individual had failed to satisfy timely the dictates of President Carter's Proclamation, under § 3328, he still had the opportunity to register with the Selective Service System and avoid disqualification from federal employment. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.704(b), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> 300.705(c); <i>cf. </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 849, 104 S.Ct. 3348. As such, § 3328 does not identify any individuals \"`ineluctably designated by the legislature' for punishment\" because all men can comply prospectively. <i>See </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 847, 104 S.Ct. 3348 (quoting <i>Communist Party,</i> 367 U.S. at 87, 81 S.Ct. 1357).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court found similarly in <i>Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group,</i> 468 U.S. at 849-51, 104 S.Ct. 3348, when it held that § 12(f) of the Military Selective Service Act, which denies federal financial assistance to male students who fail to register for the draft, did not meet the specification requirement to constitute a bill of attainder.<sup>[13]</sup> Similar to § 3328, § 12(f) was enacted before any men subject to it would have been too old to register with the Selective Service System. Because § 12(f)'s implementing regulations permitted nonregistrants to register late, meaning, after the timeline delineated in Proclamation 4771, § 12(f) was not retrospective.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs counter that § 3328 is nevertheless a bill of attainder because it penalizes an easily identifiable group of men age twenty-six and older who are no longer eligible to register for the draft. They argue that Supreme Court precedent and historical parliamentary acts demonstrate that legislation qualifies as a bill of attainder even when punishment occurs post-enactment and is conditioned on future behavior. They advance that § 3328 is such a bill because it makes termination contingent upon the subsequent act of failing to register for the draft before turning twenty-six. Relatedly, they also assert that § 3328 should be evaluated as a bill of attainder at the time of enforcement rather than the time of enactment, and that under such analysis, the statute meets the specification element because men currently age twenty-six and older who did not register for the draft represent an easily ascertainable group.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' arguments miss the mark. To be sure, the Supreme Court has held that a statute conditioning punishment on future behavior may still constitute a bill of attainder, but this assertion is irrelevant. Such statutes have met the specificity requirement because they have identified specific individuals or groups based on prior acts, irrespective of also providing these individuals with a means to escape punishment through some future performance. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 442, 85 S.Ct. 1707 (highlighting that statutes meet specification by designation of affected individuals, even if they provide escape clauses).</p>\n<p>For example, in <i>Cummings v. Missouri,</i> 71 U.S. 277, the Supreme Court found invalid a Missouri constitutional amendment that prohibited people from engaging in certain professions unless they stated under oath that they had not given aid or comfort to the Confederacy.<sup>[14]</sup> Although individuals could arguably escape punishment by performing the oath,<sup>[15]</sup> the statute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> was still a bill of attainder because it identified the affected group based on immutable past conduct, prior sympathy and aid to the Confederate army. <i>Id.</i> at 318 (\"In the first place, [the amendment] is retrospective; it embraces all the past from this day.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Ex Parte Garland,</i> 71 U.S. at 377 (involving federal statute directed at Confederates that contained an escape clause and was ultimately found to be a bill of attainder). Section 3328, however, does not identify individuals in this manner because it is not directed at people who committed prior acts. Rather, it is a broadly drawn statute of general applicability directed at prospective conduct and affecting all men regardless of their past actions, political affiliations, or ideological beliefs.</p>\n<p>With respect to the plaintiffs' insistence that the court evaluate § 3328 at the time of enforcement rather than at the time of enactment, I would reject it. A statute meets the specification element if it identifies individuals by name or by description of prior conduct so that it \"operates only as a designation of particular persons.\" <i>Communist Party,</i> 367 U.S. at 86, 81 S.Ct. 1357. A statute of general applicability that affects individuals only upon enforcement is not a bill of attainder; it is simply an example of the quintessential legislation that the Constitution tasks Congress with creating. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 461, 85 S.Ct. 1707.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Punishment</h2>\n<p>Even if § 3328 fulfilled the specificity element, I would still find that it does not constitute a bill of attainder because it does not inflict punishment. Courts evaluate whether a statute satisfies the punishment element for bill of attainder purposes by considering: (1) whether the statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether, in view of the type and severity of the burdens imposed, the statute reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3) whether the legislative record demonstrates a congressional intent to punish. <i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348 (citing <i>Nixon v. Admin. of Gen. Servs.,</i> 433 U.S. 425, 473, 475-76, 478, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977)). \"[O]nly the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute\" based on impermissible congressional motive. <i>Flemming v. Nestor,</i> 363 U.S. 603, 617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). Further, \"[e]ach case [turns] on its own highly particularized context.\" <i>Id.</i> at 616, 80 S.Ct. 1367.</p>\n<p>Section 3328 does not satisfy any of these punishment queries. It is true that \"a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion\" from specific types of employment meets the historical understanding of a bill of attainder. <i>Ex parte Garland,</i> 71 U.S. at 377 (1867) (barring types of employment for Confederate sympathizers); <i>see </i><i>Cummings,</i> 71 U.S. 277 (same); <i>Lovett,</i> 328 U.S. 303, 66 S.Ct. 1073 (barring named individuals from federal employment); <i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. 437, 85 S.Ct. 1707 (barring Community Party members from positions within labor unions). But § 3328 does not act as a perpetual exclusion to employment because all men have an opportunity to register for the draft. A statute that allows men to \"`carry the keys of their prison in their own pockets' ... does not fall within the historical meaning of forbidden legislative punishment.\" <i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 853, 104 S.Ct. 3348 (quoting <i>Shillitani v. United States,</i> 384 U.S. 364, 368, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966)).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Also, it is reasonable to understand § 3328 as a means to further the nonpunitive goal of encouraging Selective Service System registration. The statute was enacted in conjunction with findings that detailed the importance of the draft registration program and an urging from Congress that the President \"recognize ... the contribution of our young men to the success of the peacetime registration program.\" <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 99-145 §§ 1621, 1622(a), 99 Stat. 583, 776-77 (1985). It also complements President Carter's directive to executive agencies to \"cooperate and assist\" in the draft registration requirements. Proclamation No. 4771. The conditioning of civil service employment on draft registration, then, acts as a \"rational means to improve compliance,\" which is a legitimate nonpunitive objective. <i>See </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 854, 104 S.Ct. 3348.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would not find the \"clearest proof\" from the congressional record that Congress intended § 3328 to act as a form of punishment. Admittedly, Senator Strom Thurmond, the statute's sponsor, deemed it \"unpatriotic\" to permit nonregistrants to enjoy the privileges and benefits of civil service positions. 131 Cong. Rec. S6627 (1985). These comments alone, however, do not suffice as \"`unmistakable evidence of punitive intent which ... is required before a Congressional enactment of this kind may be struck down.'\" <i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 855 n. 15, 104 S.Ct. 3348 (alterations in original) (quoting <i>Flemming,</i> 363 U.S. at 619, 80 S.Ct. 1367); <i>see also </i><i>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</i> 441 U.S. 281, 311, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (\"The remarks of a single legislator, even the sponsor, are not controlling in analyzing legislative history.\"). Little other legislative history of the statute exists, and what the record does contain suggests nonpunitive motives. Senator Sam Nunn, the only other senator who offered substantive remarks during debate on the legislation, lent his support to the statute, but underscored the importance of allowing a person to register late despite Proclamation 4771's mandates. 131 Cong. Rec. S6627. His concern for the ability of nonregistrants to correct their failure demonstrates the legislation's goal of encouraging compliance.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would find that § 3328 is not a bill of attainder and affirm the dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Equal Protection</h2>\n<p>For their second constitutional claim, the plaintiffs contend that § 3328 and the Military Selective Service Act on which it is predicated violate equal protection as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment because the statutes draw unlawful gender-based distinctions. The plaintiffs acknowledge that the Supreme Court has already evaluated the constitutionality of the Military Selective Service Act upon an equal protection challenge in <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981). They argue that <i>Rostker</i> is no longer good law, however, due to subsequent precedent from <i>United States v. Virginia,</i> 518 U.S. 515, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996), which, they posit, altered the legal standard governing equal protection claims, and due to dramatic changes in the roles of women in the military.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Rostker</i> stands on all fours with the present matter, I would reject the plaintiffs' challenge. Despite changes in the military and the extent, if any, of <i>Virginia</i>'s impact on the equal protection standard as applied here, principles of stare decisis would mandate the finding that <i>Rostker</i> is controlling and that plaintiffs' claim are meritless. <i>See </i><i>Agostini v. Felton,</i> 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (\"We reaffirm <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> that `[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.'\" (quoting <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989))); <i>see also </i><i>Tenet v. Doe,</i> 544 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 1230, 161 L.Ed.2d 82 (2005) (reversing Ninth Circuit because its holding was \"quite wrong\" and \"contravene[d] [] longstanding\" Supreme Court precedent).</p>\n<p>In <i>Rostker,</i> the Supreme Court held that the Military Selective Service Act does not violate equal protection by requiring men, but not women, to register for the draft. It noted that Congress is afforded due deference in matters involving national defense and the constitutionality of its enactments, and the extensive congressional record of the statute demonstrated that Congress made a \"studied choice\" in excluding women from the registration requirements. <i>Id.</i> at 64-69, 72-77, 101 S.Ct. 2646. It then held that the statute was not an instance of unlawful gender discrimination. The government had an important interest in raising and supporting armies, as detailed in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> at 70-72, 101 S.Ct. 2646. The gender classification excluding women from the draft was closely related to this interest because the purpose of registration was to facilitate a draft for combat troops, and women were ineligible for combat. <i>Id.</i> at 75-79, 101 S.Ct. 2646. No part of <i>Rostker</i> has been overruled, and its holding would foreclose any review of the plaintiffs' claim.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the current reality of the armed forces represents a marked shift from 1981, when <i>Rostker</i> was decided. According to the plaintiffs' complaint, more than 200,000 women presently serve in the United States military, and women now make up 15 percent of the armed forces, compared to 8.4 percent in 1980. Legislation enacted after the decision is <i>Rostker</i> permits women to serve on Navy combat ships and fly combat aircraft, and a new Navy policy will allow women to serve on submarines. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 103-160, § 541, 107 Stat. 1547, 1659 (1993) (repealing ban on assignment of women to combat ships); Pub.L. No. 102-190, § 531, 105 Stat. 1290, 1365 (1991) (repealing ban on women from serving on aircraft engaged in combat missions); Commander, Submarine Forces Public Affairs, <i>Navy Policy Will Allow Women to Serve Aboard Submarines,</i> navy.mil, (Apr. 29, 2010, 6:35 AM), http://www.navy.mil/search/display. asp?story_id=52954. Even more, the congressional Military Leadership Diversity Commission recently issued a final report urging Congress to allow women into male-only land combat units. <i>From Representation to Inclusion: Diversity Leadership for the 21st-Century Military,</i> Final Report (Military Leadership Diversity Comm'n, Arlington, Va.) Mar. 15, 2011, at 71-74, 127, <i>available at</i> http://mldc.whs. mil/index.php/final-report.</p>\n<p>Despite these developments, women are still precluded from ground combat positions. Further, Congress has demonstrated an acute awareness of the gender distinctions in draft registration requirements, and yet it has not amended the statute. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pub.L. No. 109-163, § 541(a)(1), 119 Stat. 3136, 3251-52 (2006) (directing Secretary of Defense to provide advance notice of changes to ground combat policy along with \"detailed analysis of legal implication of the proposed change with respect to the constitutionality of the application of the Military Selective Service Act to males only.\" (internal citation omitted)). Indeed, the House's Armed Service Committee took pains to explain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> that repeals to certain bans on women-in-combat positions should not be \"construed as tacit committee concurrence in an expansion of the assignment of women to units or positions whose mission requires routine engagement in direct combat on the ground, or be seen as a suggestion that selective service registration or conscription include women.\" H.R.Rep. No. 103-200, pt. 2 (1993). In any event, it would not be for this court to determine what, if any, impact these developments had on the continued vitality of <i>Rostker,</i> a task left solely to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment. I would find jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims but ultimately affirm their dismissal on the merits.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"Executive agency\" is defined to mean an \"Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment.\" 5 U.S.C. § 105.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. §§ 7511-7514, 7701-7703; 5 C.F.R. §§ 752.401-.406, 1201.3, 1201.120. The remedy extends to \"forced resignations\"the claim made by one of the plaintiffs herewhich are treated as constructive \"removals.\" <i>See </i><i>Carrow v. MSPB,</i> 626 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Diamond v. U.S. Agency for International Development,</i> 108 F.3d 312 (Fed.Cir.1997), the Federal Circuit mentioned the MSPB assertion, without passing on its validity, saying only that it did not apply to the case at hand. <i>Id.</i> at 316. In <i>Daneshpayeh v. Department of the Air Force,</i> No. 93-3476, 1994 WL 18964 (Fed.Cir. Jan. 26, 1994) (per curiam)an unpublished, non-precedential decision, see Fed. Cir. R. 32.1, 36the Federal Circuit affirmed an MSPB decision dismissing an appeal based on the supposed rule, but the court noted that the removed person took \"no issue with the Board's recital of the applicable law\" <i>id.</i> at *2, and suggested doubts as to the \"Board's boiler-plate labeling of its decision as based on a `lack of jurisdiction,'\" <i>id.</i> at *2 n. 4.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>Compare </i><i>Dotson v. Griesa,</i> 398 F.3d 156, 179-82 (2d Cir.2005), <i>and </i><i>Lombardi v. Small Bus. Admin.,</i> 889 F.2d 959, 961-62 (10th Cir. 1989), <i>with </i><i>Mitchum v. Hurt,</i> 73 F.3d 30, 35-36 (3d Cir. 1996), <i>and </i><i>Hubbard v. EPA,</i> 809 F.2d 1, 11 &amp; n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1986), <i>vacated in part on other grounds, </i><i>Spagnola v. Mathis,</i> 859 F.2d 223 (D.C.Cir.1988) (en banc) (per curiam). The Supreme Court has not resolved the question. <i>Whitman,</i> 547 U.S. at 513-14, 126 S.Ct. 2014.</p>\n<p>[5]  This self-denying ordinance, distinguishing this subset of constitutional challenges from all others, is widely repeated in the case law, <i>e.g., </i><i>Califano v. Sanders,</i> 430 U.S. 99, 109, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977), although it is \"not mandatory,\" <i>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich,</i> 510 U.S. 200, 215, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994).</p>\n<p>[6]  The plaintiffs seek equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judgment that § 3328 and the Military Selective Service Act are unconstitutional; an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of § 3328; reinstatement to their agency positions; and back pay, benefits, and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>[7]  The majority states that, to the extent that the MSPB would have found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims because the plaintiffs were terminated pursuant to an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment, the MSPB would be wrong because the doctrine has never been endorsed by the Federal Circuit and is illogical. I believe that the majority oversteps in reaching this conclusion. First, as cited above, the MSPB routinely holds that it cannot hear appeals contesting removals based on absolute statutory prohibitions to appointment, and this precedent appears firmly established.\n</p>\n<p>Second, the Federal Circuit has hardly indicated any error in the Board's finding. In <i>Diamond v. U.S. Agency for International Development,</i> 108 F.3d 312 (Fed.Cir.1997), it cited with approval <i>Travaglini v. Department of Education,</i> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132 (1983), one of the leading cases to discuss the doctrine, although it did not apply the doctrine to the case at hand. In <i>Daneshpayeh v. Department of the Air Force,</i> 1994 WL 18964, 1994 U.S.App. LEXIS 14360, an unreported and non-precedential opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the MSPB's decision that the Board could not grant relief to a federal employee terminated pursuant to an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment. Although the court indicated in a footnote that it may have been incorrect for the MSPB to term this holding \"jurisdictional,\" it still found that the Board could not grant relief because the employee's appointment was illegal. It is immaterial whether an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment is \"jurisdictional\" or simply precludes review; under either circumstance, the Board is unable to hear the merits of a plaintiff's claim.</p>\n<p>[8]  The majority suggests that were the Federal Circuit not to address a colorable constitutional claim, the remedy would be on certiorari to the Supreme Court and not via a plenary federal district court action. I disagree with the majority because the doctrine obliging review of constitutional claims is relevant only when review is otherwise unavailable. Here, it appears that review under the CSRA's administrative scheme is foreclosed, and so I do not see why the federal district court is not the proper forum to review the claims. Indeed, the several circuits that have invoked this doctrine in the context of the CSRA have done so despite the Federal Circuit's ostensible ability to do the same. <i>See </i><i>Stone,</i> 502 F.3d at 1034-39; <i>Mitchum,</i> 73 F.3d at 34-36; <i>Hubbard,</i> 809 F.2d at 11-12.</p>\n<p>[9]  To the extent that the majority opinion suggests that the plaintiffs' claims are not colorable, I disagree. There is a difference between colorable and meritorious claims, and although I would dismiss the plaintiffs claims as a matter of law, I do not find them lacking in \"potential validity,\" <i>see </i><i>Makieh v. Holder,</i> 572 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir.2009). The district court's initial holding on the bill of attainder claim demonstrates as much.</p>\n<p>[10]  Unpublished opinions from this court and opinions from other courts act as persuasive authority and are not binding precedent. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 32.1; 1st Cir. R. 32.1.0(a); <i>United States v. Stepanian,</i> 570 F.3d 51, 57 n. 10 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[11]  Although the majority claims that <i>Berrios</i> definitely answers our present matter, the case is distinct. In <i>Berrios,</i> the plaintiff was afforded and took advantage of available CSRA remedies, and so the rationale for district court jurisdiction would not apply. Here, however, the plaintiffs have no statutory remedies.</p>\n<p>[12]  Indeed, in <i>Pathak</i> we acknowledged that, despite the CSRA's expansive reach, we might have jurisdiction to review the plaintiffs claims, were they colorable. 274 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Supreme Court also determined that the statute did not meet the punishment requirement. As explained below, I would hold that neither does § 3328.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Constitution extends the prohibition of bills of attainder to the states. U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1 (\"No State shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder....\").</p>\n<p>[15]  The Supreme Court has noted the elusiveness of escaping punishment under the Missouri amendment at issue in <i>Cummings.</i> In effect, prior Confederate sympathizers could not evade the employment bar because their only options were to abstain from the oath and lose their livelihood, or take the oath and perjure themselves. <i>See </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 848, 104 S.Ct. 3348. To the extent that the plaintiffs analogize the Missouri amendment to § 3328 in that both provide \"escape clauses,\" § 3328 does not present the double bind at issue in <i>Cummings</i> since men subject to § 3328 can avoid punishment through lawful actions.</p>\n\n</div>",

In the district court, four plaintiffs, who are male United States citizens over age twenty-six, sought to challenge this statutory bar on constitutional grounds, failed on the merits, and now appeal.</p>\n<p>The statutory bar reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>An individual</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) who was born after December 31, 1959, and is or was required to register under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 453); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) who is not so registered or knowingly and willfully did not so register before the requirement terminated or became inapplicable to the individual,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>shall be ineligible for appointment to a position in an Executive agency.</blockquote>\n<p>5 U.S.C. § 3328(a) (2006).<sup>[1]</sup> Section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act, 62 Stat. 604, 605, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. § 453 (2006), empowers the President to require every male citizen and male resident alien between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six to register for the draft. In 1980, President Carter reinstituted the registration requirements for young men. Proclamation No. 4771, 3 C.F.R. 82 (1981), <i>reprinted as amended in</i> 50 U.S.C. app. § 453 app. at 59-60.</p>\n<p>The Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), which manages civil service employment in the Executive Branch, has adopted corresponding regulations. 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707 (2010). These regulations provide that a civil service employee who was required to register</p>\n<blockquote>will be terminated by his agency under the authority of the statute and these regulations if he has not registered as required, unless he registers or unless, if no longer eligible to register, OPM determines in response to his explanation that his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 300.707.</p>\n<p>Three of the plaintiffs in this case were discharged by their federal agencies when it was discovered that they had not registered although required to do so; the fourth resigned when confronted with his failure to register and says that his resignation was forced by the statutory bar. None of the four presently challenges the premise that his failure to register was knowing or willful, and none sought to pursue to the end the statutory remedies prescribed for civil service employees who dispute their removals.</p>\n<p>Instead, the plaintiffs brought an original action in the district court seeking reinstatement and claiming that the statutory bar is unconstitutional; the grounds asserted are that it is both a forbidden bill <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> of attainder under Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the Constitution and, because it applies to men but not women, an unlawful discrimination under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. The latter claim has already been rejected by the Supreme Court, <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span> (1981), but the plaintiffs may intend to ask the Court to revisit the ruling.</p>\n<p>In the district court, the government asserted that the claims were barred because the plaintiffs had a statutory route to dispute their removals or forced resignation and that this route was intended by Congress to be exclusive for cases covered by the statutory remedy. This statutory remedy, which will be described in more detail hereafter, ordinarily leads through the Merit Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\" or \"Board\") and, on judicial review, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Three of the four plaintiffs did not pursue this avenue; one did but abandoned it after an adverse decision by the MSPB administrative law judge.</p>\n<p>The district court declined to dismiss the action on jurisdictional grounds, initially sided with the plaintiffs on the bill of attainder issue, and ultimately reversed ground and decided against the plaintiffs on their constitutional claims. <i>Elgin v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1900601\"><a href=\"/opinion/1900601/elgin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span> (D.Mass. 2010). The plaintiffs now seek review in this court; the government continues to argue both that the district court had no jurisdiction and that, if it did, the statutory bar is constitutional. An objection to subject matter jurisdiction takes priority, and we begin (and end) with that issue.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, and as a default remedy, a district court has authority as a federal court of general jurisdictionsubject to various limitationsto consider claims against federal government officials that they are acting unconstitutionally and should be enjoined. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2006); <i>Larson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (1974).</p>\n<p>Instead, the government argues the exclusive remedy for the removal or forced resignation of the four plaintiffs is provided by the Civil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). The CSRA scheme, set forth in Title 5, Chapter 75, Subchapter II and augmented by regulations, allows certain employees in the civil serviceincluding those (such as the plaintiffs) in the competitive serviceto seek review if they are removed \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a); the route prescribed is by appeal to the MSPB and, if dissatisfied with the result, appeal to the Federal Circuit, whose decisions in turn are reviewable by the Supreme Court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Although the CSRA does not in terms describe this scheme as exclusive of other remedies, Congress intended the scheme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> at least where it applies and provides a mechanism for administrative and judicial review and reliefto be exclusive of ordinary district court actions to challenge a removal. The Supreme Court has suggested that this is so, <i>United States v.

However, the statutory route does in fact give the plaintiffs a route to direct review of their constitutional claims by an Article III court; Congress intended that route to be exclusive in removal cases; and, despite some confusion in the precedents, both literal language and Congress' policy require that result.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiffs suggest that the government's objection is foreclosed because (a) it resisted efforts by one of the plaintiffs to raise this very kind of claim through the MSPB route, and (b) it has raised the subject matter jurisdiction claim only on reconsideration in the district court. But, as it turns out, the government is within its rights to raise the objection: subject matter jurisdiction claims are not waivable and may be raised for the first time even on direct appeal, Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3); <i>United States v.

But, if the CSRA remedy is available and intended to be exclusive, it does not prescribe some administrative step required before resorting to district court, <i>e.g., </i><i>Woodford v.

Dep't of Transp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145650\"><a href=\"/opinion/145650/whitman-v-department-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 513-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145650\"><a href=\"/opinion/145650/whitman-v-department-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Arguing that section 7513(a) is limited to misconduct, the plaintiffs cite Supreme Court language stating that \"Chapter 75 of the Act governs adverse action taken against employees for the `efficiency of the service,' which includes action of the type taken here, based on misconduct,\" <i>Fausto,</i> 484 U.S. at 446, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111987\"><a href=\"/opinion/111987/united-states-v-fausto/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>. However, \"includes\" does not mean \"limited to.\"</p>\n<p>The CSRA is a successor to earlier civil service statutes, including the Lloyd-La Follette Act, which created the first general statutory protection for civil servants, <i>see </i><i>Arnett v. Kennedy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109008\"><a href=\"/opinion/109008/arnett-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 149-50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109008\"><a href=\"/opinion/109008/arnett-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1974), and used the same \"efficiency of [the] service\" phrase as the substantive standard for removal, <i>see</i> Act of Aug. 24, 1912, ch. 389, § 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555 (repealed 1978). That standard was understood to include removals that were based on disqualifying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> conditions that existed before the employees were hired, and Congress was aware of and intended to adopt this interpretation.</p>\n<p>Thus, prior to the CSRA's enactment, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs noted that for covered civil service employees, \"existing law provides that an individual may be removed only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\" S.Rep. No. 95-969, at 9 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2731. The committee reported that in 1976, 17,157 federal employees had been dismissed under that standard, and it listed eight different categories, including 240 \"[r]emoved because of some condition that existed before they were hired.\" <i>Id.</i> In recommending section 7513, the committee said that it did not intend any substantive change to the existing law permitting removals only for \"efficiency of the service.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50, <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2772.</p>\n<p>OPM shares this view of the \"efficiency of the service\" standard. In a related part, 5 C.F.R. pt. 731, OPM regulations discuss the standard for a \"suitability action,\" including a \"removal,\" 5 C.F.R. § 731.203; the regulations state that a suitability action may be taken only to \"protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service,\" <i>id.</i> § 731.201, which includes \"[a]ny statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question,\" <i>id.</i> § 731.202(b)(8). <i>See also id.</i> § 731.501(a) (right to appeal suitability action to the MSPB).</p>\n<p>Third, the plaintiffs question whether the removals in this case were intended as removals for the \"efficiency of the service.\" The removal notices, it appears, cited the statutory bar, 5 U.S.C. § 3328not Chapter 75, Subchapter II and the \"efficiency of the service\" phrasebut the legislative history and regulations make clear that a removal because of a statutory bar <i>is</i> one for the \"efficiency of the service,\" thereby triggering the opportunityand obligationto use the MSPB procedures and to seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' contrary suggestion rests on a misreading of <i>Department of the Navy v. Egan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span> (1988). There, the Court relied on the ground given in a removal notice to conclude that the action was taken under the \"efficiency of the service\" standard and <i>not</i> on grounds of national security. <i>Id.</i> at 522 &amp; n. 4, 523, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>. A national security removal is explicitly exempted from all \"other statutes\" and review is narrowly limited. 5 U.S.C. § 7532; <i>see id.</i> § 7512(A) (exempting a section 7532 removal); <i>Egan,</i> 484 U.S. at 525-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>. Here, no such statutory exemption applies, and the notice merely particularizes the \"efficiency of the service\" basis for the removal.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the MSPB has suggested that a person who was wrongly hired in the face of an absolute statutory bar was never an \"employee\" at all because the appointment was void <i>ab initio,</i> and therefore, when the error is discovered, the person removed is not a former \"employee\" who can invoke the CSRA. <i>E.g., </i><i>Hope v. Dep't of the Army,</i> 108 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (2008) (citing cases). This \"reasoning,\" <i>see </i><i>Travaglini v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132-37 (1983), <i>aff'd as modified,</i> 23 M.S.P.R. 417 (1984), underlies statements by the Board, occasionally noted but not endorsed by the Federal Circuit,<sup>[3]</sup> that a removal because of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> an absolute statutory bar is outside the Board's authority under the CSRA because the employee should not have been hired in the first place.</p>\n<p>This is not the approach taken by modern courts in construing remedial statutes, and the government should be embarrassed ever to have taken advantage of such question begging rhetoric. The plaintiffs in this case were hired by the federal government, served (in some cases for many years) as its employees, exercised official authority, and were then terminated. The idea that Congress would implicitly exclude them from the category of former \"employees\" entitled to seek redress under the CSRAif and to the extent that their removal was outside a statutory bar or that the bar was itself unconstitutionalbeggars belief.</p>\n<p>The CSRA governs \"removals\"; nothing in its language suggests that a case involving a statutory bar follows a different route; and the legislative history already described refutes any such suggestion. Of course, <i>if</i> the employee comes within the statutory bar <i>and</i> the statutory bar is constitutional, the discharged employee will not get reinstated; but the proper outcome should be a decision denying reinstatement on the merits. Thus, the statutory route gives the plaintiff a full opportunity to present both questions to the Federal Circuit, which is an Article III court.</p>\n<p>Fifth, this brings us at last to the question whether there is some implied exception to the exclusive CSRA remedy because the challenge in this case is a constitutional one sounding in equity or because it is a facial constitutional attack rather than an \"as-applied\" challenge. The Supreme Court has already ruled that <i>Bivens</i>-type constitutional claims for damages cannot bypass CSRA limitations, <i>Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. at 368, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110965\"><a href=\"/opinion/110965/bush-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2404</span></a></span>; and as to equitable constitutional claims, there is something of a circuit split,<sup>[4]</sup> but this circuit has been firm in treating the CSRA remedy as exclusive as to equitable constitutional claims as well.</p>\n<p>Thus, this court held in <i>Berrios</i> that an employee fired by the government could not bring a due process claim and other facial and as-applied constitutional claims by an original action in the district court but had to follow the CSRA scheme through the MSPB into the Federal Circuit. 884 F.2d at 31. Another decision in this circuit reaffirmed the general rule but found it inapplicable because the employee's classification excluded him from the CSRA remedy. <i>Pathak v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199737\"><a href=\"/opinion/199737/pathak-v-department-of-vet/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31-33 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>see also </i><i>Irizarry v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792255\"><a href=\"/opinion/792255/no-05-1205/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 77-78 (1st Cir.2005). None of our cases has adopted the distinction urged nor does it have any obvious basis in policy.</p>\n<p>Constitutional claims are common in administrative proceedingsespecially equal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> protection and procedural due process claimsand are part of the ordinary fodder of review in discharge cases. Often such claims are made along with factual claims denying the conduct alleged against the employee and statutory or rule-based claims as well. Congress' desire to consolidate employee removal in a single forum was based on the action taken against the employee rather than the precise arguments made in contesting that action.</p>\n<p>What matters in the end is whether the CSRA process can afford relief. The plaintiffs argue that a <i>facial</i> claim attacking the underlying statute is one for which the MSPB <i>cannot</i> grant relief to them and therefore the premisethat the CSRA remedy is exclusive where it appliesdoes not itself apply. And to show that there is no MSPB remedy, the plaintiffs point to statements by the MSPB itself that it, \"as an administrative agency, is without authority to determine the constitutionality of Federal statutes.\" <i>Bayly v. OPM,</i> 42 M.S.P.R. 524, 525-26 (1990).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>But while the Board may be powerless to strike down the statute, the Federal Circuit on review of the Board may do so, 5 U.S.C. § 7703(c), and, if it agreed with the plaintiffs on the merits, remand to the Board to grant relief. <i>See </i><i>Shalala v.

Accordingly, the CSRA regime <i>does</i> provide an opportunity for the plaintiffs to obtain a full determination of their facial constitutional challenge. Indeed, even if the MSPB had the first word on the constitutional issue, it certainly would not have the last.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs object that the Federal Circuit has regularly said that its jurisdiction is coextensive with that of the MSPB as to the categories of cases that fall within the CSRA. <i>E.g., </i><i>Rosano v. Dep't of the Navy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414322\"><a href=\"/opinion/414322/lawrence-r-rosano-v-department-of-the-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></a></span>, 1318 (Fed.Cir.1983). That proposition happens to be true as a general statement, but it was not made by the Federal Circuit in our context and would make no sense if it were: for in such cases the MSPB is limited only because of a doctrine that uniquely applies to administrative agencies and <i>not</i> to the Federal Circuit or any other Article III court.</p>\n<p>The Federal Circuit has never said that it was powerless to act where a removal occurred and the underlying statute that prompted the removal was itself unconstitutional. On the contrary, that court has said that if a colorable constitutional claim were presented, it would have to address the issue. <i>See </i><i>Riggin v.

And if it mistakenly held otherwise, the remedy would be on certiorari to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The substantive constitutional claims in this case are unpromising, given that one conflicts with governing Supreme Court precedent and the other ignores the fact that the plaintiffs were free to avoid the bar by timely registration. But the CSRA channels removals covered by the CSRA and thus the plaintiffs' claimsto the Federal Circuit, <i>see </i><i>Hall v.

Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>The majority reaches a reasoned conclusion, but I believe it falls short in considering fully the question of whether there is an applicable exception to the CSRA's preclusive effect. To be sure, the majority disposes of the plaintiffs' arguments regarding constitutional challenges generally and facial attacks specifically. It does not, however, take head-on the issue of whether federal district court jurisdiction remains intact if the CSRA does not afford meaningful review to the plaintiffs' colorable constitutional claims that sound in equity.<sup>[6]</sup> Because I find that the plaintiffs' claims would be unreviewable under the CSRA's remedial scheme, I would hold that federal district court jurisdiction exists, just as our sister circuits have done in comparable cases. <i>See </i><i>Am.

The MSPB consistently dismisses appeals related to terminations pursuant to § 3328 on these grounds, a position the government regularly advances before the Board and on which it succeeded in the MSPB appeal by Mr. Elgin, a plaintiff in this matter. <i>E.g., Charner v. OPM,</i> No. PH-3443-08-0601-I-2, 2009 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 1296, at *10-11 (Mar. 6, 2009) (unpublished); <i>Whitfield v. Dep't of Interior,</i> No. DC-0752-09-0094-I-1, 2008 M.S.P.B.

LEXIS 7502, at *9 (Nov. 16, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>Indeed, the MSPB has often deemed frivolous the assertion that it has jurisdiction over cases contesting removals pursuant to § 3328. <i>See, e.g., Whitfield,</i> 2008 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 6910, at *1; <i>Clarke v. OPM,</i> No. DA-3443-07-0538-I-1, 2007 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 7101, at *1 n. 1 (Dec. 17, 2007) (unpublished); <i>Belmares-Avalos v.

Moreover, the regulations promulgated by OPM are entitled \"Statutory Bar to Appointment of Persons Who Fail to Register Under Selective Service Law,\" and they state that administrative review beyond OPM's determination is prohibited. 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.701-.707; <i>id.</i> at .706(c).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Because the MSPB has routinely stated that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claims on the merits, it appears to me that the Federal Circuit is without jurisdiction to do so as well. The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is derivative of the MSPB's jurisdiction, and it is problematic whether the Federal Circuit has the ability to decide matters beyond that of the Board. <i>See </i><i>Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559999\"><a href=\"/opinion/559999/george-perez-v-merit-systems-protection-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 855 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\"Since the MSPB had no jurisdiction, the merits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> of Perez's challenge ... were not before the MSPB for decision; nor are they before us.\"); <i>Carroll v.

Cir.1983) (\"`[W]ith respect to cases brought under [5 U.S.C. §] 7701, the scope of the subject matter jurisdiction of this court is identical to the scope of the jurisdiction of the Board.'\" (quoting <i>Rosano v.

The evidence to support these assertions, however, is elusive. First, although no plaintiff, in this suit or others, who was removed under § 3328 has ever sought Federal Circuit review of the MSPB's decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the case law and regulations cited above suggest that such efforts would be futile. Time and again the MSPB has dismissed these cases, claiming that it is unable to grant relief, and an appeal to the Federal Circuit seems almost certain to result in a simple affirmance. <i>See Daneshpayeh,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">18964</span></span>, 1994 U.S.App. LEXIS 14360.</p>\n<p>Second, the Federal Circuit has never reached beyond the limits of the MSPB to hear the merits of a claim otherwise barred from review. In only one instance has it hypothesized the possibility, and never before has it acted on the idea. <i>See </i><i>Brockmann v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672461\"><a href=\"/opinion/672461/stephen-s-brockmann-v-department-of-the-air-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 546-47 (Fed.Cir.1994) (acknowledging Supreme Court precedent supporting review of colorable constitutional claims otherwise barred, but finding precedent inapplicable because plaintiffs' claims unreviewable by the MSPB were not colorable). Indeed, when the Federal Circuit did confront a plaintiff covered by the CSRA who asserted constitutional claims that were beyond MSPB review, it affirmed the dismissal of his suit for lack of jurisdiction, rather than providing a forum for his constitutional claims. <i>Hubbard v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> 319 Fed.Appx. 912 (Fed.Cir.2009) (unpublished). Such case law provides little comfort that the plaintiffs in this matter would fare any better.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>To be sure, administrative boards have been declared competent to review constitutional issues otherwise perhaps beyond their scope. <i>See </i><i>Shalala v.

In these instances, however, the administrative schemes at issue expressly precluded federal district court jurisdiction, and, therefore, would leave the constitutional claims without any forum were the boards unable to review them. <i>See </i><i>Shalala,</i> 529 U.S. at 5, 8, 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118342\"><a href=\"/opinion/118342/shalala-v-illinois-council-on-long-term-care-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Chapter 75 of the CSRA allows an agency to remove an employee \"only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and upon such action, the employee \"is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\" 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a), (d). Nowhere does the statute indicate explicitly that a plaintiff may not challenge his termination by raising colorable constitutional claims in federal court.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Our sister courts in the Ninth, Third, and D.C. Circuits have held similarly and allowed federal employees to bring constitutional claims in district court actions seeking equitable relief. <i>See </i><i>Stone,</i> 502 F.3d at 1034-39 (holding CSRA did not preclude judicial review of plaintiffs' First Amendment constitutional claims for equitable relief when plaintiffs had no remedy under the statute); <i>Mitchum,</i> 73 F.3d at 34-36 (finding CSRA and comparable statutes did not preclude federal district court review of plaintiffs' constitutional claims for injunctive and declaratory relief because CSRA not sufficiently clear to restrict federal power to grant equitable relief for constitutional violations); <i>Hubbard,</i> 809 F.2d at 11-12 &amp; n. 15 (holding federal district court had jurisdiction over First Amendment claim because the \"CSRA does not preclude federal employees from seeking equitable relief against agencies for allegedly unconstitutional personnel actions\"); <i>Spagnola,</i> 859 F.2d at 229-30 (\"[T]ime and again this court has affirmed the right of civil servants to seek equitable relief against their supervisors, and the agency itself, in vindication of their constitutional rights.\").</p>\n<p>The Eleventh, Seventh, and Fourth Circuits have expressly avoided the question of whether the CSRA forecloses equitable relief for colorable constitutional claims; indeed, the Eleventh and Fourth Circuits have distinguished or questioned their prior precedent that suggests preclusion. <i>See </i><i>Hardison v.

Rather, the statute is entirely prospective in nature. President Carter's Proclamation issued on July 2, 1980, dictated that men born on or after January 1, 1960, are required to register with the Selective Service System. Those born in the years 1960, 1961, and 1962 had six specified days to register. All men born during or after 1963 have thirty days both before and after their eighteenth birthdays to comply. Proclamation No. 4771.</p>\n<p>Section 3328 became effective on November 8, 1985. On this date, the oldest person subject to its provisions would have been twenty-five. Thus, even if an individual had failed to satisfy timely the dictates of President Carter's Proclamation, under § 3328, he still had the opportunity to register with the Selective Service System and avoid disqualification from federal employment. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. §§ 300.704(b), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> 300.705(c); <i>cf. </i><i>Selective Serv.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3348</span></a></span>, when it held that § 12(f) of the Military Selective Service Act, which denies federal financial assistance to male students who fail to register for the draft, did not meet the specification requirement to constitute a bill of attainder.<sup>[13]</sup> Similar to § 3328, § 12(f) was enacted before any men subject to it would have been too old to register with the Selective Service System. Because § 12(f)'s implementing regulations permitted nonregistrants to register late, meaning, after the timeline delineated in Proclamation 4771, § 12(f) was not retrospective.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs counter that § 3328 is nevertheless a bill of attainder because it penalizes an easily identifiable group of men age twenty-six and older who are no longer eligible to register for the draft. They argue that Supreme Court precedent and historical parliamentary acts demonstrate that legislation qualifies as a bill of attainder even when punishment occurs post-enactment and is conditioned on future behavior. They advance that § 3328 is such a bill because it makes termination contingent upon the subsequent act of failing to register for the draft before turning twenty-six. Relatedly, they also assert that § 3328 should be evaluated as a bill of attainder at the time of enforcement rather than the time of enactment, and that under such analysis, the statute meets the specification element because men currently age twenty-six and older who did not register for the draft represent an easily ascertainable group.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' arguments miss the mark. To be sure, the Supreme Court has held that a statute conditioning punishment on future behavior may still constitute a bill of attainder, but this assertion is irrelevant. Such statutes have met the specificity requirement because they have identified specific individuals or groups based on prior acts, irrespective of also providing these individuals with a means to escape punishment through some future performance. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 381 U.S. at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107081\"><a href=\"/opinion/107081/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 3328, however, does not identify individuals in this manner because it is not directed at people who committed prior acts. Rather, it is a broadly drawn statute of general applicability directed at prospective conduct and affecting all men regardless of their past actions, political affiliations, or ideological beliefs.</p>\n<p>With respect to the plaintiffs' insistence that the court evaluate § 3328 at the time of enforcement rather than at the time of enactment, I would reject it. A statute meets the specification element if it identifies individuals by name or by description of prior conduct so that it \"operates only as a designation of particular persons.\" <i>Communist Party,</i> 367 U.S. at 86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106267\"><a href=\"/opinion/106267/communist-party-of-united-states-v-subversive-activities-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Punishment</h2>\n<p>Even if § 3328 fulfilled the specificity element, I would still find that it does not constitute a bill of attainder because it does not inflict punishment. Courts evaluate whether a statute satisfies the punishment element for bill of attainder purposes by considering: (1) whether the statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether, in view of the type and severity of the burdens imposed, the statute reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3) whether the legislative record demonstrates a congressional intent to punish. <i>Selective Serv.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2646</span></a></span>. It then held that the statute was not an instance of unlawful gender discrimination. The government had an important interest in raising and supporting armies, as detailed in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. <i>Id.</i> at 70-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2646</span></a></span>. The gender classification excluding women from the draft was closely related to this interest because the purpose of registration was to facilitate a draft for combat troops, and women were ineligible for combat. <i>Id.</i> at 75-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2646</span></a></span>. No part of <i>Rostker</i> has been overruled, and its holding would foreclose any review of the plaintiffs' claim.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the current reality of the armed forces represents a marked shift from 1981, when <i>Rostker</i> was decided. According to the plaintiffs' complaint, more than 200,000 women presently serve in the United States military, and women now make up 15 percent of the armed forces, compared to 8.4 percent in 1980. Legislation enacted after the decision is <i>Rostker</i> permits women to serve on Navy combat ships and fly combat aircraft, and a new Navy policy will allow women to serve on submarines. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 103-160, § 541, 107 Stat. 1547, 1659 (1993) (repealing ban on assignment of women to combat ships); Pub.L. No. 102-190, § 531, 105 Stat. 1290, 1365 (1991) (repealing ban on women from serving on aircraft engaged in combat missions); Commander, Submarine Forces Public Affairs, <i>Navy Policy Will Allow Women to Serve Aboard Submarines,</i> navy.mil, (Apr. 29, 2010, 6:35 AM), http://www.navy.mil/search/display. asp?story_id=52954. Even more, the congressional Military Leadership Diversity Commission recently issued a final report urging Congress to allow women into male-only land combat units. <i>From Representation to Inclusion: Diversity Leadership for the 21st-Century Military,</i> Final Report (Military Leadership Diversity Comm'n, Arlington, Va.) Mar. 15, 2011, at 71-74, 127, <i>available at</i> http://mldc.whs. mil/index.php/final-report.</p>\n<p>Despite these developments, women are still precluded from ground combat positions. Further, Congress has demonstrated an acute awareness of the gender distinctions in draft registration requirements, and yet it has not amended the statute. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Pub.L. No. 109-163, § 541(a)(1), 119 Stat. 3136, 3251-52 (2006) (directing Secretary of Defense to provide advance notice of changes to ground combat policy along with \"detailed analysis of legal implication of the proposed change with respect to the constitutionality of the application of the Military Selective Service Act to males only.\" (internal citation omitted)). Indeed, the House's Armed Service Committee took pains to explain <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> that repeals to certain bans on women-in-combat positions should not be \"construed as tacit committee concurrence in an expansion of the assignment of women to units or positions whose mission requires routine engagement in direct combat on the ground, or be seen as a suggestion that selective service registration or conscription include women.\" H.R.Rep. No. 103-200, pt. 2 (1993). In any event, it would not be for this court to determine what, if any, impact these developments had on the continued vitality of <i>Rostker,</i> a task left solely to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

I believe that the majority oversteps in reaching this conclusion. First, as cited above, the MSPB routinely holds that it cannot hear appeals contesting removals based on absolute statutory prohibitions to appointment, and this precedent appears firmly established.\n</p>\n<p>Second, the Federal Circuit has hardly indicated any error in the Board's finding. In <i>Diamond v. U.S. Agency for International Development,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737033\"><a href=\"/opinion/737033/dennis-g-diamond-v-us-agency-for-international-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (Fed.Cir.1997), it cited with approval <i>Travaglini v. Department of Education,</i> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132 (1983), one of the leading cases to discuss the doctrine, although it did not apply the doctrine to the case at hand. In <i>Daneshpayeh v. Department of the Air Force,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">18964</span></span>, 1994 U.S.App. LEXIS 14360, an unreported and non-precedential opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the MSPB's decision that the Board could not grant relief to a federal employee terminated pursuant to an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment. Although the court indicated in a footnote that it may have been incorrect for the MSPB to term this holding \"jurisdictional,\" it still found that the Board could not grant relief because the employee's appointment was illegal. It is immaterial whether an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment is \"jurisdictional\" or simply precludes review; under either circumstance, the Board is unable to hear the merits of a plaintiff's claim.</p>\n<p>[8]  The majority suggests that were the Federal Circuit not to address a colorable constitutional claim, the remedy would be on certiorari to the Supreme Court and not via a plenary federal district court action. I disagree with the majority because the doctrine obliging review of constitutional claims is relevant only when review is otherwise unavailable. Here, it appears that review under the CSRA's administrative scheme is foreclosed, and so I do not see why the federal district court is not the proper forum to review the claims. Indeed, the several circuits that have invoked this doctrine in the context of the CSRA have done so despite the Federal Circuit's ostensible ability to do the same. <i>See </i><i>Stone,</i> 502 F.3d at 1034-39; <i>Mitchum,</i> 73 F.3d at 34-36; <i>Hubbard,</i> 809 F.2d at 11-12.</p>\n<p>[9]  To the extent that the majority opinion suggests that the plaintiffs' claims are not colorable, I disagree. There is a difference between colorable and meritorious claims, and although I would dismiss the plaintiffs claims as a matter of law, I do not find them lacking in \"potential validity,\" <i>see </i><i>Makieh v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203910\"><a href=\"/opinion/203910/makieh-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2009). The district court's initial holding on the bill of attainder claim demonstrates as much.</p>\n<p>[10]  Unpublished opinions from this court and opinions from other courts act as persuasive authority and are not binding precedent. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 32.1; 1st Cir. R. 32.1.0(a); <i>United States v. Stepanian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203888\"><a href=\"/opinion/203888/united-states-v-stepanian/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57 n. 10 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[11]  Although the majority claims that <i>Berrios</i> definitely answers our present matter, the case is distinct. In <i>Berrios,</i> the plaintiff was afforded and took advantage of available CSRA remedies, and so the rationale for district court jurisdiction would not apply. Here, however, the plaintiffs have no statutory remedies.</p>\n<p>[12]  Indeed, in <i>Pathak</i> we acknowledged that, despite the CSRA's expansive reach, we might have jurisdiction to review the plaintiffs claims, were they colorable. 274 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Supreme Court also determined that the statute did not meet the punishment requirement. As explained below, I would hold that neither does § 3328.</p>\n<p>[14]  The Constitution extends the prohibition of bills of attainder to the states. U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1 (\"No State shall ... pass any Bill of Attainder....\").</p>\n<p>[15]  The Supreme Court has noted the elusiveness of escaping punishment under the Missouri amendment at issue in <i>Cummings.</i> In effect, prior Confederate sympathizers could not evade the employment bar because their only options were to abstain from the oath and lose their livelihood, or take the oath and perjure themselves. <i>See </i><i>Selective Serv. Sys.,</i> 468 U.S. at 848, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111260\"><a href=\"/opinion/111260/selective-service-system-v-minnesota-public-interest-research-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3348</span></a></span>. To the extent that the plaintiffs analogize the Missouri amendment to § 3328 in that both provide \"escape clauses,\" § 3328 does not present the double bind at issue in <i>Cummings</i> since men subject to § 3328 can avoid punishment through lawful actions.</p>\n\n</div>",
