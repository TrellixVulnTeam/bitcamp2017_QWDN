Petitioner Onsy Zakhary1 seeks review of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals's (\"BIA\") order affirming the denial\n\nof his application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.                   We affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n              Petitioner, a native and citizen of Egypt, was a resident\n\nof Italy when he entered this country at Boston, Massachusetts, on\n\nFebruary 12, 1998, as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to\n\nremain   in    the     United   States      for     a    temporary    period     ending\n\nFebruary 12, 1999.          On October 18, 1999, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization       Service      (\"INS\")       commenced     removal    proceedings\n\nagainst petitioner by filing a Notice to Appear in immigration\n\ncourt.    He     was    charged    with     being       removable    under   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who, after admission to the United\n\nStates as a nonimmigrant, remained in the United States longer than\n\npermitted.\n\n              At the hearing before the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") the\n\npetitioner, through counsel, admitted some factual allegations\n\nagainst him, conceded removability and requested asylum.                         The IJ\n\nfound that the application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)\n\n(2)(B). The IJ also found, in the alternative, that petitioner had\n\n\n\n1\n   Fadia Sadek also seeks asylum. The basis of her claim is that\nshe married Onsy Zakhary in Massachusetts in 2001. Because her\nclaim is derivative, our affirmance of the BIA's denial of\nZakhary's claim necessarily affirms the denial of her claim.\n\n                                          -2-\n\ffiled a frivolous asylum application after receiving warnings about\n\nfiling such an application.           Further, the IJ found that the\n\npetitioner had been firmly resettled in Italy before entering the\n\nUnited States. Accordingly, he was ordered removed to Italy, or in\n\nthe alternative, to Egypt.\n\n           Some confusion exists as to whether petitioner will be\n\nallowed into Italy.       Petitioner bases his claim of asylum on his\n\nassertion that he will not be accepted into Italy and will be\n\nreturned to Egypt, where he claims to fear persecution.                  We may\n\naffirm, however, without addressing whether petitioner will be\n\naccepted   into   Italy    because,    even   assuming    arguendo      he   were\n\nreturned to Egypt, his claim for asylum fails.            That is because we\n\nconclude that petitioner was firmly resettled in Italy and so\n\nineligible for asylum.      The finding of firm resettlement precludes\n\nasylum relief whether or not petitioner will have difficulty\n\nreturning to Italy.       See Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n           Petitioner's      appeal   to    the   BIA   claims   that   he   had\n\nestablished extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely\n\napplication and that he had a valid asylum claim.           The BIA affirmed\n\nthe application's denial for the reasons contained in the IJ's oral\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdecision but reversed the finding that the petition was frivolous.\n\nThis appeal followed.2\n\n                                       II.\n\n             Petitioner   bears       the    burden    of    demonstrating    his\n\neligibility for asylum.      He must meet that burden by showing past\n\npersecution or fear of future persecution.                   \"Determinations of\n\neligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation are reviewed\n\nunder the substantial evidence standard.\" Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333\n\nF.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003); Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The agency decision is upheld if it is \"supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"         Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18 (quoting INS v.\n\nElías-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).                  \"This standard is a\n\ndeferential one: the petitioner must demonstrate that the evidence\n\nhe presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\" Id. (internal\n\nquotations     and    citation    omitted).         Applicants    must   provide\n\nconclusive evidence that they were targeted or fear becoming\n\ntargets for persecution.        Id.    To show fear of future persecution,\n\napplicants must meet both subjective and objective prongs.                    Id.\n\nThe   asylum   applicant's    fear     must    be    genuine    and   objectively\n\nreasonable.      To   satisfy    the    objective      prong,    an   applicant's\n\n\n2\n   Petitioner argued in his brief that the IJ's finding that his\napplication was untimely should be reversed. Because we affirm on\nthe merits, we need not address this procedural claim.\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftestimony alone may be sufficient, but it must constitute credible,\n\ndirect and specific evidence of a reasonable fear of persecution.\n\nEl Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             Petitioner is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. He testified\n\nto the following facts.          While growing up in Egypt, he was a\n\npracticing Christian.        His first alleged experience of persecution\n\nwas in 1960 while he attended an academy for electronic studies.\n\nHe alleges that he was subject to harassment, including insults and\n\nthe burning of his books.         The administrators threatened to fail\n\nhim, and he left the academy.\n\n             Petitioner returned home from the academy and remained\n\nthere for two years.         He worked in a variety of jobs and then\n\nenlisted to perform his mandatory service in the Egyptian army,\n\nwhere the petitioner faced what he alleges to be the second\n\ninstance of persecution.           The alleged persecution involved a\n\ncommander who, according to petitioner, ordered him to attend\n\nlectures about Islam, knowing he was a Christian.            At the lecture,\n\na cleric took him aside and spoke to him about conversion to Islam.\n\nAfter   he    refused   to    convert,     the   cleric   reported    this   to\n\npetitioner's commander.          Petitioner alleges that his off-base\n\nprivileges were revoked.         He was thereafter confined for about\n\ntwenty days in what he alleges were harsh conditions.                Petitioner\n\nsaid that after his release from confinement he went to his brother\n\nYousry Zakhary's house. Petitioner never returned to the army. He\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fworked in his brother's store until he left for Lebanon in February\n\n1975.\n\n          Petitioner eventually settled in Italy, where he stayed\n\nfrom 1977 until his departure for the United States in 1998.\n\nDuring that time, petitioner had a valid Italian work permit and\n\noperated a dry-cleaning business.      Petitioner and Fadia Sadek had\n\ntwo daughters while they lived in Italy.         Petitioner visited the\n\nUnited States fifteen times during the time he lived in Italy and\n\nnever applied for asylum.\n\n          The government argues that petitioner is ineligible for\n\nasylum in the United States because he had \"firmly resettled\" in\n\nItaly. Under the regulatory scheme, 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13 and 208.15,\n\nan IJ may not grant asylum to any applicant who \"has been firmly\n\nresettled within the meaning of § 208.15.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)\n\n(2)(i)(B); see also Yang v. INS, 79 F.3d 932, 939 (9th Cir.\n\n1996)(holding   that   resettlement    in   a   third   country   normally\n\nprecludes asylum).     The definition of \"firm resettlement\" states\n\nthat:\n\n          An alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, prior\n          to arrival in the United States, he or she entered into\n          another country with, or while in that country received,\n          an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or\n          some other type of permanent resettlement unless he or\n          she establishes:\n\n          (a)     That his or her entry into that country was a\n                  necessary consequence of his or her flight from\n                  persecution, that he or she remained in that\n                  nation only as long as was necessary to arrange\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                      onward travel, and that he or she did not\n                      establish significant ties in that country; or\n           (b)        That the conditions of his or her residence in\n                      that   country   were   so   substantially   and\n                      consciously restricted by the authority of the\n                      country of refuge that he or she was not in fact\n                      resettled.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.15.\n\n           There is substantial evidence that petitioner was firmly\n\nresettled in Italy.       Courts have consistently upheld BIA decisions\n\nin which asylum was denied because the applicants were found to\n\nhave firmly resettled.         See Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 45, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 2004);        see also     Mussie v. INS, 172 F.3d 329, 332 (4th\n\nCir.   1999);    Cheo    v.   INS,    162     F.3d   1227,   1229-30   (9th    Cir.\n\n1998)(firm resettlement in Malaysia after Cambodian nationals lived\n\nthere for three years).         Petitioner lived in Italy for more than\n\ntwo decades, operated a business, lived with Fadia Sadek, had two\n\ndaughters with her, and by his own admission, did not want to leave\n\nbecause   he    was   happy   in     Italy.      There   are   no   indicia    that\n\npetitioner was still \"in flight\" in Italy or that Italy, as country\n\nof refuge, restricted him in any way.                Therefore, we affirm the\n\ndenial of asylum.\n\n           If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, he is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of removal.            Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.            Since\n\npetitioner has not met the standard for well-founded fear of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpersecution,       he    cannot   meet   the     standard          for   withholding     of\n\nremoval.     The IJ's decision as to withholding is affirmed.\n\n             Petitioner makes a final argument, based on his belief\n\nthat if he is returned to Italy he will be subsequently deported to\n\nEgypt, where he alleges he will be tortured.                      Under Article III of\n\nthe Convention Against Torture, petitioner must demonstrate that it\n\nis more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to\n\nEgypt   in   order      to    obtain   relief.         8    C.F.R.       §   208.16(c)(2).\n\nPetitioner produced only his own testimony that he was tortured in\n\nthe past, which the IJ did not find credible. Petitioner presented\n\nno documentary evidence to substantiate his allegations of torture\n\nin Egypt. Further, his accounts were contradicted by a witness who\n\nsaw petitioner          frequently     during    the       time    he    alleges   he    was\n\ntortured.    We see no reason to disturb the IJ's findings as to the\n\nTorture Convention claims and the BIA's affirmance thereof.\n\n                                         III.\n\n             For    the      reasons   stated    above,           the    BIA's   order    is\n\naffirmed.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f",

He testified\n\nto the following facts.          While growing up in Egypt, he was a\n\npracticing Christian.        His first alleged experience of persecution\n\nwas in 1960 while he attended an academy for electronic studies.\n\nHe alleges that he was subject to harassment, including insults and\n\nthe burning of his books.         The administrators threatened to fail\n\nhim, and he left the academy.\n\n             Petitioner returned home from the academy and remained\n\nthere for two years.         He worked in a variety of jobs and then\n\nenlisted to perform his mandatory service in the Egyptian army,\n\nwhere the petitioner faced what he alleges to be the second\n\ninstance of persecution.           The alleged persecution involved a\n\ncommander who, according to petitioner, ordered him to attend\n\nlectures about Islam, knowing he was a Christian.            At the lecture,\n\na cleric took him aside and spoke to him about conversion to Islam.\n\nAfter   he    refused   to    convert,     the   cleric   reported    this   to\n\npetitioner's commander.          Petitioner alleges that his off-base\n\nprivileges were revoked.         He was thereafter confined for about\n\ntwenty days in what he alleges were harsh conditions.                Petitioner\n\nsaid that after his release from confinement he went to his brother\n\nYousry Zakhary's house. Petitioner never returned to the army. He\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fworked in his brother's store until he left for Lebanon in February\n\n1975.\n\n          Petitioner eventually settled in Italy, where he stayed\n\nfrom 1977 until his departure for the United States in 1998.\n\nDuring that time, petitioner had a valid Italian work permit and\n\noperated a dry-cleaning business.      Petitioner and Fadia Sadek had\n\ntwo daughters while they lived in Italy.         Petitioner visited the\n\nUnited States fifteen times during the time he lived in Italy and\n\nnever applied for asylum.\n\n          The government argues that petitioner is ineligible for\n\nasylum in the United States because he had \"firmly resettled\" in\n\nItaly. Under the regulatory scheme, 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13 and 208.15,\n\nan IJ may not grant asylum to any applicant who \"has been firmly\n\nresettled within the meaning of § 208.15.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)\n\n(2)(i)(B); see also Yang v.

The definition of \"firm resettlement\" states\n\nthat:\n\n          An alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, prior\n          to arrival in the United States, he or she entered into\n          another country with, or while in that country received,\n          an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or\n          some other type of permanent resettlement unless he or\n          she establishes:\n\n          (a)     That his or her entry into that country was a\n                  necessary consequence of his or her flight from\n                  persecution, that he or she remained in that\n                  nation only as long as was necessary to arrange\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                      onward travel, and that he or she did not\n                      establish significant ties in that country; or\n           (b)        That the conditions of his or her residence in\n                      that   country   were   so   substantially   and\n                      consciously restricted by the authority of the\n                      country of refuge that he or she was not in fact\n                      resettled.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.15.\n\n           There is substantial evidence that petitioner was firmly\n\nresettled in Italy.       Courts have consistently upheld BIA decisions\n\nin which asylum was denied because the applicants were found to\n\nhave firmly resettled.         See Salazar v.

Petitioner lived in Italy for more than\n\ntwo decades, operated a business, lived with Fadia Sadek, had two\n\ndaughters with her, and by his own admission, did not want to leave\n\nbecause   he    was   happy   in     Italy.      There   are   no   indicia    that\n\npetitioner was still \"in flight\" in Italy or that Italy, as country\n\nof refuge, restricted him in any way.                Therefore, we affirm the\n\ndenial of asylum.\n\n           If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, he is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of removal.            Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.            Since\n\npetitioner has not met the standard for well-founded fear of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpersecution,       he    cannot   meet   the     standard          for   withholding     of\n\nremoval.     The IJ's decision as to withholding is affirmed.\n\n             Petitioner makes a final argument, based on his belief\n\nthat if he is returned to Italy he will be subsequently deported to\n\nEgypt, where he alleges he will be tortured.                      Under Article III of\n\nthe Convention Against Torture, petitioner must demonstrate that it\n\nis more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to\n\nEgypt   in   order      to    obtain   relief.         8    C.F.R.       §   208.16(c)(2).\n\nPetitioner produced only his own testimony that he was tortured in\n\nthe past, which the IJ did not find credible. Petitioner presented\n\nno documentary evidence to substantiate his allegations of torture\n\nin Egypt. Further, his accounts were contradicted by a witness who\n\nsaw petitioner          frequently     during    the       time    he    alleges   he    was\n\ntortured.    We see no reason to disturb the IJ's findings as to the\n\nTorture Convention claims and the BIA's affirmance thereof.\n\n                                         III.\n\n             For    the      reasons   stated    above,           the    BIA's   order    is\n\naffirmed.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f</pre>",
