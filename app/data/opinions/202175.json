George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Timothy G. Watkins, on brief for the appellant.\n     Paul G. Levenson, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for the\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 20, 2006\n\f               Per Curiam.      Defendant Gary Sagendorf was found\n\nguilty, after a jury trial, of trafficking in counterfeit goods\n\n(i.e., counterfeit \"Stolichnaya\" vodka) in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2320.         At his original sentencing, which occurred\n\nbefore the Supreme Court issued its decision in United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), the primary issue in dispute\n\nwas whether or to what extent Sagendorf's sentence should be\n\nenhanced under USSG § 2B5.3 based on the \"infringement amount.\"\n\nThe district court ultimately enhanced the sentence 12 levels\n\non that ground and sentenced Sagendorf to the bottom of the\n\nresulting guideline range, i.e., 41 months.\n\n               Sagendorf appealed from his sentence (but not his\n\nconviction). His brief challenged his sentence on two grounds:\n\n(1)     that     the   district    court    committed   a    guidelines\n\ninterpretation error in calculating the infringement amount and\n\n(2) that he was entitled to resentencing under Booker, which\n\nhad come down after sentencing but before appellate briefing.\n\nAfter Sagendorf filed his brief but before the government\n\nresponded, Sagendorf filed an unopposed motion to withdraw his\n\nbrief    and     remand   the   case   to   the   district   court   for\n\nresentencing. In that motion, Sagendorf expressly \"agree[d] to\n\nwithdraw his appeal and to abandon his claim that the district\n\ncourt incorrectly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines.\" In so\n\ndoing, Sagendorf expressed his understanding \"that if this\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fCourt   remands        the    case     as    requested          in    this     motion,     the\n\ndistrict      court     will      be     permitted          to       determine       whether\n\nSagendorf's sentence should be reduced in light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Booker and the sentencing goals set out in\n\n18   U.S.C.    §3553(a)        and     will        use    its    computation          of    the\n\nguideline     sentencing        range        as     advisory.\"             Sagendorf       also\n\nexpressly stated that he \"underst[ood] that the district court\n\nis not obligated to alter the sentence on remand, and may re-\n\nimpose the sentence that is the subject of this appeal.\"                                   \"In\n\naccordance with\" Sagendorf's motion, we remanded the case for\n\nresentencing.\n\n              The sentence imposed on remand was identical to that\n\nimposed under the mandatory guidelines.                               In appealing the\n\nreimposed      sentence,         Sagendorf               challenges         it   both       as\n\nunreasonable          under     Booker        (because          the       district     court\n\npurportedly gave presumptive weight to the guidelines) and as\n\nbased on an incorrect calculation of the guideline sentencing\n\nrange. Given the course of events described above, we conclude\n\nthat    Sagendorf        waived        any    argument          that       the   guideline\n\ncalculations were incorrect.                  See United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (finding it \"difficult to\n\nconceive    of    a    more     conspicuous          example         of    a   knowing     and\n\nvoluntary abandonment of a legal right\" than when \"[a] party\n\nidentifies       an    issue,    and        then    explicitly            withdraws    it\").\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f  \"Although an appellate court has discretion to excuse waiver\n\n  'in the interests of justice,'\" Olsen v. United States, 414\n\n  F.3d 144, 154 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S.\n\n  140, 155, & n.15 (1986)), we see no reason to do so here.\n\n             We   therefore   turn   to    Sagendorf's   only   remaining\n\n  claim: that, by re-imposing the 41-month sentence (rather than\n\n  the 13-month sentence that Sagendorf sought), the district\n\n  court treated the guideline sentencing range as \"presumptive.\"\n\n  If so, that would be inconsistent with this court's recent\n\n  decision in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518\n\n  (1st Cir. 2006), in which we declined to view the guidelines,\n\n  post-Booker, as \"presumptively controlling.\"1            We disagree,\n\n  however, with Sagendorf's characterization of the district\n\n  court's methodology.    Our own    review of the record leads us to\n\n  conclude   that   the   district    court's   consideration     of   the\n\n  guideline sentencing range, in conjunction with the other\n\n  relevant statutory factors, was fully consistent with the\n\n  standards articulated in Jiménez-Beltre.\n\n             In support of his argument, Sagendorf points to one\n\n  of the general principles that the court indicated that it\n\n  would follow in \"consulting the guidelines\" post-Booker.              In\n\n\n     1\n      Sagendorf's suggestion that the guideline sentencing range be\ngiven equal weight with the other statutory factors also has been\nforeclosed by Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518, as has the\ngovernment's argument that this court lacks jurisdiction to review\na within-guidelines sentence at all, id. at 517.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat   general   context,     the   district      court   did     state   its\n\ntentative view that \"relying on grounds that would not justify\n\na guidelines departure to impose a nonguideline sentence is\n\ninherently suspect . . .[,] [s]o the burden of persuasion will\n\nbe high for someone seeking to persuade me to agree to a shadow\n\ndeparture   where   a   departure         in   the    sunlight    would    be\n\nunjustified.\" Regardless of whether that particular statement,\n\nstanding alone, accurately states the law--a matter on which we\n\ntake   no   view--it    was     tempered,        in    context,     by    the\n\ncountervailing principle that \"consultation of the guidelines\n\nmust be qualified by the reality that the guidelines . . .\n\nnecessarily remain general and categorical to a significant\n\ndegree,\" as well as by the principle that the court's approach\n\n\"cannot be so . . . slavishly compliant as to constitute\n\neffective submission to the guidelines, thereby reviving in\n\nthem a de facto mandatory quality.\"            Those principles presaged\n\nour similar statements in Jiménez-Beltre.             See, e.g., 440 F.3d\n\nat 518 (\"the guidelines are still generalizations that can\n\npoint to outcomes that may appear unreasonable to sentencing\n\njudges in particular cases\"); id. (declining to view the\n\nguidelines as \"'presumptively' controlling or a guidelines\n\nsentence as 'per se reasonable'\" because doing so \"tends in the\n\ndirection [of making them mandatory]\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           Perhaps more important, whatever the merit of the\n\njudge's general reference to \"shadow departures,\" that was not\n\nthe basis for the district court's decision in this case (and,\n\nso, it is not the focus of our review).         Here, the district\n\ncourt based its decision not to impose a below-guidelines\n\nsentence primarily on the principle that to do so simply\n\nbecause the guideline sentencing range for this offense \"seems\n\nhigh\" would be \"willfully idiosyncratic\" or, in other words, \"a\n\njudge-by-judge recalibration of the guidelines,\" which would\n\nconstitute a \"serious mistake.\"        That principle is consistent\n\nwith this court's later warning that, in the post-Booker world,\n\n\"sentencing decisions must be done case by case and must be\n\ngrounded   in   case-specific   considerations,    not     in   general\n\ndisagreement with broad-based policies enunciated by Congress\n\nor the [Sentencing] Commission, as its agent.\"       United States\n\nv. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 65 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           In applying that principle to this case, the district\n\njudge   asked   whether   the   previously    calculated    guideline\n\nsentencing range \"seem[s] high because of something unique or\n\nspecific to this case or because [he] generally regard[s] the\n\ncalibration of guidelines ranges to be set higher than [he]\n\nwould set them if [he] had the freedom and authority to do so.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to answer that question by consulting the\n\nrelevant factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              As to the nature and circumstances of the offense,\n\n  id. § 3553(a)(1), the court considered the offense a serious\n\n  one, \"committed over an extended period of time with planning\n\n  and effort[,] . . . not a crime of momentary weakness or a\n\n  crime of opportunity, but a deliberate criminal project.\"               As\n\n  to how that seriousness was quantified, the court indicated\n\n  that \"many of the close questions in that calculation were\n\n  resolved   in    the   defendant's   favor,\"   and   that   alternative\n\n  calculations would have resulted in an even higher sentence.\n\n  As to deterrence, id. § 3553(a)(2)(B), the court concluded\n\n  \"that adequate general deterrence requires a penalty that\n\n  reflects the seriousness of the offense, even if specific\n\n  deterrence might be satisfied with a lesser penalty.\"             As to\n\n  the    history   and   characteristics   of    the   defendant,   id.    §\n\n  3553(a)(1),      which,    the   court    acknowledged,       \"are      in\n\n  [Sagendorf's] favor,\"2 the court concluded that Sagendorf's\n\n  lack of a criminal history was already taken into account by\n\n  placing him in criminal history category I for purposes of\n\n  computing his guideline sentencing        range.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Sagendorf points to that acknowledgment as illustrating the\nexcessive weight given to the guidelines relative to the other\nstatutory factors. However, \"the requirement that the sentencing\njudge consider a § 3553(a) factor that may cut in a defendant's\nfavor does not bestow on the defendant an entitlement to receive\nany particular 'credit' under that factor.\"     United States v.\nFernandez, 2006 WL 851670, at *12 (2d Cir. Apr. 3, 2006).\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           On the basis of the totality of these factors, as\n\nwell as consultation of the guidelines, the court concluded\n\nthat its \"sense that the sentence previously imposed seems high\n\nderives not from factors specific to this case that distinguish\n\nit in its seriousness from other possible cases of purveyors of\n\ncounterfeit goods and marks where there was an intended loss of\n\nabout $300,000, but rather from a more generalized view of the\n\nguidelines ranges.\"    Accordingly, the court reimposed the same\n\n41-month   sentence,    which   it    deemed,   \"under   all   the\n\ncircumstances[,] reasonable and just.\"\n\n           Because the district court's explanation for that\n\nsentence is \"plausible,\" Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519, and\n\nthe resulting sentence is, at the very least, \"defensible,\"\n\nid., we decline to second-guess the district court's judgment.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the sentence.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

At his original sentencing, which occurred before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), the primary issue in dispute was whether or to what extent Sagendorf's sentence should be enhanced under USSG &#167; 2B5.3 based on the \"infringement amount.\" The district court ultimately enhanced the sentence 12 levels on that ground and sentenced Sagendorf to the bottom of the resulting guideline range, i.e., 41 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sagendorf appealed from his sentence (but not his conviction). His brief challenged his sentence on two grounds: (1) that the district court committed a guidelines interpretation error in calculating the infringement amount and (2) that he was entitled to resentencing under <i>Booker,</i> which had come down after sentencing but before appellate briefing. After Sagendorf filed his brief but before the government responded, Sagendorf filed an unopposed motion to withdraw his brief and remand the case to the district court for resentencing. In that motion, Sagendorf expressly \"agree[d] to withdraw his appeal and to abandon his claim that the district court incorrectly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines.\" In so doing, Sagendorf expressed his understanding \"that if this Court remands the case as requested in this motion, the district court will be permitted to determine whether Sagendorf's sentence should be reduced in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Booker</i> and the sentencing goals set out in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) and will use its computation of the guideline sentencing range as advisory.\" Sagendorf also expressly stated that he \"underst[ood] that the district court is not obligated to alter the sentence on remand, and may re-impose the sentence that is the subject of this appeal.\" \"In accordance with\" Sagendorf's motion, we remanded the case for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence imposed on remand was identical to that imposed under the mandatory guidelines. In appealing the reimposed sentence, Sagendorf challenges it both as unreasonable under <i>Booker</i> (because the district court purportedly gave presumptive weight to the guidelines) and as based on an incorrect calculation of the guideline sentencing range. Given the course of events described above, we conclude that Sagendorf waived any argument that the guideline calculations were incorrect. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 437 (1st Cir.2002) (finding it \"difficult to conceive of a more conspicuous example of a knowing and voluntary abandonment of a legal right\" than when \"[a] party identifies an issue, and then explicitly withdraws it\"). \"Although an appellate court has discretion to excuse waiver `in the interests of justice,'\" <i>Olsen v. United</i> <i>States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201691\"><a href=\"/opinion/201691/olsen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Thomas v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span> (1985)), we see no reason to do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to Sagendorf's only remaining claim: that, by re-imposing the 41-month sentence (rather than the 13-month sentence that Sagendorf sought), the district court treated the guideline sentencing range as \"presumptive.\" If so, that would be inconsistent with this court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 518 (1st Cir.2006), in which we declined to view the guidelines, post-<i>Booker,</i> as \"presumptively controlling.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We disagree, however, with Sagendorf's characterization of the district court's methodology. Our own review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court's consideration of the guideline sentencing range, in conjunction with the other relevant statutory factors, was fully consistent with the standards articulated in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his argument, Sagendorf points to one of the general principles that the court indicated that it would follow in \"consulting the guidelines\" post-<i>Booker.</i> In that general context, the district court did state its tentative view that \"relying on grounds that would not justify a guidelines departure to impose a nonguideline sentence is inherently suspect . . .[,][s]o the burden of persuasion will be high for someone seeking to persuade me to agree to a shadow departure where a departure in the sunlight would be unjustified.\" Regardless of whether that particular statement, standing alone, accurately states the law &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; it was tempered, in context, by the countervailing principle that \"consultation of the guidelines must be qualified by the reality that the guidelines ... necessarily remain general and categorical to a significant degree,\" as well as by the principle that the court's approach \"cannot be so... slavishly compliant as to constitute effective submission to the guidelines, thereby reviving in them a de facto mandatory quality.\" Those principles presaged our similar statements in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre. See, e.g.,</i> 440 F.3d at 518 (\"the guidelines are still <i>generalizations</i> that can point to outcomes that may appear unreasonable to sentencing judges in particular cases\"); <i>id.</i> (declining to view the guidelines as \"`presumptively' controlling or a guidelines sentence as `per se reasonable'\" because doing so \"tends in the direction [of making them mandatory]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps more important, whatever the merit of the judge's general reference to \"shadow departures,\" that was not the basis for the district court's decision in this case (and, so, it is not the focus of our review). Here, the district court based its decision not to impose a below-guidelines sentence primarily on the principle that to do so simply because the guideline sentencing range for this offense \"seems high\" would be \"willfully idiosyncratic\" or, in other words, \"a judge-by-judge recalibration of the guidelines,\" which would constitute a \"serious mistake.\" That principle is consistent with this court's later warning that, in the post-<i>Booker</i> world, \"sentencing decisions must be done case by case and must be grounded in case-specific considerations, not in general disagreement with broad-based policies enunciated by Congress or the [Sentencing] Commission, as its agent.\" <i>United States v.
