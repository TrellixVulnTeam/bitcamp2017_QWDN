Paul Campagna (\"Campagna\"), an\n\nemployee     of    the    Massachusetts       Department          of   Environmental\n\nProtection    (\"DEP\")     and    DEP-certified        septic      system   inspector,\n\nclaims that six DEP employees1 subjected him to a retaliatory\n\nadministrative proceeding that deprived him of his constitutional\n\nrights to petition the government for redress of grievances under\n\nthe First Amendment and to equal protection under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.        Finding that Campagna failed to state a claim for\n\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss Campagna's federal claims under Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.    P.    12(b)(6)      and   declined      to    exercise      supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.                      We affirm.\n\n                  I.     Factual and Procedural Background\n\n             We   cull   the     relevant    facts    from       Campagna's   amended\n\ncomplaint,    taking      them    in   the    light       most   favorable    to    the\n\nplaintiff.        Campagna began working for the DEP in 1985 as an\n\nenvironmental engineer, and was promoted soon thereafter.                            He\n\nunsuccessfully sought a further promotion, while candidates were\n\nhired for positions at the level sought by Campagna who were in his\n\nview \"less qualified, but more politically connected.\"                     Frustrated\n\n\n\n     1\n      Campagna sued David Howland, Deirdre Doherty Cabral, Mary\nHolland, Edward Kunce, Alan Weinberg, and David Struhs (apparently\nmisidentified in the pleadings as \"David Struh\").         Campagna\ninitially named the DEP as a defendant in his § 1983 claim, but\nlater assented to its dismissal from the suit.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fby his situation, Campagna left the DEP in 1992 for a position with\n\nthe federal government.         As soon as he left, the DEP announced a\n\nposition for which Campagna was qualified.        He immediately applied\n\nfor the position, but defendant David Howland, the DEP employee\n\nresponsible for filling the position, refused to hire him.\n\n            Campagna brought suit in state court, claiming that he was\n\nentitled to preferential hiring because of his status as a veteran\n\nof the Vietnam War.      The court agreed, and ordered the DEP to place\n\nhim in the position unless a better qualified candidate who was also\n\na veteran applied for the job.        The DEP appealed, contending that\n\nCampagna was not qualified for the position.2           As part of a 1995\n\nsettlement of the dispute, Campagna ultimately accepted a different\n\nposition that was \"less desirable.\"\n\n            Campagna continued working for the DEP without incident\n\nfor more than two years.        During this period, Campagna also ran a\n\nprivate    after-hours    business    designing   and   monitoring   septic\n\nsystems.     In April 1997, Campagna was hired to upgrade a septic\n\nsystem of a home in Westfield, Massachusetts that had failed an\n\ninspection    conducted    by    another   inspector,   identified   in   the\n\npleadings as \"Mr. Lally\" (\"Lally\").          Lally had concluded that the\n\n\n     2\n      Although the significance of the allegation is unclear,\nCampagna alleges \"on information and belief\" that defendants\nHowland and Kunce made a secret agreement that, if forced to hire\nCampagna for the position he sought, \"they would fire him during\nthe six-month probationary period.\" These allegations connected to\nthe 1992 lawsuit are the only instances in which Howland and Kunce\nare singled out in the amended complaint.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsystem was installed too close to the groundwater and that the tank\n\nhad an unsealed \"weep hole,\" a small hole allowing drainage of any\n\nwater that accumulates in the tank prior to installation.              Campagna\n\ninspected the system and concluded that Lally was incorrect in both\n\nrespects.      Campagna   advised    Westfield's    board   of    health      to\n\nreevaluate    the   system.    The    board   notified   the     DEP    of   the\n\ndiscrepancy, and on October 11, 1997, defendant Cabral, a DEP\n\nemployee, reinspected the site, accompanied by inspector David\n\nRecoulee (\"Recoulee\") and others.\n\n            Cabral evaluated the soil in a 10-foot deep inspection\n\nhole and found evidence of a high groundwater level of 26 inches.3\n\nLike Lally, Cabral concluded that the system had been installed too\n\nclose to the groundwater.     Cabral instructed Recoulee to \"fail the\n\nsystem.\"     Recoulee did not make any independent evaluation of the\n\naverage height of high groundwater.4          Cabral also concluded that\n\nCampagna's determination that the weep hole had been adequately\n\nsealed was invalid because he had not emptied the tank to reach this\n\nfinding.       Cabral   initiated    an    administrative   proceeding        or\n\n\"enforcement action\" against Campagna \"without first sending the\n\nplaintiff a Letter of Non-Compliance,\" charging him with two willful\n\n\n\n     3\n      Cabral had taken a 32-hour soil inspection course the\nprevious year, and had not inspected any other sites prior to the\nOctober 11, 1997 inspection.\n     4\n      Campagna alleges that if Recoulee had made his own estimate,\nit would have been consistent with Campagna's.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fviolations of state regulations commonly known as Title 55 for (1)\n\ninaccurately estimating the groundwater level and (2) failing to\n\ncomplete a required form.\n\n           Also in October 1997 (although the precise date is not set\n\nforth in the amended complaint), the DEP brought an enforcement\n\naction against another inspector, Timothy Maginnis (\"Maginnis\").\n\nLike Campagna, Maginnis was fined without first receiving a notice\n\nof   non-compliance.     Campagna    \"actively   supported\"   Maginnis's\n\nsubsequent appeal.     This support included a March 1999 letter from\n\nCampagna to Maginnis's attorney \"exonerating Mr. Maginnis.\"\n\n           On August 28, 1998, Campagna was fined $1500 for the\n\nviolations that were the subject of the October 1997 reinspection.\n\nCampagna appealed, and on November 1, 2000, an administrative judge\n\nreduced the fine to $100.    According to the amended complaint, the\n\njudge found that, except for the minor violation of failing to note\n\nthe owner's explanation regarding the weep hole, the accusations\n\nagainst Campagna were unfounded. The judge also found that Campagna\n\nhad been subjected to a different standard than other inspectors,\n\nbasing her conclusion in part on the fact that both Lally and\n\nRecoulee failed to include similar information in their inspection\n\nforms but had not been accused of violations.\n\n\n\n      5\n      \"Title 5\" refers to Mass. Regs. Code tit. 310, §§ 15.000, et\nseq. (state environmental regulations governing on-site sewage\ntreatment and disposal systems), available at http://www.lawlib.\nstate.ma.us/title5.html.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          Campagna       contends    that      his   groundwater   estimate   was\n\naccurate, and that the findings made by Lally and Cabral were\n\nincorrect.      According to the amended complaint, Cabral (acting\n\n\"under the direction of the other defendants\") ignored key evidence\n\nthat would have validated Campagna's estimate, including monthly\n\nreadings from a test hole on the property. Campagna further alleges\n\nthat only three other inspectors (including Maginnis, the inspector\n\nCampagna \"actively supported\") have been subjected to enforcement\n\nactions by the Western Regional Office of the DEP, and only two of\n\nthese inspectors were fined.\n\n             During   the      pendency     of   Campagna's    appeal    of   the\n\nenforcement action, defendant Alan Weinberg advised Campagna not to\n\ndiscuss his case with other DEP employees, and required him to\n\nrequest permission to visit other areas of the DEP's Western\n\nRegional Office in an effort to prevent Campagna from discussing his\n\ncase with fellow employees.         Also, at some time after another DEP\n\nemployee advised defendant Mary Holland that he intended to testify\n\non Campagna's behalf, the employee \"was falsely accused by the DEP\n\nof visiting pornography sites on the Internet during office hours.\"\n\nThis employee left the DEP, accepting a lower-paying position\n\nbecause   he    \"could    no    longer    tolerate     the   animosity   of   the\n\ndefendants.\"6\n\n\n     6\n      Like the allegations regarding defendants Howland and Kunce,\nsee note 2, above, and defendant Struhs, see note 6, below, these\nreferences to Weinberg and Holland are the only allegations in the\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           Campagna brought suit in May 2001, claiming violations of\n\nhis constitutional rights (under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 12, §§ H-I) and common law defamation.7            According to\n\nCampagna, the enforcement action violated his constitutional right\n\nto petition the government for redress of grievances under the First\n\nAmendment because it was initiated in retaliation for his 1992\n\nlawsuit   and   his   support   of   Maginnis's   appeal.   Further,   the\n\nenforcement action violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal\n\nprotection under the law because he had been held to a different\n\nstandard than other inspectors. The defendants moved to dismiss for\n\nfailure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) as to both\n\nof the alleged constitutional violations.             The district court\n\ngranted the motion, dismissing the case in toto after declining to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law\n\nclaims.   This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\namended complaint (other than an initial identification of the\ndefendants) in which Weinberg or Holland are identified by name.\nAll other references to them are only generalized references to\n\"the defendants.\"\n     7\n      Campagna alleges that \"the defendants\" made defamatory\nstatements about him in connection with the enforcement action,\nwith harmful consequences for his private inspection business. See\nCampagna v. Commonwealth, 206 F. Supp. 2d 120, 123 (D. Mass. 2002).\nDefendant David Struhs is the only defendant identified by name in\nconnection with these allegations.      Because these allegations\nrelate solely to the defamation claim under Massachusetts common\nlaw, they are not repeated here.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                              II.   Analysis\n\n            We review the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling de\n\nnovo, crediting all well pleaded facts in the complaint, and drawing\n\nall reasonable inferences in Campagna's favor.               Nethersole v.\n\nBulger, 287 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).        We affirm the dismissal\n\n\"only if, under the facts alleged, [the plaintiff] cannot recover\n\non any viable theory.\"      Id. (quoting Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,\n\n244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001)). Despite a generous reading, the\n\namended complaint falls short of stating a viable constitutional\n\nclaim.\n\nA.          First Amendment\n\n            We begin with Campagna's claim that the enforcement action\n\nviolated his right to petition the government for redress of\n\ngrievances.    The district court found that Campagna had failed to\n\nallege that his 1992 lawsuit or his support of Maginnis's appeal\n\nimplicated matters of public concern.8 Thus, it concluded, Campagna\n\nfailed to state a claim challenging a retaliatory action by his\n\nemployer.    The district court relied on the principle that, except\n\nin unusual circumstances, public employees claiming an adverse\n\nemployment    action   in   retaliation   for   exercising    their   First\n\n\n     8\n      In addition to (1) the 1992 lawsuit, and (2) Campagna's\nsupport of Maginnis, the district court found that Campagna alleged\na third course of conduct, namely his appeal of the enforcement\naction, that prompted retaliatory action by the Defendants. See\nCampagna, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 123. In our view, however, the only\nform of retaliation alleged by Campagna is the enforcement action\nitself.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fAmendment rights must allege that their conduct touched on matters\n\nof public concern.         Connick v. Meyers, 461 U.S. 138, 147 (1983)\n\n(applying public concern doctrine in connection with claim made\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment); see also\n\nNethersole, 287 F.3d at 18-19 (same); Tang v. State of Rhode Island,\n\n163 F.3d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1998) (same); Boyle v. Burke, 925 F.2d\n\n497, 505 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing, in dicta, the applicability\n\nof the public concern doctrine to claim made under the Petition\n\nClause). The \"public concern\" doctrine balances the First Amendment\n\nrights of a citizen-employee against the interest of a government-\n\nemployer in maintaining order and efficiency in the workplace.              See\n\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 140 (citing Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S.\n\n563, 568 (1968)).\n\n             The facts of this case are complicated by Campagna's dual\n\nroles as a DEP employee and a DEP-certified inspector.             According\n\nto the amended complaint, however, the DEP took action against\n\nCampagna in his capacity as a private inspector, not as a DEP\n\nemployee.    Other than the relatively minor allegation that Campagna\n\nand his fellow employees were advised not to discuss his appeal of\n\nthe enforcement action, Campagna alleges no adverse impact on his\n\nemployment    with   the    DEP,   such    as   a   transfer,   demotion,   or\n\ntermination.9 Instead, Campagna complains that his private business\n\n\n     9\n      To the extent Campagna alleges that the restrictions on\ndiscussing his case in the workplace constituted a retaliatory\nemployment action, we uphold the district court's application of\n\n                                     -9-\n\fof inspecting and updating septic systems suffered as a result of\n\nadverse publicity regarding the enforcement action.         \"Since the\n\nreason for the test is missing in the present case -- maintaining\n\norder in the governmental workplace -- the [public concern doctrine]\n\nshould not be applied here.\" Gable v. Lewis, 201 F.3d 769, 771 (6th\n\nCir. 2000) (holding that, as an independent contractor for a\n\ngovernment agency, plaintiff alleging retaliation need not prove\n\nthat her complaint for sex discrimination touched on matters of\n\npublic concern).    So too in the present circumstances.\n\n          Our First Amendment inquiry does not end here, however,\n\nbecause we may affirm the district court's dismissal of the First\n\nAmendment claim on any ground supported by the record.     Aldridge v.\n\nA.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2002).      Therefore, we\n\nconsider whether Campagna has satisfied the pleading requirements\n\nof Rule 12(b)(6).    In so doing, we are not bound to credit \"bald\n\nassertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets.\"\n\nDartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)(internal   quotation   omitted)(quoting   Chongris   v.   Bd.   of\n\nAppeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987)).      While forgiving, Rule\n\n12(b)(6) \"is not entirely a toothless tiger.\" Id. A plaintiff must\n\nallege facts in support of \"each material element necessary to\n\nsustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.\"      Id. (quoting\n\nGooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n\nthe public concern doctrine.\n\n                                -10-\n\f            In the amended complaint, Campagna gives a chronological\n\naccount of his relationship with the DEP, both as an employee and\n\nas a private inspector.     Campagna's claim turns on the allegations\n\nthat Cabral acted \"under the direction of the other defendants\"10\n\nwhen she undertook the enforcement action, and that this was done\n\nin   retaliation   for   Campagna's    earlier    lawsuit    and   support   of\n\nMaginnis.    Compl. ¶¶ 24, 27, 34.          These are the only allegations\n\nthat link the critical events in Campagna's case.              But more than\n\nfive years had passed since Campagna filed his lawsuit, a suit\n\nundertaken in the context of his employment with the DEP, not his\n\nprivate    inspection    business.      The    allegations    in   Campagna's\n\ncomplaint do not support a fact-based inference that the \"direction\"\n\ngiven to Cabral by the defendants was anything other than routine\n\nsupervision of Cabral as a DEP employee.11         Without more, we cannot\n\ncredit Campagna's unsupported conclusion that the enforcement action\n\nwas undertaken to retaliate against Campagna.\n\n\n      10\n      Campagna's frequent references to \"the defendants\" highlight\nthe generality of his allegations. Taken literally, they would\ninclude defendant Struhs, who is named only in Campagna's common\nlaw defamation claim.\n      11\n      Campagna fails to allege that any defendant other than Cabral\ndirectly participated in the enforcement action. To the extent\nCampagna relies on these defendants' positions within the DEP as a\nbasis for supervisory liability, he has failed to allege facts\nsufficient to allow such an inference. See Rogan v. Menino, 175\nF.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir. 1999)(\"To state a cognizable claim on that\nbasis, [the plaintiff] needed to depict a scenario that would\npermit a fact-based inference that [the defendants] were guilty of\nconduct that amounted to condonation or tacit authorization of\nwrongdoing.\").\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Similarly, even if we make the tenuous assumption that\n\nCampagna's support of Maginnis's appeal is properly characterized\n\nas an exercise of Campagna's rights under the Petition Clause -- an\n\nissue we do not address today -- he fails to state a claim for\n\ndeprivation of that right.             Campagna's allegation that, \"[o]n\n\ninformation and belief, the defendants were aware of plaintiff\n\nCampagna's support of Mr. Maginnis,\" Compl. ¶ 17, does not bridge\n\nthe   gap   between   his   support     for    Maginnis's     appeal      and   the\n\nenforcement action.    Campagna identifies a single act of support in\n\nthe amended complaint -- a letter written in 1999 (and months after\n\nCampagna was fined) to Maginnis's attorney on Maginnis's behalf.\n\nBut he fails utterly to link his writing of the letter to the\n\nallegedly retaliatory enforcement action.\n\n            As to the First Amendment claim, we find that the amended\n\ncomplaint fails to meet even the minimal requirements to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.     See Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440,\n\n443-45 (1st Cir. 1992). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of that claim.\n\nB.          Equal Protection\n\n            We turn to Campagna's claim that he was denied equal\n\nprotection   under    the   law   on    the   ground   that    he   was   treated\n\ndifferently from inspectors Lally and Recoulee.               Campagna does not\n\nallege that he is a member of a protected class or group.                 Relying\n\non Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 563-64 (2000), he\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fclaims instead that he is a \"class of one,\" an individual who has\n\nbeen treated differently from others similarly situated without any\n\nrational basis for the disparate treatment.\n\n            We consider whether Campagna sufficiently alleged that he\n\nwas treated differently from others \"similarly situated\" and that\n\nthere was no rational basis for the treatment.                     As we read the\n\namended    complaint,   Lally    failed      the    system    on     the   Westfield\n\nproperty, Campagna arrived at a different result, and Recoulee\n\nparticipated    in   an   investigation            intended    to     resolve    the\n\ndiscrepancies between the two conclusions.

Finding that Campagna failed to state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss Campagna's federal claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cull the relevant facts from Campagna's amended complaint, taking them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Campagna began working for the DEP in 1985 as an environmental engineer, and was promoted soon thereafter. He unsuccessfully sought a further promotion, while candidates were hired for positions at the level sought by Campagna who were in his view \"less qualified, but more politically connected.\" Frustrated by his situation, Campagna left the DEP in 1992 for a position with the federal government. As soon as he left, the DEP announced a position for which Campagna was qualified. He immediately applied for the position, but defendant David Howland, the DEP employee responsible for filling the position, refused to hire him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna brought suit in state court, claiming that he was entitled to preferential hiring because of his status as a veteran of the Vietnam War. The court agreed, and ordered the DEP to place him in the position unless a better qualified candidate who was also a veteran applied for the job. The DEP appealed, contending that Campagna was not qualified for the position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As part of a 1995 settlement of the dispute, Campagna ultimately accepted a different position that was \"less desirable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna continued working for the DEP without incident for more than two years. During this period, Campagna also ran a private after-hours business designing and monitoring septic systems. In April 1997, Campagna was hired to upgrade a septic system of a home in Westfield, Massachusetts that had failed an inspection conducted by another inspector, identified in the pleadings as \"Mr. Lally\" (\"Lally\"). Lally had concluded that the system was installed too close to the groundwater and that the tank had an unsealed \"weep hole,\" a small hole allowing drainage of any water that accumulates in the tank prior to installation. Campagna inspected the system and concluded that Lally was incorrect in both respects. Campagna advised Westfield's board of health to reevaluate the system. The board notified the DEP of the discrepancy, and on October 11, 1997, defendant Cabral, a DEP employee, reinspected the site, accompanied by inspector David Recoulee (\"Recoulee\") and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabral evaluated the soil in a 10-foot deep inspection hole and found evidence of a high groundwater level of 26 inches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Like Lally, Cabral concluded that the system had been installed too close to the groundwater. Cabral instructed Recoulee to \"fail the system.\" Recoulee did not make any independent evaluation of the average height of high groundwater.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cabral also concluded that Campagna's determination that the weep hole had been adequately sealed was invalid because he had not emptied the tank to reach this finding. Cabral initiated an administrative proceeding or \"enforcement action\" against Campagna \"without first sending the plaintiff a Letter of Non-Compliance,\" charging him with two willful violations of state regulations commonly known as Title 5<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> for (1) inaccurately estimating the groundwater level and (2) failing to complete a required form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in October 1997 (although the precise date is not set forth in the amended complaint), the DEP brought an enforcement action against another inspector, Timothy Maginnis (\"Maginnis\"). Like Campagna, Maginnis was fined without first receiving a notice of non-compliance. Campagna \"actively supported\" Maginnis's subsequent appeal. This support included a March 1999 letter from Campagna to Maginnis's attorney \"exonerating Mr. Maginnis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 1998, Campagna was fined $1500 for the violations that were the subject of the October 1997 reinspection. Campagna appealed, and on November 1, 2000, an administrative judge reduced the fine to $100. According to the amended complaint, the judge found that, except for the minor violation of failing to note the owner's explanation regarding the weep hole, the accusations against Campagna were unfounded. The judge also found that Campagna had been subjected to a different standard than other inspectors, basing her conclusion in part on the fact that both Lally and Recoulee failed to include similar information in their inspection forms but had not been accused of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna contends that his groundwater estimate was accurate, and that the findings made by Lally and Cabral were incorrect. According to the amended complaint, Cabral (acting \"under the direction of the other defendants\") ignored key evidence that would have validated Campagna's estimate, including monthly readings from a test hole on the property. Campagna further alleges that only three other inspectors (including Maginnis, the inspector Campagna \"actively supported\") have been subjected to enforcement actions by the Western Regional Office of the DEP, and only two of these inspectors were fined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of Campagna's appeal of the enforcement action, defendant Alan Weinberg advised Campagna not to discuss his case with other DEP employees, and required him to request permission to visit other areas of the DEP's Western Regional Office in an effort to prevent Campagna from discussing his case with fellow employees. Also, at some time after another DEP employee advised defendant Mary Holland that he intended to testify on Campagna's behalf, the employee \"was falsely accused by the DEP of visiting pornography sites on the Internet during office hours.\" This employee left the DEP, accepting a lower-paying position because he \"could no longer tolerate the animosity of the defendants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna brought suit in May 2001, claiming violations of his constitutional rights (under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; H-I) and common law defamation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> According to Campagna, the enforcement action violated his constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances under the First Amendment because it was initiated in retaliation for his 1992 lawsuit and his support of Maginnis's appeal. Further, the enforcement action violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law because he had been held to a different standard than other inspectors. The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) as to both of the alleged constitutional violations. The district court granted the motion, dismissing the case <i>in toto</i> after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling <i>de novo,</i> crediting all well pleaded facts in the complaint, and drawing all reasonable inferences in Campagna's favor. <i>Nethersole v. Bulger,</i> 287 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2002). We affirm the dismissal \"only if, under the facts alleged, [the plaintiff] cannot recover on any viable theory.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.2001)). Despite a generous reading, the amended complaint falls short of stating a viable constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. First Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Campagna's claim that the enforcement action violated his right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The district court found that Campagna had failed to allege that his 1992 lawsuit or his support of Maginnis's appeal implicated matters of public concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, it concluded, Campagna failed to state a claim challenging a retaliatory action by his employer. The district court relied on the principle that, except in unusual circumstances, public employees claiming an adverse employment action in retaliation for exercising their First Amendment rights must allege that their conduct touched on matters of public concern. <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (applying public concern doctrine in connection with claim made under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment); <i>see also Nethersole,</i> 287 F.3d at 18-19 (same); <i>Tang v. State of Rhode Island,</i> 163 F.3d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir.1998) (same); <i>Boyle v. Burke,</i> 925 F.2d 497, 505 (1st Cir.1991) (discussing, in <i>dicta,</i> the applicability of the public concern doctrine to claim made under the Petition Clause). The \"public concern\" doctrine balances the First Amendment rights of a citizen-employee against the interest of a government-employer in maintaining order and efficiency in the workplace. <i>See Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 140, 103 S.Ct. 1684 (citing <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are complicated by Campagna's dual roles as a DEP employee and a DEP-certified inspector. According to the amended complaint, however, the DEP took action against Campagna in his capacity as a private inspector, not as a DEP employee. Other than the relatively minor allegation that Campagna and his fellow employees were advised not to discuss his appeal of the enforcement action, Campagna alleges no adverse impact on his employment with the DEP, such as a transfer, demotion, or termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Instead, Campagna complains that his private business of inspecting and updating septic systems suffered as a result of adverse publicity regarding the enforcement action. \"Since the reason for the test is missing in the present case &#8212; maintaining order in the governmental workplace &#8212; the [public concern doctrine] should not be applied here.\" <i>Gable v. Lewis,</i> 201 F.3d 769, 771 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that, as an independent contractor for a government agency, plaintiff alleging retaliation need not prove that her complaint for sex discrimination touched on matters of public concern). So too in the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our First Amendment inquiry does not end here, however, because we may affirm the district court's dismissal of the First Amendment claim on any ground supported by the record. <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.2002). Therefore, we consider whether Campagna has satisfied the pleading requirements of Rule 12(b)(6). In so doing, we are not bound to credit \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets.\" <i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College,</i> 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation omitted)(quoting <i>Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987)). While forgiving, Rule 12(b)(6) \"is not entirely a toothless tiger.\" <i>Id.</i> A plaintiff must allege facts in support of \"each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the amended complaint, Campagna gives a chronological account of his relationship with the DEP, both as an employee and as a private inspector. Campagna's claim turns on the allegations that Cabral acted \"under the direction of the other defendants\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> when she undertook the enforcement action, and that this was done in retaliation for Campagna's earlier lawsuit and support of Maginnis. Compl. &#182;&#182; 24, 27, 34. These are the only allegations that link the critical events in Campagna's case. But more than five years had passed since Campagna filed his lawsuit, a suit undertaken in the context of his employment with the DEP, not his private inspection business. The allegations in Campagna's complaint do not support a fact-based inference that the \"direction\" given to Cabral by the defendants was anything other than routine supervision of Cabral as a DEP employee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Without more, we cannot credit Campagna's unsupported conclusion that the enforcement action was undertaken to retaliate against Campagna.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, even if we make the tenuous assumption that Campagna's support of Maginnis's appeal is properly characterized as an exercise of Campagna's rights under the Petition Clause &#8212; an issue we do not address today &#8212; he fails to state a claim for deprivation of that right. Campagna's allegation that, \"[o]n information and belief, the defendants were aware of plaintiff Campagna's support of Mr. Maginnis,\" Compl. &#182; 17, does not bridge the gap between his support for Maginnis's appeal and the enforcement action. Campagna identifies a single act of support in the amended complaint &#8212; a letter written in 1999 (and months after Campagna was fined) to Maginnis's attorney on Maginnis's behalf. But he fails utterly to link his writing of the letter to the allegedly retaliatory enforcement action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the First Amendment claim, we find that the amended complaint fails to meet even the minimal requirements to survive a motion to dismiss. <i>See Coyne v. City of Somerville,</i> 972 F.2d 440, 443-45 (1st Cir.1992). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Campagna's claim that he was denied equal protection under the law on the ground that he was treated differently from inspectors Lally and Recoulee. Campagna does not allege that he is a member of a protected class or group. Relying on <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> 528 U.S. 562, 563-64, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000), he claims instead that he is a \"class of one,\" an individual who has been treated differently from others similarly situated without any rational basis for the disparate treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider whether Campagna sufficiently alleged that he was treated differently from others \"similarly situated\" and that there was no rational basis for the treatment. As we read the amended complaint, Lally failed the system on the Westfield property, Campagna arrived at a different result, and Recoulee participated in an investigation intended to resolve the discrepancies between the two conclusions. Recoulee did not make his own independent inspection of the property, but instead failed the system at Cabral's direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lally and Campagna were not similarly situated for the purposes of determining whether Campagna was treated unfairly: the two inspectors reached different results. <i>See Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. Rhode Island Hous. &amp; Mortgage Fin. Corp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2001) (finding plaintiff developer and other developers who applied for tax credit were not similarly situated where, under facts alleged in complaint, plaintiff could have been found to have more questionable business acumen and judgment). The October 1997 investigation (the so-called \"third\" inspection) resulted in a DEP finding, whether accurate or not, that Lally's conclusion was correct. And Recoulee was unlike either Lally or Campagna. Recoulee was not hired by the homeowner to inspect the property for the purposes of certification &#8212; he was part of a DEP investigation into the conflicting conclusions. These facts, even when taken in the light most favorable to Campagna, defeat any claim that the enforcement action was irrational or arbitrary. To the contrary, it was Campagna's conclusions as an inspector (in conflict with another inspector's) that prompted the enforcement action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the dispute over the groundwater calculations, Campagna argues that we should find that his right to equal protection under the law was violated because the DEP fined him, but not Lally or Recoulee, for failing to fill out certain paperwork. The DEP fined Campagna for this technical violation as part of a proceeding that found him responsible for a substantive violation of law. The defendants &#8212; who we assume <i>arguendo</i> took part in the DEP's decision to discipline Campagna &#8212; were under no obligation to take enforcement action for technical violations by other inspectors found to have committed no other violation of law. A state agency may allocate its resources in this manner without raising the specter of discriminatory enforcement. <i>Cf. Kisser v. Cisneros,</i> 14 F.3d 615, 620 (D.C.Cir.1994). We find no equal protection violation under these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. State Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Campagna's state law claims without prejudice, finding this an inappropriate case for exercising supplemental jurisdiction. <i>See Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.1995). We affirm this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Finding that Campagna failed to state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss Campagna's federal claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.

Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cull the relevant facts from Campagna's amended complaint, taking them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Campagna began working for the DEP in 1985 as an environmental engineer, and was promoted soon thereafter. He unsuccessfully sought a further promotion, while candidates were hired for positions at the level sought by Campagna who were in his view \"less qualified, but more politically connected.\" Frustrated by his situation, Campagna left the DEP in 1992 for a position with the federal government. As soon as he left, the DEP announced a position for which Campagna was qualified. He immediately applied for the position, but defendant David Howland, the DEP employee responsible for filling the position, refused to hire him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna brought suit in state court, claiming that he was entitled to preferential hiring because of his status as a veteran of the Vietnam War. The court agreed, and ordered the DEP to place him in the position unless a better qualified candidate who was also a veteran applied for the job. The DEP appealed, contending that Campagna was not qualified for the position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As part of a 1995 settlement of the dispute, Campagna ultimately accepted a different position that was \"less desirable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna continued working for the DEP without incident for more than two years. During this period, Campagna also ran a private after-hours business designing and monitoring septic systems. In April 1997, Campagna was hired to upgrade a septic system of a home in Westfield, Massachusetts that had failed an inspection conducted by another inspector, identified in the pleadings as \"Mr. Lally\" (\"Lally\"). Lally had concluded that the system was installed too close to the groundwater and that the tank had an unsealed \"weep hole,\" a small hole allowing drainage of any water that accumulates in the tank prior to installation. Campagna inspected the system and concluded that Lally was incorrect in both respects. Campagna advised Westfield's board of health to reevaluate the system. The board notified the DEP of the discrepancy, and on October 11, 1997, defendant Cabral, a DEP employee, reinspected the site, accompanied by inspector David Recoulee (\"Recoulee\") and others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabral evaluated the soil in a 10-foot deep inspection hole and found evidence of a high groundwater level of 26 inches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Like Lally, Cabral concluded that the system had been installed too close to the groundwater. Cabral instructed Recoulee to \"fail the system.\" Recoulee did not make any independent evaluation of the average height of high groundwater.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Cabral also concluded that Campagna's determination that the weep hole had been adequately sealed was invalid because he had not emptied the tank to reach this finding. Cabral initiated an administrative proceeding or \"enforcement action\" against Campagna \"without first sending the plaintiff a Letter of Non-Compliance,\" charging him with two willful violations of state regulations commonly known as Title 5<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> for (1) inaccurately estimating the groundwater level and (2) failing to complete a required form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in October 1997 (although the precise date is not set forth in the amended complaint), the DEP brought an enforcement action against another inspector, Timothy Maginnis (\"Maginnis\"). Like Campagna, Maginnis was fined without first receiving a notice of non-compliance. Campagna \"actively supported\" Maginnis's subsequent appeal. This support included a March 1999 letter from Campagna to Maginnis's attorney \"exonerating Mr. Maginnis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 1998, Campagna was fined $1500 for the violations that were the subject of the October 1997 reinspection. Campagna appealed, and on November 1, 2000, an administrative judge reduced the fine to $100. According to the amended complaint, the judge found that, except for the minor violation of failing to note the owner's explanation regarding the weep hole, the accusations against Campagna were unfounded. The judge also found that Campagna had been subjected to a different standard than other inspectors, basing her conclusion in part on the fact that both Lally and Recoulee failed to include similar information in their inspection forms but had not been accused of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna contends that his groundwater estimate was accurate, and that the findings made by Lally and Cabral were incorrect. According to the amended complaint, Cabral (acting \"under the direction of the other defendants\") ignored key evidence that would have validated Campagna's estimate, including monthly readings from a test hole on the property. Campagna further alleges that only three other inspectors (including Maginnis, the inspector Campagna \"actively supported\") have been subjected to enforcement actions by the Western Regional Office of the DEP, and only two of these inspectors were fined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of Campagna's appeal of the enforcement action, defendant Alan Weinberg advised Campagna not to discuss his case with other DEP employees, and required him to request permission to visit other areas of the DEP's Western Regional Office in an effort to prevent Campagna from discussing his case with fellow employees. Also, at some time after another DEP employee advised defendant Mary Holland that he intended to testify on Campagna's behalf, the employee \"was falsely accused by the DEP of visiting pornography sites on the Internet during office hours.\" This employee left the DEP, accepting a lower-paying position because he \"could no longer tolerate the animosity of the defendants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campagna brought suit in May 2001, claiming violations of his constitutional rights (under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; H-I) and common law defamation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> According to Campagna, the enforcement action violated his constitutional right to petition the government for redress of grievances under the First Amendment because it was initiated in retaliation for his 1992 lawsuit and his support of Maginnis's appeal. Further, the enforcement action violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law because he had been held to a different standard than other inspectors. The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) as to both of the alleged constitutional violations. The district court granted the motion, dismissing the case <i>in toto</i> after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.

The district court found that Campagna had failed to allege that his 1992 lawsuit or his support of Maginnis's appeal implicated matters of public concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, it concluded, Campagna failed to state a claim challenging a retaliatory action by his employer. The district court relied on the principle that, except in unusual circumstances, public employees claiming an adverse employment action in retaliation for exercising their First Amendment rights must allege that their conduct touched on matters of public concern. <i>Connick v.

Other than the relatively minor allegation that Campagna and his fellow employees were advised not to discuss his appeal of the enforcement action, Campagna alleges no adverse impact on his employment with the DEP, such as a transfer, demotion, or termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Instead, Campagna complains that his private business of inspecting and updating septic systems suffered as a result of adverse publicity regarding the enforcement action. \"Since the reason for the test is missing in the present case &#8212; maintaining order in the governmental workplace &#8212; the [public concern doctrine] should not be applied here.\" <i>Gable v.

Campagna's claim turns on the allegations that Cabral acted \"under the direction of the other defendants\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> when she undertook the enforcement action, and that this was done in retaliation for Campagna's earlier lawsuit and support of Maginnis. Compl. &#182;&#182; 24, 27, 34. These are the only allegations that link the critical events in Campagna's case. But more than five years had passed since Campagna filed his lawsuit, a suit undertaken in the context of his employment with the DEP, not his private inspection business. The allegations in Campagna's complaint do not support a fact-based inference that the \"direction\" given to Cabral by the defendants was anything other than routine supervision of Cabral as a DEP employee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Without more, we cannot credit Campagna's unsupported conclusion that the enforcement action was undertaken to retaliate against Campagna.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, even if we make the tenuous assumption that Campagna's support of Maginnis's appeal is properly characterized as an exercise of Campagna's rights under the Petition Clause &#8212; an issue we do not address today &#8212; he fails to state a claim for deprivation of that right. Campagna's allegation that, \"[o]n information and belief, the defendants were aware of plaintiff Campagna's support of Mr. Maginnis,\" Compl. &#182; 17, does not bridge the gap between his support for Maginnis's appeal and the enforcement action. Campagna identifies a single act of support in the amended complaint &#8212; a letter written in 1999 (and months after Campagna was fined) to Maginnis's attorney on Maginnis's behalf. But he fails utterly to link his writing of the letter to the allegedly retaliatory enforcement action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the First Amendment claim, we find that the amended complaint fails to meet even the minimal requirements to survive a motion to dismiss. <i>See Coyne v.

As we read the amended complaint, Lally failed the system on the Westfield property, Campagna arrived at a different result, and Recoulee participated in an investigation intended to resolve the discrepancies between the two conclusions.

The October 1997 investigation (the so-called \"third\" inspection) resulted in a DEP finding, whether accurate or not, that Lally's conclusion was correct. And Recoulee was unlike either Lally or Campagna. Recoulee was not hired by the homeowner to inspect the property for the purposes of certification &#8212; he was part of a DEP investigation into the conflicting conclusions. These facts, even when taken in the light most favorable to Campagna, defeat any claim that the enforcement action was irrational or arbitrary. To the contrary, it was Campagna's conclusions as an inspector (in conflict with another inspector's) that prompted the enforcement action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the dispute over the groundwater calculations, Campagna argues that we should find that his right to equal protection under the law was violated because the DEP fined him, but not Lally or Recoulee, for failing to fill out certain paperwork. The DEP fined Campagna for this technical violation as part of a proceeding that found him responsible for a substantive violation of law. The defendants &#8212; who we assume <i>arguendo</i> took part in the DEP's decision to discipline Campagna &#8212; were under no obligation to take enforcement action for technical violations by other inspectors found to have committed no other violation of law. A state agency may allocate its resources in this manner without raising the specter of discriminatory enforcement. <i>Cf. Kisser v.
