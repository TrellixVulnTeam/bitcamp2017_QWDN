Appellant David \"Ovid\"\n\nMacKinnon was sentenced before the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), under\n\na mandatory Guidelines system, as a career offender to 262 months\n\nimprisonment     after     pleading     guilty     to     one    count    of    drug\n\ntrafficking.    His initial request to this court was for a review of\n\nthe district court's denial of his motion for downward departure,\n\nclaiming, inter alia, that his physical, mental, and familial\n\ncircumstances, as well as the fact that his criminal history\n\nconsists of mostly minor street crimes, took him out of the\n\n\"heartland\" of typical cases with the same sentencing range.                        He\n\nalso claimed that his sentence violates the Cruel and Unusual\n\nPunishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment.                At the invitation of\n\nthis Court, MacKinnon has filed two supplemental briefs arguing\n\nthat he should be resentenced in light of Booker.                     We agree and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                               I.     BACKGROUND\n\n          Between July 1999 and December 2001, the Drug Enforcement\n\nAgency (\"DEA\"), in conjunction with local, state, and federal\n\nagencies, conducted an investigation of drug trafficking in and\n\naround   the    Franklin     Hill      Housing     Project       in     Dorchester,\n\nMassachusetts.     During the course of the investigation, on three\n\noccasions,     MacKinnon    was     observed     selling        crack    cocaine.\n\n          On     January    30,     2002,    MacKinnon      was       charged   with\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdistributing five grams or more of cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\")\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and Aiding and Abetting in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.        Subsequently, on April 2, 2002, the\n\ngovernment filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851,\n\ninforming MacKinnon that he faced enhanced penalties under 21\n\nU.S.C. §     841(b)(1)(B),   and   establishing   MacKinnon's   predicate\n\nfelony convictions for purposes of enhanced sentencing under United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") § 4B1.1.\n\n           On January 6, 2003, MacKinnon pleaded guilty to the one\n\ncount of drug trafficking, but reserved his right to dispute that\n\nthe amount of drugs involved in the offense of conviction was \"five\n\ngrams or more.\"1\n\n           The probation department issued a Pre-Sentence Report\n\n(\"PSR\"), and, based upon the fact that MacKinnon had at least four\n\npredicate felony convictions of either a crime of violence or an\n\napplicable    controlled     substance    offense,   it   concluded   that\n\nMacKinnon was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.\n\nMacKinnon's resulting base offense level as calculated in the PSR\n\nwas 37, and his Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") was VI.         The PSR\n\nawarded MacKinnon a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance\n\nof responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 34.\n\n\n\n     1\n        MacKinnon claimed below that the government was unable to\nprove that the weight of the drugs seized in the offense of\nconviction was five grams or more because there were less than five\ngrams after testing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fThus, MacKinnon's Guideline Sentencing Range was 262-324 months'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n           MacKinnon    moved    for    downward      departure     on   numerous\n\ngrounds, and the government opposed MacKinnon's request.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the district court criticized\n\nthe   government's    decision    to    file     an   §   851    information   in\n\nMacKinnon's   case.     Just    prior    to    imposing    the    sentence,    the\n\ndistrict court stated:\n\n        I do not believe that the law allows me to depart\n        in this case. . . . There are simply no bases under\n        the law, as I understand it, that allow a\n        departure. It is an obscene sentence that has to\n        be imposed.    It is unwarranted by the conduct,\n        granted that Mr. MacKinnon has a hugely long\n        record, but 188 months, which [is what] the\n        sentence would have been without the       [§] 851\n        notice, was more than adequate for this then forty-\n        five-year-old man to serve, he would have been\n        sixty or so when he got out, but I have no choice.\n\nThe court further stated: \"I have worked hard on the memorandum and\n\ntried to figure out some way under the law in which the sentence\n\ncould be reduced.     I can't do it.         And although I totally disagree\n\nwith our government's policies at this stage concerning sentencing,\n\nI am bound to obey my oath and to do this according to principle,\n\nknowing all the time that this is an unjust, excessive and obscene\n\nsentence.\"    The court then concluded by stating \"I have no power to\n\ngrant you leniency.     I'm without authority to do other than as the\n\nstatute prescribes, having in mind the charging decisions that were\n\nmade and the 851 notice.\"        The court then sentenced MacKinnon to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe minimum permitted under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, 262\n\nmonths'    incarceration   followed   by   eight   years   of   supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n            Finding that remand is warranted in light of Booker, we\n\nremand for resentencing, and thus we do not address MacKinnon's\n\nclaims of sentencing error under our pre-Booker precedent or\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and\n\nunusual punishment.\n\n                            II. DISCUSSION\n\n            In United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005), decided after we heard argument in MacKinnon's case, the\n\nSupreme Court excised the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of\n\n1984, Pub. L. 98-473, Title II, § 211-238, 98 Stat. 1987 (1984),\n\nthat made the Guidelines mandatory in federal court sentencing, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3353(b)(1).   See 125 S. Ct. at 764-68.2      In addition, the\n\nCourt stated that the principles announced in Booker apply to all\n\ncases pending on direct review.         Id. at 769.   Courts of appeals\n\nwere then directed, when evaluating claims under Booker, to \"apply\n\nordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        The Court also excised the provision of the Sentencing\nReform Act that gave the courts of appeals de novo review over\ncertain aspects of sentencing, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(3). See Booker,\n125 S Ct. at 764-68. The two excised portions of the Act were\nsevered, leaving the remainder of the Sentencing Reform Act intact.\nSee United States v. Antonakopoulos, No. 03-1384, 2005 WL 407365,\nat *12-*13 (1st Cir. Feb. 22, 2005).\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe issue was raised below and whether it fails the 'plain error'\n\ntest.\" Id.\n\n             In United States v. Antonakopoulos, this court held that\n\nthe error under Booker is that \"the defendant's Guidelines sentence\n\nwas imposed under a mandatory system.\"         Antonakopoulos, 2005 WL\n\n407365, *10.     And, we held there that the argument that a Booker\n\nerror occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued error\n\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, 520 U.S. 466 (2000), or Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. __, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), or that the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.       Antonakopoulos, 2005 WL 407365,\n\nat *13.   Here, MacKinnon made no such arguments below, and thus his\n\nclaim under Booker is unpreserved.\n\n             In Antonakopoulos, we also set forth the applicable\n\nframework for review of unpreserved Booker claims.       Utilizing the\n\nfour-prong test set forth in United States v. Olano,       507 U.S. 725\n\n(1993), there must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, (3) that\n\naffects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nSee   Antonakopoulos, 2005 WL 407365, at *14-*15.        We went on to\n\ndescribe a situation similar to that presented by MacKinnon as one\n\npresenting a strong argument for remand:\n\n      [H]istory shows that the mandatory nature of the\n      Guidelines has produced particular results which led\n      trial judges to express that the sentences imposed were\n      unjust, grossly unfair, or disproportionate to the crime\n      committed, and the judges would otherwise have sentenced\n      differently. Where the district judge has said as much\n\n                                  -6-\n\f     about a Guidelines sentence, that is a powerful argument\n     for remand. If the resulting sentence after remand is\n     itself unreasonable, the government can appeal.\n\nId. at *24-*25 (internal citations omitted).\n\n          Here, we believe that this record, in light of the\n\njudge's comments and the numerous grounds presented by MacKinnon\n\nfor departure that could not be considered under a mandatory\n\nGuidelines system, presents a case for remand.\n\n          Accordingly, MacKinnon's sentence is VACATED, and the\n\ncase is REMANDED for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

His initial request to this court was for a review of the district court's denial of his motion for downward departure, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i> that his physical, mental, and familial circumstances, as well as the fact that his criminal history consists of mostly minor street crimes, took him out of the \"heartland\" of typical cases with the same sentencing range. He also claimed that his sentence violates the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. At the invitation of this Court, MacKinnon has filed two supplemental briefs arguing that he should be resentenced in light of <i>Booker.</i> We agree and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between July 1999 and December 2001, the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\"), in conjunction with local, state, and federal agencies, conducted an investigation of drug trafficking in and around the Franklin Hill Housing Project in Dorchester, Massachusetts. During the course of the investigation, on three occasions, MacKinnon was observed selling crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 2002, MacKinnon was charged with distributing five grams or more of cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\") in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), and Aiding and Abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Subsequently, on April 2, 2002, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, informing MacKinnon that he faced enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), and establishing MacKinnon's predicate felony convictions for purposes of enhanced sentencing under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 4B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 2003, MacKinnon pleaded guilty to the one count of drug trafficking, but reserved his right to dispute that the amount of drugs involved in the offense of conviction was \"five grams or more.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation department issued a Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\"), and, based upon the fact that MacKinnon had at least four predicate felony convictions of either a crime of violence or an applicable controlled substance offense, it concluded that MacKinnon was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. MacKinnon's resulting base offense level as calculated in the PSR was 37, and his Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") was VI. The PSR awarded MacKinnon a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 34. Thus, MacKinnon's Guideline Sentencing Range was 262-324 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MacKinnon moved for downward departure on numerous grounds, and the government opposed MacKinnon's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court criticized the government's decision to file an &#167; 851 information in MacKinnon's case. Just prior to imposing the sentence, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not believe that the law allows me to depart in this case.... There are simply no bases under the law, as I understand it, that allow a departure. It is an obscene sentence that has to be imposed. It is unwarranted by the conduct, granted that Mr. MacKinnon has a hugely long record, but 188 months, which [is what] the sentence would have been without the [&#167;] 851 notice, was more than adequate for this then forty-five-year-old man to serve, he would have been sixty or so when he got out, but I have no choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further stated: \"I have worked hard on the memorandum and tried to figure out some way under the law in which the sentence could be reduced. I can't do it. And although I totally disagree with our government's policies at this stage concerning sentencing, I am bound to obey my oath and to do this according to principle, knowing all the time that this is an unjust, excessive and obscene sentence.\" The court then concluded by stating \"I have no power to grant you leniency. I'm without authority to do other than as the statute prescribes, having in mind the charging decisions that were made and the 851 notice.\" The court then sentenced MacKinnon to the minimum permitted under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, 262 months' incarceration followed by eight years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that remand is warranted in light of <i>Booker,</i> we remand for resentencing, and thus we do not address MacKinnon's claims of sentencing error under our pre-<i>Booker</i> precedent or violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005), decided after we heard argument in MacKinnon's case, the Supreme Court excised the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II, &#167; 211-238, 98 Stat.1987 (1984), that made the Guidelines mandatory in federal court sentencing, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1). <i>See</i> 125 S.Ct. at 764-68.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In addition, the Court stated that the principles announced in <i>Booker</i> apply to all cases pending on direct review. <i>Id.</i> at 769. Courts of appeals were then directed, when evaluating claims under <i>Booker,</i> to \"apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the `plain error' test.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> this court held that the error under <i>Booker</i> is that \"the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. And, we held there that the argument that a <i>Booker</i> error occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued error under <i>Apprendi v.

Here, MacKinnon made no such arguments below, and thus his claim under <i>Booker</i> is unpreserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> we also set forth the applicable framework for review of unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claims. Utilizing the four-prong test set forth in <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993), there must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77. We went on to describe a situation similar to that presented by MacKinnon as one presenting a strong argument for remand:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[H]istory shows that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines has produced particular results which led trial judges to express that the sentences imposed were unjust, grossly unfair, or disproportionate to the crime committed, and the judges would otherwise have sentenced differently. Where the district judge has said as much about a Guidelines sentence, that is a powerful argument for remand. If the resulting sentence after remand is itself unreasonable, the government can appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 81 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we believe that this record, in light of the judge's comments and the numerous grounds presented by MacKinnon for departure that could not be considered under a mandatory Guidelines system, presents a case for remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, MacKinnon's sentence is <i>VACATED,</i> and the case is <i>REMANDED</i> for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> MacKinnon claimed below that the government was unable to prove that the weight of the drugs seized in the offense of conviction was five grams or more because there were less than five grams after testing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Court also excised the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that gave the courts of appeals de novo review over certain aspects of sentencing, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(3)<i>See Booker,</i> 125 S Ct. at 764-68.
