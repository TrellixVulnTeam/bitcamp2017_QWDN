Petitioner Lush Lumaj claims\n\nthat he fled his native Albania in 2001 because of persecution\n\nbased on his involvement with the Democratic Party. He entered the\n\nUnited States using a false passport and subsequently applied for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal. In denying his application, the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) found that petitioner was not a credible\n\nwitness and that he had failed to establish eligibility for relief.\n\nThe Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion.\n\nAfter examining the record, we conclude that the IJ’s decision is\n\nsufficiently supported and consequently deny Lumaj’s petition for\n\nreview.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).1\n\n                       I. Factual Background\n\n     Petitioner arrived in the United States in May 2001 and\n\npresented a Slovenian passport bearing someone else’s name. He was\n\ndetained at Miami International Airport, and an asylum officer who\n\ninterviewed him concluded that his assertions of persecution might\n\nbe found credible if fully developed.      Petitioner subsequently\n\nsubmitted an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal.\n\n     In his accompanying two-page statement, he reported that his\n\nfamily had been persecuted through the years by the communist\n\nregime in Albania and that they had been among the first to support\n\n\n\n     1\n       Section 242(b)(4)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B),\nprovides that “the administrative findings of fact are conclusive\nunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\nthe contrary.”\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe democratic movement that emerged in the early 1990s. He stated\n\nthat he joined the Democratic Party (DP) in 1991 and became active\n\nin the organization’s Youth Forum, encouraging friends to join the\n\nparty and working as an election coordinator for DP candidates.\n\nThe party won the elections in 1992 and remained in power until\n\n1997, when the Socialist Party – which petitioner links with the\n\nCommunist Party – regained control of the Albanian government.\n\n     Petitioner claims that he was actively involved with the Youth\n\nForum during the June 1997 elections and that his activities, which\n\nincluded transporting people to the polls and to demonstrations,\n\nwere watched “by the local fanatics and the Socialist police.”            He\n\nstated that on June 29, “two well-known criminals” came to his car\n\nwindow and said: “Keep it up and you’ll end up dead.”                Another\n\nincident occurred two years later, in July 1999, when petitioner\n\nreports he was arrested at his home for participating in an illegal\n\nrally and distributing anti-government leaflets.           He claimed that\n\nhe was held in custody overnight, beaten with a rubber stick, and\n\ntold upon his release to stop supporting the DP “or you will have\n\nproblems with us.”\n\n     He remained active, however, and reported that he barely\n\nescaped when the police came to his home to arrest him in November\n\n2000.   After   hiding   for   a   month,   he   resumed    his    political\n\nactivities and took part in several demonstrations.               In January\n\n2001, a friend dissuaded him from joining a hunger strike that was\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpart of a large protest because petitioner was known as one of “the\n\nmost       wanted    democrats”    and    would    be    “attacked       by    the    large\n\ncontingent of policemen.”\n\n       Petitioner wrote that, at that time, “[r]ealizing that my life\n\nwas in danger,” he made the “very difficult decision to leave my\n\nfamily      and     escape    Albania    before    I    would    get    killed.”        The\n\nstatement then describes his route to the United States in April\n\nand May 2001, which began with three days in Greece and continued\n\nwith stops in Spain, France and Guadeloupe before he reached Miami.\n\n       Petitioner       presented       oral     testimony       on    three     separate\n\noccasions and before two immigration judges because of continuances\n\nin his hearing.              He provided further details of his family’s\n\npolitical persecution, including that his father’s uncle’s son had\n\nbeen executed and his own cousin had been imprisoned for sixteen\n\nyears.        He     asserted    that    his     family’s       properties      had     been\n\nconfiscated and that he had been allowed to remain in school only\n\nthrough eighth grade. Petitioner also testified, however, that his\n\nfather had served as chief in their village and that neither parent\n\nhad    experienced       difficulties       stemming      from        their    recent    DP\n\ninvolvement.2\n\n       In his testimony on April 28, 2003, he reported that his\n\narrest in July 1999 occurred after police forcibly entered his home\n\n\n       2\n       He reported that his mother had been interned from 1948 to\n1952 by the Communist regime.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fat 11 p.m., and he stated that he was punched and beaten with\n\npolice clubs during the four- to five-hour drive to the police\n\nstation.    At the resumed hearing on February 19, 2004, however,\n\npetitioner recalled the episode differently.          He stated that the\n\npolice knocked on the door when they arrived, and his mother opened\n\nit.   He then testified that he was taken to the police station,\n\nwhere he was beaten with a rubber stick.           On both occasions, he\n\nsaid that he was told upon his release that he would be killed if\n\nhe continued to support the DP leader Berisha.\n\n      Petitioner also testified to additional details of the episode\n\nthat occurred in November 2000, when he fled his home to avoid the\n\npolice.    In his testimony on June 26, 2003, he stated that he went\n\nto a friend’s home in the mountains but returned several hours\n\nlater to a location “close to home” to meet with his father, who\n\ntold him that the police had indeed been looking for him.          Again,\n\nthe February 2004 hearing revealed a changed version of the events.\n\nAt that time, petitioner stated that he remained in hiding with his\n\nfriend for a week or more, that his friend acted as a messenger\n\nbetween him and his parents, and that it was the friend who relayed\n\nthe information that the police had come to arrest him.\n\n      Several   other   discrepancies   in   his   story   surfaced.   At\n\ndifferent times, he stated that he was born in different years\n\n(1972 and 1973), and he claimed at one point that he was issued\n\nonly one DP membership card – in 1991 – but he submitted a copy of\n\n                                  -5-\n\fa card issued in 2000.       Earlier, he had testified that he had\n\nreceived other cards but lost them.\n\n     In addition to his own testimony, petitioner presented a\n\nwitness, Rush Draju, another member of the DP who fled Albania and\n\nwas awarded political asylum in the United States. Draju testified\n\nthat petitioner was a member of the DP and had helped in his\n\nelection campaign and in other candidates’ campaigns.         Petitioner\n\nalso relied on country condition reports prepared by Amnesty\n\nInternational describing the ill treatment of DP supporters during\n\nthe time period in which he claimed to experience persecution.\n\n     The IJ was unpersuaded by petitioner’s presentation.         Noting\n\nthe inconsistencies in his recollections about significant events,\n\nthe judge found petitioner not credible: “[H]e is testifying to\n\nvery specific salient factors that a person who is telling the\n\ntruth would not confuse.” The judge found petitioner’s demeanor to\n\nbe “evasive” and “furtive,” and he questioned his failure to seek\n\nasylum in any of the other countries through which he traveled en\n\nroute to the United States.    The judge noted that other members of\n\npetitioner’s   politically    active    family   remain,   unharmed,   in\n\nAlbania, and they own the land on which they farm.         The IJ further\n\nrelied, inter alia, on a report issued by the State Department\n\ndetailing the educational opportunity available for members of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fAssociation of Former Politically Persecuted Persons.3         The judge\n\nalso referred to petitioner’s testimony on cross-examination that\n\nhe had completed three months of military service in 1997, but did\n\nnot resign and had no documents showing release from service.\n\n     As noted above, the IJ’s denial of petitioner’s application\n\nwas affirmed without opinion by the BIA; we therefore review the\n\nIJ’s decision.   See Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 59 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).            In\n\nevaluating   a   denial   of   asylum,   our   inquiry   is   limited   to\n\ndetermining whether substantial evidence in the administrative\n\nrecord supports the IJ’s findings that petitioner neither suffered\n\nfrom cognizable past persecution nor demonstrated a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.       Susanto, 439 F.3d at 59; Silva v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004).4         Those findings “must\n\n     3\n       Petitioner submitted a document indicating that he was a\nmember of the Association, which supposedly entitled him to various\nbenefits.   The State Department’s Profile of Asylum Claims and\nCountry Conditions in Albania reported that “[t]he only benefit\ndelivered to date allows those registered to receive automatic\nadmittance to Albanian universities while the general population\nmust take highly competitive entrance exams.”\n     4\n       An alien seeking asylum must establish that he is a\n“refugee” within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(INA). See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d\n257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005). To do so, an applicant must prove either\na well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion,\nnationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group, or\npast persecution based on one of these five grounds (which\nestablishes a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution). See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. §\n208.13(b); Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fstand unless the record evidence is such as to compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.” Olujoke, 411 F.3d at\n\n21.   “Matters of witness credibility and demeanor are peculiarly\n\nfor the factfinder,” and credibility determinations supported with\n\nspecific findings are treated with “‘great respect.’”    Rodriguez\n\nDel Carmen v. Gonzales, 441 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n      Because we find the asylum ruling adequately supported, we do\n\nnot address petitioner’s alternative request for withholding of\n\nremoval, which “‘places a more stringent burden of proof on an\n\nalien,’” and thus cannot succeed when an asylum claim fails, Bocova\n\nv. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Rodriguez-\n\nRamirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005)); see also\n\nOlujoke, 411 F.3d at 22.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n      The IJ’s decision rested on his determination that petitioner\n\nwas not credible, based on observations and a number of significant\n\ninconsistencies that cast doubt on his allegations of abusive\n\ntreatment and prompted the judge to question even his identity. In\n\nhis oral decision, the judge said that he found it “extremely\n\ntroubling” that petitioner testified twice that he was born in 1972\n\nwhile his birth certificate showed a date of birth in 1973.5    As\n\n\n      5\n      In our review of the record, we could find only one instance\nof petitioner stating that he was born in 1972 rather than 1973.\n\n                                -8-\n\fpreviously noted, the IJ also was particularly bothered by the\n\ninconsistent details surrounding petitioner’s detention in July\n\n1999 and his escape from arrest in November 2000, viewing the\n\ndifferences as significant evidence of fabrication.                      The IJ also\n\nlinked his credibility judgment to the other discrepancies noted\n\nabove – including the date petitioner received the DP membership\n\ncard and his alleged lack of access to higher education – as well\n\nas to petitioner’s demeanor.\n\n     We conclude that the IJ’s listed reasons for questioning\n\npetitioner’s      veracity    are   sufficient       to     meet   the   substantial\n\nevidence      standard.      Petitioner     argues     in    his    brief   that    the\n\nvariations in his recollections are minor and tangential, but we\n\nthink    it   reasonable     for    the   judge   to      draw     an   inference   of\n\nfictionalization from the differences in petitioner’s portrayals of\n\nthe two primary episodes of asserted persecution. Indeed, we, too,\n\nthink it unlikely that petitioner could mis-remember whether the\n\npolice officers who arrested him in 1999 burst through the door or\n\ngained entry by knocking.6           Similarly, the variation in the time\n\n\n     6\n       Of some significance, too, is the fact that petitioner did\nnot mention the 1999 incident during his “credible fear” interview\nin 2001.    The interview worksheet and the interviewer’s notes\nindicate that, when asked if he or anyone in his family had been\n“mistreated or threatened by anyone in any country to which you may\nbe returned,” he responded that he had had no past encounters but\nfeared that he would be a target in the future. Although this fact\nwas not noted in the IJ’s oral decision, it was the subject of\ninquiry by the previous IJ during proceedings in June 2003.\nPetitioner acknowledged that he had not reported the arrest and\n\n                                          -9-\n\fpetitioner reported spending away from home after his near-arrest\n\nin 2000 – a week vs. a month – need not be discounted as simply\n\nimperfect memory.\n\n     Other discrepancies, while perhaps minor in isolation, add to\n\na reasonable inference of lack of candor.          The different reported\n\nbirth dates cast some doubt on the authenticity of his submitted\n\nbirth certificate, and the DP card dated 2000, together with his\n\ntestimony that he had received such a membership card only once,\n\ncast doubt on the veracity of his testimony that he joined the DP\n\nparty in 1991.        Although we can imagine that misunderstandings\n\ncould result from imperfect translations of testimony, petitioner\n\ndoes not attribute any of the variations to language barriers. The\n\nIJ also reasonably could view the State Department’s report that\n\npolitically    persecuted    individuals    have   had   access   to   higher\n\neducation since 1992 to indicate that petitioner was disingenuously\n\nrelying   on   lack    of   educational    opportunity    to   bolster    his\n\npersecution claim.7\n\n     Our discussion thus far applies in some measure to both the\n\nshowing of past persecution and to the fear of future persecution.\n\n\nbeating, stating, through an interpreter, that “I was very tired\nfrom the trip and I wasn’t able to explain my whole story, from my\nactivities, what I did in Albania and what happened to me.”\n     7\n       Petitioner also complains that the IJ’s depiction of his\ndemeanor as “evasive” and “furtive” was “conclusory and\nunsubstantiated.” Even disregarding the demeanor appraisal would\nnot, however, undermine the IJ’s credibility finding, as it played\na minimal role in his analysis.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fOf particular relevance to the latter is the additional fact that\n\npetitioner’s parents and sister remain in Albania, apparently\n\nwithout imminent risk of harm, despite the family’s longstanding\n\nhistory of political persecution and his father’s public status as\n\nan elected DP official. Although petitioner points to his parents’\n\nadvanced age to explain their apparently peaceful existence, we\n\nhave no basis for treating age as a relevant distinction.             As to\n\nhis subjective fear of confronting persecution if he were sent back\n\nto Albania, the IJ pointed to petitioner’s decision to return home\n\nfor a number of months after the police came to his house in\n\nNovember 2000.      The judge observed that it would be “incredible”\n\nthat petitioner would return there “[i]f he truly had a fear of the\n\ngovernment.”      Moreover, at this point, years removed from his\n\ninvolvement in DP politics, there is no probative evidence that\n\npetitioner is likely to be harmed if he returns.           Thus, even if he\n\ncould show a genuine subjective fear of future persecution, he has\n\nnot   met   his   separate   obligation   to   establish    an   objectively\n\nreasonable basis for that fear. See Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121-22;\n\nBocova, 412 F.3d at 264.\n\n      In sum, our assessment of the record persuades us that the\n\nIJ’s credibility judgment was grounded on an adequate foundation\n\nand that, as a consequence, the judge supportably concluded that\n\npetitioner failed to establish either past persecution or a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.       Although that outcome renders\n\n                                   -11-\n\fany further discussion unnecessary, see Olujoke, 411 F.3d at 22 (“a\n\nfully supported adverse credibility determination, without more,\n\ncan sustain a denial of asylum”), we wish to note briefly that,\n\neven if we fully accepted the veracity of petitioner’s claims of\n\nabuse, we doubt that he would have established persecution within\n\nthe meaning of the INA.       He describes sporadic episodes, only one\n\nof which involved physical harm, and his mistreatment was less\n\nsevere than in cases in which we have upheld the BIA’s rejection of\n\npersecution claims.     See, e.g., Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128,\n\n132   (1st   Cir.    2005)    (citing   cases)      (rejecting   claim      where\n\npetitioner was arrested, detained for up to 24 hours, and beaten on\n\nseven   occasions);    Bocova,    412   F.3d   at    263-64   (citing    cases)\n\n(rejecting   claim    where    petitioner   was     beaten    twice   and    once\n\nrendered unconscious: “mistreatment ordinarily must entail more\n\nthan sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution”).\n\n      Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f",

In his oral decision, the judge said that he found it \"extremely troubling\" that petitioner testified twice that he was born in 1972 while his birth certificate showed a date of birth in 1973.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As previously noted, the IJ also was particularly bothered by the inconsistent details surrounding petitioner's detention in July 1999 and his escape from arrest in November 2000, viewing the differences as significant evidence of fabrication. The IJ also linked his credibility judgment to the other discrepancies noted above &#8212; including the date petitioner received the DP membership card and his alleged lack of access to higher education &#8212; as well as to petitioner's demeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the IJ's listed reasons for questioning petitioner's veracity are sufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard. Petitioner argues in his brief that the variations in his recollections are minor and tangential, but we think it reasonable for the judge to draw an inference of fictionalization from the differences in petitioner's portrayals of the two primary episodes of asserted persecution. Indeed, we, too, think it unlikely that petitioner could mis-remember whether the police officers who arrested him in 1999 burst through the door or gained entry by knocking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Similarly, the variation in the time petitioner reported spending away from home after his near-arrest in 2000 &#8212; a week vs. a month &#8212; need not be discounted as simply imperfect memory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other discrepancies, while perhaps minor in isolation, add to a reasonable inference of lack of candor. The different reported birth dates cast some doubt on the authenticity of his submitted birth certificate, and the DP card dated 2000, together with his testimony that he had received such a membership card only once, cast doubt on the veracity of his testimony that he joined the DP party in 1991. Although we can imagine that misunderstandings could result from imperfect translations of testimony, petitioner does not attribute any of the variations to language barriers. The IJ also reasonably could view the State Department's report that politically persecuted individuals have had access to higher education since 1992 to indicate that petitioner was disingenuously relying on lack of educational opportunity to bolster his persecution claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion thus far applies in some measure to both the showing of past persecution and to the fear of future persecution. Of particular relevance to the latter is the additional fact that petitioner's parents and sister remain in Albania, apparently without imminent risk of harm, despite the family's longstanding history of political persecution and his father's public status as an elected DP official. Although petitioner points to his parents' advanced age to explain their apparently peaceful existence, we have no basis for treating age as a relevant distinction. As to his subjective fear of confronting persecution if he were sent back to Albania, the IJ pointed to petitioner's decision to return home for a number of months after the police came to his house in November 2000. The judge observed that it would be \"incredible\" that petitioner would return there \"[i]f he truly had a fear of the government.\" Moreover, at this point, years removed from his involvement in DP politics, there is no probative evidence that petitioner is likely to be harmed if he returns. Thus, even if he could show a genuine subjective fear of future persecution, he has not met his separate obligation to establish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear. <i>See Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 121-22; <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, our assessment of the record persuades us that the IJ's credibility judgment was grounded on an adequate foundation and that, as a consequence, the judge supportably concluded that petitioner failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although that outcome renders any further discussion unnecessary, <i>see Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 22 (\"a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum\"), we wish to note briefly that, even if we fully accepted the veracity of petitioner's claims of abuse, we doubt that he would have established persecution within the meaning of the INA. He describes sporadic episodes, only one of which involved physical harm, and his mistreatment was less severe than in cases in which we have upheld the BIA's rejection of persecution claims. <i>See, e.g., Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir.2005) (citing cases) (rejecting claim where petitioner was arrested, detained for up to 24 hours, and beaten on seven occasions); <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263-64 (citing cases) (rejecting claim where petitioner was beaten twice and once rendered unconscious: \"mistreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 242(b)(4)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B), provides that \"the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> He reported that his mother had been interned from 1948 to 1952 by the Communist regime</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Petitioner submitted a document indicating that he was a member of the Association, which supposedly entitled him to various benefits.

He entered the United States using a false passport and subsequently applied for asylum and withholding of removal. In denying his application, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found that petitioner was not a credible witness and that he had failed to establish eligibility for relief. The Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion. After examining the record, we conclude that the IJ's decision is sufficiently supported and consequently deny Lumaj's petition for review. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner arrived in the United States in May 2001 and presented a Slovenian passport bearing someone else's name.

He stated that he joined the Democratic Party (DP) in 1991 and became active in the organization's Youth Forum, encouraging friends to join the party and working as an election coordinator for DP candidates. The party won the elections in 1992 and remained in power until 1997, when the Socialist Party &#8212; which petitioner links with the Communist Party &#8212; regained control of the Albanian government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner claims that he was actively involved with the Youth Forum during the June 1997 elections and that his activities, which included transporting people to the polls and to demonstrations, were watched \"by the local fanatics and the Socialist police.\" He stated that on June 29, \"two well-known criminals\" came to his car window and said: \"Keep it up and you'll end up dead.\" Another incident occurred two years later, in July 1999, when petitioner reports he was arrested at his home for participating in an illegal rally and distributing anti-government leaflets.

In his oral decision, the judge said that he found it \"extremely troubling\" that petitioner testified twice that he was born in 1972 while his birth certificate showed a date of birth in 1973.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As previously noted, the IJ also was particularly bothered by the inconsistent details surrounding petitioner's detention in July 1999 and his escape from arrest in November 2000, viewing the differences as significant evidence of fabrication. The IJ also linked his credibility judgment to the other discrepancies noted above &#8212; including the date petitioner received the DP membership card and his alleged lack of access to higher education &#8212; as well as to petitioner's demeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the IJ's listed reasons for questioning petitioner's veracity are sufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard. Petitioner argues in his brief that the variations in his recollections are minor and tangential, but we think it reasonable for the judge to draw an inference of fictionalization from the differences in petitioner's portrayals of the two primary episodes of asserted persecution. Indeed, we, too, think it unlikely that petitioner could mis-remember whether the police officers who arrested him in 1999 burst through the door or gained entry by knocking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Similarly, the variation in the time petitioner reported spending away from home after his near-arrest in 2000 &#8212; a week vs. a month &#8212; need not be discounted as simply imperfect memory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other discrepancies, while perhaps minor in isolation, add to a reasonable inference of lack of candor. The different reported birth dates cast some doubt on the authenticity of his submitted birth certificate, and the DP card dated 2000, together with his testimony that he had received such a membership card only once, cast doubt on the veracity of his testimony that he joined the DP party in 1991. Although we can imagine that misunderstandings could result from imperfect translations of testimony, petitioner does not attribute any of the variations to language barriers. The IJ also reasonably could view the State Department's report that politically persecuted individuals have had access to higher education since 1992 to indicate that petitioner was disingenuously relying on lack of educational opportunity to bolster his persecution claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion thus far applies in some measure to both the showing of past persecution and to the fear of future persecution. Of particular relevance to the latter is the additional fact that petitioner's parents and sister remain in Albania, apparently without imminent risk of harm, despite the family's longstanding history of political persecution and his father's public status as an elected DP official. Although petitioner points to his parents' advanced age to explain their apparently peaceful existence, we have no basis for treating age as a relevant distinction. As to his subjective fear of confronting persecution if he were sent back to Albania, the IJ pointed to petitioner's decision to return home for a number of months after the police came to his house in November 2000. The judge observed that it would be \"incredible\" that petitioner would return there \"[i]f he truly had a fear of the government.\" Moreover, at this point, years removed from his involvement in DP politics, there is no probative evidence that petitioner is likely to be harmed if he returns. Thus, even if he could show a genuine subjective fear of future persecution, he has not met his separate obligation to establish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear. <i>See Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 121-22; <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, our assessment of the record persuades us that the IJ's credibility judgment was grounded on an adequate foundation and that, as a consequence, the judge supportably concluded that petitioner failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although that outcome renders any further discussion unnecessary, <i>see Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 22 (\"a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum\"), we wish to note briefly that, even if we fully accepted the veracity of petitioner's claims of abuse, we doubt that he would have established persecution within the meaning of the INA. He describes sporadic episodes, only one of which involved physical harm, and his mistreatment was less severe than in cases in which we have upheld the BIA's rejection of persecution claims. <i>See, e.g., Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201738\"><a href=\"/opinion/201738/topalli-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.2005) (citing cases) (rejecting claim where petitioner was arrested, detained for up to 24 hours, and beaten on seven occasions); <i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263-64 (citing cases) (rejecting claim where petitioner was beaten twice and once rendered unconscious: \"mistreatment ordinarily must entail more than sporadic abuse in order to constitute persecution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 242(b)(4)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B), provides that \"the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> He reported that his mother had been interned from 1948 to 1952 by the Communist regime</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Petitioner submitted a document indicating that he was a member of the Association, which supposedly entitled him to various benefits.

Although this fact was not noted in the IJ's oral decision, it was the subject of inquiry by the previous IJ during proceedings in June 2003. Petitioner acknowledged that he had not reported the arrest and beating, stating, through an interpreter, that \"I was very tired from the trip and I wasn't able to explain my whole story, from my activities, what I did in Albania and what happened to me.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Petitioner also complains that the IJ's depiction of his demeanor as \"evasive\" and \"furtive\" was \"conclusory and unsubstantiated.\" Even disregarding the demeanor appraisal would not, however, undermine the IJ's credibility finding, as it played a minimal role in his analysis</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
