José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Hansen,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lynch, Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n     Rosa Elena Pérez-Agosto, Assistant Solicitor General, Office\nof the Solicitor General, Department of Justice, Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico, with whom Salvador Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor\nGeneral, and Mariana D. Negrón-Vargas, Deputy Solicitor General,\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n     Scott A. Sinder, with whom Alysa N. Zeltzer, Daniel S. Blynn,\nCollier Shannon Scott, PLLC, and Guillermo Ramos Luiña were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           March 30, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This appeal arises from the entry\n\nof an injunction based on a finding of facial unconstitutionality\n\nof provisions of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code which impose\n\nrestrictions on the ability of nonresident licensed insurance\n\nagents and brokers to participate in the Puerto Rico insurance\n\nmarket, thus advantaging resident agents and brokers.\n\n           The suit was brought by the Council of Insurance Agents\n\nand   Brokers,    an    association.         The    defendant     Puerto    Rico\n\nCommissioner of Insurance moved for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat the Council lacked standing, and the Council filed a cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment.          The district court, in a thoughtful\n\nopinion,     denied    the   Commissioner's        motion   and   granted    the\n\nCouncil's,    holding    that   the    Council     had   standing,   that    the\n\nchallenged provisions were unconstitutional, and that declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief were warranted.            See Council of Ins. Agents\n\n& Brokers v. Juarbe-Jiménez, 363 F. Supp. 2d 47 (D.P.R. 2005).\n\n           On appeal, the Commissioner does not challenge the ruling\n\nthat the statutes are unconstitutional under the Privileges and\n\nImmunities Clause (although she does question the language of the\n\ninjunction).     At the heart of her appeal is her argument that the\n\nCouncil lacked standing to raise its challenge in the first place.\n\nWe disagree, and we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                  I.\n\n            The provisions challenged in this case are P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 26, §§ 329 and 927 (2003), which have the effect of requiring\n\nthe business of insurance in Puerto Rico to be done by using agents\n\nresident in Puerto Rico.    Section 329 provides that \"[n]o insurer\n\nshall effectuate any direct insurance upon or relative to any\n\nperson, property, or other subject of insurance resident, located,\n\nor to be performed in Puerto Rico, except through a licensed agent\n\nof such insurer residing in Puerto Rico.\"1   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,\n\n§ 329(1).     Furthermore, under § 329(2), all such policies and\n\ncontracts must be countersigned by the insurer's manager, general\n\nagent, or authorized agent, who must reside in Puerto Rico.2\n\n            Section 927 prohibits nonresident agents and brokers from\n\nsoliciting insurance and inspecting risks in Puerto Rico.        Id.\n\n§ 927(1).     It allows nonresident agents and brokers to place\n\ninsurance upon subjects located or to be performed in Puerto Rico\n\nonly if the insurance was \"directly procured from the insured\n\noutside of Puerto Rico,\" id., or if the nonresident agent or broker\n\n\n     1\n       In addition, \"[i]f the insured is represented by a licensed\nbroker resident in Puerto Rico, such insurance may be effectuated\nthrough the insurer's manager, general agent, or licensed agent,\nresident in Puerto Rico.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 329(1).\n     2\n       Moreover, \"[i]f any person, property or other material\nobject subject to insurance that resides, is located in, or is to\nbe carried out in Puerto Rico is also covered by an insurance\npolicy placed or issued outside of Puerto Rico, the same must be\ncountersigned\" by a Puerto Rico resident. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,\n§ 329(2).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fplaces the insurance \"through a resident agent or broker of Puerto\n\nRico, and in an insurer authorized to transact insurance in Puerto\n\nRico,\" id. § 927(2).   Countersigning can be done only by resident\n\nagents authorized by the insurer.     Id. § 927(3).\n\n          The Council filed suit, arguing that these provisions\n\nviolated both the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const.\n\nart. IV, § 2, cl. 1, and the Equal Protection Clause, id. amend.\n\nXIV, § 1, because they gave local insurance agents and brokers an\n\nunfair competitive advantage over nonresident agents and brokers\n\n(even though the nonresident agents and brokers are licensed to\n\nsell insurance in Puerto Rico).        The Council alleged that it\n\nrepresents hundreds of insurance agencies and brokerage firms; that\n\nits \"member agencies and brokerages and their officers, directors,\n\nprincipals, and employees are located/reside outside of Puerto Rico\n\nbut sell insurance in . . . the Commonwealth\"; that its members and\n\ntheir individual associates,3 some of whom are licensed in Puerto\n\nRico, \"are suffering immediate injury and are being deprived of\n\nsignificant rights\" because of the challenged laws; and that one of\n\nthe Council's central purposes is to protect the interests of its\n\nmembers and their individual associates.        The Council sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       We refer to the officers, directors, principals, and\nemployees of the Council's members as \"individual associates.\"\n\n                                -4-\n\f           The Commissioner alleged in her answer that the Council\n\nlacked standing.       She later moved for summary judgment on the same\n\nground.    Her argument was that the Council had not demonstrated\n\nthat any of its members had suffered an injury in fact, which meant\n\nit had not shown that at least one of its members would otherwise\n\nhave standing to sue in its own right, which meant the Council's\n\nclaim of associational standing must fail.\n\n           The       Council   then   filed   a    cross-motion    for   summary\n\njudgment   and       submitted   a    memorandum     in   opposition     to     the\n\nCommissioner's motion for summary judgment.               The Council asserted\n\nthat at least some of its entity members had standing to sue in\n\ntheir own right, on the ground that entity employers may assert the\n\nconstitutional rights of their employees where violation of those\n\nrights adversely affects the financial interests or patronage of\n\nthe business. The Council attached a declaration by Ken A. Crerar,\n\nthe Council's President, which we describe in more detail below.\n\n           The Commissioner replied, arguing, inter alia, that the\n\nCouncil had not shown that any one of its members \"as such\" was\n\nlicensed   as    a    nonresident     agent   or    broker   in   Puerto      Rico.\n\nTherefore, she argued, none of the entity members could engage in\n\nthe insurance business in Puerto Rico through its individual\n\nassociates (even if the individual associates were licensed and\n\ncould have acted in Puerto Rico on their own behalf), and none\n\ncould have suffered any injury as a result of the challenged laws.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fThe Commissioner did not argue that she needed discovery on this\n\nmatter.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).         Nor did she argue that she had\n\nproof that none of the Council's members could have suffered\n\ninjury.\n\n           The     Council     responded,      attaching      a    supplemental\n\ndeclaration of Crerar, also described below.\n\n           The district court denied the Commissioner's motion and\n\ngranted the Council's cross-motion for summary judgment.                     See\n\nCouncil of Ins., 363 F. Supp. 2d at 56.             The court determined that\n\nthe Council's members had third-party standing to assert the claims\n\nof their individual associates, reasoning that \"the employers have\n\nsuffered injury in fact of thousands of dollars in lost revenues,\"\n\nthe   employers'       relationship   with    their    employees    made    them\n\neffective advocates of the employees' interests, and the employees\n\nwere ill-situated to press their own rights here.              Id. at 53.    The\n\ncourt concluded that the Council had associational standing to\n\nassert the rights of its members, and since the members had\n\nstanding to assert the rights of their individual associates, the\n\nCouncil had standing to assert the individual associates' rights.\n\nId. at 54.\n\n           As to the constitutionality of the challenged provisions,\n\nthe   district     court     determined      that     \"the    countersignature\n\nrequirement      for    nonresidents\"     violated      the   Privileges     and\n\nImmunities Clause.         Id. at 55.        It did not reach the equal\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprotection question.      Id. at 56.       The judgment repeated the final\n\nlanguage of the court's opinion and order:\n\n          [T]he countersignature requirements of . . .\n          §§ 329 and 927 are unconstitutional to the\n          extent that they deny Puerto Rico-licensed\n          nonresident insurance agents the same rights\n          and privileges that they afford Puerto Rico-\n          licensed resident agents.         The . . .\n          Commissioner . . . is enjoined from denying to\n          Puerto Rico-licensed nonresident agents the\n          same rights and privileges possessed by Puerto\n          Rico-licensed   resident   agents   under  the\n          governing statutes.\n\nId.\n\n          The    Commissioner     moved      for   reconsideration      of   the\n\nstanding issue and for clarification of the judgment.                The Council\n\nopposed this motion, and it was denied.\n\n                                      II.\n\n          We    review    de   novo    a    district     court's   rulings   on\n\ncross-motions for summary judgment, see Calero-Cerezo v. U.S.\n\nDep't. of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004), and (usually)\n\nits conclusions about standing, see Donahue v. City of Boston, 304\n\nF.3d 110, 115 (1st Cir. 2002).        We may affirm the summary judgment\n\norder on any ground justified in the record, even if our rationale\n\ndiffers from the district court's. Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town\n\nof Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The litany on summary judgment is familiar.                   Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories,    and    admissions       on   file,    together    with   the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\faffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).        Once the party moving\n\nfor   summary   judgment   \"has   asserted    that   no   genuine   issue    of\n\nmaterial fact exists,\" the party opposing summary judgment has the\n\nburden of pointing to \"specific facts demonstrating that there is,\n\nindeed, a trialworthy issue.\"       Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19.           We\n\nagree with the district court that the Commissioner not only failed\n\nto justify her own motion, but also failed to oppose adequately the\n\nCouncil's motion.\n\n            The general standing inquiry involving any plaintiff\n\nfocuses on \"whether the litigant is entitled to have the court\n\ndecide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues\"; it\n\ninvolves    both   \"constitutional        limitations     on   federal-court\n\njurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.\" Warth v.\n\nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).         The constitutional constraints\n\nare designed to ensure compliance with Article III's \"case or\n\ncontroversy\" requirement; they require that the plaintiff allege a\n\nsufficient personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.                See\n\nid.\n\n            The Supreme Court has outlined a three-part test for\n\nArticle III standing to ensure that these constitutional limits are\n\nobserved.    \"First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in\n\nfact -- an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fconcrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not\n\nconjectural or hypothetical[.]\"                      Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n504    U.S.   555,        560    (1992)       (footnote,        citations,       and   internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S.\n\n149, 155 (1990)).                \"Second, there must be a causal connection\n\nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of\"; in other words,\n\nthe injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged\n\naction rather than to some third party's independent action.                                  Id.\n\nAnd third, it must be likely that a favorable decision will redress\n\nthe injury.         Id.\n\n              The question of standing of plaintiff associations, while\n\nwithin the general rule, is subject to its own subset of rules.\n\n\"Even in the absence of injury to itself, an association may have\n\nstanding solely as the representative of its members.\"                             Warth, 422\n\nU.S.    at    511;        see     also    Rumsfeld         v.     Forum    for    Academic      &\n\nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 1297, No. 04-1152, 2006 U.S.\n\nLEXIS 2025, at *10 n.2 (March 6, 2006) (association of law schools\n\nand law faculties had associational standing to bring suit on\n\nbehalf of its members).                   There are three requirements for an\n\nassociation, which has not itself suffered injury, to have standing\n\nto bring suit on behalf of its members: \"(a) its members would\n\notherwise     have        standing       to    sue    in     their   own   right;       (b)   the\n\ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's\n\npurpose;      and    (c)        neither       the    claim      asserted   nor    the    relief\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\frequested requires the participation of individual members in the\n\nlawsuit.\"    Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333,\n\n343 (1977).\n\n            The dispute on appeal is whether the Council has met its\n\nburden of showing associational standing, see Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n\n561 (burden of establishing elements of standing is on party\n\ninvoking    federal   jurisdiction),   to   challenge   the   Puerto   Rico\n\nInsurance Code provisions on behalf of its entity members.             Even\n\nmore narrowly, the dispute is whether the first prong of the Hunt\n\ntest is satisfied,4 that is, whether \"at least some members of the\n\n[Council] would have had standing to bring this suit in their own\n\nright.\"     UAW v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 286 (1986); see also United\n\nStates v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 116 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that\n\nif \"at least one\" member \"possesses standing to sue in [its] own\n\nright,\" first prong is satisfied).\n\n            As to the standing of the association's entity members to\n\nraise the rights of their individual associates, there is yet\n\nanother three-part test.     In addition to showing that the third-\n\nparty claim satisfies the three basic Article III requirements, the\n\nlitigant asserting third-party standing must show the following:\n\nfirst, \"that the litigant personally has suffered an injury in fact\n\n\n\n     4\n        The Commissioner does not argue on appeal that the\ngermaneness requirement is not satisfied or that individual\nmembers' participation is necessary. In any event, it is clear\nthat Hunt's second and third prongs are satisfied.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthat       gives    rise   to    a   sufficiently     concrete   interest   in   the\n\nadjudication of the third party's rights\"; second, \"that the\n\nlitigant has a close relationship to the third party\"; and third,\n\n\"that some hindrance exists that prevents the third party from\n\nprotecting its own interests.\"              Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ., 386\n\nF.3d 344, 351 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                 The Council says its licensed members have standing to\n\nchallenge the laws on behalf of their individual associates, and so\n\nthe Council has standing. The Commissioner argues that the Council\n\nfailed to carry its burden of proof to establish standing.                       See\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (\"[E]ach element [of standing] must be\n\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the\n\nplaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and\n\ndegree      of     evidence     required   at   the   successive   stages   of   the\n\nlitigation.\").         The Commissioner has two main theories.\n\n                 She argues first her theory that the Council has no\n\nstanding unless its entity members have suffered injury5 in their\n\n\n\n       5\n       The Commissioner's only challenge to the standing of the\nindividual associates is that they are free to act on their own\nbehalf and that they cannot be harmed by the challenged laws when\nthey are unable to act on their employers' behalf, since the\nemployers are not licensed to participate in the Puerto Rico market\nanyway. This final proposition fails, as explained in the text.\nThe Commissioner does not otherwise challenge injury in fact,\ncausation, and redressability, as to the individual associates.\nNor does she dispute that the Council's members have sufficiently\nclose relationships with their employees, and that the members are\nfar better situated than the employees to protect the employees'\ninterests.\n\n                                           -11-\n\fown right, and that the entities cannot gain standing through their\n\nemployees.      She argues that a peculiarity of Puerto Rico law\n\npermits her to make the argument.           As a matter of federal law, the\n\ntheory itself is questionable.                 The Council's entity members\n\nordinarily     would   have    third-party       standing      to   represent    the\n\ninterests of their individual associates, and the Council has\n\nassociational standing on behalf of its members.                    See N.Y. State\n\nClub   Ass'n    v.   City    of   New   York,     487   U.S.    1,    9-10     (1988)\n\n(undertaking a similar analysis).\n\n            The Commissioner's argument is based on the Puerto Rico\n\nlaw requirement that entities and not just individuals must be\n\nlicensed to engage in the insurance industry in Puerto Rico.                     See\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 926.          Misreading the record, she contends\n\nthat it is an uncontested fact that none of the Council's members\n\nhas a license to operate in the Puerto Rico market.                     That means,\n\nshe argues, that none of the Council's members can compete in that\n\nmarket, nor can their individual associates compete there on the\n\nmembers' behalf, even if the individual associates are licensed.\n\nBecause of the total inability to compete created by the members'\n\nlack of licenses, she says, the members cannot be harmed by the\n\nchallenged provisions, which at best make it more difficult or\n\nexpensive      for   licensed     nonresident       insurance        agencies    and\n\nbrokerages to compete in Puerto Rico.              The fact that none of the\n\nCouncil's    members   has    suffered     an    injury   in    fact,    she    says,\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fvitiates any possibility that the members could have third-party\n\nstanding to raise the rights of the members' individual associates\n\nand destroys the Council's claim of associational standing.\n\n          The Commissioner's factual assertion is squarely refuted\n\nby the record, and she has offered no contrary evidence to create\n\na dispute of material fact on this or any other point.         The\n\nsupplemental Crerar declaration clearly states that \"[s]ome Council\n\nmembers that are based outside of Puerto Rico are licensed as\n\nnonresident agents and brokers by the Insurance Commissioner of\n\nPuerto Rico . . . and sell insurance services and products,\n\ncurrently through unaffiliated countersigning resident agents, in\n\nPuerto Rico.\"   (Emphases added.)     The Commissioner argues this\n\nCrerar declaration must be disregarded because it was filed too\n\nlate and without the court's permission.    But the district court\n\nwas clearly entitled to and did consider the declaration, which\n\nonly clarified evidence that was proffered earlier.6\n\n\n     6\n        During discovery, in responding to the Commissioner's\ninterrogatories, the Council had stated that \"[a]ll nonresident\nagents and brokers, some of whom are Council members and their\n[individual associates], are subject to the burdens and injuries\ncaused by complying with the challenged countersignature laws.\"\nThe Council later submitted the first Crerar declaration, which\nstated that \"[t]he Council's members include insurance agencies and\nbrokerage firms that are based outside of Puerto Rico\" and that\n\"[t]he Council also represents its members' [individual associates]\nwho are licensed [in Puerto Rico] and act as licensed nonresident\ninsurance agents and brokers selling insurance services and\nproducts, currently through countersigning resident agents, in\nPuerto Rico, but who reside outside of that Commonwealth.\" The\nsupplemental Crerar declaration clarified that \"[t]he Council's\nmembership includes insurance agencies and brokerages -- all\n\n                               -13-\n\f              The Commissioner next objects that the declaration failed\n\nto \"particularize or specify\" who the licensed nonresident members\n\nwere.7      But the Council was not obliged to provide specific names\n\nabsent some contest by the Commissioner of the accuracy of the\n\nrepresentation by the Council.8             What was important was that the\n\nCouncil's President declared, under penalty of perjury, that such\n\nmembers existed. This declaration was facially sufficient. Had it\n\nbeen       called   into    question   by     competent   evidence   from   the\n\nCommissioner, there would have been a genuine factual dispute, but\n\nit was not; the only facts on the record were those put there by\n\nthe    Council.       The    Commissioner's     failure   to   controvert   the\n\nCouncil's version of the facts with her own evidence is fatal to\n\nher appeal.9        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (providing that party\n\n\ncorporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships; its\nmembership does not include any individuals.\"\n       7\n       The Commissioner also argues that the Council failed to\nspecify which of the members' individual associates were licensed.\nThis argument fails for the reasons stated in the text.\n       8\n       Indeed, the Council had offered to make its confidential\nmembership list available, if certain reasonable conditions were\nmet, so that the Commissioner could check that list against her own\nrecords to determine which members and individual associates were\nlicensed in Puerto Rico.\n       9\n        We emphasize that the Commissioner could have sought\nadditional time to conduct more pointed discovery on this issue\nbefore she responded to the Council's cross-motion for summary\njudgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) (providing that if it appears\nfrom the affidavits of the party opposing summary judgment that the\nparty \"cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts\nessential to justify the party's opposition,\" then the court may,\namong other things, \"order a continuance to permit affidavits to be\n\n                                       -14-\n\fopposing adequately supported summary judgment motion may not rest\n\nupon \"mere allegations or denials,\" but must, by affidavit or\n\notherwise, \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial\").\n\n            The     Commissioner's   second      theory    is   that,    licensure\n\naside, the Council's allegations regarding its members' injury in\n\nfact were not sufficiently concrete and specific.                       Again, the\n\nargument misrepresents the record.            The Council, in answering an\n\ninterrogatory, identified numerous specific injuries suffered by\n\nits members and their individual associates, including: losing\n\nbusiness because of the total prohibition on certain activities,\n\nhaving to engage in burdensome administrative efforts to arrange\n\nfor resident countersigning agents for permitted transactions (and\n\nlosing clients unhappy with these transaction costs), and, in some\n\ncases,     foregoing       participation    in    the     Puerto   Rico     market\n\naltogether. The first Crerar declaration described these and other\n\nburdens,     such     as    interference    with    individual      associates'\n\nrelationships with their clients, and stated that annual costs of\n\ncompliance were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost\n\nbusiness.    This evidence, unrebutted by any factual proffer from\n\n\n\n\nobtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had\").                  She\ndid not do so.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe Commissioner, was enough to support summary judgment for the\n\nCouncil.10\n\n             In the end, this appeal involves the Commissioner's\n\nattempt to preserve in place an unconstitutional statutory scheme\n\non the flimsy basis that the wrong plaintiff sued, when in fact the\n\nplaintiff has asserted all of the elements needed for standing and\n\nthe    Commissioner     has   never   contested     the    accuracy      of   those\n\nassertions.\n\n                                      III.\n\n             The Commissioner also appeals the district court's denial\n\nof her motion for reconsideration and clarification, which was\n\nbrought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).                   See Fed. R.\n\nCiv.    P.   59(e)   (providing     for   motions   to    alter   or    amend   the\n\njudgment).     We normally review the district court's denial of such\n\nmotions for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"                 Binkley Co. v. E.\n\nTank, Inc., 831 F.2d 333, 337 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n             The     Commissioner     sought   from      the   district       court\n\nclarification of whether the judgment declared unconstitutional\n\nthose provisions of §§ 329 and 927, especially § 927(1) and (2),\n\nthat are not technically \"countersignature\" provisions, and whether\n\nit applies to brokers (as distinct from agents).\n\n\n       10\n       The Commissioner also argues that the Crerar declarations\nwere insufficient because they were not based on personal\nknowledge.   The declarations and the Council's answers to the\nCommissioner's interrogatories, also supplied by Crerar, were\nadequate; as stated, Crerar was the President of the Council.\n\n                                      -16-\n\f              The motion for clarification as presented to the district\n\ncourt    appeared      to        seek   to     undo     the       declaration      of\n\nunconstitutionality.        It is no surprise the Council opposed it and\n\nthe   court    rejected     it    without    opinion.        To   the   extent    the\n\n\"clarification\" sought was merely technical, as the Commissioner\n\nnow suggests on appeal, we note that the Commissioner made no\n\nattempt to work with the Council to agree on substitute language\n\nuntil prompted by us at oral argument.\n\n              After we raised this issue at oral argument, the parties\n\nagreed to work together, and they have jointly submitted a proposed\n\nmodified judgment.        They have agreed that the judgment extends to\n\nall provisions of §§ 329 and 927, including § 927(1) and (2), that\n\ndeny Puerto Rico-licensed nonresident agents and brokers the same\n\nrights   and    privileges       that   they   afford       Puerto   Rico-licensed\n\nresident agents and brokers.                They also have agreed that the\n\njudgment    should   be     modified    to   make    this    meaning    clearer    by\n\ndeleting the one instance of the word \"countersignature\" and by\n\nadding the words \"and brokers\" after each of the four references to\n\n\"agents.\"\n\n              The parties' proposal reflects our understanding of the\n\ndistrict court's intended meaning.                  In light of the parties'\n\nagreement, we remand with instructions for the district court to\n\nenter a modified judgment with the clarifications described above.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f                                  IV.\n\n          The   judgment   is   remanded   for   modification   and,   as\n\nmodified, is affirmed.     Costs are awarded to the Council.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

The defendant Puerto Rico Commissioner of Insurance moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Council lacked standing, and the Council filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court, in a thoughtful opinion, denied the Commissioner's motion and granted the Council's, holding that the Council had standing, that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional, and that declaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. <i>See Council of Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers v. Juarbe-Jim&#233;nez,</i> 363 F.Supp.2d 47 (D.P.R.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Commissioner does not challenge the ruling that the statutes are unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause (although she does question the language of the injunction). At the heart of her appeal is her argument that the Council lacked standing to raise its challenge in the first place. We disagree, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions challenged in this case are P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 329 and 927 (2003), which have the effect of requiring the business of insurance in Puerto Rico to be done by using agents resident in Puerto Rico. Section 329 provides that \"[n]o insurer shall effectuate any direct insurance upon or relative to any person, property, or other subject of insurance resident, located, or to be performed in Puerto Rico, except through a licensed agent of such insurer residing in Puerto Rico.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 329(1). Furthermore, under &#167; 329(2), all such policies and contracts must be countersigned by the insurer's manager, general agent, or authorized agent, who must reside in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 927 prohibits nonresident agents and brokers from soliciting insurance and inspecting risks in Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 927(1). It allows nonresident agents and brokers to place insurance upon subjects located or to be performed in Puerto Rico only if the insurance was \"directly procured from the insured outside of Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.,</i> or if the nonresident agent or broker places the insurance \"through a resident agent or broker of Puerto Rico, and in an insurer authorized to transact insurance in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 927(2). Countersigning can be done only by resident agents authorized by the insurer. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 927(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council filed suit, arguing that these provisions violated both the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 2, cl. 1, and the Equal Protection Clause, <i>id.</i> amend. XIV, &#167; 1, because they gave local insurance agents and brokers an unfair competitive advantage over nonresident agents and brokers (even though the nonresident agents and brokers are licensed to sell insurance in Puerto Rico). The Council alleged that it represents hundreds of insurance agencies and brokerage firms; that its \"member agencies and brokerages and their officers, directors, principals, and employees are located/reside outside of Puerto Rico but sell insurance in . . . the Commonwealth\"; that its members and their individual associates,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> some of whom are licensed in Puerto Rico, \"are suffering immediate injury and are being deprived of significant rights\" because of the challenged laws; and that one of the Council's central purposes is to protect the interests of its members and their individual associates. The Council sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner alleged in her answer that the Council lacked standing. She later moved for summary judgment on the same ground. Her argument was that the Council had not demonstrated that any of its members had suffered an injury in fact, which meant it had not shown that at least one of its members would otherwise have standing to sue in its own right, which meant the Council's claim of associational standing must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council then filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and submitted a memorandum in opposition to the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment. The Council asserted that at least some of its entity members had standing to sue in their own right, on the ground that entity employers may assert the constitutional rights of their employees where violation of those rights adversely affects the financial interests or patronage of the business. The Council attached a declaration by Ken A. Crerar, the Council's President, which we describe in more detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner replied, arguing, inter alia, that the Council had not shown that any one of its members \"as such\" was licensed as a nonresident agent or broker in Puerto Rico. Therefore, she argued, none of the entity members could engage in the insurance business in Puerto Rico through its individual associates (even if the individual associates were licensed and could have acted in Puerto Rico on their <i>own</i> behalf), and none could have suffered any injury as a result of the challenged laws. The Commissioner did not argue that she needed discovery on this matter. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Nor did she argue that she had proof that none of the Council's members could have suffered injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council responded, attaching a supplemental declaration of Crerar, also described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the Commissioner's motion and granted the Council's cross-motion for summary judgment. <i>See Council of Ins.,</i> 363 F.Supp.2d at 56. The court determined that the Council's members had third-party standing to assert the claims of their individual associates, reasoning that \"the employers have suffered injury in fact of thousands of dollars in lost revenues,\" the employers' relationship with their employees made them effective advocates of the employees' interests, and the employees were ill-situated to press their own rights here. <i>Id.</i> at 53. The court concluded that the Council had associational standing to assert the rights of its members, and since the members had standing to assert the rights of their individual associates, the Council had standing to assert the individual associates' rights. <i>Id.</i> at 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the constitutionality of the challenged provisions, the district court determined that \"the countersignature requirement for nonresidents\" violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 55. It did not reach the equal protection question. <i>Id.</i> at 56.

Once the party moving for summary judgment \"has asserted that no genuine issue of material fact exists,\" the party opposing summary judgment has the burden of pointing to \"specific facts demonstrating that there is, indeed, a trialworthy issue.\" <i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 19.

AVX Corp.,</i> 962 F.2d 108, 116 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that if \"at least one\" member \"possesses standing to sue in [its] own right,\" first prong is satisfied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the standing of the association's entity members to raise the rights of their individual associates, there is yet another three-part test. In addition to showing that the third-party claim satisfies the three basic Article III requirements, the litigant asserting third-party standing must show the following: first, \"that the litigant personally has suffered an injury in fact that gives rise to a sufficiently concrete interest in the adjudication of the third party's rights\"; second, \"that the litigant has a close relationship to the third party\"; and third, \"that some hindrance exists that prevents the third party from protecting its own interests.\" <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 351 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council says its licensed members have standing to challenge the laws on behalf of their individual associates, and so the Council has standing. The Commissioner argues that the Council failed to carry its burden of proof to establish standing. <i>See Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (\"[E]ach element [of standing] must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"). The Commissioner has two main theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She argues first her theory that the Council has no standing unless its entity members have suffered injury<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> in their own right, and that the entities cannot gain standing through their employees. She argues that a peculiarity of Puerto Rico law permits her to make the argument. As a matter of federal law, the theory itself is questionable. The Council's entity members ordinarily would have third-party standing to represent the interests of their individual associates, and the Council has associational standing on behalf of its members. <i>See N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 9-10, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (undertaking a similar analysis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's argument is based on the Puerto Rico law requirement that entities and not just individuals must be licensed to engage in the insurance industry in Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 926. Misreading the record, she contends that it is an uncontested fact that none of the Council's members has a license to operate in the Puerto Rico market. That means, she argues, that none of the Council's members can compete in that market, nor can their individual associates compete there on the members' behalf, even if the individual associates are licensed. Because of the total inability to compete created by the members' lack of licenses, she says, the members cannot be harmed by the challenged provisions, which at best make it more difficult or expensive for <i>licensed</i> nonresident insurance agencies and brokerages to compete in Puerto Rico. The fact that none of the Council's members has suffered an injury in fact, she says, vitiates any possibility that the members could have third-party standing to raise the rights of the members' individual associates and destroys the Council's claim of associational standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's factual assertion is squarely refuted by the record, and she has offered no contrary evidence to create a dispute of material fact on this or any other point. The supplemental Crerar declaration clearly states that \"[s]ome Council <i>members</i> that are based outside of Puerto Rico <i>are licensed</i> as nonresident agents and brokers by the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico . . . and sell insurance services and products, currently through unaffiliated countersigning resident agents, in Puerto Rico.\" (Emphases added.) The Commissioner argues this Crerar declaration must be disregarded because it was filed too late and without the court's permission. But the district court was clearly entitled to and did consider the declaration, which only clarified evidence that was proffered earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner next objects that the declaration failed to \"particularize or specify\" who the licensed nonresident members were.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> But the Council was not obliged to provide specific names absent some contest by the Commissioner of the accuracy of the representation by the Council.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> What was important was that the Council's President declared, under penalty of perjury, that such members existed. This declaration was facially sufficient. Had it been called into question by competent evidence from the Commissioner, there would have been a genuine factual dispute, but it was not; the only facts on the record were those put there by the Council. The Commissioner's failure to controvert the Council's version of the facts with her own evidence is fatal to her appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (providing that party opposing adequately supported summary judgment motion may not rest upon \"mere allegations or denials,\" but must, by affidavit or otherwise, \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's second theory is that, licensure aside, the Council's allegations regarding its members' injury in fact were not sufficiently concrete and specific. Again, the argument misrepresents the record. The Council, in answering an interrogatory, identified numerous specific injuries suffered by its members and their individual associates, including: losing business because of the total prohibition on certain activities, having to engage in burdensome administrative efforts to arrange for resident countersigning agents for permitted transactions (and losing clients unhappy with these transaction costs), and, in some cases, foregoing participation in the Puerto Rico market altogether. The first Crerar declaration described these and other burdens, such as interference with individual associates' relationships with their clients, and stated that annual costs of compliance were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost business. This evidence, unrebutted by any factual proffer from the Commissioner, was enough to support summary judgment for the Council.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, this appeal involves the Commissioner's attempt to preserve in place an unconstitutional statutory scheme on the flimsy basis that the wrong plaintiff sued, when in fact the plaintiff has asserted all of the elements needed for standing and the Commissioner has never contested the accuracy of those assertions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner also appeals the district court's denial of her motion for reconsideration and clarification, which was brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (providing for motions to alter or amend the judgment). We normally review the district court's denial of such motions for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>Binkley Co. v. E. Tank, Inc.,</i> 831 F.2d 333, 337 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner sought from the district court clarification of whether the judgment declared unconstitutional those provisions of &#167;&#167; 329 and 927, especially &#167; 927(1) and (2), that are not technically \"countersignature\" provisions, and whether it applies to brokers (as distinct from agents).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for clarification as presented to the district court appeared to seek to undo the declaration of unconstitutionality. It is no surprise the Council opposed it and the court rejected it without opinion. To the extent the \"clarification\" sought was merely technical, as the Commissioner now suggests on appeal, we note that the Commissioner made no attempt to work with the Council to agree on substitute language until prompted by us at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After we raised this issue at oral argument, the parties agreed to work together, and they have jointly submitted a proposed modified judgment. They have agreed that the judgment extends to all provisions of &#167;&#167; 329 and 927, including &#167; 927(1) and (2), that deny Puerto Rico-licensed nonresident agents and brokers the same rights and privileges that they afford Puerto Rico-licensed resident agents and brokers. They also have agreed that the judgment should be modified to make this meaning clearer by deleting the one instance of the word \"countersignature\" and by adding the words \"and brokers\" after each of the four references to \"agents.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties' proposal reflects our understanding of the district court's intended meaning.

This final proposition fails, as explained in the text. The Commissioner does not otherwise challenge injury in fact, causation, and redressability, as to the individual associates.

The defendant Puerto Rico Commissioner of Insurance moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Council lacked standing, and the Council filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court, in a thoughtful opinion, denied the Commissioner's motion and granted the Council's, holding that the Council had standing, that the challenged provisions were unconstitutional, and that declaratory and injunctive relief were warranted. <i>See Council of Ins.

At the heart of her appeal is her argument that the Council lacked standing to raise its challenge in the first place. We disagree, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions challenged in this case are P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 329 and 927 (2003), which have the effect of requiring the business of insurance in Puerto Rico to be done by using agents resident in Puerto Rico. Section 329 provides that \"[n]o insurer shall effectuate any direct insurance upon or relative to any person, property, or other subject of insurance resident, located, or to be performed in Puerto Rico, except through a licensed agent of such insurer residing in Puerto Rico.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 329(1). Furthermore, under &#167; 329(2), all such policies and contracts must be countersigned by the insurer's manager, general agent, or authorized agent, who must reside in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 927 prohibits nonresident agents and brokers from soliciting insurance and inspecting risks in Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 927(1). It allows nonresident agents and brokers to place insurance upon subjects located or to be performed in Puerto Rico only if the insurance was \"directly procured from the insured outside of Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.,</i> or if the nonresident agent or broker places the insurance \"through a resident agent or broker of Puerto Rico, and in an insurer authorized to transact insurance in Puerto Rico,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 927(2). Countersigning can be done only by resident agents authorized by the insurer. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 927(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council filed suit, arguing that these provisions violated both the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 2, cl. 1, and the Equal Protection Clause, <i>id.</i> amend. XIV, &#167; 1, because they gave local insurance agents and brokers an unfair competitive advantage over nonresident agents and brokers (even though the nonresident agents and brokers are licensed to sell insurance in Puerto Rico). The Council alleged that it represents hundreds of insurance agencies and brokerage firms; that its \"member agencies and brokerages and their officers, directors, principals, and employees are located/reside outside of Puerto Rico but sell insurance in . . . the Commonwealth\"; that its members and their individual associates,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> some of whom are licensed in Puerto Rico, \"are suffering immediate injury and are being deprived of significant rights\" because of the challenged laws; and that one of the Council's central purposes is to protect the interests of its members and their individual associates.

She later moved for summary judgment on the same ground. Her argument was that the Council had not demonstrated that any of its members had suffered an injury in fact, which meant it had not shown that at least one of its members would otherwise have standing to sue in its own right, which meant the Council's claim of associational standing must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council then filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and submitted a memorandum in opposition to the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment. The Council asserted that at least some of its entity members had standing to sue in their own right, on the ground that entity employers may assert the constitutional rights of their employees where violation of those rights adversely affects the financial interests or patronage of the business. The Council attached a declaration by Ken A. Crerar, the Council's President, which we describe in more detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner replied, arguing, inter alia, that the Council had not shown that any one of its members \"as such\" was licensed as a nonresident agent or broker in Puerto Rico. Therefore, she argued, none of the entity members could engage in the insurance business in Puerto Rico through its individual associates (even if the individual associates were licensed and could have acted in Puerto Rico on their <i>own</i> behalf), and none could have suffered any injury as a result of the challenged laws. The Commissioner did not argue that she needed discovery on this matter. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Nor did she argue that she had proof that none of the Council's members could have suffered injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Council responded, attaching a supplemental declaration of Crerar, also described below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the Commissioner's motion and granted the Council's cross-motion for summary judgment. <i>See Council of Ins.,</i> 363 F.Supp.2d at 56. The court determined that the Council's members had third-party standing to assert the claims of their individual associates, reasoning that \"the employers have suffered injury in fact of thousands of dollars in lost revenues,\" the employers' relationship with their employees made them effective advocates of the employees' interests, and the employees were ill-situated to press their own rights here. <i>Id.</i> at 53. The court concluded that the Council had associational standing to assert the rights of its members, and since the members had standing to assert the rights of their individual associates, the Council had standing to assert the individual associates' rights. <i>Id.</i> at 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the constitutionality of the challenged provisions, the district court determined that \"the countersignature requirement for nonresidents\" violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 55.

She argues that a peculiarity of Puerto Rico law permits her to make the argument. As a matter of federal law, the theory itself is questionable. The Council's entity members ordinarily would have third-party standing to represent the interests of their individual associates, and the Council has associational standing on behalf of its members. <i>See N.Y.

Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 926. Misreading the record, she contends that it is an uncontested fact that none of the Council's members has a license to operate in the Puerto Rico market. That means, she argues, that none of the Council's members can compete in that market, nor can their individual associates compete there on the members' behalf, even if the individual associates are licensed. Because of the total inability to compete created by the members' lack of licenses, she says, the members cannot be harmed by the challenged provisions, which at best make it more difficult or expensive for <i>licensed</i> nonresident insurance agencies and brokerages to compete in Puerto Rico. The fact that none of the Council's members has suffered an injury in fact, she says, vitiates any possibility that the members could have third-party standing to raise the rights of the members' individual associates and destroys the Council's claim of associational standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's factual assertion is squarely refuted by the record, and she has offered no contrary evidence to create a dispute of material fact on this or any other point. The supplemental Crerar declaration clearly states that \"[s]ome Council <i>members</i> that are based outside of Puerto Rico <i>are licensed</i> as nonresident agents and brokers by the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico . . . and sell insurance services and products, currently through unaffiliated countersigning resident agents, in Puerto Rico.\" (Emphases added.) The Commissioner argues this Crerar declaration must be disregarded because it was filed too late and without the court's permission. But the district court was clearly entitled to and did consider the declaration, which only clarified evidence that was proffered earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner next objects that the declaration failed to \"particularize or specify\" who the licensed nonresident members were.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> But the Council was not obliged to provide specific names absent some contest by the Commissioner of the accuracy of the representation by the Council.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> What was important was that the Council's President declared, under penalty of perjury, that such members existed. This declaration was facially sufficient. Had it been called into question by competent evidence from the Commissioner, there would have been a genuine factual dispute, but it was not; the only facts on the record were those put there by the Council. The Commissioner's failure to controvert the Council's version of the facts with her own evidence is fatal to her appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (providing that party opposing adequately supported summary judgment motion may not rest upon \"mere allegations or denials,\" but must, by affidavit or otherwise, \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's second theory is that, licensure aside, the Council's allegations regarding its members' injury in fact were not sufficiently concrete and specific. Again, the argument misrepresents the record. The Council, in answering an interrogatory, identified numerous specific injuries suffered by its members and their individual associates, including: losing business because of the total prohibition on certain activities, having to engage in burdensome administrative efforts to arrange for resident countersigning agents for permitted transactions (and losing clients unhappy with these transaction costs), and, in some cases, foregoing participation in the Puerto Rico market altogether. The first Crerar declaration described these and other burdens, such as interference with individual associates' relationships with their clients, and stated that annual costs of compliance were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost business. This evidence, unrebutted by any factual proffer from the Commissioner, was enough to support summary judgment for the Council.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, this appeal involves the Commissioner's attempt to preserve in place an unconstitutional statutory scheme on the flimsy basis that the wrong plaintiff sued, when in fact the plaintiff has asserted all of the elements needed for standing and the Commissioner has never contested the accuracy of those assertions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner also appeals the district court's denial of her motion for reconsideration and clarification, which was brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (providing for motions to alter or amend the judgment). We normally review the district court's denial of such motions for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>Binkley Co. v. E.
