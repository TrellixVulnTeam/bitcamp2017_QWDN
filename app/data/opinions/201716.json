For the reasons stated in\n\nthis opinion we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n              Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\na judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).                       Review of\n\na grant of summary judgment is de novo, with the reviewing court\n\nlooking      at    \"the    record    and   ask[ing]    if    a   fact    finder    could\n\nrationally reach a different conclusion from that of the [district]\n\ncourt.\"      Nicolo v. Phillip Morris Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving         party.     Id.      Massachusetts      negligence       law    is    the\n\nsubstantive law that governs this case.                Goldman v. United States,\n\n790 F.3d 181, 183 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n              The questions raised by the Hartels on appeal require us\n\nto   first    determine      whether       the    district   court      relied    on   any\n\nmaterial fact genuinely in controversy in reaching its decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f           The material facts found by the district court are as\n\nfollows. The United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") operates a post\n\noffice in Falmouth, Massachusetts.            On or about September 1995, as\n\npart of a renovation project of the premises, the USPS installed\n\nnew   ornamental    rails    at   the   front   entrance   to   the   building,\n\nadjacent to which were also installed railings for persons with\n\ndisabilities.      As stated by the district court:\n\n           The ornamental handrail was the taller of the\n           two and ended at the last tread on the stairs.\n           The handicap handrail extended approximately\n           two feet beyond the ornamental handrail. Both\n           handrails were painted black.\n\nHartel v. United States, No. 02-10101, slip op. at 4 (D. Mass.\n\nOct. 12, 2004).     This description accurately depicts the handrails\n\nshown in the photographs submitted with the United States' motion\n\nfor summary judgment, which Mrs. Hartel agreed depict the site\n\naccurately.     See id. at 9, n.3.        These photographs show that the\n\nhandrails appear open to the public view to anyone who transits the\n\nsidewalk or the stairway leading into the post office, or enters\n\nthe stairway from the adjacent flagstone path.\n\n           On June 25, 1999, Mrs. Hartel visited the Falmouth Post\n\nOffice, as she had done on at least twenty occasions in the year\n\nprior to that date.         On at least ten of those occasions, she had\n\nwalked in and out of the post office entrance, using the stairway\n\nwhere the two sets of railings were located.               On the other ten\n\noccasions she walked within fifteen feet of this area to free-\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fstanding mailboxes.    Although Mrs. Hartel was \"sure [she] did\"\n\nnotice that additional handrails had been installed, she did not\n\n\"consciously think about it.\"    Id. at 5.\n\n           On the day in question, after entering the post office\n\nbuilding following a path up the middle of the renovated stairway,\n\nMrs. Hartel mailed some letters, and left down the same stairway\n\ncarrying approximately twenty legal and standard sized envelopes,\n\nwhich she held with both hands. As she got to the end of the higher\n\nornamental handrail, Mrs. Hartel testified, she was not aware of\n\nthe lower handicap rail.   As she turned right from the stairway she\n\nfell.   After falling to the ground, Mrs. Hartel turned and saw that\n\nthe handicap handrail extended beyond the ornamental hand rail and,\n\nthus, concluded that she had fallen over the handicap handrail. As\n\na result of the fall, Mrs. Hartel suffered serious injuries,\n\nbreaking a hip and having to undergo two operations.\n\n           The above facts1 are sufficient to sustain the ruling of\n\nthe district court which is based on settled Massachusetts law\n\nregarding open and obvious conditions. See O'Sullivan v. Shaw, 420\n\nMass. 201, 204-06 (Mass. 2000)(\"[I]t is well established in our law\n\nof negligence that a land owner's duty to protect lawful visitors\n\n\n1\n   The \"disputed facts\" limned at pages 20-21 of appellant's brief\nare simply insubstantial and irrelevant to the district court's\nruling.

Morse & Co.,\n76 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir. 1996).

Priestly, 402 Mass. 84, 89 (Mass.\n\n1988) (\"Ordinarily, a landowner has no duty to protect lawful\n\nvisitors on his property from risks that would be obvious to\n\npersons of average intelligence.\").\n\n          Both handrails, in whatever condition they were in, were\n\nobviously apparent to any passerby and thus, the land owner is\n\nrelieved of any duty of care as to risks arising therefrom.       In the\n\ncase of such obvious conditions there is neither a duty to warn nor\n\nto maintain a safe premise because there is simply no duty of care.\n\nO'Sullivan, 420 Mass. at 206 (\"the open and obvious danger rule\n\n. . . operates to negate the existence of a duty of care\"); see\n\nalso id. at 204 (finding no duty to \"protect\" visitors against\n\nobvious danger of diving into shallow end of swimming pool);\n\nToubiana, 402 Mass. at 88-89 (noting duty to maintain elevator in\n\nsafe condition, but finding no duty to \"protect\" passenger from\n\nobvious danger of using elevator to transport tall items protruding\n\nthrough carriage ceiling).    Nor is the \"open and obvious\" doctrine\n\nlimited to only inherently dangerous conditions, as is claimed by\n\nappellants.    See,   e.g.,   Toubiana,   402   Mass.   84   (riding   an\n\nelevator); Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass. 837 (1987)\n\n(filling one's gas tank); Del Sesto v.
