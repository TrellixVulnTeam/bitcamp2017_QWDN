Reardon, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Thomas\nF. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for respondent.\n\n                                May 20, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f     Per Curiam.    Toraino Pridgen and his brother Satron Pridgen\n\nwere convicted in 1999 in Massachusetts Superior Court of assault\n\nand battery with a dangerous weapon.              The convictions followed\n\ntheir joint     trial   on    charges    stemming   from   an   early    morning\n\nshooting at a birthday party in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on\n\nOctober   25,   1998.        Toraino    Pridgen   has   brought   this    appeal\n\nchallenging the district court's denial of his petition for a writ\n\nof habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.            The writ alleged denials\n\nof due process in the form of arguments that Pridgen was convicted\n\non legally insufficient evidence, see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\n\n307 (1979), and that his joint trial with his look-alike brother\n\n(who, in petitioner's view, was asserting an antagonistic defense)\n\nrendered his trial fundamentally unfair, see Zafiro v. United\n\nStates, 506 U.S. 534 (1993).\n\n     The parties clash over the appropriate standards of review and\n\nwhether the joint trial issue is properly before us.              But even if\n\nwe assume arguendo proper issue preservation and the applicability\n\nof petitioner-friendly reviewing standards, we see no error in the\n\ndistrict court's denial of the petition. As petitioner recognizes,\n\nthe conviction was appropriate if a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that petitioner was present at the scene of the crime with\n\nknowledge that his brother intended to commit the crime and, by\n\nagreement, was willing and available to assist his brother if\n\fnecessary.   See Commonwealth v. Bianco, 388 Mass. 358, 366 (1983).1\n\nHere, the trial evidence warranted such a finding.        There was\n\ntestimony from which the jury could have concluded that petitioner,\n\nshortly after encouraging his brother to shoot another party guest,\n\nnodded to his brother just before his brother shot the victim.2\n\nThis testimony tends to establish petitioner's physical presence at\n\nthe crime scene, his prior knowledge of his brother's mens rea, and\n\nhis personal intent to support his brother in the contemplated\n\nshooting crime.    No more was constitutionally required to ground\n\nthe conviction.3\n\n\n     1\n      This is not the only theory under which the jury might have\nconvicted petitioner, but it is a theory that is both consistent\nwith the jury instructions and, as we explain, supported by the\ntrial testimony.\n     2\n      To arrive at this conclusion, the jury would have had to find\nthat the victim -- who testified that petitioner shot him after a\nnod from petitioner's brother -- confused the two. But there was\nample evidence, including evidence that the brothers strongly\nresembled one another and that the brother was the shooter, to\nsupport such a finding.\n     3\n      In presenting his arguments, petitioner makes much of the\ntrial court's refusal to instruct the jury that the defendants'\nintentions with respect to the man they initially accosted (but did\nnot shoot) properly could be \"transferred\" to the shooting\nincident. Petitioner also highlights the trial court's decision to\nstrike the shooting victim's characterization of the nod that\npreceded the shooting as one of \"agreement.\" Petitioner seems to\ninfer from these rulings that the earlier assault evidence is\nlargely irrelevant and that any nod was not one of agreement. But\nthe refusal to give a transferred intent jury instruction is, quite\nplainly, not tantamount to a determination that the evidence of the\ninitial assault had no relevance to the issues of knowledge and\nintent raised in this case; to the contrary, the jury remained free\nto draw from this evidence any conclusions about petitioner's\nintent and knowledge that were reasonable.      And similarly, the\n\n                                -3-\n\f     There also was no constitutional violation in permitting the\n\nbrothers to be jointly tried. Petitioner's only developed argument\n\nthat a severance was constitutionally required proceeds from the\n\npremise that there was insufficient evidence to convict petitioner\n\nunder a joint venture theory -- a premise we have just rejected.\n\nMoreover,   and       in   any   event,    a    joint   trial   in    the   case    of\n\nantagonistic defenses violates a defendant's constitutional due\n\nprocess rights only if it compromises a specific trial right of the\n\ndefendant or if it prevents the jury from making a reliable\n\njudgment about guilt or innocence.                See Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539\n\n(elaborating a severance might be required where evidence is\n\nadmitted that is probative of a defendant's guilt but admissible\n\nonly against      a    codefendant,       or    where   evidence     that   tends   to\n\nexculpate a defendant is excluded because of the presence of a\n\ncodefendant).     And here, petitioner has failed to establish either\n\na deprivation of a specific trial right or that the jury's judgment\n\nshould be disregarded as unreliable.\n\n     For the reasons stated, we affirm the denial of petitioner\n\nToraino Pridgen's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\n\n\nstriking of the victim's characterization of the nod does not mean\nthat the jury was precluded from inferring for itself that the nod\nwas one of support and that it communicated a promise of assistance\nif necessary.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
