José Fernando Rodríguez-Ortiz\n\nfiled a federal securities fraud claim against his former employer\n\nMargo Caribe, Inc. and its chief executive officer, Michael J.\n\nSpector (collectively, \"Margo\") over Margo's refusal to allow\n\nRodríguez to exercise certain stock options after he resigned from\n\nthe company. The district court dismissed the claim for failure to\n\nmeet the pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation\n\nReform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b), and Rodríguez now\n\nchallenges that dismissal.    As to Rodríguez's primary theory of\n\nfraud, under the PSLRA, Rodríguez has not pleaded \"facts giving\n\nrise to a strong inference\" of scienter.        Id. § 78u-4(b)(2).\n\nRodríguez adverts to a second theory as well, but even assuming\n\nsuch a theory were available, he has not sufficiently specified the\n\n\"statement alleged to have been misleading\" under that theory. Id.\n\n§ 78u-4(b)(1). We thus affirm the dismissal of Rodríguez's federal\n\nsecurities fraud claim.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Because we are reviewing a motion to dismiss, we recite\n\nthe facts as alleged in Rodríguez's complaint in the light most\n\nfavorable to him.   See In re Cabletron Sys., Inc., 311 F.3d 11, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Rodríguez worked for Margo Caribe as its president and\n\nchief operating officer, beginning no later than 2001. On or about\n\nFebruary 9, 2001, Rodríguez was offered a compensation package from\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe company that was to include stock options under the 1998 Margo\n\nStock Option Plan.      Subsequently, Rodríguez and the company signed\n\na Stock Option Agreement, dated March 2, 2001.           The Stock Option\n\nAgreement, at section 5(b), provided that if Rodríguez terminated\n\nhis employment \"voluntarily (with or without the consent of [Margo\n\nCaribe]),\" the options would become fully vested and could be\n\nexercised for a period of time after the separation.\n\n          On September 3, 2003, at Spector's request, Rodríguez and\n\nSpector   began   to     discuss   the     possibility   of       Rodríguez's\n\nresignation.      The    parties   began    to   negotiate    a    separation\n\nagreement, but on September 12, after the parties' attorneys had\n\nworked out the details of an agreement, Margo withdrew from the\n\nnegotiations and informed Rodríguez that no agreement would be\n\nforthcoming.   That same day, Rodríguez tendered his resignation.\n\nRodríguez asserts that throughout the negotiations, he\n\n          at all times notified Margo of his intention\n          to exercise his rights under the Stock Option\n          Agreement in the event of his resignation and\n          was led to believe by Margo that his\n          resignation would, and could, not be treated\n          as [a] dismissal for any purposes, including\n          without limitation, for purposes of the Stock\n          Option Agreement.\n\n          On October 20, 2003, Rodríguez filed suit against Margo\n\nCaribe in federal court in Puerto Rico, initially asserting a COBRA\n\nclaim and a state law claim for bad faith withdrawal from the\n\nseparation agreement negotiations.         These claims are not at issue\n\non appeal.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            On October 31, 2003, Rodríguez informed the company of\n\nhis intention to exercise his options under the Stock Option\n\nAgreement.     On November 14, the company replied that Rodríguez's\n\nresignation would be treated as a dismissal under the Agreement,\n\nthat as a result the company had the right to terminate his\n\noptions, and that the company intended to exercise its right of\n\ntermination.       That same day, the company also issued a press\n\nrelease stating that Rodríguez had been dismissed from the company\n\non August 29, 2003.\n\n            On November 24, 2003, Rodríguez amended his complaint to\n\nadd Spector as a defendant and to add a federal securities fraud\n\nclaim under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange\n\nAct   of   1934,   15   U.S.C.   §§   78j(b),   78t(a),   and   Rule   10b-5\n\npromulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder,\n\n17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.      Rodríguez also added a state law claim for\n\nbreach of the Stock Option Agreement. On March 31, 2004, Rodríguez\n\nfurther amended his complaint and added a state law claim for\n\nsecurities fraud.       The alleged fraud was that the company \"never\n\nintended to honor the terms and conditions of the Stock Option\n\nAgreement\" and that the company and Spector had made misleading\n\n\"representations regarding the effect of [Rodríguez's] resignation\"\n\nunder the Agreement.\n\n            Margo filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter alia,\n\nthat the federal securities claim should be dismissed for failure\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fto satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA and\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).1\n\n          The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge,\n\nwho recommended that it be denied in its entirety.          On the\n\nsecurities fraud claim, the magistrate judge found that Rodríguez\n\nhad satisfied the heightened pleading standards \"by providing the\n\ntime, place, date and content of the alleged misrepresentation,\"\n\nnamely the \"promise\" in the Stock Option Agreement itself \"that in\n\nthe event of [Rodríguez's] resignation the full Option would vest.\"\n\n          On August 29, 2005, the district court issued an opinion\n\nand order in which it declined to adopt the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommendation on this point and determined instead that Rodríguez\n\nhad not satisfied the pleading standards of the PSLRA.    The court\n\nfound that Rodríguez had \"failed to specify a materially misleading\n\nstatement or omission, in connection with the sale\" of securities,\n\nand that while he had alleged \"misrepresentations right and left,\"\n\nhe had not \"specifie[d] their time, place and content.\"   Moreover,\n\nthe court noted that \"given the juxtaposition of the alleged fraud\n\nwith the dismissal and not the original sale of the option,\" the\n\ncomplaint seemed to impermissibly allege \"fraud in hindsight.\"   As\n\na result, the district court granted the motion to dismiss the\n\n\n     1\n       Rule 9(b) requires that \"the circumstances constituting\nfraud . . . be stated with particularity.\" We have previously held\nthat our pre-PSLRA case law interpreting Rule 9(b) in the context\nof securities fraud claims is \"consistent with the PSLRA.\" Greebel\nv. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 194 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                               -5-\n\ffederal      securities      claim.     The    court      declined   to     exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.2\n\n                                        II.\n\n              Our review of the district court's granting of the motion\n\nto dismiss is de novo, and we may affirm on any ground apparent in\n\nthe record.         See Ezra Charitable Trust v. Tyco Int'l, Ltd., 466\n\nF.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              At the outset, we note that even under the liberal\n\npleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, the Supreme\n\nCourt has recently held that to survive a motion to dismiss, a\n\ncomplaint must allege \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\"                      Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1967 (2007).                 In so doing,\n\nthe Court disavowed the oft-quoted language of Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355   U.S.    41,    45-46    (1957),   that   \"a    complaint   should      not   be\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\nhis claim which would entitle him to relief.\"                  See Twombly, 127\n\nS. Ct. at 1969.           The Court found that the \"no set of facts\"\n\nlanguage, if taken literally, would impermissibly allow for the\n\npleading of \"a wholly conclusory statement of [a] claim,\" and that\n\n\"after    puzzling      the    profession      for   50    years,    this     famous\n\nobservation has earned its retirement.\"               Id. at 1968, 1969.\n\n\n      2\n        The district court adopted the magistrate judge's\nrecommendation to deny the motion to dismiss the COBRA claim. The\nparties later settled this claim.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              To make out a claim under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5,\n\nRodríguez needed to allege that\n\n              (1) [Margo] made a materially false or\n              misleading statement or failed to state a fact\n              necessary to make a statement not misleading;\n              (2) in connection with the purchase or sale of\n              a security; (3) with the intent to deceive,\n              manipulate,   or   defraud;   and   that   (4)\n              [Rodríguez] was injured by his reasonable\n              reliance on [Margo's] misrepresentations.\n\nWortley v. Camplin, 333 F.3d 284, 294 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\n\nDura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005).               The\n\nfirst and third elements are critical here.\n\n              The PSLRA imposes two heightened pleading requirements on\n\nfederal securities fraud claims, beyond the requirements of Rule 8.\n\nFirst,   to     support   allegations     of   misleading   statements    or\n\nomissions, the complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to\n\nhave been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is\n\nmisleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or\n\nomission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall\n\nstate with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\"\n\n15   U.S.C.    §   78u-4(b)(1).    This    standard   is    \"congruent   and\n\nconsistent with the pre-existing standards of this circuit\" under\n\nRule 9(b), Greebel, 194 F.3d at 193, under which we required the\n\n\"specification of the time, place, and content of an alleged false\n\nrepresentation,\" id. (quoting McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc.,\n\n633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1980)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            Second, allegations of scienter must be made by stating\n\n\"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that\n\nthe defendant acted with the required state of mind.\"               15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78u-4(b)(2).         The \"required state of mind\" for liability under\n\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is \"intent to deceive, manipulate, or\n\ndefraud,\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976), or\n\nrecklessness that goes beyond \"ordinary negligence and is closer to\n\na lesser form of intent,\" Greebel, 194 F.3d at 199.\n\n            On a motion to dismiss in a securities fraud case, this\n\n\"strong inference\" standard has several consequences.                 A court\n\ncontinues to take all factual allegations as true and to draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.              See Aldridge v.\n\nA.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 78-79 (1st Cir. 2002).             However, as\n\nto scienter, not any inference will do: the ultimate inference of\n\nscienter must be a strong one.              See Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 28.\n\nThis involves some assessment of the strength of inferences.                This\n\ncircuit has adopted the rule that the inference of scienter is not\n\nstrong \"when, viewed in light of the complaint as a whole, there\n\nare legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally\n\nconvincing.\"     In re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., 431 F.3d 36,\n\n49 (1st Cir. 2005).        Furthermore, in this circuit we have avoided\n\nthe   use   of   any    \"rigid   pleading    formula\"   for   determining   the\n\nsufficiency of allegations of scienter, \"instead 'preferring to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\frely on a \"fact-specific approach\" that proceeds case by case.'\"3\n\nEzra Charitable Trust, 466 F.3d at 6 (quoting Cabletron, 311 F.3d\n\nat 38).\n\n          Rodríguez argues that he has met both of these pleading\n\nrequirements, but on his primary theory, while he has specified the\n\nmisleading statements, he has not alleged facts to support a strong\n\ninference of scienter.     He adverts briefly to another theory, but\n\nwhether or not he has sufficiently alleged scienter as to that\n\ntheory, he has not specified the misleading statements in support\n\nof that theory. Because Rodríguez cannot meet both requirements as\n\nto any one theory, his claim was properly dismissed.\n\n          Rodríguez argues that he has satisfied the requirement to\n\nspecify the \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged misleading\n\nrepresentations by pointing to section 5(b) of the Stock Option\n\nAgreement, which provided for the vesting of his options following\n\na voluntary resignation.    The theory is that when a party \"makes a\n\nspecific promise, as part of the consideration for the transfer of\n\nsecurities, to perform an act, while intending not to perform the\n\nact, this may constitute a basis for a fraud finding.\"      Wortley,\n\n333 F.3d at 294 (citing United Int'l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf\n\n(Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1221 (10th Cir. 2000), aff'd, 532\n\nU.S. 588 (2001)).   Rodríguez contends that Margo misled him into\n\n\n     3\n       See Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs, Inc., 437 F.3d\n588, 601 (7th Cir. 2006) (describing the different approaches in\nthe various circuits), cert. granted, 127 S. Ct. 853 (2007).\n\n                                  -9-\n\faccepting options as part of his compensation package, while\n\nsecretly intending either never to allow the exercise of the\n\noptions at all, or at least never to allow their exercise following\n\na voluntary resignation.\n\n            In the context of such a claim, however, the requisite\n\nscienter is an intent to deceive at the time the promise was made,\n\nnot a later intent to break a promise already made.            See Wharf\n\nHoldings, 532 U.S. at 596-97 (distinguishing a federal securities\n\nclaim from an \"ordinary state breach-of-contract\" claim on the\n\nbasis of an allegation of a \"secret[] inten[t] from the very\n\nbeginning not to honor the option\" (emphasis added)).         Thus, under\n\nthe PSLRA, Rodríguez was required to allege facts sufficient to\n\nestablish a strong inference that in 2001, when the Agreement was\n\nsigned, Margo intended to deceive Rodríguez by agreeing to section\n\n5(b) while secretly intending to violate it.\n\n            It   is   on   this   requirement   that   Rodríguez's   claim\n\nfounders.   His allegations of wrongdoing relate almost entirely to\n\nthe later period starting on September 3, 2003, when he and Spector\n\nbegan to discuss the possibility of his resignation.            Rodríguez\n\nargues that his resignation was merely a \"triggering event\" that\n\nprovided the occasion for Margo to act on its \"long standing\"\n\nintention to violate section 5(b) of the Agreement.             Rodríguez\n\npoints primarily to the alleged violation itself, however, as the\n\nbasis on which to infer that intention.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            The bare allegation that Margo violated the Agreement in\n\n2003 is not enough to establish a strong inference that Margo never\n\nintended to abide by the Agreement when it signed it in 2001.                  To\n\nhold otherwise would be to permit the pleading of a form of \"fraud\n\nby hindsight,\" essentially inferring earlier knowledge based only\n\non   the   situation    that   later    came   to   pass.      This    we     have\n\nconsistently rejected.      See, e.g., Ezra Charitable Trust, 466 F.3d\n\nat 6.\n\n            Nor    do   Rodríguez's    additional      allegations     help    to\n\nestablish a strong inference of Margo's intent in 2001.               Rodríguez\n\npoints to the November 2003 press release as showing that Margo had\n\na hidden intention to treat his resignation as a dismissal.                 But by\n\nits terms, the press release stated only that Rodríguez had been\n\ndismissed as of August 2003, which bears no relationship to Margo's\n\nintentions in 2001.       Similarly, in an apparent attempt to allege\n\nbad faith on Margo's part, Rodríguez makes much of the fact that it\n\nwas not until \"after the breakdown in the negotiations of a\n\nseparation    agreement,\"      that    he    learned   \"that   he     had     been\n\ndismissed.\"       Like the press release, such an allegation suggests\n\nthat it was only later that Margo decided to treat Rodríguez as\n\ndismissed, thereby weighing against a strong inference of scienter\n\nin 2001.\n\n            Rodríguez also argues that Margo claimed broad discretion\n\nin interpreting the Agreement and that such claims support an\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\finference that Margo never intended to be bound by the Agreement.\n\nThe    complaint,       however,    only    specifically       alleges    that     after\n\nRodríguez's resignation, Margo claimed the discretion to treat that\n\nresignation as a dismissal.              Again, there are no allegations to\n\nsupport an inference that Margo had any such interpretation of the\n\nAgreement prior to 2003.                Rodríguez did not allege any facts\n\nsuggesting that Margo had ever considered how it might interpret\n\nsection 5(b) of the Agreement before the issue arose in 2003, or\n\nthat        either   party    had   considered        the   issue   in   signing     the\n\nAgreement.4          Cf. Wortley, 333 F.3d at 295 (finding that a jury\n\ncould        reasonably      conclude    that     a    contractual       promise     was\n\nfraudulently made where the promisor never intended to keep the\n\npromise and the promisee had made it clear to the promisor that\n\nsuch a promise was indispensable to the agreement).\n\n                Finally,     Rodríguez     attributes        significance     to     the\n\nallegation that the proposed, but unexecuted, separation agreement\n\nwould have required him to waive his right to sue Margo, including\n\nfor breach of the Stock Option Agreement.                   It is not apparent why\n\nsuch a provision, freely agreed upon, would have indicated wrongful\n\n\n\n\n        4\n       The lack of any such facts also shows that Rodríguez has not\nalleged that Margo had a motive and opportunity to commit fraud by\nhiding its intended interpretation of the Agreement. See Greebel,\n194 F.3d at 197 (finding the pleading of motive and opportunity\nneither necessary nor always sufficient for a strong inference of\nscienter, but finding it potentially relevant to the issue).\n\n                                           -12-\n\fintent in 2003, let alone why it has any bearing on Margo's intent\n\nin signing the Stock Option Agreement.\n\n           Thus, even considering the various facts offered by\n\nRodríguez in combination, see Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82, he failed\n\nto plead facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter.\n\nThe constellation of facts pleaded are at least equally, if not\n\nmore, consistent with an inference that Margo chose its course only\n\nafter relations soured.        See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49.\n\nRodríguez alleged little that is probative of Margo's intent when\n\nit signed the Stock Option Agreement, and hence is unable to raise\n\na strong inference as to that intent.\n\n           Rodríguez has also suggested a separate theory that Margo\n\nknew from the beginning of the separation agreement negotiations in\n\nSeptember 2003 that it intended to treat Rodríguez's resignation as\n\na dismissal and that it hid this intention from Rodríguez.           Under\n\nthis theory, distinct from the one above, the deception lay in the\n\nmisrepresentation of Margo's intentions at the time Rodríguez\n\ndecided to resign.      In support of this theory as a basis for\n\nliability under the securities laws, Rodríguez cites to Smith v.\n\nDuff & Phelps, Inc., 891 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir. 1990).         In Smith, the\n\nEleventh   Circuit   held   that   in   some   situations   an   employee's\n\ndecision to resign or retire can be an investment decision for\n\npurposes of federal securities law, triggering a requirement on the\n\npart of management to disclose objective material information. Id.\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fat 1574.   Assuming, without deciding, that Smith is good law, it is\n\ndoubtful that this case falls within either the rule or the\n\nrationale of Smith, but we need not decide the issue.      Nor need we\n\ndecide whether Rodríguez sufficiently pleaded scienter even if such\n\na theory were plausible.\n\n           It is clear that any putative claim based on this theory\n\nfails under the PSLRA because Rodríguez did not sufficiently\n\nspecify the relevant misrepresentations.         Rodríguez's complaint\n\nrepeatedly makes only the general claim that he \"was led to believe\n\nby Margo that his resignation would, and could, not be treated as\n\n[a] dismissal for any purposes, including without limitation, for\n\npurposes   of   the   Stock   Option   Agreement.\"   Nowhere   does   the\n\ncomplaint specify what statements led Rodríguez to such a belief,\n\nnor when and in what context such statements were made.        Nor does\n\nthe complaint specify any instances in which Margo misled Rodríguez\n\nby failing to correct any expressions to the contrary.           Such a\n\ngeneral allegation falls far short of the requirement to specify\n\nthe \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged misrepresentations or\n\nmisleading omissions.     See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 193.\n\n           Because Rodríguez did not meet both of the PSLRA's\n\npleading requirements with respect to either of his theories of\n\nliability, his claim for federal securities fraud was properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

The district court dismissed the claim for failure to meet the pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b), and Rodr&#237;guez now challenges that dismissal. As to Rodr&#237;guez's primary theory of fraud, under the PSLRA, Rodr&#237;guez has not pleaded \"facts giving rise to a strong inference\" of scienter. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). Rodr&#237;guez adverts to a second theory as well, but even assuming such a theory were available, he has not sufficiently specified the \"statement alleged to have been misleading\" under that theory. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 78u-4(b)(1).

On or about February 9, 2001, Rodr&#237;guez was offered a compensation package from the company that was to include stock options under the 1998 Margo Stock Option Plan. Subsequently, Rodr&#237;guez and the company signed a Stock Option Agreement, dated March 2, 2001. The Stock Option Agreement, at section 5(b), provided that if Rodr&#237;guez terminated his employment \"voluntarily (with or without the consent of [Margo Caribe]),\" the options would become fully vested and could be exercised for a period of time after the separation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, 2003, at Spector's request, Rodr&#237;guez and Spector began to discuss the possibility of Rodr&#237;guez's resignation. The parties began to negotiate a separation agreement, but on September 12, after the parties' attorneys had worked out the details of an agreement, Margo withdrew from the negotiations and informed Rodr&#237;guez that no agreement would be forthcoming. That same day, Rodr&#237;guez tendered his resignation. Rodr&#237;guez asserts that throughout the negotiations, he</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">at all times notified Margo of his intention to exercise his rights under the Stock Option Agreement in the event of his resignation and was led to believe by Margo that his resignation would, and could, not be treated as [a] dismissal for any purposes, including without limitation, for purposes of the Stock Option Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 2003, Rodr&#237;guez filed suit against Margo Caribe in federal court in Puerto Rico, initially asserting a COBRA claim and a state law claim for bad faith withdrawal from the separation agreement negotiations. These claims are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2003, Rodr&#237;guez informed the company of his intention to exercise his options under the Stock Option Agreement. On November 14, the company replied that Rodr&#237;guez's resignation would be treated as a dismissal under the Agreement, that as a result the company had the right to terminate his options, and that the company intended to exercise its right of termination. That same day, the company also issued a press release stating that Rodr&#237;guez had been dismissed from the company on August 29, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 24, 2003, Rodr&#237;guez amended his complaint to add Spector as a defendant and to add a federal securities fraud claim under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5. Rodr&#237;guez also added a state law claim for breach of the Stock Option Agreement. On March 31, 2004, Rodr&#237;guez further amended his complaint and added a state law claim for securities fraud. The alleged fraud was that the company \"never intended to honor the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Agreement\" and that the company and Spector had made misleading \"representations regarding the effect of [Rodr&#237;guez's] resignation\" under the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Margo filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that the federal securities claim should be dismissed for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that it be denied in its entirety. On the securities fraud claim, the magistrate judge found that Rodr&#237;guez had satisfied the heightened pleading standards \"by providing the time, place, date and content of the alleged misrepresentation,\" namely the \"promise\" in the Stock Option Agreement itself \"that in the event of [Rodr&#237;guez's] resignation the full Option would vest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 2005, the district court issued an opinion and order in which it declined to adopt the magistrate judge's recommendation on this point and determined instead that Rodr&#237;guez had not satisfied the pleading standards of the PSLRA. The court found that Rodr&#237;guez had \"failed to specify a materially misleading statement or omission, in connection with the sale\" of securities, and that while he had alleged \"misrepresentations right and left,\" he had not \"specifie[d] their time, place and content.\" Moreover, the court noted that \"given the juxtaposition of the alleged fraud with the dismissal and not the original sale of the option,\" the complaint seemed to impermissibly allege \"fraud in hindsight.\" As a result, the district court granted the motion to dismiss the federal securities claim. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's granting of the motion to dismiss is de novo, and we may affirm on any ground apparent in the record. <i>See Ezra Charitable Trust v.

Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1967, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). In so doing, the Court disavowed the oft-quoted language of <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), that \"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" <i>See Twombly,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1969. The Court found that the \"no set of facts\" language, if taken literally, would impermissibly allow for the pleading of \"a wholly conclusory statement of [a] claim,\" and that \"after puzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous observation has earned its retirement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1968, 1969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make out a claim under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Rodr&#237;guez needed to allege that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) [Margo] made a materially false or misleading statement or failed to state a fact necessary to make a statement not misleading; (2) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security; (3) with the intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud; and that (4) [Rodr&#237;guez] was injured by his reasonable reliance on [Margo's] misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Wortley v.

The first and third elements are critical here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSLRA imposes two heightened pleading requirements on federal securities fraud claims, beyond the requirements of Rule 8. First, to support allegations of misleading statements or omissions, the complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1). This standard is \"congruent and consistent with the pre-existing standards of this circuit\" under Rule 9(b), <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 193, under which we required the \"specification of the time, place, and content of an alleged false representation,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc.,</i> 633 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir.1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, allegations of scienter must be made by stating \"with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). The \"required state of mind\" for liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is \"intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), or recklessness that goes beyond \"ordinary negligence and is closer to a lesser form of intent,\" <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a motion to dismiss in a securities fraud case, this \"strong inference\" standard has several consequences. A court continues to take all factual allegations as true and to draw all <i>reasonable</i> inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <i>See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 72, 78-79 (1st Cir.2002). However, as to scienter, not any inference will do: the ultimate inference of scienter must be a strong one. <i>See Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 28. This involves some assessment of the strength of inferences. This circuit has adopted the rule that the inference of scienter is not strong \"when, viewed in light of the complaint as a whole, there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally convincing.\" <i>In re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,</i> 431 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir.2005). Furthermore, in this circuit we have avoided the use of any \"rigid pleading formula\" for determining the sufficiency of allegations of scienter, \"instead `preferring to rely on a \"fact-specific approach\" that proceeds case by case.'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Ezra Charitable Trust,</i> 466 F.3d at 6 (quoting <i>Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 38).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez argues that he has met both of these pleading requirements, but on his primary theory, while he has specified the misleading statements, he has not alleged facts to support a strong inference of scienter. He adverts briefly to another theory, but whether or not he has sufficiently alleged scienter as to that theory, he has not specified the misleading statements in support of that theory. Because Rodr&#237;guez cannot meet both requirements as to any one theory, his claim was properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez argues that he has satisfied the requirement to specify the \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged misleading representations by pointing to section 5(b) of the Stock Option Agreement, which provided for the vesting of his options following a voluntary resignation. The theory is that when a party \"makes a specific promise, as part of the consideration for the transfer of securities, to perform an act, while intending not to perform the act, this may constitute a basis for a fraud finding.\" <i>Wortley,</i> 333 F.3d at 294 (citing <i>United Int'l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf</i> (<i>Holdings</i>) <i>Ltd.,</i> 210 F.3d 1207, 1221 (10th Cir.2000), <i>aff'd,</i> 532 U.S. 588, 121 S.Ct. 1776, 149 L.Ed.2d 845 (2001)). Rodr&#237;guez contends that Margo misled him into accepting options as part of his compensation package, while secretly intending either never to allow the exercise of the options at all, or at least never to allow their exercise following a voluntary resignation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of such a claim, however, the requisite scienter is an intent to deceive at the time the promise was made, not a later intent to break a promise already made. <i>See Wharf Holdings,</i> 532 U.S. at 596-97, 121 S.Ct. 1776 (distinguishing a federal securities claim from an \"ordinary state breach-of-contract\" claim on the basis of an allegation of a \"secret[] inten[t] <i>from the very beginning</i> not to honor the option\" (emphasis added)). Thus, under the PSLRA, Rodr&#237;guez was required to allege facts sufficient to establish a strong inference that in 2001, when the Agreement was signed, Margo intended to deceive Rodr&#237;guez by agreeing to section 5(b) while secretly intending to violate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is on this requirement that Rodr&#237;guez's claim founders. His allegations of wrongdoing relate almost entirely to the later period starting on September 3, 2003, when he and Spector began to discuss the possibility of his resignation. Rodr&#237;guez argues that his resignation was merely a \"triggering event\" that provided the occasion for Margo to act on its \"long standing\" intention to violate section 5(b) of the Agreement. Rodr&#237;guez points primarily to the alleged violation itself, however, as the basis on which to infer that intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bare allegation that Margo violated the Agreement in 2003 is not enough to establish a strong inference that Margo never intended to abide by the Agreement when it signed it in 2001. To hold otherwise would be to permit the pleading of a form of \"fraud by hindsight,\" essentially inferring earlier knowledge based only on the situation that later came to pass. This we have consistently rejected. <i>See, e.g., Ezra Charitable Trust,</i> 466 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do Rodr&#237;guez's additional allegations help to establish a strong inference of Margo's intent in 2001. Rodr&#237;guez points to the November 2003 press release as showing that Margo had a hidden intention to treat his resignation as a dismissal. But by its terms, the press release stated only that Rodr&#237;guez had been dismissed as of August 2003, which bears no relationship to Margo's intentions in 2001. Similarly, in an apparent attempt to allege bad faith on Margo's part, Rodr&#237;guez makes much of the fact that it was not until \"after the breakdown in the negotiations of a separation agreement,\" that he learned \"that he had been dismissed.\" Like the press release, such an allegation suggests that it was only later that Margo decided to treat Rodr&#237;guez as dismissed, thereby weighing against a strong inference of scienter in 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez also argues that Margo claimed broad discretion in interpreting the Agreement and that such claims support an inference that Margo never intended to be bound by the Agreement. The complaint, however, only specifically alleges that after Rodr&#237;guez's resignation, Margo claimed the discretion to treat that resignation as a dismissal. Again, there are no allegations to support an inference that Margo had any such interpretation of the Agreement prior to 2003. Rodr&#237;guez did not allege any facts suggesting that Margo had ever considered how it might interpret section 5(b) of the Agreement before the issue arose in 2003, or that either party had considered the issue in signing the Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf. Wortley,</i> 333 F.3d at 295 (finding that a jury could reasonably conclude that a contractual promise was fraudulently made where the promisor never intended to keep the promise and the promisee had made it clear to the promisor that such a promise was indispensable to the agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodr&#237;guez attributes significance to the allegation that the proposed, but unexecuted, separation agreement would have required him to waive his right to sue Margo, including for breach of the Stock Option Agreement. It is not apparent why such a provision, freely agreed upon, would have indicated wrongful intent in 2003, let alone why it has any bearing on Margo's intent in signing the Stock Option Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even considering the various facts offered by Rodr&#237;guez in combination, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82, he failed to plead facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter. The constellation of facts pleaded are at least equally, if not more, consistent with an inference that Margo chose its course only after relations soured. <i>See Credit Suisse,</i> 431 F.3d at 49. Rodr&#237;guez alleged little that is probative of Margo's intent when it signed the Stock Option Agreement, and hence is unable to raise a strong inference as to that intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez has also suggested a separate theory that Margo knew from the beginning of the separation agreement negotiations in September 2003 that it intended to treat Rodr&#237;guez's resignation as a dismissal and that it hid this intention from Rodr&#237;guez. Under this theory, distinct from the one above, the deception lay in the misrepresentation of Margo's intentions at the time Rodr&#237;guez decided to resign. In support of this theory as a basis for liability under the securities laws, Rodr&#237;guez cites to <i>Smith v. Duff &amp; Phelps, Inc.,</i> 891 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir.1990). In <i>Smith,</i> the Eleventh Circuit held that in some situations an employee's decision to resign or retire can be an investment decision for purposes of federal securities law, triggering a requirement on the part of management to disclose objective material information. <i>Id.</i> at 1574. Assuming, without deciding, that <i>Smith</i> is good law, it is doubtful that this case falls within either the rule or the rationale of <i>Smith,</i> but we need not decide the issue. Nor need we decide whether Rodr&#237;guez sufficiently pleaded scienter even if such a theory were plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that any putative claim based on this theory fails under the PSLRA because Rodr&#237;guez did not sufficiently specify the relevant misrepresentations. Rodr&#237;guez's complaint repeatedly makes only the general claim that he \"was led to believe by Margo that his resignation would, and could, not be treated as [a] dismissal for any purposes, including without limitation, for purposes of the Stock Option Agreement.\" Nowhere does the complaint specify what statements led Rodr&#237;guez to such a belief, nor when and in what context such statements were made. Nor does the complaint specify any instances in which Margo misled Rodr&#237;guez by failing to correct any expressions to the contrary.

On or about February 9, 2001, Rodr&#237;guez was offered a compensation package from the company that was to include stock options under the 1998 Margo Stock Option Plan. Subsequently, Rodr&#237;guez and the company signed a Stock Option Agreement, dated March 2, 2001. The Stock Option Agreement, at section 5(b), provided that if Rodr&#237;guez terminated his employment \"voluntarily (with or without the consent of [Margo Caribe]),\" the options would become fully vested and could be exercised for a period of time after the separation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 3, 2003, at Spector's request, Rodr&#237;guez and Spector began to discuss the possibility of Rodr&#237;guez's resignation.

That same day, Rodr&#237;guez tendered his resignation.

Rodr&#237;guez also added a state law claim for breach of the Stock Option Agreement. On March 31, 2004, Rodr&#237;guez further amended his complaint and added a state law claim for securities fraud. The alleged fraud was that the company \"never intended to honor the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Agreement\" and that the company and Spector had made misleading \"representations regarding the effect of [Rodr&#237;guez's] resignation\" under the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Margo filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that the federal securities claim should be dismissed for failure to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that it be denied in its entirety.

The court found that Rodr&#237;guez had \"failed to specify a materially misleading statement or omission, in connection with the sale\" of securities, and that while he had alleged \"misrepresentations right and left,\" he had not \"specifie[d] their time, place and content.\" Moreover, the court noted that \"given the juxtaposition of the alleged fraud with the dismissal and not the original sale of the option,\" the complaint seemed to impermissibly allege \"fraud in hindsight.\" As a result, the district court granted the motion to dismiss the federal securities claim.

First, to support allegations of misleading statements or omissions, the complaint must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1). This standard is \"congruent and consistent with the pre-existing standards of this circuit\" under Rule 9(b), <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 193, under which we required the \"specification of the time, place, and content of an alleged false representation,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>McGinty v.

However, as to scienter, not any inference will do: the ultimate inference of scienter must be a strong one. <i>See Cabletron,</i> 311 F.3d at 28. This involves some assessment of the strength of inferences. This circuit has adopted the rule that the inference of scienter is not strong \"when, viewed in light of the complaint as a whole, there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that are equally convincing.\" <i>In re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201960\"><a href=\"/opinion/201960/in-re-credit-suisse-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2005).

Thus, under the PSLRA, Rodr&#237;guez was required to allege facts sufficient to establish a strong inference that in 2001, when the Agreement was signed, Margo intended to deceive Rodr&#237;guez by agreeing to section 5(b) while secretly intending to violate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is on this requirement that Rodr&#237;guez's claim founders. His allegations of wrongdoing relate almost entirely to the later period starting on September 3, 2003, when he and Spector began to discuss the possibility of his resignation. Rodr&#237;guez argues that his resignation was merely a \"triggering event\" that provided the occasion for Margo to act on its \"long standing\" intention to violate section 5(b) of the Agreement. Rodr&#237;guez points primarily to the alleged violation itself, however, as the basis on which to infer that intention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bare allegation that Margo violated the Agreement in 2003 is not enough to establish a strong inference that Margo never intended to abide by the Agreement when it signed it in 2001. To hold otherwise would be to permit the pleading of a form of \"fraud by hindsight,\" essentially inferring earlier knowledge based only on the situation that later came to pass. This we have consistently rejected. <i>See, e.g., Ezra Charitable Trust,</i> 466 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do Rodr&#237;guez's additional allegations help to establish a strong inference of Margo's intent in 2001. Rodr&#237;guez points to the November 2003 press release as showing that Margo had a hidden intention to treat his resignation as a dismissal. But by its terms, the press release stated only that Rodr&#237;guez had been dismissed as of August 2003, which bears no relationship to Margo's intentions in 2001. Similarly, in an apparent attempt to allege bad faith on Margo's part, Rodr&#237;guez makes much of the fact that it was not until \"after the breakdown in the negotiations of a separation agreement,\" that he learned \"that he had been dismissed.\" Like the press release, such an allegation suggests that it was only later that Margo decided to treat Rodr&#237;guez as dismissed, thereby weighing against a strong inference of scienter in 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez also argues that Margo claimed broad discretion in interpreting the Agreement and that such claims support an inference that Margo never intended to be bound by the Agreement. The complaint, however, only specifically alleges that after Rodr&#237;guez's resignation, Margo claimed the discretion to treat that resignation as a dismissal. Again, there are no allegations to support an inference that Margo had any such interpretation of the Agreement prior to 2003. Rodr&#237;guez did not allege any facts suggesting that Margo had ever considered how it might interpret section 5(b) of the Agreement before the issue arose in 2003, or that either party had considered the issue in signing the Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf. Wortley,</i> 333 F.3d at 295 (finding that a jury could reasonably conclude that a contractual promise was fraudulently made where the promisor never intended to keep the promise and the promisee had made it clear to the promisor that such a promise was indispensable to the agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodr&#237;guez attributes significance to the allegation that the proposed, but unexecuted, separation agreement would have required him to waive his right to sue Margo, including for breach of the Stock Option Agreement. It is not apparent why such a provision, freely agreed upon, would have indicated wrongful intent in 2003, let alone why it has any bearing on Margo's intent in signing the Stock Option Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even considering the various facts offered by Rodr&#237;guez in combination, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82, he failed to plead facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter. The constellation of facts pleaded are at least equally, if not more, consistent with an inference that Margo chose its course only after relations soured. <i>See Credit Suisse,</i> 431 F.3d at 49. Rodr&#237;guez alleged little that is probative of Margo's intent when it signed the Stock Option Agreement, and hence is unable to raise a strong inference as to that intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez has also suggested a separate theory that Margo knew from the beginning of the separation agreement negotiations in September 2003 that it intended to treat Rodr&#237;guez's resignation as a dismissal and that it hid this intention from Rodr&#237;guez. Under this theory, distinct from the one above, the deception lay in the misrepresentation of Margo's intentions at the time Rodr&#237;guez decided to resign. In support of this theory as a basis for liability under the securities laws, Rodr&#237;guez cites to <i>Smith v. Duff &amp; Phelps, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533855\"><a href=\"/opinion/533855/vera-smith-as-of-the-estate-of-robert-j-smith-deceased-v-duff-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1567</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1990). In <i>Smith,</i> the Eleventh Circuit held that in some situations an employee's decision to resign or retire can be an investment decision for purposes of federal securities law, triggering a requirement on the part of management to disclose objective material information. <i>Id.</i> at 1574. Assuming, without deciding, that <i>Smith</i> is good law, it is doubtful that this case falls within either the rule or the rationale of <i>Smith,</i> but we need not decide the issue. Nor need we decide whether Rodr&#237;guez sufficiently pleaded scienter even if such a theory were plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that any putative claim based on this theory fails under the PSLRA because Rodr&#237;guez did not sufficiently specify the relevant misrepresentations. Rodr&#237;guez's complaint repeatedly makes only the general claim that he \"was led to believe by Margo that his resignation would, and could, not be treated as [a] dismissal for any purposes, including without limitation, for purposes of the Stock Option Agreement.\" Nowhere does the complaint specify what statements led Rodr&#237;guez to such a belief, nor when and in what context such statements were made. Nor does the complaint specify any instances in which Margo misled Rodr&#237;guez by failing to correct any expressions to the contrary. Such a general allegation falls far short of the requirement to specify the \"time, place, and content\" of the alleged misrepresentations or misleading omissions. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 193.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Rodr&#237;guez did not meet both of the PSLRA's pleading requirements with respect to either of his theories of liability, his claim for federal securities fraud was properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rule 9(b) requires that \"the circumstances constituting fraud ... be stated with particularity.\" We have previously held that our pre-PSLRA case law interpreting Rule 9(b) in the context of securities fraud claims is \"consistent with the PSLRA.\"<i>Greebel v.
