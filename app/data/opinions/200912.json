This public corruption case from\n\nPuerto Rico resulted in the conviction, for misuse of federal\n\nhousing monies from 1996 to 2001, of the sole defendant, Edwin\n\nRafael   Cornier-Ortiz.      Cornier   was   the   general   manager,\n\nsequentially, of two private for-profit management corporations,\n\nCORA and ERCO.    Cornier worked with others -- including a HUD\n\ndivision director, a contract employee of the Puerto Rico Public\n\nHousing Authority, and their relatives -- to divert United States\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funds that were\n\nmeant for the administration of low-income housing projects in\n\nPuerto Rico.   The schemes alleged involved fraud, kickbacks, sham\n\ncontracts, ghost employees, and conflicts of interest.         Others\n\ninvolved were convicted under separate indictments.\n\n          Cornier claimed to be an innocent victim caught in the\n\ncorrupt schemes of others. He was sentenced to fifty-two months in\n\nprison and three years of supervised release, and sentenced to pay\n\nrestitution of $136,056.00 to HUD.       Cornier appeals both his\n\nconviction, on insufficiency of evidence grounds, and his sentence\n\nrequiring restitution.    We affirm the conviction, but vacate part\n\nof the restitution order.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Cornier was indicted on eight counts, all related to\n\nmisuse of federal housing funding. Cornier pled not guilty. After\n\nan eight-day jury trial on the first seven counts, he was convicted\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fon six of those seven counts: aiding and abetting the theft or\n\nmisapplication of federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n666(a)(1)(A) and (2) (Count One); conspiring to defraud the United\n\nStates by violating 18 U.S.C. § 666, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371 (Count Three); aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication\n\nof federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and (2)\n\n(via a different scheme than the scheme implicated by Count One)\n\n(Count Four); aiding and abetting extortion in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§    1951(a)   and   (b)     (Count    Five);    money   laundering    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (2) (Count Six); and\n\nconspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(h) (Count Seven).         He was acquitted on Count Two, which\n\ncharged   him   with   aiding      and   abetting       the   solicitation    and\n\nacceptance of a kickback in violation of 41 U.S.C. §§ 51, 53, and\n\n54.\n\n            Essentially,     Count    One     involved    a   scheme   in    which\n\nCornier, as general manager of CORA, hired the brother of a housing\n\nauthority employee to prepare and submit vouchers for federal CGP\n\nfunds and then lied about the nature of the brother's employment to\n\nthe CORA board. The work -- both preparing vouchers for submission\n\nto the housing authority and the underlying modernization work\n\nevidenced by the vouchers -- appears to have been done.                        The\n\npreparation of the vouchers, however, was done by the housing\n\nauthority employee, who also approved the payment of the vouchers\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwhen they were submitted to the housing authority, and not by the\n\nbrother.     As to this scheme, Cornier says that no real harm was\n\ndone.\n\n           Counts Three through Seven involved a later scheme with\n\nCornier's next company, ERCO. ERCO employed at an excessive salary\n\nthe half-brother of a HUD official.      The brother did little work,\n\nbut he received a handsome salary of $15,000 a month, kept $4,000\n\nof it, and passed along the remaining $11,000 to the HUD official.\n\nAs to this scheme, Cornier claims that he was forced into feeding\n\nthe greed of the HUD official, was himself a victim of the\n\nofficial's extortion, and was entitled to judgment in his favor.\n\nThere is no claim of trial error, only that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient.\n\n           At sentencing, the district court addressed Count Eight,\n\nwhich charged Cornier with forfeiture of assets related to the\n\noffenses   in   the   other   counts,   and   ordered   Cornier   to   pay\n\nrestitution in the amount of $136,056.00 to HUD.        Of that amount,\n\n$61,804.80 was connected with the Count One conviction.           Cornier\n\nnow appeals his convictions and the order to pay restitution as to\n\nCount One.\n\n                                  II.\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Cornier argues that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis Rule 29 motions for judgment of acquittal as to all six\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\foffenses.   We review the denial of Rule 29 motions de novo.         United\n\nStates v. Zenon-Rodriguez, 289 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Ayala-Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2002).        Our review\n\nof the sufficiency of the evidence requires us to ask \"whether,\n\nafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential   elements   of   the   crime   beyond   a   reasonable   doubt.\"\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (emphasis omitted);\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We draw\n\nall reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict\n\nand resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable\n\nto the government.\"); United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 102\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Some background facts about the funding of public housing\n\nprojects in Puerto Rico are necessary to understand the schemes\n\ninvolved in this case. HUD allocates federal monies to Puerto Rico\n\nfor the administration of low-income public housing projects. Most\n\nof that federal funding is allocated to cover the costs of managing\n\nand operating the housing projects.         A different portion of the\n\nfederal funding is allocated to pay for periodic modernization of\n\nthe housing projects.       HUD disburses this modernization funding\n\nbased in part on a Comprehensive Grant Program (\"CGP\"), so the\n\nfunds are called CGP funds.          The Puerto Rico Public Housing\n\nAdministration (\"PRPHA\") receives the federal funds from HUD and is\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcharged      with   administering       the     Commonwealth's     public     housing\n\nprojects.      Pursuant to a 1992 agreement between the government of\n\nPuerto Rico and HUD, management of the low-income housing projects\n\nin Puerto Rico is done by private management agencies.                           Such\n\nagencies submit bid proposals to PRPHA, and the proposals are then\n\nevaluated by a PRPHA bid board.               A private management agency that\n\nhas   been    awarded    a    management        contract   by   PRPHA    is   paid    a\n\nmanagement fee under the contract using federal funds from HUD. In\n\naddition, the private management agency may submit requests to\n\nPRPHA for CGP funding in connection with the documented expenses of\n\nmodernizing and improving its assigned housing projects.\n\n              1.    Count One\n\n              Under Count One,1 violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666, the\n\ngovernment had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Cornier\n\nwas \"an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian\n\ntribal    government,        or   any   agency    thereof\";     (2)   that    Cornier\n\nembezzled,     stole,    obtained       by    fraud,   knowingly      converted,     or\n\nintentionally misapplied property that is \"valued at $5,000 or\n\nmore\" from \"such organization, government, or agency\"; and (3) that\n\nsuch \"organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year\n\n\n      1\n          Count One charged that, from 1995 to 1997, Cornier, an\nagent of an organization as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 666, along with\nother such agents, aided and abetted the violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n666 by willingly and intentionally embezzling, stealing, obtaining\nby fraud, converting, or misapplying $61,804.80 that was the\nproperty of the PRPHA, an organization that received in excess of\n$10,000 in a one-year period under a federal program.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fperiod, [federal assistance] in excess of $10,000.\"              18 U.S.C. §\n\n666.\n\n            Cornier raises no issue about the first or third prongs.\n\nHe argues only that the second prong was not satisfied because his\n\nactions fit within a statutory exception.              Under § 666(c), \"bona\n\nfide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses\n\npaid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business\" are exempted\n\nfrom the statute's coverage. § 666(c); see United States v. Mills,\n\n140 F.3d 630, 633 (6th Cir. 1998) (\"[B]ona fide salaries, wages,\n\nfees, and other compensation either received by or promised by §\n\n666    defendants   fall   within   the   scope   of    the   subsection   (c)\n\nexception\").   Subsection (c) was added to the statute in 1986, and\n\nthe only reference to it in the legislative history states that it\n\n\"amends 18 U.S.C. § 666 to avoid its possible application to\n\nacceptable business practices.\"           H.R. Rep. No. 99-797, at 30\n\n(1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6138, 6153.\n\n            The facts pertaining to Count One, recounted in the light\n\nmost favorable to the prosecution, are as follows. CORA Management\n\nGroup, Inc. was a for-profit private management agency.             Cornier,\n\na former PRPHA employee, was the general manager and a shareholder\n\nof CORA.    Among other things, he was in charge of administering\n\nbids for contracting services and obtaining CGP funding for CORA.\n\nIn July 1995, CORA was awarded a contract with the PRPHA to manage\n\nand maintain certain low-income housing projects.                  Under the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcontract, CORA received federal funds from PRPHA; PRPHA received\n\nthose funds from HUD.   CORA received federal assistance in excess\n\nof $10,000 during each of the years 1996-1998 in connection with\n\nits management of the housing projects.\n\n          Rubin Monroig, a contract employee at PRPHA, approached\n\nCornier in 1995 and informed him that CORA was not requesting from\n\nPRPHA any CGP funds.    CORA was, of course, receiving a management\n\nfee from PRPHA to operate the housing projects.    That management\n\nfee was paid by PRPHA using federal funds from HUD.    But CORA was\n\nalso entitled to request CGP funds in order to make physical\n\nimprovements to the public housing projects it operated and in\n\norder to improve its management of those projects.2     Unlike the\n\nmanagement fee, which was established under the contract, the\n\ndisbursement of CGP funds was left to the discretion of PRPHA.\n\nLike the management fee, the original source of the CGP money\n\ndisbursed by PRPHA was HUD.    Rubin Monroig told Cornier that his\n\nbrother, Francisco Monroig, could assist CORA in obtaining CGP\n\nfunds.   Cornier then hired Francisco for that very purpose.\n\n           Hiring an expert to assist in handling the paperwork\n\nassociated with obtaining CGP funds was itself a legitimate use of\n\nCGP funds because employing such an expert could improve the\n\n\n\n     2\n          Rubin Monroig explained that CGP funds could be used for\n\"permanent improvements . . . such as . . . painting the entire\nhousing project, widening sidewalks, access control, gates and\nmaterial, basically the most costly items.\"\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmanagement of the public housing projects.                  Francisco Monroig,\n\nhowever, had absolutely no expertise in or knowledge of CGP funds.\n\nWhenever Cornier needed assistance as to CGP funds, he contacted\n\nFrancisco's brother, Rubin, who did have such knowledge, and Rubin\n\nprovided the requested assistance.            Rubin prepared CORA's requests\n\nfor CGP funding, which involved creating invoices and associated\n\ndocumentation,     and    gave   them    to    Francisco.      Francisco   then\n\ndelivered the documents to Cornier, who, in turn, submitted them to\n\nPRPHA.    This was an end-run by Rubin, who could not directly do any\n\nof these things because he worked for PRPHA.                Francisco did not\n\nperform any work at all related to CGP funds.\n\n            This case is unusual in that the government made no\n\neffort to prove that the underlying work paid for by the HUD monies\n\nwas not done.     Cf. United States v. Moeller, 80 F.3d 1053, 1057-58\n\n(5th     Cir.   1996)    (sufficient     evidence    to     convict   under   §\n\n666(a)(1)(A) where, among other things, no written product was ever\n\nproduced in exchange for state funds). Rubin testified (1) that he\n\ndid in fact provide the expertise necessary to fill out the\n\npaperwork associated with requesting CGP funding for maintenance\n\nwork, and (2) that the underlying maintenance work -- the work for\n\nwhich he claimed CGP funding was needed in the invoices he prepared\n\nfor Cornier -- was in fact performed by CORA.               However, there was\n\nalso testimony from Carmen Ortiz, a CORA board member, indicating\n\nthat Cornier could have done the paperwork himself. Cornier's job,\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fafter all, was to administer the CORA budget and to prepare bids\n\nfor contracting services.     When Francisco's contract \"expired,\"\n\nCornier did in fact prepare the CGP invoices himself.       See Mills,\n\n140 F.3d at 633-34 (suggesting that the § 666(c) exception would\n\nnot apply if the government proved that salaries were paid for jobs\n\nthat were unnecessary or unjustified).\n\n            The government's strategy, it seems, was not to prove\n\nthat the work was not done, but rather, to prove that the work was\n\ndone by someone who could not lawfully do it.      Rubin worked for\n\nPRPHA, and his job was to review the requests for CGP funding from\n\nprivate management agencies such as CORA and to authorize payments\n\nof CGP funding to those agencies on PRPHA's behalf.         Rubin gave\n\npreferential treatment to CORA's requests for federal funding, but\n\nit was not proven that those requests would not have been funded\n\nanyway.    CORA paid Francisco $61,804.80 between September 1995 and\n\nFebruary 1997 for the assistance with the paperwork involved in\n\nobtaining CGP funds, and Francisco passed the money along to Rubin.\n\n            The government's evidence about what Cornier got out of\n\nthis arrangement was not entirely clear.   As best we can tell, this\n\nscheme may have somewhat increased CORA's profits in at least two\n\nways.     First, CORA's CGP invoices were never rejected.    This was\n\nimportant because there was some evidence that the underlying\n\nmaintenance work needed to be done and that CORA risked losing its\n\nmanagement contract if the work was not done.    If the CGP invoices\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhad been rejected, then CORA might have had to pay for the costs of\n\nthe maintenance work out of its own funds, if the work was done at\n\nall.    Rubin suggested that the work would not have been done by\n\nCORA if CGP funds were not available.        According to Rubin, the\n\nbenefit of the arrangement to Cornier was that CORA \"had the\n\nbenefit of having some work that they needed to be done, having it\n\nactually done at a cost which was not going to be charged against\n\ntheir profit, and the company would appear well for having done\n\nthat work.\" Second, there was some marginal benefit in that CORA's\n\nCGP invoices were processed more quickly.\n\n             Whatever the gains to Cornier from the arrangement may\n\nhave been, they were not trivial because Cornier both lied about\n\nand tried to cover up the arrangement.          The CORA board was not\n\naware   of   Francisco's   employment.   When    the   board   eventually\n\ndiscovered his employment, it confronted Cornier.       Cornier falsely\n\ntold the board that he had hired Francisco because PRPHA had\n\ndemanded that CORA hire a CGP lobbyist.          Francisco only worked\n\nabout a month after the board's discovery, and Cornier told the\n\nboard that Francisco's employment had ended because his contract\n\nhad expired, even though the contract actually had no expiration\n\ndate.\n\n             Cornier argues that his conviction on Count One should be\n\nreversed because the payments that he authorized to Francisco\n\nMonroig constituted legitimate compensation paid in the usual\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcourse of business and thus fell within the § 666(c) exception.\n\nCornier points out that CGP funds could lawfully be used to hire\n\nexperts to assist CORA in requesting funds from PRPHA. Further, he\n\nmaintains that there was no evidence either that he had any\n\nknowledge that Rubin Monroig was receiving any part of the payments\n\nmade to Francisco Monroig, or that he had any knowledge that Rubin,\n\nnot Francisco, was the one actually doing the work.    Without such\n\nknowledge, Cornier argues, the payments to Francisco were made in\n\ngood faith.    In other words, Francisco and Rubin may have had a\n\nscheme, but he was not part of it.\n\n          There was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict.\n\nFirst,   the    intentionality    element   of   the   \"intentional\n\nmisapplication\" of federal funds was met by evidence that Cornier\n\nin fact knew that Rubin did the work, not Francisco.     There was\n\ntestimony that Francisco was entirely ignorant about CGP funds and\n\nthat Cornier never even bothered to ask Francisco about them.\n\nFrancisco testified that he \"really didn't know what CGP was\" and\n\nthat the work required by his employment contract with CORA was not\n\nperformed by him, but rather by Rubin. Francisco explained that he\n\nnever talked to Cornier about CGP funds and that Cornier never\n\nasked him about them.    His \"limited conversation with [Cornier]\n\npertaining to [the documents he delivered] was, if [Cornier] had\n\nany questions regarding the information, [Cornier] should contact\n\nmy brother Rubin because he was the one who could answer.\"\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f              Rubin's testimony was consistent with Francisco's. Rubin\n\nacknowledged that Francisco had no knowledge of federal funds and\n\ncould not have assisted Cornier with them. Rubin testified that \"I\n\nsuppose that [Cornier] knew that Francisco didn't know anything\n\n[about CGP funds], because [Cornier] never asked him [about them].\"\n\nRubin explained that he himself prepared the invoices for Cornier\n\nand that Cornier would contact him, not Francisco, to discuss work\n\nrelated to CGP funds.3\n\n              Furthermore, Cornier's own behavior belies his contention\n\nthat he had no knowledge that he was involving CORA in sham\n\ncontracts with Francisco; it supports the conclusion that he took\n\nactive steps to conceal the fraud.          Cornier met with Francisco\n\nbehind closed doors, and he never informed the CORA board that\n\nFrancisco was being employed.        When eventually confronted by the\n\nboard, Cornier first lied about the reason that Francisco was hired\n\nand then lied about the termination date of Francisco's contract.\n\n              This brings us to the bona fide salary exception in §\n\n666(c), and to Cornier's argument that the payments were not a\n\n\"misapplication\" at all. The jury could easily have concluded that\n\nthe payments to Rubin through Francisco were not bona fide because\n\nthe   PRPHA    conflict   of   interest   rules   prohibited   Rubin   from\n\n\n\n      3\n          Rubin explained that the advantage of using him, someone\nwho worked for PRPHA, was that \"because . . . I was the one who was\nreceiving these invoices directly, I would move them with greater\nspeed and they would not be rejected.\"\n\n                                   -13-\n\fparticipating in such a scheme.         A scheme designed to evade\n\nconflict of interest rules is hardly legitimate or acceptable.\n\nThat the payments were made for a legitimate purpose -- to hire a\n\nCGP expert to obtain funding for maintenance work that was indeed\n\ndone -- does not render them bona fide under the statute if they\n\nwere intentionally misapplied, as they were here via sham contracts\n\nthat skirted conflict of interest rules and allowed CORA to receive\n\npreferential treatment and other benefits.\n\n          This interplay between the bona fide exception and the\n\nprohibition against \"intentional misapplication\" is sensible.         As\n\nthe Second Circuit has explained, the first four prohibitions of §\n\n666(a)(1)(A),   embezzlement,   stealing,   obtaining   by   fraud,   and\n\nknowing conversion, \"cover any possible taking of money for one's\n\nown use or benefit.   Intentional misapplication, in order to avoid\n\nredundancy, must mean intentional misapplication for otherwise\n\nlegitimate purposes; if it were for illegitimate purposes, it would\n\nbe covered by [the first four] prohibitions . . . .\"      United States\n\nv. Urlacher, 979 F.2d 935, 938 (2nd Cir. 1992).         The prohibition\n\nagainst intentional misapplication covers the situation presented\n\nhere: payments made for what was an underlying legitimate purpose\n\nbut intentionally misapplied to undermine a conflict of interest\n\nprohibition.    To hold that such payments were bona fide under §\n\n666(c) would be inconsistent with § 666(a)(1)(A).\n\n          We affirm the conviction on Count One.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          2.   Counts Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven\n\n          To convict Cornier under Count Three,4 conspiracy to\n\nviolate 18 U.S.C. § 666, the government had to prove that there was\n\n(1) an agreement, (2) an unlawful objective of the agreement (here,\n\nviolation of § 666), and (3) an overt act in furtherance of the\n\nagreement. United States v. Barker Steel Co., Inc., 985 F.2d 1123,\n\n1127-28 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          To convict Cornier under Count Four,5 the government had\n\nto prove that Cornier aided and abetted in a violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 666, the elements of which were set forth earlier.\n\n          To convict Cornier under Count Five,6 aiding and abetting\n\nextortion, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, the government had to prove (1) that\n\nCornier aided the inducement of a victim to part with property; (2)\n\nthat he did so knowingly and willingly with extortionate means; and\n\n(3) that interstate commerce was affected.     See United States v.\n\nStephens, 964 F.2d 424, 429 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n\n     4\n          Count Three charged that, from April 1999 to January\n2001, Cornier knowingly and willfully conspired with Juan Irizarry\nValentin and Samuel Valentin Toro to violate § 666.\n     5\n          Count Four charged that, from April 1999 to January 2001,\nCornier, an agent of an organization as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 666,\nalong with other such agents, aided and abetted the violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 666 by willingly and intentionally embezzling, stealing,\nobtaining by fraud, converting, or misapplying $266,252.48 that was\nthe property of the PRPHA, an organization that received in excess\nof $10,000 in a one-year period under a federal program.\n     6\n          Count Five charged that, from April 1999 to January 2001,\nCornier aided and abetted extortion by consenting to a person's\nreceipt of approximately $266,252.48 that was not due to him.\n\n                               -15-\n\f          To convict Cornier under Count Six,7 money laundering\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government had to show (1)\n\nthat Cornier knowingly conducted a \"financial transaction,\" (2)\n\nthat he knew the transaction involved funds that were the proceeds\n\nof some form of unlawful activity, (3) that the funds involved were\n\nin fact the proceeds of a \"specified unlawful activity,\" and (4)\n\nthat Cornier engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it\n\nwas designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,\n\nlocation, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such\n\nunlawful activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i); United States\n\nv. Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 115 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Count Seven8 charged conspiracy to launder money.\n\n          Cornier's appeal of Counts Three through Seven boils down\n\nto a single contention -- that he was an innocent victim of\n\nextortion by Juan Irizarry Valentin (\"Irizarry\").\n\n          The facts relevant to the remaining counts, described in\n\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, are as follows.    In\n\n1997, Cornier befriended Irizarry, who was the Director, Operations\n\n\n\n     7\n          Count Six charged that, from April 1999 to January 2001,\nCornier aided and abetted the knowing and willful execution or\nattempted execution of forty-one financial transactions with\nproceeds from extortion, knowing that the transactions involved\nunlawful proceeds and knowing that the transactions were designed\nto conceal those proceeds.\n     8\n          Count Seven charged that Cornier conspired to commit\nmoney laundering related to the offense alleged in Count Six, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).\n\n                               -16-\n\fDivision,    Office     of   Public   Housing   at   HUD    in   Puerto   Rico.\n\nIrizarry's job at HUD involved visiting and evaluating the public\n\nhousing projects that were managed by private management agencies.\n\n            In 1998, CORA received a fee for its management and\n\nmaintenance of certain shelters that were set up by FEMA in the\n\naftermath    of   the    devastation     wrought     by    Hurricane   George.\n\nNormally, all the CORA partners shared in management fees.                 When\n\nthe management fee from FEMA arrived in this instance, however,\n\nCornier took Carmen Ortiz, one of the CORA board members, to see\n\nIrizarry at Irizarry's HUD office.           Irizarry falsely told Ortiz\n\nthat the fee could only be divided among the three CORA partners\n\nwho had actively worked on the shelters.                   As a result, the\n\nmanagement fee was split among Cornier and only two other CORA\n\nboard members, so Cornier received a larger share than he should\n\nhave.    Irizarry thus lined Cornier's pocket by making a false\n\nstatement.\n\n            Cornier formed his own management agency company, ERCO\n\nEnterprises, Inc. (\"ERCO\") in 1998.9               Irizarry helped Cornier\n\nbehind the scenes to incorporate ERCO and then to prepare a bid\n\nproposal to PRPHA.       Irizarry, a HUD official, did not sit on the\n\nPRPHA board that would act on the proposal.               The proposal budget\n\nset forth the allocation of the money that ERCO planned to spend in\n\nmanaging the requested housing projects.           Under the public housing\n\n\n     9\n            Cornier resigned from CORA in April 1999.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fproject system, federal funds paid the salaries of management\n\nagency employees assigned to the particular housing projects.               In\n\nits proposal, ERCO budgeted a generous salary of about $305,000.00\n\nannually for an assistant general manager; the person named was\n\nRoberto Colon.\n\n             Based on that proposal, PRPHA awarded ERCO a multi-\n\nmillion dollar, five-year contract (April 1999 to March 2004) to\n\nmanage and maintain certain housing projects. The overall contract\n\nwas worth $28,676,304.00.           There is no evidence that Irizarry\n\ninfluenced    the   PRPHA   to    approve    the   proposal,   including   its\n\ngenerous salary figure.          After the contract was awarded to ERCO,\n\nIrizarry arranged for a meeting among Cornier, Samuel Valentin Toro\n\n(Irizarry's    half-brother,       \"Valentin\")     and   himself.   At     that\n\nmeeting, Irizarry introduced Cornier to Valentin as \"your next\n\nboss.\"   Cornier offered Valentin an assistant general manager\n\nposition for $15,000.00 per month ($180,000.00 annually), plus\n\nadditional incentives.      Valentin accepted the offer and was hired\n\nto work as an assistant general manager.             Cornier's wife, Raquel\n\nRios, was also hired to work as an assistant general manager; she\n\nwas paid the same salary as Valentin.              So, $360,000 a year was\n\nbeing spent on the position of assistant general manager.            Roberto\n\nColon, who had been designated as the assistant general manager in\n\nthe bid proposal, never held the position.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f             Irizarry then instructed Valentin to open a bank account\n\nand to deposit the money from Cornier there each month.                    Irizarry\n\ntold Valentin to keep $4,000 each month for himself; it was\n\nunderstood     that    Irizarry      would      keep    the   remaining    $11,000.\n\nIrizarry   received     approximately         $195,386.36       in   payments   from\n\nCornier in this way.\n\n           Even before Valentin started working for ERCO, Cornier\n\nmade payments to Irizzary by issuing two checks to Valentin and\n\nthen   endorsing      the   checks    to     himself     by   forging     Valentin's\n\nsignature.    Cornier deposited these checks in his own bank account\n\nand then wrote out checks to Irizarry from that account for\n\ncomparable    amounts.        Cornier      also    created     and   signed     false\n\nemployment records for Valentin in connection with the two checks.\n\nIrizarry later asked Valentin to imitate the forged signature on\n\nfuture checks.\n\n             Cornier    argues    that     he     was   an    innocent    victim   of\n\nextortion by Irizarry and thus entitled to judgment in his favor on\n\neach of the remaining counts.              As to Counts Three and Four, the\n\ngovernment asserts that there is no \"innocent victim\" defense to a\n\nviolation of § 666.           While some case law suggests that mere\n\nacquiescence to an extortioner's demands for payments may not be\n\ncriminal under 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (extortion), see United States v.\n\nSpitler, 800 F.2d 1267, 1275-78 (4th Cir. 1986), Cornier has\n\npointed to no authority, and we have not discovered any, to support\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fa similar defense to § 666.        Cf. Evans v. United States, 504 U.S.\n\n255, 267 n.18 (1992) (extortion and bribery are not necessarily\n\nmutually exclusive).\n\n            We have already discussed the bona fide exception defense\n\nto § 666 liability, and it has no conceivable application to the\n\nIrizarry affair.       As to Counts Three and Four, then, we take the\n\ndefendant's \"innocent victim\" argument as a claim that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that he entered into an agreement with\n\nIrizarry and Valentin to intentionally misapply funds in violation\n\nof § 666.\n\n            The government's evidence supporting the existence of an\n\nagreement included the following: that Irizarry had helped Cornier\n\nto get money while at CORA and then helped him to incorporate ERCO\n\nand to prepare a bid proposal for a PRPHA management contract; that\n\nthe   bid   proposal    included    an   annual   salary   of   $305,000.00\n\ndesignated for an assistant general manager named Roberto Colon;\n\nthat once ERCO was awarded the contract, Valentin, Irizarry's half-\n\nbrother, was substituted for Colon and paid a salary that even\n\nValentin conceded was grossly inflated; that Valentin gave $11,000\n\nof his monthly salary to Irizarry, who had arranged the meeting\n\namong the three men at which Cornier offered Valentin the position;\n\nand that Cornier was clearly aware that Valentin was being used to\n\nfunnel money to Irizarry because even before Valentin began working\n\nfor ERCO, Cornier \"paid\" Valentin, falsely endorsed the payments to\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fhimself, and then used the money to pay Irizarry.                    Based on that\n\nevidence, the jury was amply justified in concluding that Irizarry\n\nand Cornier had an agreement to submit a bid proposal that included\n\nan   inflated   salary    figure      for   the   assistant    general     manager\n\nposition, to substitute Valentin for Colon, and to use the inflated\n\nsalary to channel federal funds to Irizarry.                The inflated salary\n\nin the bid proposal provided Cornier with the extra federal funds\n\nnecessary to pay Irizarry, so the jury could logically infer that\n\nthe men had agreed to include the inflated salary in the bid for\n\nthat very purpose.       That Cornier engaged in the misapplication of\n\nfunds intentionally is supported by the evidence of his efforts to\n\nconceal the scheme -- by channeling the payments to Irizarry\n\nthrough   Valentin,      by   using    Roberto    Colon's     name    on   the   bid\n\nproposal, and by signing false employment records in connection\n\nwith the checks he issued before Valentin started working.                       We\n\naffirm the convictions on Counts Three and Four.\n\n           Cornier's \"innocent victim\" defense is more properly\n\nasserted as to Counts Five through Seven because they involve\n\nextortion and associated offenses.            See Spitler, 800 F.2d at 1276\n\n(\"Congress may not have intended to criminalize the acquiescence of\n\nextortion victims\"); cf. Gebardi v. United States, 287 U.S. 112,\n\n120-23 (1932) (interpreting the Mann Act as not intended to punish\n\nthe \"victim\" of the crime).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f           The defense makes much of the fact that Irizarry pled\n\nguilty in another case to conspiring to extort $195,386.36 from\n\nCornier, a fact of which the district court took judicial notice.\n\nA victim of extortion can cross the line into illegal behavior if\n\nhe engages in more active conduct than simply agreeing to pay the\n\nextortioner.    See Spitler, 800 F.2d at 1276.          But here, Cornier\n\nargues, Irizarry forced him to hire Valentin for $15,000 per month\n\nby using his official position at HUD to threaten Cornier with\n\neconomic harm, and the evidence shows that he merely acquiesced to\n\nthe monthly $15,000 payments that Irizarry demanded.           He argues\n\nthat there was no symbiotic relationship between himself and\n\nIrizarry and that there is no evidence that he benefitted from or\n\nwillingly joined in the payments made to Irizarry through Valentin.\n\nHe emphasizes that Irizarry had nothing at all to do with the\n\napproval of ERCO's management contract with PRPHA.         Irizarry was a\n\nHUD official, and HUD had no input in the awarding of contracts by\n\nPRPHA.   As a result, he claims, Irizarry's assistance in starting\n\nERCO and in preparing the bid proposal to PRPHA are irrelevant.\n\nPut simply, Cornier claims that he got nothing in exchange for the\n\npayments   he   made   to   Irizarry,   thus   making   unreasonable   any\n\nconclusion other than that he was an unwilling victim.\n\n           To resolve this case, we need not delineate the precise\n\nlocation of the \"line at which a payor's conduct constitutes\n\nsufficient activity beyond the mere acquiescence of a victim.\" Id.\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fat 1278.     Wherever that line is drawn, there was sufficient\n\nevidence here to conclude that Cornier was on the wrong side of it.\n\n            The fact of Irizarry's guilty plea does not make the\n\nevidence of Cornier's own guilt insufficient.        Irizarry's plea was\n\nevidence for the jury to consider, and the jury was entitled to\n\nconclude, based on the other evidence presented, that Cornier was\n\nnot an innocent victim at all.\n\n            The evidence supported the conclusion that some sort of\n\nquid pro quo arrangement was in place and that Cornier did more\n\nthan merely acquiesce to it.            Irizarry had used his official\n\nposition at HUD to help Cornier to receive a larger-than-deserved\n\nfee from a FEMA program in 1998.        Cornier had taken one of the CORA\n\nboard members to Irizarry's office to accomplish the fraud. Later,\n\nCornier    would   again   be   the   beneficiary   of   Irizarry's   help.\n\nIrizarry provided his experience and expertise in helping Cornier\n\nto incorporate his own management company and to prepare a bid\n\nproposal to PRPHA.    There is thus no question that Irizarry's help\n\nyielded monetary benefits to Cornier, and it would only take a\n\nsmall inference for the jury to conclude that Cornier agreed to the\n\nERCO payment arrangement with Valentin and Irizarry in gratitude\n\nfor this help.     Valentin explained the scheme in just this way,\n\ntestifying that he got the assistant general manager job \"through\n\nmy brother, in gratitude for him having helped Mr. Cornier\" prepare\n\nthe bid proposal for the PRPHA contract.             He said, \"I had to\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fbelieve, and I know for a fact, that he [Irizarry] had a deal with\n\nMr. Cornier.\"\n\n            Moreover, there was testimony that Irizarry and Cornier\n\nwere great friends.       Carmen Santiago, who is Irizarry's ex-wife,\n\ntestified that Cornier and Irizarry \"had a very close relationship\"\n\nand had been friends since 1997.          She said that the two men called\n\neach other constantly and that Cornier frequently visited Irizarry\n\nat his farm.      Valentin's testimony was consistent with Santiago's.\n\nHe   explained     that     Cornier    and      Irizarry    \"had    an   enormous\n\nfriendship.\"      Similarly, Carmen Ortiz, a member of the CORA board,\n\ntestified that \"there was a very close friendship between them.\"\n\n            The jury could easily have credited the reinforcing\n\ntestimony of Santiago, Valentin, and Ortiz and concluded that\n\nIrizarry    and   Cornier    were     working    together,    not   against     one\n\nanother.     The two men looked out for each other and for each\n\nother's    future.     For   example,     Cornier    told    Irizarry    that   if\n\nIrizarry ever retired from HUD, Cornier would give him some ERCO\n\nshares and have him work for ERCO as a consultant.                   Cornier and\n\nIrizarry often discussed various projects that could be undertaken\n\non Irizarry's farmland.       Irizarry constantly advised and counseled\n\nCornier on business matters, and Cornier gave cellular phones to\n\nIrizarry.    Even if Cornier acted out of friendship for Irizarry,\n\nthe jury could conclude that there was nothing innocent about it.\n\nWe affirm the convictions on Counts Five, Six, and Seven.\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fB.   Restitution Order\n\n            Cornier appeals the order that he pay $61,804.80 to HUD\n\nas restitution in connection with his conviction on Count One. The\n\namount of restitution ordered for Count One is equal to the amount\n\nof money paid to Francisco Monroig by Cornier, on behalf of CORA,\n\nvia the illegal employment scheme.           We review restitution orders\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard, crediting the lower court's\n\nsubsidiary factual findings unless clearly erroneous and reviewing\n\nassociated legal questions de novo.          United States v. Vaknin, 112\n\nF.3d 579, 586 (1st Cir. 1997).      No facts are in dispute; what is at\n\nissue is the viability of the government's theory.\n\n            Cornier's argument on appeal appears to be that HUD was\n\nnot a \"victim\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 3663 because it suffered\n\nno loss attributable to the CGP funds disbursed to CORA and then\n\npaid   to   Francisco   Monroig   and   so   HUD   was   not   \"directly   and\n\nproximately harmed.\"      Cornier does not argue that the crime of\n\nconviction in Count One is outside the coverage of § 3663, or that\n\nthe government cannot qualify as a victim under § 3663, United\n\nStates v. Quarrell, 310 F.3d 664, 677 (10th Cir. 2002).              Rather,\n\nCornier asserts that the $61,804.80 in CGP funding was spent by\n\nCORA for legitimate purposes and in the ordinary course of business\n\nbecause CGP funds from PRPHA could legitimately be used to pay for\n\nexpert assistance.      He claims that he hired Francisco Monroig in\n\ngood faith as a funding expert.\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f            As defined by 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2), a \"victim\" is\n\n            a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of\n            the commission of an offense for which restitution may be\n            ordered including, in the case of an offense that\n            involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern\n            of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the\n            defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,\n            conspiracy, or pattern.\n\nThe district court found that there was a loss, and that HUD was\n\nthe victim of Cornier's misapplication of federal funds.                The\n\ncourt's restitution order was for $136,056.00.       On appeal, Cornier\n\nchallenges only the $61,804.80 that was involved in Count One.\n\n            Cornier argues that:\n\n            as a matter of law there was no loss because the money at\n            issue was, indeed, actually spent by CORA Management for\n            a legitimate purpose, for its own benefit, and in the\n            normal course of business.     Indeed, after making the\n            expenditures, CORA['s] performance under the PHA\n            management contract was actually better than if it had\n            not made the expenditures. . . .         The inescapable\n            conclusion is that there was no loss to the government\n            because the money was actually spent for what it was\n            suppose[d] to be spent on and the intended beneficiaries\n            (CORA Management and the Project dwellers) received the\n            benefits of the expenditures. In short, there was no\n            victim.\n\n(emphasis omitted).      In arguing this, Cornier relies on testimony\n\nfrom the government's own witness, Rubin Monroig, who said that the\n\nCGP funds disbursed to CORA represented payment for work that was\n\nactually done, including the expert advice that he, Rubin, had\n\nprovided.\n\n            The government's brief is largely non-responsive, arguing\n\ninstead     that   the   misapplication   resulted   from   the   use    of\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fFrancisco's name, that Francisco was no expert, and that Francisco\n\ndid no work, so there must have been a loss.            The government did\n\nnot try this case on a theory that the work paid for by the CGP\n\nfunds was never done; there is no testimony to that effect.               The\n\ngovernment's own witness, Rubin Monroig, said that the underlying\n\nwork, for which the $61,804.80 was disbursed, was done.\n\n           The     purpose   of    restitution   is    to   secure   to    an\n\nidentifiable victim who has been directly and proximately harmed\n\nthe pecuniary loss he or she has suffered.            18 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)\n\nand (c).    The government's argument confuses the issue whether\n\nthere has been a crime with the issue whether the conditions for\n\nrestitution have been met, particularly whether HUD suffered a\n\npecuniary loss.      Because the work for which the CGP funds were\n\ndisbursed was done, it would be an unfair windfall to HUD to\n\nconclude that HUD had directly and proximately suffered a loss of\n\n$61,804.80.      The government offered no evidence of an actual loss\n\nto HUD in a lesser amount.        Accordingly, we vacate the restitution\n\norder to the extent it requires restitution of $61,804.80.                See\n\nUnited States v. Paradis, 219 F.3d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2000).             We\n\nleave the matter of any further proceedings on the restitution\n\ncount to the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f                               III.\n\n          The convictions are affirmed; the order of restitution is\n\nvacated to the extent of the $61,804.80 awarded in connection with\n\ndefendant's conviction on Count One of the indictment. So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f",

Cornier was the general manager, sequentially, of two private for-profit management corporations, CORA and ERCO. Cornier worked with others &#8212; including a HUD division director, a contract employee of the Puerto Rico Public Housing Authority, and their relatives &#8212; to divert United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funds that were meant for the administration of low-income housing projects in Puerto Rico. The schemes alleged involved fraud, kickbacks, sham contracts, ghost employees, and conflicts of interest. Others involved were convicted under separate indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier claimed to be an innocent victim caught in the corrupt schemes of others. He was sentenced to fifty-two months in prison and three years of supervised release, and sentenced to pay restitution of $136,056.00 to HUD. Cornier appeals both his conviction, on insufficiency of evidence grounds, and his sentence requiring restitution. We affirm the conviction, but vacate part of the restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier was indicted on eight counts, all related to misuse of federal housing funding. Cornier pled not guilty. After an eight-day jury trial on the first seven counts, he was convicted on six of those seven counts: aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 666(a)(1)(A) and (2) (Count One); conspiring to defraud the United States by violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (Count Three); aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 666(a)(1)(A) and (2) (via a different scheme than the scheme implicated by Count One) (Count Four); aiding and abetting extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951(a) and (b) (Count Five); money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (2) (Count Six); and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h) (Count Seven). He was acquitted on Count Two, which charged him with aiding and abetting the solicitation and acceptance of a kickback in violation of 41 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 51, 53, and 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Count One involved a scheme in which Cornier, as general manager of CORA, hired the brother of a housing authority employee to prepare and submit vouchers for federal CGP funds and then lied about the nature of the brother's employment to the CORA board. The work &#8212; both preparing vouchers for submission to the housing authority and the underlying modernization work evidenced by the vouchers &#8212; appears to have been done. The preparation of the vouchers, however, was done by the housing authority employee, who also approved the payment of the vouchers when they were submitted to the housing authority, and not by the brother. As to this scheme, Cornier says that no real harm was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts Three through Seven involved a later scheme with Cornier's next company, ERCO. ERCO employed at an excessive salary the half-brother of a HUD official. The brother did little work, but he received a handsome salary of $15,000 a month, kept $4,000 of it, and passed along the remaining $11,000 to the HUD official. As to this scheme, Cornier claims that he was forced into feeding the greed of the HUD official, was himself a victim of the official's extortion, and was entitled to judgment in his favor. There is no claim of trial error, only that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court addressed Count Eight, which charged Cornier with forfeiture of assets related to the offenses in the other counts, and ordered Cornier to pay restitution in the amount of $136,056.00 to HUD. Of that amount, $61,804.80 was connected with the Count One conviction. Cornier now appeals his convictions and the order to pay restitution as to Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motions for judgment of acquittal as to all six offenses. We review the denial of Rule 29 motions de novo. <i>United States v. Zenon-Rodriguez,</i> 289 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Ayala Ayala,</i> 289 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2002). Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence requires us to ask \"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis omitted); <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 126 (1st Cir.2004) (\"We draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict and resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable to the government.\"); <i>United States v.

HUD allocates federal monies to Puerto Rico for the administration of low-income public housing projects. Most of that federal funding is allocated to cover the costs of managing and operating the housing projects. A different portion of the federal funding is allocated to pay for periodic modernization of the housing projects. HUD disburses this modernization funding based in part on a Comprehensive Grant Program (\"CGP\"), so the funds are called CGP funds. The Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration (\"PRPHA\") receives the federal funds from HUD and is charged with administering the Commonwealth's public housing projects. Pursuant to a 1992 agreement between the government of Puerto Rico and HUD, management of the low-income housing projects in Puerto Rico is done by private management agencies. Such agencies submit bid proposals to PRPHA, and the proposals are then evaluated by a PRPHA bid board. A private management agency that has been awarded a management contract by PRPHA is paid a management fee under the contract using federal funds from HUD. In addition, the private management agency may submit requests to PRPHA for CGP funding in connection with the documented expenses of modernizing and improving its assigned housing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Count One</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Count One,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Cornier was \"an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof\"; (2) that Cornier embezzled, stole, obtained by fraud, knowingly converted, or intentionally misapplied property that is \"valued at $5,000 or more\" from \"such organization, government, or agency\"; and (3) that such \"organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, [federal assistance] in excess of $10,000.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier raises no issue about the first or third prongs. He argues only that the second prong was not satisfied because his actions fit within a statutory exception. Under &#167; 666(c), \"bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business\" are exempted from the statute's coverage. &#167; 666(c); <i>see United States v. Mills,</i> 140 F.3d 630, 633 (6th Cir.1998) (\"[B]ona fide salaries, wages, fees, and other compensation either <i>received by</i> or <i>promised by</i> &#167; 666 defendants fall within the scope of the subsection (c) exception\"). Subsection (c) was added to the statute in 1986, and the only reference to it in the legislative history states that it \"amends 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 to avoid its possible application to acceptable business practices.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-797, at 30 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6138, 6153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts pertaining to Count One, recounted in the light most favorable to the prosecution, are as follows. CORA Management Group, Inc. was a for-profit private management agency. Cornier, a former PRPHA employee, was the general manager and a shareholder of CORA. Among other things, he was in charge of administering bids for contracting services and obtaining CGP funding for CORA. In July 1995, CORA was awarded a contract with the PRPHA to manage and maintain certain low-income housing projects. Under the contract, CORA received federal funds from PRPHA; PRPHA received those funds from HUD. CORA received federal assistance in excess of $10,000 during each of the years 1996-1998 in connection with its management of the housing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubin Monroig, a contract employee at PRPHA, approached Cornier in 1995 and informed him that CORA was not requesting from PRPHA any CGP funds. CORA was, of course, receiving a management fee from PRPHA to operate the housing projects. That management fee was paid by PRPHA using federal funds from HUD. But CORA was also entitled to request CGP funds in order to make physical improvements to the public housing projects it operated and in order to improve its management of those projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Unlike the management fee, which was established under the contract, the disbursement of CGP funds was left to the discretion of PRPHA. Like the management fee, the original source of the CGP money disbursed by PRPHA was HUD. Rubin Monroig told Cornier that his brother, Francisco Monroig, could assist CORA in obtaining CGP funds. Cornier then hired Francisco for that very purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hiring an expert to assist in handling the paperwork associated with obtaining CGP funds was itself a legitimate use of CGP funds because employing such an expert could improve the management of the public housing projects. Francisco Monroig, however, had absolutely no expertise in or knowledge of CGP funds. Whenever Cornier needed assistance as to CGP funds, he contacted Francisco's brother, Rubin, who did have such knowledge, and Rubin provided the requested assistance. Rubin prepared CORA's requests for CGP funding, which involved creating invoices and associated documentation, and gave them to Francisco. Francisco then delivered the documents to Cornier, who, in turn, submitted them to PRPHA. This was an end-run by Rubin, who could not directly do any of these things because he worked for PRPHA. Francisco did not perform any work at all related to CGP funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is unusual in that the government made no effort to prove that the underlying work paid for by the HUD monies was not done. <i>Cf. United States v. Moeller,</i> 80 F.3d 1053, 1057-58 (5th Cir.1996) (sufficient evidence to convict under &#167; 666(a)(1)(A) where, among other things, no written product was ever produced in exchange for state funds). Rubin testified (1) that he did in fact provide the expertise necessary to fill out the paperwork associated with requesting CGP funding for maintenance work, and (2) that the underlying maintenance work &#8212; the work for which he claimed CGP funding was needed in the invoices he prepared for Cornier &#8212; was in fact performed by CORA. However, there was also testimony from Carmen Ortiz, a CORA board member, indicating that Cornier could have done the paperwork himself. Cornier's job, after all, was to administer the CORA budget and to prepare bids for contracting services. When Francisco's contract \"expired,\" Cornier did in fact prepare the CGP invoices himself. <i>See Mills,</i> 140 F.3d at 633-34 (suggesting that the &#167; 666(c) exception would not apply if the government proved that salaries were paid for jobs that were unnecessary or unjustified).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's strategy, it seems, was not to prove that the work was not done, but rather, to prove that the work was done by someone who could not lawfully do it. Rubin worked for PRPHA, and his job was to review the requests for CGP funding from private management agencies such as CORA and to authorize payments of CGP funding to those agencies on PRPHA's behalf. Rubin gave preferential treatment to CORA's requests for federal funding, but it was not proven that those requests would not have been funded anyway. CORA paid Francisco $61,804.80 between September 1995 and February 1997 for the assistance with the paperwork involved in obtaining CGP funds, and Francisco passed the money along to Rubin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence about what Cornier got out of this arrangement was not entirely clear. As best we can tell, this scheme may have somewhat increased CORA's profits in at least two ways. First, CORA's CGP invoices were never rejected. This was important because there was some evidence that the underlying maintenance work needed to be done and that CORA risked losing its management contract if the work was not done. If the CGP invoices had been rejected, then CORA might have had to pay for the costs of the maintenance work out of its own funds, if the work was done at all. Rubin suggested that the work would not have been done by CORA if CGP funds were not available. According to Rubin, the benefit of the arrangement to Cornier was that CORA \"had the benefit of having some work that they needed to be done, having it actually done at a cost which was not going to be charged against their profit, and the company would appear well for having done that work.\" Second, there was some marginal benefit in that CORA's CGP invoices were processed more quickly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the gains to Cornier from the arrangement may have been, they were not trivial because Cornier both lied about and tried to cover up the arrangement. The CORA board was not aware of Francisco's employment. When the board eventually discovered his employment, it confronted Cornier. Cornier falsely told the board that he had hired Francisco because PRPHA had demanded that CORA hire a CGP lobbyist. Francisco only worked about a month after the board's discovery, and Cornier told the board that Francisco's employment had ended because his contract had expired, even though the contract actually had no expiration date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that his conviction on Count One should be reversed because the payments that he authorized to Francisco Monroig constituted legitimate compensation paid in the usual course of business and thus fell within the &#167; 666(c) exception. Cornier points out that CGP funds could lawfully be used to hire experts to assist CORA in requesting funds from PRPHA. Further, he maintains that there was no evidence either that he had any knowledge that Rubin Monroig was receiving any part of the payments made to Francisco Monroig, or that he had any knowledge that Rubin, not Francisco, was the one actually doing the work. Without such knowledge, Cornier argues, the payments to Francisco were made in good faith. In other words, Francisco and Rubin may have had a scheme, but he was not part of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict. First, the intentionality element of the \"intentional misapplication\" of federal funds was met by evidence that Cornier in fact knew that Rubin did the work, not Francisco. There was testimony that Francisco was entirely ignorant about CGP funds and that Cornier never even bothered to ask Francisco about them. Francisco testified that he \"really didn't know what CGP was\" and that the work required by his employment contract with CORA was not performed by him, but rather by Rubin. Francisco explained that he never talked to Cornier about CGP funds and that Cornier never asked him about them. His \"limited conversation with [Cornier] pertaining to [the documents he delivered] was, if [Cornier] had any questions regarding the information, [Cornier] should contact my brother Rubin because he was the one who could answer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubin's testimony was consistent with Francisco's. Rubin acknowledged that Francisco had no knowledge of federal funds and could not have assisted Cornier with them. Rubin testified that \"I suppose that [Cornier] knew that Francisco didn't know anything [about CGP funds], because [Cornier] never asked him [about them].\" Rubin explained that he himself prepared the invoices for Cornier and that Cornier would contact him, not Francisco, to discuss work related to CGP funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Cornier's own behavior belies his contention that he had no knowledge that he was involving CORA in sham contracts with Francisco; it supports the conclusion that he took active steps to conceal the fraud. Cornier met with Francisco behind closed doors, and he never informed the CORA board that Francisco was being employed. When eventually confronted by the board, Cornier first lied about the reason that Francisco was hired and then lied about the termination date of Francisco's contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the bona fide salary exception in &#167; 666(c), and to Cornier's argument that the payments were not a \"misapplication\" at all. The jury could easily have concluded that the payments to Rubin through Francisco were not bona fide because the PRPHA conflict of interest rules prohibited Rubin from participating in such a scheme. A scheme designed to evade conflict of interest rules is hardly legitimate or acceptable. That the payments were made for a legitimate purpose &#8212; to hire a CGP expert to obtain funding for maintenance work that was indeed done &#8212; does not render them bona fide under the statute if they were intentionally misapplied, as they were here via sham contracts that skirted conflict of interest rules and allowed CORA to receive preferential treatment and other benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interplay between the bona fide exception and the prohibition against \"intentional misapplication\" is sensible. As the Second Circuit has explained, the first four prohibitions of &#167; 666(a)(1)(A), embezzlement, stealing, obtaining by fraud, and knowing conversion, \"cover any possible taking of money for one's own use or benefit. Intentional misapplication, in order to avoid redundancy, must mean intentional misapplication for otherwise legitimate purposes; if it were for illegitimate purposes, it would be covered by [the first four] prohibitions....\" <i>United States v. Urlacher,</i> 979 F.2d 935, 938 (2nd Cir.1992). The prohibition against intentional misapplication covers the situation presented here: payments made for what was an underlying legitimate purpose but intentionally misapplied to undermine a conflict of interest prohibition. To hold that such payments were bona fide under &#167; 666(c) would be inconsistent with &#167; 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the conviction on Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Counts Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Cornier under Count Three,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>conspiracy</i> to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, the government had to prove that there was (1) an agreement, (2) an unlawful objective of the agreement (here, violation of &#167; 666), and (3) an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. <i>United States v.

In 1997, Cornier befriended Irizarry, who was the Director, Operations Division, Office of Public Housing at HUD in Puerto Rico. Irizarry's job at HUD involved visiting and evaluating the public housing projects that were managed by private management agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, CORA received a fee for its management and maintenance of certain shelters that were set up by FEMA in the aftermath of the devastation wrought by Hurricane George. Normally, all the CORA partners shared in management fees. When the management fee from FEMA arrived in this instance, however, Cornier took Carmen Ortiz, one of the CORA board members, to see Irizarry at Irizarry's HUD office. Irizarry falsely told Ortiz that the fee could only be divided among the three CORA partners who had actively worked on the shelters. As a result, the management fee was split among Cornier and only two other CORA board members, so Cornier received a larger share than he should have. Irizarry thus lined Cornier's pocket by making a false statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier formed his own management agency company, ERCO Enterprises, Inc. (\"ERCO\") in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Irizarry helped Cornier behind the scenes to incorporate ERCO and then to prepare a bid proposal to PRPHA. Irizarry, a HUD official, did not sit on the PRPHA board that would act on the proposal. The proposal budget set forth the allocation of the money that ERCO planned to spend in managing the requested housing projects. Under the public housing project system, federal funds paid the salaries of management agency employees assigned to the particular housing projects. In its proposal, ERCO budgeted a generous salary of about $305,000.00 annually for an assistant general manager; the person named was Roberto Colon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on that proposal, PRPHA awarded ERCO a multi-million dollar, five-year contract (April 1999 to March 2004) to manage and maintain certain housing projects. The overall contract was worth $28,676,304.00. There is no evidence that Irizarry influenced the PRPHA to approve the proposal, including its generous salary figure. After the contract was awarded to ERCO, Irizarry arranged for a meeting among Cornier, Samuel Valentin Toro (Irizarry's half-brother, \"Valentin\") and himself. At that meeting, Irizarry introduced Cornier to Valentin as \"your next boss.\" Cornier offered Valentin an assistant general manager position for $15,000.00 per month ($180,000.00 annually), plus additional incentives. Valentin accepted the offer and was hired to work as an assistant general manager. Cornier's wife, Raquel Rios, was also hired to work as an assistant general manager; she was paid the same salary as Valentin. So, $360,000 a year was being spent on the position of assistant general manager. Roberto Colon, who had been designated as the assistant general manager in the bid proposal, never held the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry then instructed Valentin to open a bank account and to deposit the money from Cornier there each month. Irizarry told Valentin to keep $4,000 each month for himself; it was understood that Irizarry would keep the remaining $11,000. Irizarry received approximately $195,386.36 in payments from Cornier in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before Valentin started working for ERCO, Cornier made payments to Irizzary by issuing two checks to Valentin and then endorsing the checks to himself by forging Valentin's signature. Cornier deposited these checks in his own bank account and then wrote out checks to Irizarry from that account for comparable amounts. Cornier also created and signed false employment records for Valentin in connection with the two checks. Irizarry later asked Valentin to imitate the forged signature on future checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that he was an innocent victim of extortion by Irizarry and thus entitled to judgment in his favor on each of the remaining counts. As to Counts Three and Four, the government asserts that there is no \"innocent victim\" defense to a violation of &#167; 666. While some case law suggests that mere acquiescence to an extortioner's demands for payments may not be criminal under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951 (extortion), <i>see United States v. Spitler,</i> 800 F.2d 1267, 1275-78 (4th Cir.1986), Cornier has pointed to no authority, and we have not discovered any, to support a similar defense to &#167; 666. <i>Cf. Evans v. United States,</i> 504 U.S. 255, 267 n. 18, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992) (extortion and bribery are not necessarily mutually exclusive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already discussed the bona fide exception defense to &#167; 666 liability, and it has no conceivable application to the Irizarry affair. As to Counts Three and Four, then, we take the defendant's \"innocent victim\" argument as a claim that there was insufficient evidence that he entered into an agreement with Irizarry and Valentin to intentionally misapply funds in violation of &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence supporting the existence of an agreement included the following: that Irizarry had helped Cornier to get money while at CORA and then helped him to incorporate ERCO and to prepare a bid proposal for a PRPHA management contract; that the bid proposal included an annual salary of $305,000.00 designated for an assistant general manager named Roberto Colon; that once ERCO was awarded the contract, Valentin, Irizarry's half-brother, was substituted for Colon and paid a salary that even Valentin conceded was grossly inflated; that Valentin gave $11,000 of his monthly salary to Irizarry, who had arranged the meeting among the three men at which Cornier offered Valentin the position; and that Cornier was clearly aware that Valentin was being used to funnel money to Irizarry because even before Valentin began working for ERCO, Cornier \"paid\" Valentin, falsely endorsed the payments to himself, and then used the money to pay Irizarry. Based on that evidence, the jury was amply justified in concluding that Irizarry and Cornier had an agreement to submit a bid proposal that included an inflated salary figure for the assistant general manager position, to substitute Valentin for Colon, and to use the inflated salary to channel federal funds to Irizarry. The inflated salary in the bid proposal provided Cornier with the extra federal funds necessary to pay Irizarry, so the jury could logically infer that the men had agreed to include the inflated salary in the bid for that very purpose. That Cornier engaged in the misapplication of funds intentionally is supported by the evidence of his efforts to conceal the scheme &#8212; by channeling the payments to Irizarry through Valentin, by using Roberto Colon's name on the bid proposal, and by signing false employment records in connection with the checks he issued before Valentin started working. We affirm the convictions on Counts Three and Four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier's \"innocent victim\" defense is more properly asserted as to Counts Five through Seven because they involve extortion and associated offenses. <i>See Spitler,</i> 800 F.2d at 1276 (\"Congress may not have intended to criminalize the acquiescence of extortion victims\"); <i>cf. Gebardi v. United States,</i> 287 U.S. 112, 120-23, 53 S.Ct. 35, 77 L.Ed. 206 (1932) (interpreting the Mann Act as not intended to punish the \"victim\" of the crime).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense makes much of the fact that Irizarry pled guilty in another case to conspiring to extort $195,386.36 from Cornier, a fact of which the district court took judicial notice. A victim of extortion can cross the line into illegal behavior if he engages in more active conduct than simply agreeing to pay the extortioner. <i>See Spitler,</i> 800 F.2d at 1276. But here, Cornier argues, Irizarry forced him to hire Valentin for $15,000 per month by using his official position at HUD to threaten Cornier with economic harm, and the evidence shows that he merely acquiesced to the monthly $15,000 payments that Irizarry demanded. He argues that there was no symbiotic relationship between himself and Irizarry and that there is no evidence that he benefitted from or willingly joined in the payments made to Irizarry through Valentin. He emphasizes that Irizarry had nothing at all to do with the approval of ERCO's management contract with PRPHA. Irizarry was a HUD official, and HUD had no input in the awarding of contracts by PRPHA. As a result, he claims, Irizarry's assistance in starting ERCO and in preparing the bid proposal to PRPHA are irrelevant. Put simply, Cornier claims that he got nothing in exchange for the payments he made to Irizarry, thus making unreasonable any conclusion other than that he was an unwilling victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve this case, we need not delineate the precise location of the \"line at which a payor's conduct constitutes sufficient activity beyond the mere acquiescence of a victim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1278. Wherever that line is drawn, there was sufficient evidence here to conclude that Cornier was on the wrong side of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of Irizarry's guilty plea does not make the evidence of Cornier's own guilt insufficient. Irizarry's plea was evidence for the jury to consider, and the jury was entitled to conclude, based on the other evidence presented, that Cornier was not an innocent victim at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supported the conclusion that some sort of quid pro quo arrangement was in place and that Cornier did more than merely acquiesce to it. Irizarry had used his official position at HUD to help Cornier to receive a larger-than-deserved fee from a FEMA program in 1998. Cornier had taken one of the CORA board members to Irizarry's office to accomplish the fraud. Later, Cornier would again be the beneficiary of Irizarry's help. Irizarry provided his experience and expertise in helping Cornier to incorporate his own management company and to prepare a bid proposal to PRPHA. There is thus no question that Irizarry's help yielded monetary benefits to Cornier, and it would only take a small inference for the jury to conclude that Cornier agreed to the ERCO payment arrangement with Valentin and Irizarry in gratitude for this help. Valentin explained the scheme in just this way, testifying that he got the assistant general manager job \"through my brother, in gratitude for him having helped Mr. Cornier\" prepare the bid proposal for the PRPHA contract. He said, \"I had to believe, and I know for a fact, that he [Irizarry] had a deal with Mr. Cornier.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was testimony that Irizarry and Cornier were great friends. Carmen Santiago, who is Irizarry's ex-wife, testified that Cornier and Irizarry \"had a very close relationship\" and had been friends since 1997. She said that the two men called each other constantly and that Cornier frequently visited Irizarry at his farm. Valentin's testimony was consistent with Santiago's. He explained that Cornier and Irizarry \"had an enormous friendship.\" Similarly, Carmen Ortiz, a member of the CORA board, testified that \"there was a very close friendship between them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could easily have credited the reinforcing testimony of Santiago, Valentin, and Ortiz and concluded that Irizarry and Cornier were working together, not against one another. The two men looked out for each other and for each other's future. For example, Cornier told Irizarry that if Irizarry ever retired from HUD, Cornier would give him some ERCO shares and have him work for ERCO as a consultant. Cornier and Irizarry often discussed various projects that could be undertaken on Irizarry's farmland. Irizarry constantly advised and counseled Cornier on business matters, and Cornier gave cellular phones to Irizarry. Even if Cornier acted out of friendship for Irizarry, the jury could conclude that there was nothing innocent about it. We affirm the convictions on Counts Five, Six, and Seven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier appeals the order that he pay $61,804.80 to HUD as restitution in connection with his conviction on Count One. The amount of restitution ordered for Count One is equal to the amount of money paid to Francisco Monroig by Cornier, on behalf of CORA, via the illegal employment scheme. We review restitution orders under an abuse of discretion standard, crediting the lower court's subsidiary factual findings unless clearly erroneous and reviewing associated legal questions de novo. <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> 112 F.3d 579, 586 (1st Cir.1997). No facts are in dispute; what is at issue is the viability of the government's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier's argument on appeal appears to be that HUD was not a \"victim\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663 because it suffered no loss attributable to the CGP funds disbursed to CORA and then paid to Francisco Monroig and so HUD was not \"directly and proximately harmed.\" Cornier does not argue that the crime of conviction in Count One is outside the coverage of &#167; 3663, or that the government cannot qualify as a victim under &#167; 3663, <i>United States v. Quarrell,</i> 310 F.3d 664, 677 (10th Cir.2002). Rather, Cornier asserts that the $61,804.80 in CGP funding was spent by CORA for legitimate purposes and in the ordinary course of business because CGP funds from PRPHA could legitimately be used to pay for expert assistance. He claims that he hired Francisco Monroig in good faith as a funding expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2), a \"victim\" is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that there was a loss, and that HUD was the victim of Cornier's misapplication of federal funds. The court's restitution order was for $136,056.00. On appeal, Cornier challenges only the $61,804.80 that was involved in Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that: as a matter of law there was no loss because the money at issue was, indeed, actually spent by CORA Management for a legitimate purpose, for its own benefit, and in the normal course of business. Indeed, after making the expenditures, CORA['s] performance under the PHA management contract was actually better than if it had not made the expenditures.... The inescapable conclusion is that there was no loss to the government because the money was actually spent for what it was suppose[d] to be spent on and the intended beneficiaries (CORA Management and the Project dwellers) received the benefits of the expenditures. In short, there was no victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis omitted). In arguing this, Cornier relies on testimony from the government's own witness, Rubin Monroig, who said that the CGP funds disbursed to CORA represented payment for work that was actually done, including the expert advice that he, Rubin, had provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's brief is largely non-responsive, arguing instead that the misapplication resulted from the use of Francisco's name, that Francisco was no expert, and that Francisco did no work, so there must have been a loss. The government did not try this case on a theory that the work paid for by the CGP funds was never done; there is no testimony to that effect. The government's own witness, Rubin Monroig, said that the underlying work, for which the $61,804.80 was disbursed, was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of restitution is to secure to an identifiable victim who has been directly and proximately harmed the pecuniary loss he or she has suffered. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(a) and (c). The government's argument confuses the issue whether there has been a crime with the issue whether the conditions for restitution have been met, particularly whether HUD suffered a pecuniary loss. Because the work for which the CGP funds were disbursed was done, it would be an unfair windfall to HUD to conclude that HUD had directly and proximately suffered a loss of $61,804.80. The government offered no evidence of an actual loss to HUD in a lesser amount. Accordingly, we vacate the restitution order to the extent it requires restitution of $61,804.80. <i>See United States v. Paradis,</i> 219 F.3d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir.2000). We leave the matter of any further proceedings on the restitution count to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions are <i>affirmed;</i> the order of restitution is vacated to the extent of the $61,804.80 awarded in connection with defendant's conviction on Count One of the indictment.

Cornier was the general manager, sequentially, of two private for-profit management corporations, CORA and ERCO. Cornier worked with others &#8212; including a HUD division director, a contract employee of the Puerto Rico Public Housing Authority, and their relatives &#8212; to divert United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funds that were meant for the administration of low-income housing projects in Puerto Rico. The schemes alleged involved fraud, kickbacks, sham contracts, ghost employees, and conflicts of interest. Others involved were convicted under separate indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier claimed to be an innocent victim caught in the corrupt schemes of others. He was sentenced to fifty-two months in prison and three years of supervised release, and sentenced to pay restitution of $136,056.00 to HUD. Cornier appeals both his conviction, on insufficiency of evidence grounds, and his sentence requiring restitution. We affirm the conviction, but vacate part of the restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier was indicted on eight counts, all related to misuse of federal housing funding. Cornier pled not guilty. After an eight-day jury trial on the first seven counts, he was convicted on six of those seven counts: aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 666(a)(1)(A) and (2) (Count One); conspiring to defraud the United States by violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (Count Three); aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 666(a)(1)(A) and (2) (via a different scheme than the scheme implicated by Count One) (Count Four); aiding and abetting extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951(a) and (b) (Count Five); money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and (2) (Count Six); and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h) (Count Seven). He was acquitted on Count Two, which charged him with aiding and abetting the solicitation and acceptance of a kickback in violation of 41 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 51, 53, and 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Count One involved a scheme in which Cornier, as general manager of CORA, hired the brother of a housing authority employee to prepare and submit vouchers for federal CGP funds and then lied about the nature of the brother's employment to the CORA board. The work &#8212; both preparing vouchers for submission to the housing authority and the underlying modernization work evidenced by the vouchers &#8212; appears to have been done. The preparation of the vouchers, however, was done by the housing authority employee, who also approved the payment of the vouchers when they were submitted to the housing authority, and not by the brother. As to this scheme, Cornier says that no real harm was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts Three through Seven involved a later scheme with Cornier's next company, ERCO. ERCO employed at an excessive salary the half-brother of a HUD official. The brother did little work, but he received a handsome salary of $15,000 a month, kept $4,000 of it, and passed along the remaining $11,000 to the HUD official. As to this scheme, Cornier claims that he was forced into feeding the greed of the HUD official, was himself a victim of the official's extortion, and was entitled to judgment in his favor. There is no claim of trial error, only that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court addressed Count Eight, which charged Cornier with forfeiture of assets related to the offenses in the other counts, and ordered Cornier to pay restitution in the amount of $136,056.00 to HUD. Of that amount, $61,804.80 was connected with the Count One conviction. Cornier now appeals his convictions and the order to pay restitution as to Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motions for judgment of acquittal as to all six offenses.

HUD allocates federal monies to Puerto Rico for the administration of low-income public housing projects. Most of that federal funding is allocated to cover the costs of managing and operating the housing projects. A different portion of the federal funding is allocated to pay for periodic modernization of the housing projects. HUD disburses this modernization funding based in part on a Comprehensive Grant Program (\"CGP\"), so the funds are called CGP funds. The Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration (\"PRPHA\") receives the federal funds from HUD and is charged with administering the Commonwealth's public housing projects. Pursuant to a 1992 agreement between the government of Puerto Rico and HUD, management of the low-income housing projects in Puerto Rico is done by private management agencies. Such agencies submit bid proposals to PRPHA, and the proposals are then evaluated by a PRPHA bid board. A private management agency that has been awarded a management contract by PRPHA is paid a management fee under the contract using federal funds from HUD. In addition, the private management agency may submit requests to PRPHA for CGP funding in connection with the documented expenses of modernizing and improving its assigned housing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Count One</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Count One,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that Cornier was \"an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof\"; (2) that Cornier embezzled, stole, obtained by fraud, knowingly converted, or intentionally misapplied property that is \"valued at $5,000 or more\" from \"such organization, government, or agency\"; and (3) that such \"organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, [federal assistance] in excess of $10,000.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier raises no issue about the first or third prongs. He argues only that the second prong was not satisfied because his actions fit within a statutory exception. Under &#167; 666(c), \"bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business\" are exempted from the statute's coverage. &#167; 666(c); <i>see United States v.

Subsection (c) was added to the statute in 1986, and the only reference to it in the legislative history states that it \"amends 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666 to avoid its possible application to acceptable business practices.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-797, at 30 (1986), <i>reprinted in</i> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6138, 6153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts pertaining to Count One, recounted in the light most favorable to the prosecution, are as follows. CORA Management Group, Inc. was a for-profit private management agency. Cornier, a former PRPHA employee, was the general manager and a shareholder of CORA. Among other things, he was in charge of administering bids for contracting services and obtaining CGP funding for CORA. In July 1995, CORA was awarded a contract with the PRPHA to manage and maintain certain low-income housing projects. Under the contract, CORA received federal funds from PRPHA; PRPHA received those funds from HUD. CORA received federal assistance in excess of $10,000 during each of the years 1996-1998 in connection with its management of the housing projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubin Monroig, a contract employee at PRPHA, approached Cornier in 1995 and informed him that CORA was not requesting from PRPHA any CGP funds. CORA was, of course, receiving a management fee from PRPHA to operate the housing projects. That management fee was paid by PRPHA using federal funds from HUD. But CORA was also entitled to request CGP funds in order to make physical improvements to the public housing projects it operated and in order to improve its management of those projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Unlike the management fee, which was established under the contract, the disbursement of CGP funds was left to the discretion of PRPHA. Like the management fee, the original source of the CGP money disbursed by PRPHA was HUD. Rubin Monroig told Cornier that his brother, Francisco Monroig, could assist CORA in obtaining CGP funds. Cornier then hired Francisco for that very purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hiring an expert to assist in handling the paperwork associated with obtaining CGP funds was itself a legitimate use of CGP funds because employing such an expert could improve the management of the public housing projects. Francisco Monroig, however, had absolutely no expertise in or knowledge of CGP funds. Whenever Cornier needed assistance as to CGP funds, he contacted Francisco's brother, Rubin, who did have such knowledge, and Rubin provided the requested assistance. Rubin prepared CORA's requests for CGP funding, which involved creating invoices and associated documentation, and gave them to Francisco. Francisco then delivered the documents to Cornier, who, in turn, submitted them to PRPHA. This was an end-run by Rubin, who could not directly do any of these things because he worked for PRPHA. Francisco did not perform any work at all related to CGP funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is unusual in that the government made no effort to prove that the underlying work paid for by the HUD monies was not done. <i>Cf. United States v. Moeller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9003\"><a href=\"/opinion/9003/united-states-v-moeller/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1057-58 (5th Cir.1996) (sufficient evidence to convict under &#167; 666(a)(1)(A) where, among other things, no written product was ever produced in exchange for state funds). Rubin testified (1) that he did in fact provide the expertise necessary to fill out the paperwork associated with requesting CGP funding for maintenance work, and (2) that the underlying maintenance work &#8212; the work for which he claimed CGP funding was needed in the invoices he prepared for Cornier &#8212; was in fact performed by CORA. However, there was also testimony from Carmen Ortiz, a CORA board member, indicating that Cornier could have done the paperwork himself. Cornier's job, after all, was to administer the CORA budget and to prepare bids for contracting services. When Francisco's contract \"expired,\" Cornier did in fact prepare the CGP invoices himself. <i>See Mills,</i> 140 F.3d at 633-34 (suggesting that the &#167; 666(c) exception would not apply if the government proved that salaries were paid for jobs that were unnecessary or unjustified).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's strategy, it seems, was not to prove that the work was not done, but rather, to prove that the work was done by someone who could not lawfully do it. Rubin worked for PRPHA, and his job was to review the requests for CGP funding from private management agencies such as CORA and to authorize payments of CGP funding to those agencies on PRPHA's behalf. Rubin gave preferential treatment to CORA's requests for federal funding, but it was not proven that those requests would not have been funded anyway. CORA paid Francisco $61,804.80 between September 1995 and February 1997 for the assistance with the paperwork involved in obtaining CGP funds, and Francisco passed the money along to Rubin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence about what Cornier got out of this arrangement was not entirely clear. As best we can tell, this scheme may have somewhat increased CORA's profits in at least two ways. First, CORA's CGP invoices were never rejected. This was important because there was some evidence that the underlying maintenance work needed to be done and that CORA risked losing its management contract if the work was not done. If the CGP invoices had been rejected, then CORA might have had to pay for the costs of the maintenance work out of its own funds, if the work was done at all. Rubin suggested that the work would not have been done by CORA if CGP funds were not available. According to Rubin, the benefit of the arrangement to Cornier was that CORA \"had the benefit of having some work that they needed to be done, having it actually done at a cost which was not going to be charged against their profit, and the company would appear well for having done that work.\" Second, there was some marginal benefit in that CORA's CGP invoices were processed more quickly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the gains to Cornier from the arrangement may have been, they were not trivial because Cornier both lied about and tried to cover up the arrangement. The CORA board was not aware of Francisco's employment. When the board eventually discovered his employment, it confronted Cornier. Cornier falsely told the board that he had hired Francisco because PRPHA had demanded that CORA hire a CGP lobbyist. Francisco only worked about a month after the board's discovery, and Cornier told the board that Francisco's employment had ended because his contract had expired, even though the contract actually had no expiration date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that his conviction on Count One should be reversed because the payments that he authorized to Francisco Monroig constituted legitimate compensation paid in the usual course of business and thus fell within the &#167; 666(c) exception. Cornier points out that CGP funds could lawfully be used to hire experts to assist CORA in requesting funds from PRPHA. Further, he maintains that there was no evidence either that he had any knowledge that Rubin Monroig was receiving any part of the payments made to Francisco Monroig, or that he had any knowledge that Rubin, not Francisco, was the one actually doing the work. Without such knowledge, Cornier argues, the payments to Francisco were made in good faith. In other words, Francisco and Rubin may have had a scheme, but he was not part of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict. First, the intentionality element of the \"intentional misapplication\" of federal funds was met by evidence that Cornier in fact knew that Rubin did the work, not Francisco. There was testimony that Francisco was entirely ignorant about CGP funds and that Cornier never even bothered to ask Francisco about them. Francisco testified that he \"really didn't know what CGP was\" and that the work required by his employment contract with CORA was not performed by him, but rather by Rubin. Francisco explained that he never talked to Cornier about CGP funds and that Cornier never asked him about them. His \"limited conversation with [Cornier] pertaining to [the documents he delivered] was, if [Cornier] had any questions regarding the information, [Cornier] should contact my brother Rubin because he was the one who could answer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rubin's testimony was consistent with Francisco's. Rubin acknowledged that Francisco had no knowledge of federal funds and could not have assisted Cornier with them. Rubin testified that \"I suppose that [Cornier] knew that Francisco didn't know anything [about CGP funds], because [Cornier] never asked him [about them].\" Rubin explained that he himself prepared the invoices for Cornier and that Cornier would contact him, not Francisco, to discuss work related to CGP funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Cornier's own behavior belies his contention that he had no knowledge that he was involving CORA in sham contracts with Francisco; it supports the conclusion that he took active steps to conceal the fraud. Cornier met with Francisco behind closed doors, and he never informed the CORA board that Francisco was being employed. When eventually confronted by the board, Cornier first lied about the reason that Francisco was hired and then lied about the termination date of Francisco's contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the bona fide salary exception in &#167; 666(c), and to Cornier's argument that the payments were not a \"misapplication\" at all. The jury could easily have concluded that the payments to Rubin through Francisco were not bona fide because the PRPHA conflict of interest rules prohibited Rubin from participating in such a scheme. A scheme designed to evade conflict of interest rules is hardly legitimate or acceptable. That the payments were made for a legitimate purpose &#8212; to hire a CGP expert to obtain funding for maintenance work that was indeed done &#8212; does not render them bona fide under the statute if they were intentionally misapplied, as they were here via sham contracts that skirted conflict of interest rules and allowed CORA to receive preferential treatment and other benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interplay between the bona fide exception and the prohibition against \"intentional misapplication\" is sensible. As the Second Circuit has explained, the first four prohibitions of &#167; 666(a)(1)(A), embezzlement, stealing, obtaining by fraud, and knowing conversion, \"cover any possible taking of money for one's own use or benefit. Intentional misapplication, in order to avoid redundancy, must mean intentional misapplication for otherwise legitimate purposes; if it were for illegitimate purposes, it would be covered by [the first four] prohibitions....\" <i>United States v. Urlacher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595188\"><a href=\"/opinion/595188/united-states-v-gordon-urlacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 938 (2nd Cir.1992). The prohibition against intentional misapplication covers the situation presented here: payments made for what was an underlying legitimate purpose but intentionally misapplied to undermine a conflict of interest prohibition. To hold that such payments were bona fide under &#167; 666(c) would be inconsistent with &#167; 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the conviction on Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Counts Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict Cornier under Count Three,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>conspiracy</i> to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 666, the government had to prove that there was (1) an agreement, (2) an unlawful objective of the agreement (here, violation of &#167; 666), and (3) an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. <i>United States v.

Irizarry's job at HUD involved visiting and evaluating the public housing projects that were managed by private management agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, CORA received a fee for its management and maintenance of certain shelters that were set up by FEMA in the aftermath of the devastation wrought by Hurricane George. Normally, all the CORA partners shared in management fees. When the management fee from FEMA arrived in this instance, however, Cornier took Carmen Ortiz, one of the CORA board members, to see Irizarry at Irizarry's HUD office. Irizarry falsely told Ortiz that the fee could only be divided among the three CORA partners who had actively worked on the shelters. As a result, the management fee was split among Cornier and only two other CORA board members, so Cornier received a larger share than he should have. Irizarry thus lined Cornier's pocket by making a false statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier formed his own management agency company, ERCO Enterprises, Inc. (\"ERCO\") in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Irizarry helped Cornier behind the scenes to incorporate ERCO and then to prepare a bid proposal to PRPHA. Irizarry, a HUD official, did not sit on the PRPHA board that would act on the proposal. The proposal budget set forth the allocation of the money that ERCO planned to spend in managing the requested housing projects. Under the public housing project system, federal funds paid the salaries of management agency employees assigned to the particular housing projects. In its proposal, ERCO budgeted a generous salary of about $305,000.00 annually for an assistant general manager; the person named was Roberto Colon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on that proposal, PRPHA awarded ERCO a multi-million dollar, five-year contract (April 1999 to March 2004) to manage and maintain certain housing projects. The overall contract was worth $28,676,304.00. There is no evidence that Irizarry influenced the PRPHA to approve the proposal, including its generous salary figure. After the contract was awarded to ERCO, Irizarry arranged for a meeting among Cornier, Samuel Valentin Toro (Irizarry's half-brother, \"Valentin\") and himself. At that meeting, Irizarry introduced Cornier to Valentin as \"your next boss.\" Cornier offered Valentin an assistant general manager position for $15,000.00 per month ($180,000.00 annually), plus additional incentives. Valentin accepted the offer and was hired to work as an assistant general manager. Cornier's wife, Raquel Rios, was also hired to work as an assistant general manager; she was paid the same salary as Valentin. So, $360,000 a year was being spent on the position of assistant general manager. Roberto Colon, who had been designated as the assistant general manager in the bid proposal, never held the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irizarry then instructed Valentin to open a bank account and to deposit the money from Cornier there each month. Irizarry told Valentin to keep $4,000 each month for himself; it was understood that Irizarry would keep the remaining $11,000. Irizarry received approximately $195,386.36 in payments from Cornier in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before Valentin started working for ERCO, Cornier made payments to Irizzary by issuing two checks to Valentin and then endorsing the checks to himself by forging Valentin's signature. Cornier deposited these checks in his own bank account and then wrote out checks to Irizarry from that account for comparable amounts. Cornier also created and signed false employment records for Valentin in connection with the two checks. Irizarry later asked Valentin to imitate the forged signature on future checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that he was an innocent victim of extortion by Irizarry and thus entitled to judgment in his favor on each of the remaining counts. As to Counts Three and Four, the government asserts that there is no \"innocent victim\" defense to a violation of &#167; 666. While some case law suggests that mere acquiescence to an extortioner's demands for payments may not be criminal under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951 (extortion), <i>see United States v. Spitler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476278\"><a href=\"/opinion/476278/united-states-v-russell-e-spitler-united-states-of-america-v-duane/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1275-78 (4th Cir.1986), Cornier has pointed to no authority, and we have not discovered any, to support a similar defense to &#167; 666. <i>Cf. Evans v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112738\"><a href=\"/opinion/112738/evans-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 267 n. 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112738\"><a href=\"/opinion/112738/evans-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1992) (extortion and bribery are not necessarily mutually exclusive).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already discussed the bona fide exception defense to &#167; 666 liability, and it has no conceivable application to the Irizarry affair. As to Counts Three and Four, then, we take the defendant's \"innocent victim\" argument as a claim that there was insufficient evidence that he entered into an agreement with Irizarry and Valentin to intentionally misapply funds in violation of &#167; 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's evidence supporting the existence of an agreement included the following: that Irizarry had helped Cornier to get money while at CORA and then helped him to incorporate ERCO and to prepare a bid proposal for a PRPHA management contract; that the bid proposal included an annual salary of $305,000.00 designated for an assistant general manager named Roberto Colon; that once ERCO was awarded the contract, Valentin, Irizarry's half-brother, was substituted for Colon and paid a salary that even Valentin conceded was grossly inflated; that Valentin gave $11,000 of his monthly salary to Irizarry, who had arranged the meeting among the three men at which Cornier offered Valentin the position; and that Cornier was clearly aware that Valentin was being used to funnel money to Irizarry because even before Valentin began working for ERCO, Cornier \"paid\" Valentin, falsely endorsed the payments to himself, and then used the money to pay Irizarry. Based on that evidence, the jury was amply justified in concluding that Irizarry and Cornier had an agreement to submit a bid proposal that included an inflated salary figure for the assistant general manager position, to substitute Valentin for Colon, and to use the inflated salary to channel federal funds to Irizarry. The inflated salary in the bid proposal provided Cornier with the extra federal funds necessary to pay Irizarry, so the jury could logically infer that the men had agreed to include the inflated salary in the bid for that very purpose. That Cornier engaged in the misapplication of funds intentionally is supported by the evidence of his efforts to conceal the scheme &#8212; by channeling the payments to Irizarry through Valentin, by using Roberto Colon's name on the bid proposal, and by signing false employment records in connection with the checks he issued before Valentin started working. We affirm the convictions on Counts Three and Four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier's \"innocent victim\" defense is more properly asserted as to Counts Five through Seven because they involve extortion and associated offenses. <i>See Spitler,</i> 800 F.2d at 1276 (\"Congress may not have intended to criminalize the acquiescence of extortion victims\"); <i>cf. Gebardi v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101962\"><a href=\"/opinion/101962/gebardi-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 120-23, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></span> (1932) (interpreting the Mann Act as not intended to punish the \"victim\" of the crime).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense makes much of the fact that Irizarry pled guilty in another case to conspiring to extort $195,386.36 from Cornier, a fact of which the district court took judicial notice. A victim of extortion can cross the line into illegal behavior if he engages in more active conduct than simply agreeing to pay the extortioner. <i>See Spitler,</i> 800 F.2d at 1276. But here, Cornier argues, Irizarry forced him to hire Valentin for $15,000 per month by using his official position at HUD to threaten Cornier with economic harm, and the evidence shows that he merely acquiesced to the monthly $15,000 payments that Irizarry demanded. He argues that there was no symbiotic relationship between himself and Irizarry and that there is no evidence that he benefitted from or willingly joined in the payments made to Irizarry through Valentin. He emphasizes that Irizarry had nothing at all to do with the approval of ERCO's management contract with PRPHA. Irizarry was a HUD official, and HUD had no input in the awarding of contracts by PRPHA. As a result, he claims, Irizarry's assistance in starting ERCO and in preparing the bid proposal to PRPHA are irrelevant. Put simply, Cornier claims that he got nothing in exchange for the payments he made to Irizarry, thus making unreasonable any conclusion other than that he was an unwilling victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve this case, we need not delineate the precise location of the \"line at which a payor's conduct constitutes sufficient activity beyond the mere acquiescence of a victim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1278. Wherever that line is drawn, there was sufficient evidence here to conclude that Cornier was on the wrong side of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact of Irizarry's guilty plea does not make the evidence of Cornier's own guilt insufficient. Irizarry's plea was evidence for the jury to consider, and the jury was entitled to conclude, based on the other evidence presented, that Cornier was not an innocent victim at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence supported the conclusion that some sort of quid pro quo arrangement was in place and that Cornier did more than merely acquiesce to it. Irizarry had used his official position at HUD to help Cornier to receive a larger-than-deserved fee from a FEMA program in 1998. Cornier had taken one of the CORA board members to Irizarry's office to accomplish the fraud. Later, Cornier would again be the beneficiary of Irizarry's help. Irizarry provided his experience and expertise in helping Cornier to incorporate his own management company and to prepare a bid proposal to PRPHA. There is thus no question that Irizarry's help yielded monetary benefits to Cornier, and it would only take a small inference for the jury to conclude that Cornier agreed to the ERCO payment arrangement with Valentin and Irizarry in gratitude for this help. Valentin explained the scheme in just this way, testifying that he got the assistant general manager job \"through my brother, in gratitude for him having helped Mr. Cornier\" prepare the bid proposal for the PRPHA contract. He said, \"I had to believe, and I know for a fact, that he [Irizarry] had a deal with Mr. Cornier.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was testimony that Irizarry and Cornier were great friends. Carmen Santiago, who is Irizarry's ex-wife, testified that Cornier and Irizarry \"had a very close relationship\" and had been friends since 1997. She said that the two men called each other constantly and that Cornier frequently visited Irizarry at his farm. Valentin's testimony was consistent with Santiago's. He explained that Cornier and Irizarry \"had an enormous friendship.\" Similarly, Carmen Ortiz, a member of the CORA board, testified that \"there was a very close friendship between them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could easily have credited the reinforcing testimony of Santiago, Valentin, and Ortiz and concluded that Irizarry and Cornier were working together, not against one another. The two men looked out for each other and for each other's future. For example, Cornier told Irizarry that if Irizarry ever retired from HUD, Cornier would give him some ERCO shares and have him work for ERCO as a consultant. Cornier and Irizarry often discussed various projects that could be undertaken on Irizarry's farmland. Irizarry constantly advised and counseled Cornier on business matters, and Cornier gave cellular phones to Irizarry. Even if Cornier acted out of friendship for Irizarry, the jury could conclude that there was nothing innocent about it. We affirm the convictions on Counts Five, Six, and Seven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Restitution Order</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier appeals the order that he pay $61,804.80 to HUD as restitution in connection with his conviction on Count One. The amount of restitution ordered for Count One is equal to the amount of money paid to Francisco Monroig by Cornier, on behalf of CORA, via the illegal employment scheme. We review restitution orders under an abuse of discretion standard, crediting the lower court's subsidiary factual findings unless clearly erroneous and reviewing associated legal questions de novo. <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 586 (1st Cir.1997). No facts are in dispute; what is at issue is the viability of the government's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier's argument on appeal appears to be that HUD was not a \"victim\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663 because it suffered no loss attributable to the CGP funds disbursed to CORA and then paid to Francisco Monroig and so HUD was not \"directly and proximately harmed.\" Cornier does not argue that the crime of conviction in Count One is outside the coverage of &#167; 3663, or that the government cannot qualify as a victim under &#167; 3663, <i>United States v. Quarrell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162706\"><a href=\"/opinion/162706/united-states-v-quarrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 677 (10th Cir.2002). Rather, Cornier asserts that the $61,804.80 in CGP funding was spent by CORA for legitimate purposes and in the ordinary course of business because CGP funds from PRPHA could legitimately be used to pay for expert assistance. He claims that he hired Francisco Monroig in good faith as a funding expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2), a \"victim\" is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that there was a loss, and that HUD was the victim of Cornier's misapplication of federal funds. The court's restitution order was for $136,056.00. On appeal, Cornier challenges only the $61,804.80 that was involved in Count One.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornier argues that: as a matter of law there was no loss because the money at issue was, indeed, actually spent by CORA Management for a legitimate purpose, for its own benefit, and in the normal course of business. Indeed, after making the expenditures, CORA['s] performance under the PHA management contract was actually better than if it had not made the expenditures.... The inescapable conclusion is that there was no loss to the government because the money was actually spent for what it was suppose[d] to be spent on and the intended beneficiaries (CORA Management and the Project dwellers) received the benefits of the expenditures. In short, there was no victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis omitted). In arguing this, Cornier relies on testimony from the government's own witness, Rubin Monroig, who said that the CGP funds disbursed to CORA represented payment for work that was actually done, including the expert advice that he, Rubin, had provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's brief is largely non-responsive, arguing instead that the misapplication resulted from the use of Francisco's name, that Francisco was no expert, and that Francisco did no work, so there must have been a loss. The government did not try this case on a theory that the work paid for by the CGP funds was never done; there is no testimony to that effect. The government's own witness, Rubin Monroig, said that the underlying work, for which the $61,804.80 was disbursed, was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of restitution is to secure to an identifiable victim who has been directly and proximately harmed the pecuniary loss he or she has suffered. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(a) and (c). The government's argument confuses the issue whether there has been a crime with the issue whether the conditions for restitution have been met, particularly whether HUD suffered a pecuniary loss. Because the work for which the CGP funds were disbursed was done, it would be an unfair windfall to HUD to conclude that HUD had directly and proximately suffered a loss of $61,804.80. The government offered no evidence of an actual loss to HUD in a lesser amount. Accordingly, we vacate the restitution order to the extent it requires restitution of $61,804.80. <i>See United States v. Paradis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199005\"><a href=\"/opinion/199005/united-states-v-paradis/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.2000).
