R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1413\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                      JUAN RAMON VEGA-MEJIAS,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro Lang on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 22, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.        After pleading guilty to possessing with\n\nintent to distribute more than one kilogram (gross weight) of\n\nheroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), Juan Ramon Vega-\n\nMejias was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, the statutory\n\nmandatory minimum for that offense, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(I).\n\nHe now appeals from his conviction and sentence and, for the\n\nreasons explained below, we affirm.\n\n           First, Vega-Mejias challenges the validity of his guilty\n\nplea on the ground that the district court violated Rule 11 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure by not adequately advising him\n\nof the consequences of his plea.       In particular, he argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have advised him that his prior criminal\n\nrecord rendered him ineligible for a downward departure, below the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum, under the \"safety valve\" provision,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2; 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). Because Vega-Mejias did not\n\nraise his Rule 11 claim in the trial court, we review the alleged\n\nerror under the plain error standard.          United States v. Vonn, 535\n\nU.S. 55, 59, 63 (2002).\n\n           Here, no Rule 11 error occurred, much less a plain one.\n\nAt the change of plea hearing, the district court complied with its\n\nobligation to \"inform the defendant of, and determine that the\n\ndefendant understands, . . . any mandatory minimum penalty.\"            Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(I).        In particular, the court explained that\n\nby   pleading   guilty   to    the   charged   conduct,   Vega-Mejias   was\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f\"exposing [him]self to a statutory mandatory minimum term of\n\nimprisonment of 10 years\" and confirmed Vega-Mejias's awareness of\n\nthat mandatory minimum.       The court further confirmed Vega-Mejias's\n\nunderstanding that \"any criminal record that [he] may have\" will be\n\nrelevant to determining what his sentence should be.              When asked\n\nwhether he had a criminal record, Vega-Mejias responded, \"No, sir.\"\n\nGiven that response, which was later echoed by defense counsel, the\n\ncourt understandably focused primarily on the fifth requirement of\n\nthe safety valve–-defendant's obligation to provide all information\n\nhe has about the crime--in further explaining that provision.\n\n            Next, Vega-Mejias argues that his attorney's failure to\n\ninvestigate his criminal history before advising him to plead\n\nguilty deprived him of his constitutional right to effective\n\nassistance of counsel.        That claim is also unavailing.\n\n            As we previously held in similar circumstances, \"There is\n\nno   per   se   rule   that    an   attorney's   failure   to    investigate\n\nindependently his client's criminal history before advising him to\n\naccept a plea offer is ineffective assistance. . . .            [L]awyers are\n\nentitled to rely reasonably on the explicit representations of\n\nclients about their criminal histories.\"          United States v. Colón-\n\nTorres, 382 F.3d 76, 86 (1st Cir. 2004).         Rather, \"'a determination\n\nof whether reliance on a client's statement of his own criminal\n\nhistory constitutes deficient performance depends on the peculiar\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case.'\" Id. (quoting United States\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fv. Pease, 240 F.3d 938, 941-42 (11th Cir. 2001)).               And as we have\n\noften held, \"'fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot\n\nmake their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but,\n\nrather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the\n\ntrial court.'\"      United States v. Negrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d 33, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)).     Here, as Vega-Mejias concedes, \"[t]he record is\n\nunclear as to how much information was developed by his counsel\n\nprior   to    the   celebration   of     the    change     of   plea   hearing.\"\n\nAccordingly, this argument is premature; any such ineffective\n\nassistance claim should be brought in the district court under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.\n\n             Finally, Vega-Mejias argues that the district court erred\n\nin imposing a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§   841(b)(1)(A)(I),    rather    than   a     five-year    mandatory    minimum\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(I), because the parties\n\nstipulated that the net weight of the heroin carried by Vega-Mejias\n\nwas 902.7 grams, less than 1 kilogram.             The short answer to this\n\nargument is that it is the gross weight–-not the net weight–-of the\n\nheroin that controls the length of the mandatory minimum sentence.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(I) (establishing mandatory minimum\n\nsentence of 10 years in a case involving \"1 kilogram or more of a\n\nmixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin\");\n\nChapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 464 (1991) (explaining\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\frationale for use of gross rather than net weights); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) (Drug Quantity Table) n.A (providing that\n\n\"[u]nless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance\n\nset forth in the [Drug Quantity] table refers to the entire weight\n\nof any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the\n\ncontrolled   substance\").       Since      Vega-Mejias      pled   guilty   to\n\npossessing more than one kilogram (gross weight) of heroin and\n\nfailed to object to the PSR's statement that he was carrying\n\n1,954.80   grams   (gross   weight)   of    heroin,   the    district   court\n\ncommitted no error, plain or otherwise, in imposing the mandatory\n\nminimum 10-year sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(I).                 For\n\nthe same reason, Vega-Mejias's trial counsel was not ineffective in\n\nfailing to make this argument below.\n\n           Accordingly, the judgment and sentence are affirmed. See\n\nLocal R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
