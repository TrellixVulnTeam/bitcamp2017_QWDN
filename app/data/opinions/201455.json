The noble pursuit of curative\n\ntechnologies birthed Visudyne, a drug that treats the leading cause\n\nof vision loss in people over age fifty.              That success involved the\n\nefforts   of      multiple       institutions,     and    the   common      drive      for\n\nfinancial returns now brings us a dispute over rights to the income\n\nstream of the fastest growing ophthalmic drug in history.\n\n             The entire range of claims articulated by plaintiff-\n\nappellant was dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.\n\nThe bulk of the opinion that follows consists of our de novo review\n\nof these dismissals.             We must also address defendant-appellee's\n\ncross-appeal of several discovery-related rulings.                         Following a\n\nreview of the factual background, considered in the light most\n\nfavorable to the appellant, we will begin our analysis.\n\n                             I.    Factual Background\n\n             A.    Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\n             Age-related         macular   degeneration     (AMD)     is    an    ocular\n\ndisease that is the predominant cause of vision loss in people over\n\nage fifty.     The illness takes two forms: \"wet\" and \"dry.\"                     The wet\n\nform, though only accounting for ten percent of the cases of age-\n\nrelated macular degeneration, leads to the debilitating condition\n\nknown as choroidal neovascularization (\"CNV\" or \"neovasculature\"),\n\nresponsible       for   ninety     percent   of   cases    of   AMD   vision          loss.\n\nNeovasculature          refers     to   conditions       characterized           by     the\n\nproliferation of unwanted blood vessels.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f            In 1989, several researchers at Massachusetts General\n\nHospital's (\"MGH\") Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine began\n\ninvestigating the use of photosensitive drugs to treat eye diseases\n\nsuch as AMD involving neovasculature.              In March 1991, the MGH\n\nresearchers      met   with    Dr.     Julia     Levy     of     appellee    QLT\n\nPhototherapeutic (\"QLT\") to discuss the possibility of utilizing\n\nbenzoporphin derivatives (\"BPD\" or \"derivatives\") developed by QLT\n\nfor the treatment of AMD.         Levy agreed to provide MGH the BPD\n\nneeded for research trials.\n\n            The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (\"MEEI\" or \"the\n\nInfirmary\"), a medical institution located next to, but distinct\n\nfrom, MGH, also sought out QLT's BPD for photodynamic therapy\n\nresearch.    Dr. Joan Miller joined the Infirmary in the fall of 1991\n\nand soon proposed conducting studies using BPD on monkeys.                    In\n\nMarch 1992, Miller applied to MEEI to investigate the use of BPD to\n\ntreat neovasculature.       Pursuant to Dr. Miller's application, MEEI\n\nand QLT signed a material transfer agreement (\"MTA\") in which MEEI\n\nwould receive BPD at no cost in exchange for providing QLT the\n\nresults     of   Miller's   pre-clinical       studies    for    use   in   QLT's\n\nregulatory filings and patent disclosures.\n\n             In September 1992, following their successful monkey\n\ntrials,   which    demonstrated      the   potential     use    of   photodynamic\n\ntherapy with BPD, Dr. Miller and her MEEI colleague, Dr. Gragoudas,\n\npresented their data confidentially to QLT representatives visiting\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fBoston.    Within the next two years, MEEI and QLT entered into two\n\nmore material transfer agreements of similar tenor.\n\n            B.    Confidential Disclosure Agreement\n\n            QLT    had    interest       in    commercial      applications   of   the\n\nInfirmary's experimental monkey trials and, in May 1993, QLT and\n\nDr.   Miller     entered      into   a    Confidential         Disclosure   Agreement\n\n(\"CDA\").    As part of this agreement, QLT promised \"not to use the\n\nConfidential Information for any purpose other than the evaluation\n\nof Products under the terms of this Agreement\" and \"to maintain\n\nConfidential Information in confidence.\"                   The parties agreed that\n\n\"misuse or improper disclosure of Confidential Information would\n\nirreparably harm the business of the disclosing party or that\n\nparty's affiliates.\"           Pursuant to the CDA, Miller continued to\n\nprovide MEEI's confidential research results to QLT, including\n\nresults of MEEI research not funded by QLT.\n\n            In July 1993, at Dr. Miller's request, QLT agreed to fund\n\nfurther experiments by the Infirmary involving the treatment of\n\nneovasculature in monkeys with the derivatives.                      The results of\n\nthese studies, as well as other studies not funded by QLT, were\n\nshared    with    QLT    in   November        1994,   in   a   report   entitled   the\n\nPreclinical BPD-MA Pharmacology Study for Macular Degeneration\n\n(\"Bolus Study\").\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           C.   QLT Partnership with CIBA Vision\n\n           In late 1993, QLT contacted the company CIBA Vision1 to\n\ncommercialize the use of photodynamic therapies with BPD to treat\n\nage-related macular degeneration.      QLT provided CIBA Vision with\n\nMEEI's confidential research results without first informing MEEI.\n\nIn February 1994, CIBA Vision sought full access to Dr. Miller's\n\nresearch results to pursue a \"high potential opportunity.\"       QLT\n\nagreed to share with CIBA Vision the \"plans and results of our\n\nocular programme,\" which included Dr. Miller's research.\n\n           Dr. Miller learned of QLT's negotiations with CIBA Vision\n\nin the Spring of 1994.    In March, she expressed concern about the\n\nconfidentiality of MEEI's research results to Julia Levy and Edwin\n\nLevy of QLT, who assured her that QLT had not disclosed and would\n\nnot disclose in the future any of MEEI's trade secret information.\n\nDr. Miller then flew to Switzerland \"to get CIBA Vision excited in\n\nthe technology,\" but during that meeting, and subsequent meetings\n\nwith CIBA Vision representatives in July and October of 1994 she\n\npresented only summaries of her research.\n\n           On May 31, 1994, CIBA Vision and QLT executed a Letter of\n\nIntent to enter into a strategic partnership for commercializing\n\nthe use of photodynamic therapy to treat neovasculature arising\n\nfrom age-related macular degeneration.    The Letter recognized that\n\nQLT had \"significant non-clinical evidence\" -- some of which came\n\n\n1\n    CIBA Vision is today known as Novartis Ophthalmics, Inc.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffrom Miller's research -- showing the success of the therapy for\n\nthis application.      The Letter indicated that \"[e]ach party will\n\nmanage the patent portfolio in collaboration with the other party.\"\n\nQLT announced the partnership to the public and MEEI announced\n\nthat:\n\n          Researchers   at    [MEEI]    in    Boston   are\n          participating in a joint worldwide project\n          with [QLT] and CIBA . . . to develop\n          photodynamic therapy, a potential treatment\n          for   certain   eye   diseases.        Infirmary\n          researchers,   since   1992,    have   performed\n          pre-clinical studies, in collaboration with\n          Wellman   Laboratories,    using    Benzoprophin\n          derivative      (BPD),       a     proprietar y\n          light-activated drug developed by [QLT].\n\nClinical trials testing the treatment on humans began in 1995, and\n\nthe Infirmary was one of several sites performing the trials under\n\na written agreement with QLT.      MEEI was paid more than one million\n\ndollars for participation in the trials and for the resulting\n\nclinical data.\n\n          On   February   6,    1995,   QLT    and   CIBA   Vision      signed   a\n\ndefinitive agreement to pursue worldwide joint development and\n\ncommercialization of photo-dynamic therapy for the treatment of\n\nchoroidal neovasculature.        The partnership aimed to obtain FDA\n\napproval for its treatment, tradenamed Visudyne, in April 2000.\n\nSales outside    the   United   States   began       in   1999,   and   Visudyne\n\nreceived FDA approval in April 2000.          As of February 2002, over two\n\nhundred twenty million dollars' worth of Visudyne had been sold\n\nworldwide.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           D.   Patent Applications\n\n           Prior to QLT's partnering with CIBA Vision, in March\n\n1994, Dr. Miller approached QLT about pursuing a patent application\n\nfor the treatment.      QLT agreed and suggested that Kate Murashige,\n\nits    long-standing    patent     attorney,        prepare    the   application.\n\nRelying on information provided by Miller, Murashige prepared a\n\npatent   application     with     serial      number    08/209,473    (\"the       '473\n\napplication\")    and    filed     it   on   March     14,   1994.     The    claimed\n\ninvention applied to methods for treating choroidal neovasculature\n\nwith photodynamic therapy using BPD; the named inventors included\n\nonly MEEI's Drs. Miller and Gragoudas and another MEEI employee,\n\nLucy Young.\n\n            Even though it was not claiming co-inventorship of the\n\n'473   application,     QLT     confirmed      that    it   would    pay    for     the\n\npreparation of the application. Murashige told MEEI that \"QLT does\n\nnot see itself as a participant in the invention other than as a\n\nsupplier of     the    material    BPD,\"      and   \"the    assignment      would    be\n\nentirely to MEEI.\"\n\n            Within months of the '473 filing, however, QLT changed\n\nits approach to the patent strategy.                On behalf of QLT, Murashige\n\nproposed to MEEI that the '473 application could be improved upon\n\nby modifying the scope of the patent claims. Murashige argued that\n\nit would strengthen the application to include methods of treating\n\nCNV with photo-dynamic therapy using liposomal formulations of BPD.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fSince QLT's Dr. Levy and the MGH inventors had contributed to the\n\ninvention of this form of treatment, the addition of these claims\n\nto the application would make them co-inventors.              QLT appreciated\n\nthe legal significance of the amplification of inventorship in the\n\n'591 application.       Jennifer Kaufman-Shaw, QLT's in-house counsel,\n\nwrote to CIBA Vision that:\n\n            at the time the invention was made, there was\n            no contractual agreement in place whereby QLT\n            would be entitled to ownership of the\n            invention.   Therefore QLT claims ownership\n            only through Dr. Julia Levy . . . . If Dr.\n            Levy were not an inventor, QLT would have no\n            rights to the patent.\n\nThus, Murashige convened the three institutions -- QLT, MEEI, and\n\nMGH -- and requested that MEEI and MGH retain their own patent\n\ncounsel.\n\n            Implementing the proposal entailed a \"continuation-in-\n\npart   application,\"      with   serial       number   08/390,591   (the    '591\n\napplication).     At the same time, Murashige removed from the '473\n\napplications those claims directed to methods of treating unwanted\n\nchoroidal    neovasculature      with    photodynamic     therapy   using    the\n\nbenzoporhin derivatives.         Those claims were joined to the '591\n\napplication.\n\n            After receiving assurances that MEEI would receive fair\n\ncompensation for its contributions, the MEEI inventors consented to\n\nthe    changes,   and     Murashige     filed    the   '591   application      on\n\nFebruary    17,   1995.     MEEI's      Miller   and   Gragoudas    executed    a\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f\"Combined Declaration of Inventorship and Power of Attorney for\n\nContinuation-in-Part Application,\" affirming that they were joint\n\ninventors along with the others of those inventions claimed in the\n\n'591 application.      Drs. Miller and Gragoudas maintained that they\n\nsigned the Declaration of Inventorship and Power of Attorney with\n\n(1)   the   expectation      that     the   proper     inventorship       would    be\n\ndetermined once final claims were allowed, and (2) in consideration\n\nfor   QLT's      express    promise    that     MEEI   would      be     compensated\n\nappropriately for Drs. Miller and Gragoudas's contributions through\n\na license agreement.\n\n            On August 25, 1998, the '591 application issued as U.S.\n\nPatent 5,798,349 (the '349 patent).               Drs. Miller and Gragoudas\n\nassigned their rights as inventors to the Infirmary, and Drs. Hasan\n\nand Schmidt-Erfurth         assigned    their    rights      to   MGH.     Dr.    Levy\n\nassigned    her    rights    to     QLT.      Among    the    assignees      of    the\n\ninventorship of the '349 patent, QLT is distinguished by its\n\nownership of the patents on the benzoporphin derivatives integral\n\nto the invented treatment. This ownership means that QLT alone can\n\nindependently exploit the rights of the '349 patent.\n\n            E.    Licensing Negotiations\n\n            In December 1995, QLT had signed a letter of intent to\n\nnegotiate exclusive licenses of MEEI's and MGH's co-ownership\n\nrights in any patent that issued from the pending '591 application.\n\nSuch a license would prevent MGH or MEEI from licensing their\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\frights under a patent issuing from the '591 application to a\n\ncompetitor of QLT.      According to the letter, \"QLT does intend to\n\nnegotiate in good faith with MEEI/MGH and other assignees to come\n\nto an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which will be\n\nconsistent with industry standards under similar circumstances.\"\n\nIn the same letter, QLT indicated \"its intent to negotiate with the\n\nMEEI/MGH for an option to license the technology which is the\n\nsubject of the ['473 application].\"         Negotiations would commence,\n\naccording to QLT, once a patent issued and the feasibility of the\n\ninvention was proven.\n\n            MEEI responded in February 1996 that the Letter of Intent\n\n\"is insufficient in that it does not address the issue of how the\n\nInfirmary will participate in the licensing or transferring of MEEI\n\ntechnology by QLT to third parties.\"           MEEI also accused QLT of\n\nentering into an agreement with CIBA Vision \"using, in part,\n\ntechnology that was developed . . . at the Infirmary.\"                   MEEI\n\nconcluded, \"If that is untrue, please advise us.          If that is true,\n\nour position is that the Infirmary should be a party to that\n\nagreement   as   well   as   any   future   agreements   relative   to   that\n\ntechnology.\"     QLT did not respond to this letter.\n\n                         II.   QLT's Cross-Appeal\n\n            The above narrative anticipates the disposition of the\n\ncross-appeal, as the picture we have painted includes information\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthat QLT wished never to disclose.2           Because QLT has challenged a\n\nnumber of evidentiary rulings, we must explain which evidence we\n\nfind properly before us.\n\n            QLT contends that the district court erroneously ordered\n\nthe production     of   certain    attorney-client       communications     with\n\nMurashige and other attorneys of her firm.                The district court\n\nfound that QLT met its burden of establishing the prima facie\n\napplicability      of    the      attorney-client        privilege    to     the\n\ncommunications in question.         See Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT\n\nPhototherapeutics, Inc., 167 F. Supp. 2d 108, 115 (D. Mass. 2001)\n\n(accepting report and recommendation of discovery master).                  Such\n\ncommunications are privileged unless an exception –- here, the\n\ncommon-interest exception -- applies.             The party challenging the\n\nprivilege    carries     the      burden     of    establishing      that    any\n\ncommunications are discoverable.            FDIC v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d\n\n454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000).      The common-interest exception permits a\n\nparty access to his joint-client's communications with the shared\n\ncounsel.     The   district    court       held   that   the   common-interest\n\nexception applied, within a specified time frame and as to certain\n\n\n2\n   We note that the existence of MEEI and QLT's common-interest\ndoes not abrogate the attorney-client privilege vis-à-vis the\ngeneral public.    However, nearly all confidential information\ndivulged in this opinion has long been available to the public in\nthe district court discovery opinion of April 13, 2001. Mass. Eye\n& Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 167 F. Supp. 2d\n108, 110-13. Moreover, we have taken care to recount only those\ncommunications essential to the issues before us, issues that will\nalso be at the heart of the ongoing litigation.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fmatters, thereby granting, in part, MEEI's motion for production of\n\ncertain documents.    Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 167 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n127-28.\n\n           We disturb a district court's discovery management \"only\n\nupon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the\n\nlower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in\n\nsubstantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"        Mack v. Great Atl.\n\n& Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).       QLT invites us\n\nto conduct a plenary review of the relevant orders, arguing that\n\nwhether an exception to the attorney-client privilege applies is a\n\nquestion of law that deserves de novo review, citing Cavallaro v.\n\nUnited States, 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir. 2002).         The authority\n\nQLT cites, however, specifies only that the \"formulation of . . .\n\nthe . . . common-interest doctrine\" should be reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n(emphasis added).    The application of properly formulated doctrine\n\nto the facts remains a matter of discretion for the district court.\n\nId.\n\n           The   discovery   master   spelled   out   MEEI's   burden   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           MEEI must first establish that MEEI shared an\n           attorney-client relationship with Morrison &\n           Foerster [Murashige's law firm] on the\n           following matters: (1) the preparation and\n           prosecution of the '473 application (which\n           issued   as  the   '986   patent);   (2)   the\n           preparation and prosecution of the '591\n           application (which issued as the '349 patent);\n           (3) the licensing of the '986 patent; and (4)\n           the licensing of the '349 patent.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fMass. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 116-17.           QLT asserts\n\nthat the discovery master's inquiry was inadequate as a matter of\n\nlaw because MEEI not only had to show that MEEI and QLT were joint\n\nclients of Morrison & Foerster, but that, in addition, they shared\n\n\"an identical (or nearly identical) legal interest as opposed to a\n\nmerely similar interest.\"     Ogden, 202 F.3d at 461.      QLT argues that\n\nMurashige's legal work for MEEI and QLT regarding the matters was\n\nnot directed toward a nearly identical legal interest.                Absent\n\nconverging interests, parties who shared an attorney ought not have\n\naccess to their counsel's communications with the other party.\n\n           It is peculiar to address this question first as it\n\ninevitably    requires   reaching   into   the   merits   we   have   yet   to\n\ndiscuss.     But the district court had to do so, as must we.               The\n\nirony that the ensuing discovery shows just how polarized the two\n\nparties' interests may already have been is not material to the\n\ninquiry.     \"A joint attorney-client relationship remains intact\n\nuntil it is expressly terminated or until circumstances arise that\n\nreadily imply to all the joint clients that the relationship is\n\nover.\"   Ogden, 202 F.3d at 463.      The rules of discovery therefore\n\ndo not insulate from discovery the communications of a duplicitous\n\nparty who feigns common interest while scheming otherwise with a\n\nshared, trusted advisor.\n\n           We agree, for the reasons elaborated in the master's\n\nrecommendation, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 118-23, that QLT and MEEI were\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fjoint clients of Morrison & Foerster during at least part of\n\nMurashige's representation of the parties for two of the four\n\nmatters   advanced   by   MEEI:    prosecution   of   the   '473   and   '591\n\napplications.   Federal patent law shapes and limits the scope of\n\njoint inventors' interest in the successful prosecution of a\n\npatent.   Until an event affirmatively terminates the joint-client\n\nrelationship of parties relying on the same attorney for that\n\nprosecution, or otherwise \"readily impl[ies]\" that the relationship\n\nis over, as a matter of law, the joint relationship endures.\n\nBehind the scenes machinations adverse to the joint client are not\n\nnecessarily determinative.        Id. at 126.\n\n           The district court found an endpoint to joint-client\n\nstatus as of October 1, 1998:\n\n           There is no evidence in the record that MEEI's\n           and QLT's joint attorney-client relationship\n           with Morrison & Foerster for the preparation\n           and prosecution of the '473 application, or\n           for the preparation and prosecution of the\n           '591 application, was expressly terminated.\n\n           However, in a letter dated October 1, 1998,\n           MEEI informed QLT that MEEI had filed in the\n           PTO a continuation patent application of the\n           '591 application.    From the record, it is\n           clear that neither QLT nor Morrison & Foerster\n           was involved in the preparation or prosecution\n           of the continuation patent application. Thus,\n           . . . at least as of October 1, 1998, both\n           MEEI and QLT understood that their respective\n           legal interests in the '349 patent were no\n           longer the same, or nearly the same, legal\n           interest.\n           . . .\n           It is less clear when MEEI's and QLT's\n           respective legal interests in the '986 patent\n\n                                    -15-\n\f           were no longer the same, or nearly the same,\n           legal interest . . . . [However], at least as\n           of October 1, 1998, both MEEI and QLT\n           understood   that   their  respective   legal\n           interests in the '986 patent were no longer\n           the same, or nearly the same, legal interest.\n\nMass. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 126.\n\n           QLT   does       not   disagree,     but    instead     raises   as    an\n\nalternative argument in its appeal that, if it shared a common\n\ninterest with MEEI, the common interest would have terminated more\n\nthan a year earlier, at the latest on July 31, 1997.                On that date,\n\nMEEI   contested,      by   letter,    QLT    and   MGH's   role    in   the     '591\n\ninvention. The letter from MEEI's patent attorney, Edmund Pitcher,\n\nto Murashige, expressed MEEI's view that \"the entirety of the\n\nsubject matter of the allowed claims is the invention of MEEI\n\npersonnel only, and that neither Dr. Levy [of QLT], nor Drs. Hasan\n\nor Schmidt [of MGH] made any inventive contribution.\"                       Pitcher\n\nnoted that \"Dr. Levy's presence on the application places MEEI in\n\nthe uncomfortable position of being dependent on the fairness of\n\nQLT,   despite   its    directly      adverse   economic    interest,       in    the\n\nnegotiation of a license agreement.\"                  The letter included the\n\ndemand that QLT:\n\n           make a concrete license proposal immediately\n           and/or file a continuation application to\n           permit correction of the named inventors. If\n           the Infirmary and QLT cannot come to an\n           agreement on a reasonable royalty rate and\n           other financial terms, we are instructed to\n           assume responsibility for prosecution of\n           patent applications covering subject matter\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            invented without the involvement of Dr. Levy\n            so as to try to preserve MEEI's rights.\n\nQLT responded to the district court's order with a \"Motion to Amend\n\nOrder as to Date of Termination of 'Common Interest,'\" in which\n\nQLT, for further support, drew on letters and memoranda written by\n\nMurashige and employees from QLT and CIBA Vision subsequent to\n\nMEEI's July 31 letter.      In QLT's motion, QLT argued that MEEI's\n\nletter implied to QLT that it no longer shared the same interest in\n\nthe successful prosecution of the '591 application, as MEEI was\n\nthreatening to pursue an alternative and conflicting avenue for\n\nrealizing   federal   protection    for    its   invention.     Thus,   QLT\n\ncontended that \"as a matter of fact, as a result of MEEI's July 31,\n\n1997 letter, QLT appreciated that QLT and MEEI no longer shared a\n\ncommon interest in successfully prosecuting the claimed inventions\n\nin\" the '591 application.\n\n            The discovery master denied the motion to move the date\n\nof termination of interest forward, finding, in essence, that\n\nMEEI's conflicting interest was only conditional.          That is to say,\n\nMEEI shared QLT's interest in the successful prosecution of the\n\n'591 application so long as a reasonable royalty rate was in the\n\ncards.      MEEI   argues   that   it     \"was   merely   exploring   other\n\npossibilities of protecting its rights in the event that QLT did\n\nnot live up to its promises once the '349 patent issued,\" when it\n\nfiled the 1997 application. The discovery master discussed how the\n\nletters and memoranda QLT offered supported this interpretation.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fA memorandum drafted by Jennifer Kauffman-Shaw, of QLT, to the QLT-\n\nCIBA Vision Joint Coordinating Committee, dated October 27, 1997,\n\nstated that \"the Director of Intellectual Property for MEEI, Carl\n\nFinn, has indicated that if QLT were willing to negotiate a\n\nsatisfactory license agreement for the patent, that MEEI would not\n\npursue the inventorship issue.\"   The master read\n\n          the memorandum [to] show[] that QLT understood\n          that   MEEI   remained   interested   in   the\n          successful    prosecution     of   the    '591\n          application.      Thus,   contrary  to   QLT's\n          assertions, the Kaufmann-Shaw Memorandum does\n          not show that QLT implied, from the Pitcher\n          Letter and the Finn Letter, that MEEI was no\n          longer    interested    in    the   successful\n          prosecution of the '591 application.\n\nMay 29, 2002, slip op. at 3.3\n\n          We believe that whether the common-interest exception\n\nexpires upon the implication that a party has a conditionally\n\nadverse interest of the sort at issue here is a question of law\n\nover which we should exercise de novo review.       The question is\n\n\n\n3\n   In its original objections to MEEI's motion for production, QLT\nargued that an October 21, 1997 letter by MEEI's Carl Finn to QLT's\nDolphin terminated any common interest that might have existed.\nIts later motion to terminate the interest as of July 31, 1997\nrelied upon materials released pursuant to the district court's\norder to produce privileged documents. Without entering into a\ncomplicated area of patent law that would require us to ascertain\nwhat QLT would infer from Finn's reference to a \"patent application\nrecently filed on behalf of MEEI,\" we note that the master's\nultimate conclusion that \"the October 21, 1997 letter did not\nreadily imply that MEEI's and QLT's respective legal interest in\nthe '591 application was no longer the same or nearly the same,\nlegal interest,\" 167 F. Supp. 2d at 131, relies on the same\nconditional analysis we deem worthy of de novo review.\n\n                                -18-\n\fwhether a party has \"an identical (or nearly identical) legal\n\ninterest\" with another when (1) they share a nearly identical\n\ninterest with regard to one outcome -- here successful prosecution\n\nof the '591 application -- which (2) depends on a condition that\n\npits the parties against each other –- here, negotiation of a\n\nlicense on agreeable terms.         We believe that it does.      Our view is\n\nthat the district court correctly focused on the continuing joint\n\nrepresentation    of   the    parties     by    Murashige   as   to    the   '591\n\napplication.     Insomuch as MEEI hoped to license its rights to the\n\n'591   application     to    QLT,   its   objective    depended       upon   that\n\napplication's successful prosecution.            The fact that one potential\n\noutcome, announced by MEEI in the July 31, 1997 letter, would\n\nrender its interests in the '591 application contrary to QLT's did\n\nnot of its own force terminate their joint representation as to the\n\nprosecution of that application.               Rather, it begs the factual\n\nquestion of whether Murashige ceased to represent MEEI's interests\n\nas to that prosecution.         The discovery master noted that in a\n\nNovember 25, 1997 letter from Kaufman-Shaw of QLT to MEEI, QLT\n\nindicated that it \"was willing to put aside the argument over\n\ninventorship in favor of settling upon an arrangement whereby the\n\nparticipants in the AMD/ocular neovasculature project would derive\n\na benefit from their contributions.\"            This letter also proposed a\n\nmeeting date between Murashige and MGH employees, CIBA Vision\n\nemployees, QLT employees, and MEEI employees. The discovery master\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fconcluded that this letter \"continues to show that QLT did not\n\nreadily [infer], from MEEI's letter by Pitcher and Finn, (1) that\n\nMEEI was no longer interested in the successful prosecution of the\n\n'591 application and, (2) as a result, that MEEI and QLT no longer\n\nshared the same, or nearly the same, legal interest, in the '591\n\napplication.\"       Accordingly, QLT's motion to amend the date of the\n\ntermination of the joint interest was denied.             The district court\n\ncorrectly framed the common-interest exception, and we find that it\n\nwas within its discretion in requiring disclosure of communications\n\nbetween QLT and Murashige of Morrison & Foerster relating to the\n\nprosecution of the '349 and '591 applications up until October 1,\n\n1998.\n\n                            III.     MEEI's Appeal\n\n            The pivotal moment that shapes nearly all of MEEI's\n\nclaims    involves    the   filing    of   the   continuation-in-part     '591\n\napplication, which added Dr. Julia Levy of QLT and Drs. Schmidt-\n\nErforth and Hasan of MGH as inventors on the patent.            In the course\n\nof that switch in patent strategy, QLT made numerous assurances to\n\nMEEI that it would license MEEI's patent rights on reasonable\n\nterms.    This case is before us because no licensing agreement was\n\never reached.   MEEI claims that it was injured by this failure, and\n\nfurther    harmed    by   QLT's   unlawful   disclosure    of   MEEI's   trade\n\nsecrets.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f           A.   Contract Claims\n\n           1.   Breach of Contract\n\n           The parties' disagreement regarding the existence of an\n\nenforceable contract is a legal one, and so this court reviews the\n\nquestion of contract formation de novo. Coady v. Ashcroft & Gerel,\n\n223 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2000).       The district court determined that\n\nthe   parties   failed   to   reach   an   agreement   whose    terms    were\n\nsufficiently determinate to constitute a binding contract.               MEEI\n\ncounters that the district court erred in failing to recognize that\n\na valid contract could include terms defined by industry standards.\n\nWhile there are surely some contracts in which a crucial term could\n\nbe sufficiently defined by pegging it to industry standards, we\n\nagree   with    the   district   court's    conclusion   that    there    is\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record to find that the parties had\n\nreached a meeting of the minds.        See, e.g., Lucey v. Hero Intern.\n\nCorp., 281 N.E.2d 266, 269 (Mass. 1972) (finding that \"'[a]n\n\nagreement to enter into a contract which leaves the terms of that\n\ncontract for future negotiation is too indefinite to be enforced'\")\n\n(quoting Cygan v. Megathlin, 96 N.E.2d 702, 703 (Mass. 1951)).\n\n           MEEI has also claimed breach of contract with regard to\n\nthe May 1993 Confidential Disclosure Agreement signed by QLT and\n\nDr. Miller.     We agree with the district court that MEEI was not a\n\nparty to this agreement and that there is no evidence that Miller\n\nwas acting as an agent of MEEI.         Furthermore, MEEI does not fall\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fwithin the limited class of third party beneficiaries who can\n\nenforce   a    contract    to    which    they      are   not    a   party.    Under\n\nMassachusetts      law,   in    order    for    a   third   party     to   enforce   a\n\ncontract, \"[i]t must appear from 'the language and circumstances of\n\nthe contract' that the parties to the contract 'clear[ly] and\n\ndefinite[ly]'      intended     the     beneficiaries       to   benefit    from   the\n\npromised performance.\"           Miller v. Mooney, 725 N.E.2d 545, 550\n\n(Mass. 2000) (quoting Anderson v. Fox Hill Vill. Homeowners Corp.,\n\n676 N.E.2d 821, 822 (Mass. 1997)).              Nothing in the language of the\n\nConfidential Disclosure Agreement indicates that MEEI was meant to\n\nbe either a party or a third party beneficiary.                  QLT was listed as\n\na party, and a vice president of the company signed for QLT.                         In\n\ncontrast, Dr. Miller signed only in her personal capacity without\n\nreference to MEEI.        Furthermore, the mere fact that MEEI would\n\nlikely benefit from such an agreement does not, by itself, show\n\nthat MEEI was an intended rather than an incidental beneficiary.\n\nSee Miller, 725 N.E.2d at 550 (citing Restatement (2d) of Contracts\n\n§ 302 (1981)).        Thus, MEEI cannot pursue a claim for breach of\n\ncontract as a third party beneficiary based on the Confidential\n\nDisclosure Agreement.\n\n              2.   Breach of Implied Contract\n\n              We construe MEEI's breach of implied contract claim to be\n\na claim of contract implied-in-fact rather than contract implied-\n\nin-law.   Although both causes of action exist in Massachusetts,\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fMEEI has argued principally that it reached an actual, enforceable\n\nagreement with QLT that was implied by the dealings of the two\n\nparties.          MEEI's   implied-in-law         oriented      arguments      will   be\n\naddressed in this court's analysis of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\nSee 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 1:6 (4th ed. 2004).\n\n           \"A contract implied in fact requires the same elements as\n\nan express contract and differs only in the method of expressing\n\nmutual   assent.\"          6    William   Meade     Fletcher     et     al.,   Fletcher\n\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 2580 (perm. ed.\n\nrev. vol. 2004). Thus, MEEI's implied contract claim fails for the\n\nsame reason we have rejected its express contract claim -- failure\n\nto reach agreement on the basic terms of the contract.                          In the\n\nprototypical        implied      contract      case,    the     terms    are    already\n\nsufficiently clear, and the court looks to the actions of the\n\nparties only to determine whether their actions indicate that they,\n\nin fact, agreed on those terms.                However, in this case, where the\n\nterms proposed by each side remain at odds, searching the actions\n\nof the parties for indicia of consent becomes a fruitless exercise.\n\nWithout agreement on the essential terms of the agreement, MEEI's\n\nimplied contract claim gets no further than does its express\n\ncontract claim.\n\n             3.    Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n             Having concluded that no contract exists, there can be no\n\nderivative    implied          covenant   of     good   faith    and    fair    dealing\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fapplicable to these parties.            Under Massachusetts law, \"[t]he\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every\n\ncontract.\"     UNO Rests., Inc. v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp., 805\n\nN.E.2d 957, 964 (Mass. 2004).           \"The covenant may not, however,\n\ncreate rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing\n\ncontractual relationship, as the purpose of the covenant is to\n\nguarantee that the parties remain faithful to the intended and\n\nagreed expectations of the parties in their performance.\"          Id.   In\n\nother words, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\n\ngoverns conduct of parties after they have entered into a contract;\n\nwithout a contract, there is no covenant to be breached.         Where, as\n\nhere, the parties have not yet reached a binding agreement, there\n\nis no duty to negotiate in good faith.           See Levenson v. L.M.I.\n\nRealty Corp., 575 N.E.2d 370, 372 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991) (rejecting\n\nthe argument that where defendant stopped short of binding himself\n\nto a contract he nevertheless had a duty to negotiate the terms in\n\ngood faith).\n\n          B.    Conversion and Misrepresentation Claims\n\n          1.    Conversion\n\n          MEEI    claims   that   QLT    converted   MEEI's   intellectual\n\nproperty rights in the invention of the photodynamic therapy \"by\n\ncausing MEEI to file a joint patent application with MGH and QLT so\n\nthat a patent issued would name employees of all these institutions\n\nas inventors.\"     \"Conversion requires the exercise of dominion or\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fcontrol over the personal property of another.\"                Third Nat'l Bank\n\nof Hampden Cty. v. Cont'l Ins. Co., 446 N.E.2d 380, 383 (Mass.\n\n1983).     However, MEEI agreed to the filing of the joint patent\n\napplication.     From the moment QLT became a co-inventor of the '349\n\npatent, it too had full and equal rights to exploit the patented\n\nintellectual     property.      Under   a       more    refined   statement   of\n\nMassachusetts law, only a defendant that \"wrongfully exercises acts\n\nof ownership\" has committed conversion.                In re Halmar Distribs.,\n\nInc., 968 F.2d 121, 129 (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis added) (internal\n\ncitation omitted).      Since QLT jointly owned the property at issue\n\nand since it did nothing to prevent MEEI from exercising its own\n\nrights in the property, QLT did not \"wrongfully exercise acts of\n\nownership,\" id., and thus, no conversion occurred.                Hence, it is\n\nunnecessary for us to address the district court's analysis of\n\nwhether intangible property, such as patent rights, can be the\n\nsubject of a conversion claim.\n\n            2.   Misrepresentation\n\n            MEEI claims that QLT falsely represented to MEEI that\n\nMEEI would be adequately compensated for its role in the inventions\n\nincluded    in   the   '349   patent.      In    order    to   succeed   on   its\n\nmisrepresentation claims, MEEI must show that QLT did not intend to\n\ncomply with these representations at the time they were made.                 See\n\nDoyle & H.P. Leasing, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 194 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"plaintiffs must allege (1) that the statement was\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fknowingly false; (2) that [defendants] made the false statement\n\nwith the intent to deceive; (3) that the statement was material to\n\nthe plaintiffs' decision . . . ; (4) that the plaintiffs reasonably\n\nrelied on the statement; and (5) that the plaintiffs were injured\n\nas a result of their reliance\") (citations omitted).               Since MEEI\n\ndoes not provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to draw\n\nthis conclusion, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.\n\n            C.     MEEI's Motion to Amend\n\n            \"We review the denial of a motion to amend under Rule\n\n15(a) for an abuse of discretion, and we defer to the district\n\ncourt if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the\n\nrecord.\"    Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (internal quotations omitted).              In the instant case, we\n\ncannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nMEEI's    motion    to   amend   its   complaint    concerning    its   unjust\n\nenrichment claim and to include a claim of promissory estoppel.\n\n            MEEI made its motion to amend more than two years after\n\nfiling the complaint, after the court had entered summary judgment\n\nfor QLT on Counts I-IV of MEEI's complaint and the parties had\n\nfully briefed summary judgment arguments on the remaining four\n\ncounts.     \"Where the motion to amend is filed after the opposing\n\nparty has    timely      moved   for   summary   judgment,   a   plaintiff   is\n\nrequired to show 'substantial and convincing evidence' to justify\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fa belated attempt to amend a complaint.\" Id. (quoting Resolution\n\nTrust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994)).           The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\n\nMEEI has failed to meet its burden of showing \"some valid reason\n\nfor [its] neglect and delay.\"4       Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc., 156 F.3d 49, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). Although the summary judgment motions already\n\nfiled necessarily did not apply to MEEI's newly proposed promissory\n\nestoppel theory, given the undue delay in raising this theory, the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in denying MEEI's motion\n\nto amend.\n\n            D.   Unjust Enrichment\n\n            The district court believed that MEEI's unjust enrichment\n\nclaim \"distill[ed] into a disagreement over the inventorship in the\n\n'349 patent.\"     Based on that premise, the district court reasoned\n\nthat MEEI could not use a Massachusetts unjust enrichment claim to\n\ncircumvent federal patent law, and accordingly, granted summary\n\njudgment to QLT.       We find, however, that the district court\n\n\n\n4\n   MEEI points to Corey v. Look as an instance where this court\nallowed the plaintiff to amend a complaint despite the fact that\nthe \"motion to amend came 15 months after the Authority's motion to\ndismiss.\" 641 F.2d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 1981). In that case, however,\nthe plaintiff sought only to incorporate facts in the complaint\nthat had been discovered from interrogatories. Id. Here, plaintiff\nseeks to add an entirely new legal theory. Furthermore, in Carey,\nwe decided only that it would have been within the district court's\ndiscretion to allow amendment, not, as MEEI's urges here, that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by denying the amendment. Id.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fmisinterpreted MEEI's unjust enrichment claim, and in light of our\n\ninterpretation       of    the    claim,      we   find     summary   judgment\n\ninappropriate.\n\n          While      the   proper      inventorship    of   either    the    '473\n\napplication or the '591 application is indeed a non-negotiable\n\nquestion of federal law, the question of which application to\n\nprosecute was a choice available to the parties.               Under the U.S.\n\npatent scheme, inventors have discretion to articulate the scope of\n\ntheir patent claims.        Donald S. Chisum, 3-8 Chisum on Patents,\n\n§ 8.06[4], at 8-247 (2003) (\"An applicant may present more than one\n\nclaim and is afforded reasonable latitude in varying the scope and\n\nterminology   with    which      he   defines   his   invention.\").         MEEI's\n\noriginal '473 application's primary claim involved three main green\n\nporphyrin-based methods: a \"method to treat conditions of the eye\n\ncharacterized by unwanted neovasculature\" (claim 1); a \"method to\n\ntreat pigmented tumors in the eye\" (claim 10); and a \"method to\n\nobserve the condition of blood vessels in the eye\" (claim 19).                 The\n\nthree methods had much in common: each claim involved administering\n\ngreen porphyrin, which would then localize in the blood vessels in\n\nthe eye; the diagnostic method simply involved observing the\n\nvessels, and the two treatment methods involved irradiating the\n\nneovasculature or tumor with light.             Furthermore, each method had\n\nan associated but separate claim that specified that \"said green\n\nporphyrin is contained in a liposomal preparation\" (claims 7, 16,\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fand 24).     Based on these claims, Murashige explained in March 1994\n\nthat \"QLT does not see itself as a participant in the invention\n\nother than as a supplier of the material BPD.\"\n\n              In   December      1994,   Murashige      suggested    substantially\n\nchanging the scope and inventorship of the '473 application.\n\nFirst, she recommended spinning off the diagnostic method as a\n\nseparate patent which would be \"properly assignable solely to\n\nMEEI.\"      Second, she recommended combining the separately stated\n\nmethods for treatment of neovasculature (claim 1) and treatment of\n\npigmented tumors (claim 10) into a single method.                   The goal was to\n\n\"be able to claim treating conditions of the eye more broadly,\"\n\ni.e., expand the scope of the patent.                    In order to do this,\n\nhowever, it was necessary to \"introduce the limitation of using the\n\ngreen      porphyrin   in    a   liposomal      composition.\"        To    this   end,\n\nMurashige proposed a modified claim 1 that claimed \"administering\n\n. . . green porphyrin in a liposomal composition.\"                    As Murashige\n\nacknowledged, that \"is substantially the same as claim 1 in the\n\noriginal case except that the limitation of using a liposomal\n\ncomposition has been included.\"\n\n              Murashige explained the significance of this proposal.\n\nOn   the    one    hand,    by   broadening     claim    1   \"to   claim    treating\n\nconditions of the eye more broadly,\" the patent, if granted, would\n\nhave \"potentially broader coverage than contemplated [earlier].\"\n\nBut the only way to justify these broad claims was to \"introduce\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fthe   limitation       of   using     the    green   porphyrin      in   a     liposomal\n\ncomposition,\" which, Murashige explained, was \"a liberating device,\n\nallowing us to claim more broadly.\"\n\n            However, this change to claim 1 broadened not just\n\ncoverage    of    potential      eye   treatments,      but       also   the    list   of\n\ninventors.       Murashige explained that \"if we include conditions of\n\nthe eye generally using liposomal compositions, . . . a larger\n\ncircle of inventors would be included both because of this greater\n\nbreadth    and    by   virtue    of    the    necessity      to    supply    the     green\n\nporphyrin in liposomes.             It then appears that the inventorship\n\nwould properly include . . . Julia Levy . . . .\"                     In other words,\n\nthe very aspect of the application that was \"a liberating device,\n\nallowing [the inventors] to claim more broadly\" also happened to be\n\nthe aspect of the revised application that would require adding Dr.\n\nLevy as an inventor.         (Conversely, had liposomal preparations not\n\nbeen claimed at all, arguably the patent would be less valuable,\n\nbut Dr. Levy might not be an inventor.)                      Adding Dr. Levy, of\n\ncourse, would give QLT full co-ownership rights to exploit the\n\npatent.    Thus, QLT presented MEEI with a second viable formulation\n\nof its patent application: it asked MEEI to change the scope of its\n\npatent     application      to      QLT's     benefit   in    exchange         for    fair\n\ncompensation.5\n\n\n5\n  At times, both parties have disputed the inventor status of the\nother party.   QLT has questioned MEEI's exclusive role in the\nclaims listed in the '473 application, and MEEI has challenged\n\n                                            -30-\n\f           MEEI already possessed a valid, and seemingly defensible,\n\npatent application, when QLT sought MEEI's assent to replace the\n\n'473 application with the '591 application.6      QLT acknowledged that\n\nthe patent as MEEI envisioned it (without Levy and her claims)\n\nwould be difficult to challenge on grounds of either obviousness or\n\nnoninventorship. Nevertheless, QLT argued that the patent could be\n\nmade stronger -- in some ways both broader and more defensible --\n\nby changing the scope of the patent and adding the additional\n\ninventors who participated in the new claims.       The addition of QLT\n\ninventor   Dr.   Levy,   however,   would   drastically   reduce   MEEI's\n\npotential profits from the patent.          If MEEI agreed to the '591\n\napplication with the additional inventors, QLT would no longer need\n\na license in order to commercialize the photo-dynamic therapy that\n\nbecame known as Visudyne.       Since QLT already owned the other\n\n\nQLT's participation in the claims added in the '591 application.\nHowever, we find that at this summary judgment stage, the record\ndoes not contradict the listed inventors on either application, and\nwe assume that both applications were valid.\n6\n   The '591 application (later approved as the '349 patent) also\nadded Drs. Schmidt-Erfurth and Hasan of MGH. It is appropriate to\nnote here that, in addition to their primary arguments about\nfederal preemption, the district court and QLT rely on the fact\nthat QLT also purchased a license to MGH's co-ownership rights in\nthe '349 patent. Given this license, QLT points out that it would\nstill have full rights to exploit the patent even if QLT, itself,\nhad not played any role in the inventorship. This argument, though,\nmisses the mark entirely, as it ignores the fact that MGH, like\nQLT, only has rights to the core inventions covered by the original\n'473 patent because MEEI agreed to the later '591 application.\nQLT's redundant licensing scheme with MGH in no way undermines\nMEEI's argument that it consented to proceed with the '591\napplication on based on QLT's assurances of fair compensation.\n\n                                    -31-\n\frequired patent for the necessary BPD, QLT's inclusion in the new\n\n'591   application      enabled    it   to     commercially   exploit    Visudyne\n\nwithout MEEI.     We note that QLT was, of course, well aware that\n\nsecuring co-inventorship would put it in this uniquely lucrative\n\nposition, and it was QLT's attorney, Murashige, who, acting also as\n\npatent counsel to MEEI, spearheaded the effort to convince MEEI to\n\ngo along with the '591 application.\n\n           Not surprisingly, MEEI did not initially agree with this\n\nnew approach proposed by QLT.                Attorney Murashige nevertheless\n\nprepared   the    '591    continuation-in-part           application,    and   MEEI\n\neventually assented after being promised fair compensation for its\n\ncontribution.     Of course, MEEI and QLT never came to an agreement\n\non the critical compensation figures, and it is for that reason\n\nthat we have affirmed summary judgment for QLT on MEEI's contract\n\nclaims.    This inadequate meeting of the minds does not, however,\n\ncall for summary judgment in the context of unjust enrichment.                   A\n\nclaim of unjust enrichment is appropriate \"where an agreement is\n\ntoo indefinite to be enforced . . . [or] where no contract is made\n\nbecause    each    of    the      parties      had   a    materially    different\n\nunderstanding of the terms.\"            1-1 Corbin on Contracts, § 1.20(b)\n\n(2004).    Unjust enrichment provides an equitable stopgap for\n\noccasional inadequacies in contractual remedies at law by mandating\n\nthat \"[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of\n\nanother is required to make restitution to the other.\"                  Fox v. F &\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fJ Gattozzi Corp., 672 N.E.2d 547, 552 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996)\n\n(quoting Restatement of Restitution § 1 (1937)).                Although QLT's\n\ncontinued   reassurances    that   it   would     pay   MEEI    royalty   rates\n\n\"consistent with industry standards\" were not specific enough to\n\nsupport MEEI's contract claims, they form a key component of MEEI's\n\nunjust enrichment claim and present a triable issue of fact.7\n\n            Furthermore, this analysis of MEEI's unjust enrichment\n\nclaim illustrates why it was not preempted by federal patent law.\n\nMEEI's claim is not that Dr. Levy was not a proper inventor of the\n\n'349 patent, but rather that QLT induced MEEI to agree to the\n\nchange in scope of the claims, and then unjustly profited from that\n\nchange by denying fair compensation.              In these circumstances,\n\nconflict    preemption,    not   the    broader     field      preemption,   is\n\nappropriate. See Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, 153 F.3d\n\n\n7\n   QLT argues that MEEI did not give up anything by agreeing to the\n'591 application. It contends that MEEI retained the right to file\na continuation application in its own behalf under 35 U.S.C. § 120,\nand in fact did exactly that by \"secretly\" filing continuation\napplications that claimed the full range of treatment methods as\nMEEI's sole invention. We need not address this issue because a\nclaim seeking restitution for unjust enrichment does not require\nconsideration. In Massachusetts, the elements of such a claim are\n\"'unjust enrichment of one party and unjust detriment to the other\nparty.'\" Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 906 F.2d 11, 15\n(1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Salamon v. Terra, 477 N.E.2d 1029, 1031\n(Mass. 1985)).     Thus, MEEI need only establish that QLT was\nunjustly enriched, and that MEEI suffered an unjust detriment.\nMEEI argues that, as a result of QLT's unjust conduct during\nnegotiations and/or patent prosecution, MEEI has received no\nroyalties at all, and, by not having to pay those royalties, QLT\nhas retained large sums that it would have had to forego if it had\nnot committed that allegedly unjust conduct. If so, the elements\nof a quasi-contract claim might be established.\n\n                                   -33-\n\f1318, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 1998).                 Under the conflict preemption\n\nstandard, if the tort action is based on conduct that is not\n\n\"protected or governed by federal patent law,\" then \"the remedy is\n\nnot preempted.\"       Id. at 1335; compare Univ. of Colo. Found., Inc.\n\nv.   Am.   Cyanamid    Co.,       196   F.3d    1366,   1372    (Fed.    Cir.    1999)\n\n(independent    state       law   inventorship     standards         frustrate   basic\n\nobjectives of patent law and thus entire field of inventorship is\n\npreempted) with       id. at 1373-74 (unjust enrichment claim preempted\n\nonly because it \"hinge[d]\" on a determination of inventorship).\n\n            QLT argues that MEEI's claims are preempted by 35 U.S.C.\n\n§ 262, which reads: \"In the absence of any agreement to the\n\ncontrary, each of the joint owners of a patent may make, use, offer\n\nto sell, or sell the patented invention within the United States,\n\nor import the patented invention into the United States, without\n\nthe consent    of     and    without     accounting     to     the    other   owners.\"\n\n(Emphasis added).       QLT contends that § 262 creates a federal right\n\nto practice an invention without fear of suit by co-inventors,\n\npreempts state      law     claims      between   co-owners      on    the    basis   of\n\nanything    other     than    a    written      contract,      and/or    effectively\n\nrepresents a Congressional determination that any asserted wrong by\n\none co-inventor against another is not \"unjust\" unless it violates\n\nsuch a contract.\n\n            We recognize that the preemption issue here is close. It\n\nis true that allowing MEEI's claim to proceed would, to some\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fextent, impinge upon QLT's rights as a co-inventor.                    However, the\n\nstatute itself admits of an exception to those rights when there is\n\n\"any agreement to the contrary.\"        QLT suggests that this exception\n\nonly   applies   where    there   is    a       written,    legally     enforceable\n\ncontract.     But § 262 says no such thing.                Congress knew how to\n\ninsist upon a contract, and even how to specify that it must be\n\nreduced to writing.        Cf. 35 U.S.C. § 261 (holding that patent\n\nrights are    \"assignable    in   law   by       an     instrument    in     writing\")\n\n(emphasis    added).      However,          §    262    simply     speaks     of   \"any\n\nagreement.\"      MEEI has provided evidence of an agreement with QLT\n\nin which QLT promised to \"negotiate in good faith with MEEI . . .\n\nto come to an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which\n\nwill   be   consistent     with   industry             standards     under     similar\n\ncircumstances.\"        We have held, supra Part III.A.1, that this\n\nagreement was not enforceable as a contract, because the terms are\n\ntoo indefinite.    However, if the fact-finder determines that there\n\nwas such an agreement, it might still qualify as an \"agreement\"\n\nunder § 262, and therefore form the basis for equitable relief on\n\na theory of unjust enrichment without presenting any conflict with\n\nthe allegedly preempting statute.\n\n            We also note that, while there is no direct precedent\n\nconcerning preemption under § 262, we may draw analogies from other\n\nsituations where patent law preemption has been alleged.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\f             First, there is precedent suggesting that a state law\n\naction alleging that the defendant secretly filed and received a\n\npatent for the plaintiff' invention, and requesting monetary or\n\nequitable relief but not a change to the patent itself, is not\n\npreempted.     See   Becher v. Contoure Labs., 279 U.S. 388 (1929)\n\n(Holmes, J.);8 Burns v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 394 F.2d 416 (1st\n\nCir. 1968) (Aldrich, C.J.);9 Laning v. Nat'l Ribbon & Carbon Paper\n\n\n8\n   In Becher, an inventor employed Becher as a machinist to help\nwork on his invention, under a confidentiality agreement. Becher\nsecretly applied for and received a patent for the invention. The\ninventor sued in state court for breach of contract and other state\ntheories, and the state court ordered a constructive trust on the\npatent rights, i.e., ordered Becher to assign the rights to the\ninventor. Becher sued in federal court to enjoin the inventor from\nfurther state court proceedings on the grounds of patent\npreemption. Justice Holmes held that the inventor's claims were\nnot preempted:\n\n     [The inventor]'s right was independent of and prior to\n     any arising out of the patent law, and it seems a strange\n     suggestion that the assertion of that right can be\n     removed from the cognizance of the tribunals established\n     to protect it by its opponent going into the patent\n     office for a later title. It is said that to establish\n     [the inventor]'s claim is to invalidate Becher's patent.\n     But, even if mistakenly, the attempt was not to\n     invalidate that patent but to get an assignment of it,\n     and an assignment was decreed. Suits against one who has\n     received a patent of land to make him a trustee for the\n     plaintiff on the ground of some paramount equity are well\n     known.\n\n279 U.S. at 391.\n9\n   In Burns, the plaintiff had been negotiating with a federal\nagency regarding some unpatented inventions. The government asked\nMIT to evaluate his ideas, and Burns turned over secrets to MIT\npursuant to a confidentiality agreement. MIT gave the government\nan unfavorable report on his ideas, but then secretly developed and\npatented them.   Burns sued for state law breach of trust.

Id. at 1-2. The complaint sought damages, not correction\nof inventorship or invalidation of the patent. Defendants argued\nthat the complaint was preempted by patent law and sought to remove\nto federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.\nThe court held that, since the plaintiff never obtained a patent\nfor the technology he claims that he invented, he therefore was not\nseeking to enjoin a defendant from infringing on his patent, but\nrather seeking damages for common law torts. It remanded the case\nfor want of federal jurisdiction. Id. at 2.\n11\n    In Zemba, plaintiff and Rodgers separately invented the same\nproduct, then decided to jointly apply for a patent.       A patent\nattorney was consulted. Rodgers and the attorney then allegedly\nconspired to process the patent application without plaintiff, and\nto represent Rodgers as the sole inventor.         See id. at 96.\n\"Rodgers falsely and fraudulently told plaintiff that the invention\nwas unpatentable, that an application would be rejected, and that\nhe had doubt as to whether the patent application would be\npursued.\" Id. With the help of the patent attorney, Rodgers filed\nand received the patent. Plaintiff sued in state court for fraud\nand various other state law theories. Defendants argued that the\nclaims were preempted by patent law and subject to exclusive\nfederal jurisdiction. See id. at 97-98. The court rejected the\nclaim of preemption, explaining:\n\n     [The complaint] depends on principles of common law and\n     equity governing fraud and disparagement, and plaintiff's\n     rights are dependent upon such principles. Plaintiff has\n     not sought a declaratory judgment to void the patent on\n     the federal grounds of non-invention. Nor has he based\n\n                               -37-\n\fJuris 2d Patents § 315 (\"[I]n the absence of any agreement to the\n\ncontrary, each of the joint owners of a patent may make, use, offer\n\nto sell, or sell the patented invention . . . unless such profits\n\naccrue after a joint owner has procured an assignment of his\n\ncoowner's    interest   to     himself    by   fraud.\")   (emphasis    added)\n\n(footnotes omitted) (citing Zemba).\n\n            Here, the allegation is that the defendant manipulated\n\nthe plaintiff into agreeing to change the scope of the patent so as\n\nto include contributions made by the defendant.               MEEI has not\n\nprovided    evidence    that    QLT's     alleged   conduct   was     actually\n\nfraudulent.    However, arguably, the case for preemption here is\n\nweaker than in the cited cases.          In the cited cases, the plaintiff\n\nstruck at the heart of inventorship by arguing (essentially) that\n\nthe patent was applied for fraudulently and never should have\n\nissued.     Here, the plaintiff argues that the defendant induced\n\nplaintiff to agree to a certain scope of invention in exchange for\n\ncompensation, and then provided none.\n\n\n\n\n     his claim for disparagement on the invalidity             of the\n     patent. Instead, plaintiff claims ownership                of an\n     interest in the patent, and demands an assignment         of that\n     interest and damages resulting from slander               of his\n     ownership.\n\n210 A.2d at 98 (internal citations omitted).\n\n                                    -38-\n\f           We also draw an analogy from the doctrine of inequitable\n\nconduct before the Patent and Trademarks Office (PTO).12              Courts\n\nhave distinguished state claims alleging bad faith misconduct by\n\nthe applicant against the PTO -- which are preempted -- from state\n\nclaims alleging bad faith misconduct occurring subsequently in the\n\nmarketplace -- which are not.       See, e.g., Methode Elecs. Inc. v.\n\nHewlett-Packard Co., 55 U.S.P.Q.2d 1602, 1604-05 (N.D. Cal. 2000)\n\n(finding   that   an   unjust   enrichment   claim   alleging   bad   faith\n\nmisconduct by the applicant against the PTO was preempted because\n\nits \"fundamental premise\" was incorrect inventorship, but making\n\nthe distinction described above, and emphasizing that \"the focal\n\npoint of the [instant case] is Methode's conduct before the PTO and\n\nnot . . . conduct subsequent to the PTO proceedings.\").         The reason\n\nfor this distinction is instructive: claims of inequitable conduct\n\nbefore the PTO are preempted because \"PTO procedures themselves\n\nprovided a remedy for [an applicant]'s malfeasance. An additional\n\nstate action would be an inappropriate collateral intrusion on the\n\nregulatory procedures of the PTO, 'under the guise of a complaint\n\nsounding in tort' . . . and is contrary to Congress' preemptive\n\nregulation in the area of patent law.\"         Abbott Labs. v. Brennan,\n\n\n\n12\n    \"Applicants for patents are required to prosecute patent\napplications in the PTO with candor, good faith, and honesty.\"\nMolins PLC v. Textron, Inc., 48 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir. 1995).\n\"A breach of this duty constitutes inequitable conduct.\" Id. If\nthe conduct was sufficiently culpable, a court may declare the\npatent to be unenforceable. Id.\n\n                                   -39-\n\f952 F.2d 1346, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal citations omitted).\n\nIn other words, state claims alleging misconduct before the PTO are\n\npreempted because federal law contains a specific remedy for just\n\nsuch misconduct.        Even then, not all state claims that implicate\n\nthe issue of inequitable conduct before the PTO are preempted. See\n\nDow Chem. Co. v. Exxon Corp., 139 F.3d 1470, 1471 (Fed. Cir. 1998)\n\n(state law tort claim for intentional interference with contractual\n\nrelations that implicates patent law issue of inequitable conduct\n\nbefore PTO is not preempted by federal patent law, even if it\n\nrequires state court to adjudicate question of federal patent law,\n\nprovided state law cause of action includes additional elements not\n\nfound   in    federal    patent    law   cause   of   action   and   is   not\n\nimpermissible attempt to offer patent-like protection to subject\n\nmatter addressed by federal law).\n\n             Again, this precedent is not directly on point.              The\n\ndistinction cited above is between state claims alleging misconduct\n\nby an applicant against the PTO (which are usually, if not always,\n\npreempted), and claims alleging misconduct between parties after\n\nthe patent has issued.            Here, the claim is misconduct by an\n\napplicant    against     a   co-applicant   before    the   application   is\n\ncompleted.     But      misconduct between parties before the patent\n\nissues is more analogous to misconduct between parties after the\n\npatent issues than it is to misconduct by a party against the PTO.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\f            Finally, we note that QLT's position, while it has the\n\nadvantage of creating an easily manageable bright-line rule, could\n\nlead to injustices that Congress did not intend.              Purely as a\n\nhypothetical, imagine a case where the evidence clearly showed that\n\nthe defendant deceived and manipulated a naive inventor into\n\nmodifying the scope of the inventor's application (within the range\n\nof properly patentable applications) so as to force the inclusion\n\nof the defendant as a co-inventor.          Further suppose that the\n\ndefendant    deflected   all   requests   for   a   legally   enforceable\n\nlicensing contract with empty assurances of future agreements which\n\nit never intended to fulfill.       We cannot imagine that Congress\n\nintended, simply by enacting the phrase \"[i]n the absence of any\n\nagreement to the contrary,\" to preclude the inventor-plaintiff from\n\nestablishing such an agreement within the framework of an equitable\n\ncause of action under state law.     Conflict preemption applies only\n\nwhen \"there is such a direct conflict between . . . the patent code\n\nand . . . [state] law that compliance with both the patent law and\n\nstate law is a 'physical impossibility,' or . . . the state law\n\n'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\n\nfull purposes and objectives of Congress' in enacting\" the federal\n\nstatute. Cover v. Hydramatic Packing Co., 83 F.3d 1390, 1393 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1996) (quoting Gade v. Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n, 505\n\nU.S. 88, 98 (1992)).     We do not find such a \"direct conflict\" here,\n\nand while the present case differs from the hypothetical, the\n\n\n                                  -41-\n\fdifferences      lie     in   the   facts    and     equities,       not   the   law    of\n\npreemption.\n\n            For all these reasons, MEEI's unjust enrichment claim is\n\nnot preempted.\n\n            We also find that MEEI's unjust enrichment claim should\n\nsurvive summary judgment based on the allegations of QLT's misuse\n\nof   confidential        information.         Under    Massachusetts        law,   \"[a]\n\nconstructive trust is . . . imposed to avoid the unjust enrichment\n\nof one party at the expense of the other where 'information\n\nconfidentially given or acquired was used to the advantage of the\n\nrecipient     at    the       expense   of     the     one     who     disclosed       the\n\ninformation.'\" Mass Cash Register, Inc. v. Comtrex Sys. Corp., 901\n\nF. Supp. 404, 423 (D. Mass. 1995) (quoting John Alden Transp. Co.\n\nv. Arnold Bloom, 415 N.E.2d 250, 250 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981)).                           The\n\nfacts underlying this theory will be laid out in the course of our\n\nsubsequent trade secret claim analysis.13\n\n            E.     Trade Secret and Unfair Trade Practices Claims\n\n            The right to control how research is used and who is\n\nprivy to trade secrets is crucial to protecting the economic\n\ninterests of non-profit research institutions like MEEI, just as it\n\nis essential to for-profit businesses.                     Without the ability to\n\nguard   their      own    data,     there    would    be     fewer    incentives       for\n\n\n13\n   Although MEEI cannot recover twice for the same conduct, MEEI\nshould have the opportunity to prove the distinct elements of its\nunjust enrichment and trade secret claims.\n\n                                        -42-\n\finstitutions like MEEI to engage in this type of cutting-edge\n\nresearch.    The allegations before this court are that QLT was\n\nentrusted with the result of MEEI's research and breached that\n\ntrust, primarily by sharing information with its partner CIBA\n\nVision without authorization from MEEI.     We now consider whether\n\nthe district court correctly found that these claims were brought\n\nby MEEI after the statute of limitations had already run.\n\n            1.   Misappropriation of Trade Secrets\n\n            MEEI claims that QLT misappropriated its trade secrets\n\nwithout MEEI's knowledge, in particular, by disclosing certain\n\nresearch results to QLT's eventual partner, CIBA Vision.       MEEI\n\nargues that the district court erred in concluding that MEEI's\n\ntrade secret claim was time barred by the three-year statute of\n\nlimitations for tort actions because, under Massachusetts law, the\n\nstatute should have been tolled.\n\n            Massachusetts law establishes two avenues by which the\n\nthree-year statute of limitations that would ordinarily apply to\n\nMEEI's trade secret claims can be tolled. The Massachusetts common\n\nlaw \"discovery rule\" provides that the statute of limitations is\n\ntolled \"until a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should have known,\n\nthat it has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant's\n\nconduct.\"   Taygeta Corp. v. Varian Assocs., Inc., 763 N.E.2d 1053,\n\n1063 (Mass. 2002).     \"The appropriate standard to be applied when\n\nassessing knowledge or notice is that of a 'reasonable person in\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fthe plaintiff's position.'\"       Id. (citing Riley v. Presnell, 565\n\nN.E.2d   780,   785   (Mass.   1991)).    Thus,   under   Massachusetts'\n\ndiscovery rule, the question before the district court was when\n\nMEEI actually knew or should have known of QLT's misappropriations\n\nof its trade secrets.\n\n           Massachusetts statutory law also grants a reprieve from\n\nthe statute of limitations when a potential defendant fraudulently\n\nconceals the basis for a cause of action:\n\n           If a person liable to a personal action\n           fraudulently conceals the cause of such action\n           from the knowledge of the person entitled to\n           bring it, the period prior to the discovery of\n           his cause of action by the person so entitled\n           shall be excluded in determining the time\n           limited for the commencement of the action.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 12 (2004).      Under this law, the statute\n\nof limitations \"will be tolled if the wrongdoer either concealed\n\nthe existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act\n\ndone with intent to deceive or breached a fiduciary duty of full\n\ndisclosure.\"    Stark v. Advanced Magnetics, Inc., 736 N.E.2d 434,\n\n442 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000) (quotations and citations omitted). \"The\n\nstatute of limitations, however, is not tolled if the plaintiff has\n\nactual knowledge of the facts giving rise to his cause of action.\"\n\nId.\n\n           The district court made short work of MEEI's trade\n\nsecrets claims by finding that MEEI had actual knowledge of its\n\nclaims more than three years before bringing this suit on April 24,\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f2000.   Since    the   district   court    concluded   that   there   were\n\nsufficient facts to prove MEEI's knowledge of its claims, it did\n\nnot need to go any further in analyzing the tolling of the trade\n\nsecret claims under either the common law discovery rule or the\n\nfraudulent concealment statute.          However, we must evaluate the\n\ndistrict court's factual conclusions to determine whether they\n\nsupported summary judgment.\n\n          a.    Review of District Court Summary Judgment Decision\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       Since\n\ngenuine issues of material fact remain concerning MEEI's knowledge\n\nof QLT's misappropriations of its trade secrets -- facts that could\n\nbring MEEI's claims within the statute of limitations -- we find\n\nthat the court erred in granting summary judgment on MEEI's trade\n\nsecret claims.\n\n          \"Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is plenary, and we read the record in the light most\n\namicable to the party contesting summary judgment.\"            Cambridge\n\nPlating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 991 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(reversing the district court grant of summary judgment because\n\nmaterial facts remained at issue where plaintiff knew it had been\n\n\n                                  -45-\n\fharmed, but could not attribute it with certainty to defendant's\n\nactions).     Considered in the light most favorable to MEEI, neither\n\nthe facts singled out by the district court, nor the record as a\n\nwhole, suffice to support the district court's conclusion that MEEI\n\nhad knowledge of trade secret misappropriations.             The district\n\ncourt based its conclusion on, inter alia, MEEI's awareness of\n\nQLT's partnership with CIBA Vision, Dr. Miller's statements that\n\nshe was concerned about the confidentiality of her work, and\n\nDr. Miller's learning from CIBA Vision that some of her data had\n\nbeen shared without her permission.        However, it is not enough to\n\nshow that Dr. Miller was suspicious about what QLT might have\n\ndisclosed. \"Suspicion and knowledge are poles apart on a continuum\n\nof understanding,\" and \"the [Massachusetts fraudulent concealment]\n\nstatute itself uses the unqualified word 'knowledge' in setting\n\nforth   the    prescribed   state    of    a   plaintiff's   perception.\"\n\nTracerlab, Inc. v. Indus. Nucleonics Corp., 313 F.2d         97, 102 (1st\n\nCir. 1963).      We will address the question of MEEI's admitted\n\nknowledge of some disclosures below.\n\n            The district court seems to have given little weight to\n\nMEEI's claims that QLT repeatedly reassured Miller that it was not\n\ndisclosing any confidential information.           Rather, the district\n\ncourt found that in a 1996 letter to QLT, MEEI indicated that it\n\n\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\fwas already aware of its trade secrets cause of action.14                       The\n\nletter stated in part, \"[w]e believe that you may have already\n\nentered into an agreement with a third party using, in part,\n\ntechnology that was developed here at the Infirmary.                     If that is\n\nuntrue, please so advise us.\"            Tracerlab, 313 F.2d at 102.            QLT\n\nnever   responded   to    the    letter.        In   our   view,    this     letter\n\ndemonstrates    only     that     MEEI    was    aware     of    QLT's     business\n\nrelationship with CIBA Vision and about the potential for trade\n\nsecret misappropriation existing in that relationship.                   The letter\n\nmakes no precise accusations and gives no indication that MEEI was\n\naware of particular instances of misappropriation.\n\n           b.   Applying Massachusetts Tolling Law\n\n           We have held that \"the Massachusetts court does not\n\nequate suspicion with knowledge, but is explicit in requiring\n\nactual knowledge, or, as an equivalent, full means of detecting the\n\nfraud.\"    Id. (internal quotation omitted).               The district court\n\nrejected MEEI's reliance on Tracerlab, because it found that the\n\n1992 letter, among other evidence, showed that MEEI actually\n\nbelieved   it    had      a     cause    of     action     for     trade     secret\n\nmisappropriation.        The district court believed that plaintiffs\n\n\n\n14\n     The district court also placed weight on the deposition\ntestimony of MEEI's witness Lisa Petukian that Miller had said that\nsome of her data had been shared with CIBA Vision. However, from\nthis testimony, we do not know whether Miller knew anything about\nthe scope of the misappropriations or whether they were more than\nisolated events.\n\n                                        -47-\n\fclearly had more knowledge of QLT's misappropriations than the\n\nplaintiffs    had   in   Tracerlab,      where     the    court   found    that    the\n\nplaintiff's belief was based on \"gossamer threads of speculation,\n\nsuspicion and surmise.\"          Id. at 100.\n\n            However, we find Tracerlab instructive. As in this case,\n\nthe plaintiffs in Tracerlab knew that the defendants possessed the\n\ntrade secrets in question.          Id. at 99 (\"There is no question but\n\nthat [the     plaintiff]    was    aware    from    the    beginning      that    [the\n\ndefendants] knew plaintiff's trade secrets\" because they were\n\nformer employees of the plaintiff.) Furthermore, in Tracerlab, the\n\ncourt found that the plaintiff was \"well aware from the very outset\n\nthat [the defendants] had gone into the [same] field and were\n\nproducing a competitive product.\"              Id. at 100.        Still, in that\n\ncase, we found that \"all of this is a far different thing from\n\nhaving knowledge that the defendant had misappropriated and was\n\nusing the self-same . . .           trade secrets . . . underl[ying] the\n\npresent cause of action.\"         Id.   Moreover, unlike most trade secret\n\ncases, during much of the time in question in this case, use of\n\nMEEI's trade secrets by data recipients like CIBA Vision would\n\nstill have remained behind closed doors, as product development was\n\nnot yet complete.        Therefore, MEEI was even less likely to become\n\naware of any unauthorized disclosures.\n\n             \"Although the Massachusetts legislature has set statutory\n\nlimitations    periods     for    various      causes     of   action[,]    .     .   .\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\fdetermining when claims accrue 'has long been the product of\n\njudicial interpretation.'\" Cambridge Plating Co., 991 F.2d at 25\n\n(quoting   Franklin   v.   Albert,   411   N.E.2d   458   (Mass.   1980)).\n\n\"Massachusetts courts have recognized that it would be unfair to\n\nbegin running the statute of limitations before a plaintiff is put\n\non notice that she has a claim.\"     Id. (citing Bowen v. Eli Lilly &\n\nCo., 557 N.E.2d 739 (Mass. 1990)).\n\n           Although it is true that \"[t]he plaintiff need not know\n\nthe full extent of the injury before the statute starts to run,\"\n\nBowen, 557 N.E.2d at 741 (emphasis added), the district court\n\nincorrectly expanded this principle to find that MEEI need not know\n\n\"the full extent of its claim.\"      Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT\n\nPhototherapeutics, Inc., No. 00-10783, at 12 (D. Mass. Apr. 23,\n\n2002) (sealed memorandum in support of summary judgment).          This is\n\nnot a case in which MEEI claims only that it did not know how much\n\nit had been harmed; rather, MEEI claims that it did not know that\n\nit had been harmed at all.\n\n           c.   MEEI's Awareness of Some of QLT's Misappropriations\n\n           In order for the statute of limitations to start to run,\n\n\"an event or events [must] have occurred that are reasonably likely\n\nto have put the plaintiff on notice that he has been harmed.\"\n\nStark, 736 N.E.2d at 442 (citing Bowen, 557 N.E.2d at 741).          We do\n\nnot believe that in a complex case of this nature -- where trade\n\nsecrets of varying importance are alleged to have been divulged\n\n\n                                 -49-\n\fover a period of years -- that notice of one misappropriation can\n\nconstitute sufficient notice to begin tolling the statute for all\n\nmisappropriations. Although we are not prepared to state a general\n\nrule, in a case such as this one, a wronged party should not be\n\nprejudiced with regards to later torts committed against it, simply\n\nbecause a defendant started the clock running by committing similar\n\nacts at an earlier time. Statutes of limitations provide necessary\n\nclosure    and   fairness   for    potential        defendants.      However,   a\n\nplaintiff must be able to decide when the harms it has sustained\n\nrequire bringing suit, and no defendant should be able to immunize\n\nitself from later, potentially graver claims, by openly engaging in\n\nprior, similar offenses that the future plaintiff does not believe\n\nwarrant bringing suit.\n\n            MEEI has not denied knowledge of some of QLT's alleged\n\ntrade secrets misappropriations.              The record does not, however,\n\nindicate   that   MEEI    knew    of   all,    or    substantially    all,   such\n\nmisappropriations.       Furthermore, MEEI's claims are strengthened by\n\nthe existence of the Confidentiality Agreement and QLT's repeated\n\nassurances that its trade secrets were not being disclosed.                     To\n\nassume that MEEI knew the full extent of disclosure to CIBA Vision\n\nwould be to assume that MEEI was already aware that it was on the\n\nverge of being cut out of any future profits from the newly\n\ndeveloped photodynamic therapy. Though this may be the case, we do\n\n\n\n\n                                       -50-\n\fnot believe that such a factual judgment can be made at the summary\n\njudgment stage.\n\n           QLT points out that MEEI does not claim that it gained\n\nany additional knowledge in the years prior to filing suit in 2000,\n\nand thus MEEI could just as easily have filed suit more than three\n\nyears prior.     However, this fact alone is not sufficient to show\n\nthat MEEI should have filed suit earlier.          Because of the nature of\n\nthe claim, it is possible that some of MEEI's trade secret claims\n\nwere only shots in the dark at the time MEEI filed its complaint,\n\nand that MEEI only learned of the facts substantiating some of its\n\nclaim   after    receiving      discovery.     Although   the    fact   that   a\n\nplaintiff files suit is usually strong evidence that he knows the\n\nfacts underlying each of his own claims, filing suit does not\n\nprove, in itself, that he has sufficient knowledge to prevent\n\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\n\n           d.    Fraudulent Concealment or Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n           Since the district court found that MEEI had actual\n\nknowledge of QLT's alleged misappropriations, it did not need to\n\nreach   the     question   of     whether    QLT   actively     concealed   its\n\ndisclosures of MEEI's trade secrets.           Having found that the issue\n\nof MEEI's knowledge of its trade secret claims was not properly\n\ndecided on summary judgment, we believe that MEEI's claims based on\n\nfraudulent concealment should also survive summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\f              Where a \"defendant[] 'made representations [he] knew or\n\nshould have known would induce the plaintiff to put off bringing\n\nsuit and . . . the plaintiff did in fact delay in reliance on the\n\nrepresentations,'\" the statute of limitations is tolled.            Olsen v.\n\nBell Tel. Labs., Inc., 445 N.E.2d 609, 612 (Mass. 1983) (quoting\n\nWhite v. Peabody Constr. Co., 434 N.E.2d 1015, 1023 (Mass. 1982)).\n\nQLT does not dispute that MEEI may have been assured by QLT that\n\ncertain trade secrets were not disclosed. Furthermore, considering\n\nthe evidence that QLT continued licensing negotiations at least in\n\npart because it feared suit by MEEI, it is reasonable at this\n\nsummary judgment stage to assume that QLT's purpose in making\n\nassurances to MEEI could have been to delay a suit that would\n\ninclude trade secret claims.\n\n              In addition, MEEI's claim that QLT owed fiduciary duties\n\nto MEEI has some persuasive force.           Fiduciary duties exist \"when a\n\nparty to a contract expressly repose[s] a trust or confidence in\n\nthe   other    party\"   or   \"where   the    contract   or   transaction   was\n\nintrinsically     fiduciary    and,   therefore,    required    perfect    good\n\nfaith.\" 26 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts, § 69:23 (4th\n\ned. 2004).      By entering into their joint research relationship,\n\nMEEI and QLT each put their valuable trade secrets in the others'\n\nhands, arguably requiring full disclosure of any misappropriation\n\nof those secrets.       Furthermore, in Massachusetts, if a defendant\n\nfails to learn of a trade secret violation due to a fiduciary's\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\ffailure to disclose, then plaintiffs do not have a duty to exercise\n\ndue diligence.   Puritan Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Cashman, 596 N.E.2d\n\n1004, 1010, n.9 (Mass. 1992).     \"Once fraudulent concealment is\n\nestablished, the limitations period is tolled until plaintiffs\n\nactually become aware of the operative facts.    Mere suspicion of\n\nfraud is insufficient to end the tolling period.\" Compagnie de\n\nReassurance d'Ile de France v. New Eng. Reins. Corp., 944 F. Supp.\n\n986, 995 (D. Mass. 1996) (citing Tracerlab, 313 F.2d at 102).\n\nThus, if QLT owes a duty of disclosure, then QLT will be forced to\n\nprove that MEEI had actual knowledge of all of QLT's alleged\n\nmisappropriations in order to prevent tolling of the statute.\n\n          e.   MEEI's Late Addition of Trade Secret Claims\n\n          MEEI provided no credible explanation for its delayed\n\nattempt to amend its complaint, and thus, we cannot say that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in refusing to allow MEEI to\n\nassert additional claims based on QLT's alleged disclosure of the\n\nresults of the Preclinical Bolus Study and its visual acuity data.\n\nSee, Torres-Ríos v. LPS Labs., Inc., 152 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); Hayes v. New Eng. Millwork Distribs., 602 F.2d 15, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1979).\n\n          2.   Unfair Trade Practices\n\n          The district court held that its \"previous rulings on\n\nContract and Trade Secret Claims,\" as well as MEEI's other claims,\n\n\"indicate there is no basis, on these facts, for a 93A claim.\"\n\n\n                                -53-\n\fMass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., No. 00-\n\n10783, at 21 (D. Mass. Sep. 23, 2002) (sealed memorandum in support\n\nof summary judgment).       Having remanded the unjust enrichment and\n\ntrade secret     claims,    we   also   remand   MEEI's   93A   unfair   trade\n\npractices claims, noting that the success of the unfair trade\n\npractices claims is not necessarily dependent on the success of the\n\nunjust enrichment or trade secret claims.\n\n          Massachusetts General Law ch. 93A, § 2 provides that\n\n\"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\n\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" are unlawful.\n\nMass. Gen. Law ch. 93A, § 2.            In determining whether a practice\n\nviolates Chapter 93A, we look to \"(1) whether the practice . . . is\n\nwithin at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or\n\nother established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral,\n\nunethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; [and] (3) whether it causes\n\nsubstantial    injury      to    consumers   (or   competitors     or    other\n\nbusinessmen).\"     PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 321\n\nN.E.2d 915, 917 (Mass. 1975) (quotations omitted). We believe that\n\nthe same allegations underlying MEEI's unjust enrichment claim\n\ncould potentially meet these requirements. Moreover, MEEI alleges\n\nthat QLT's trade secret misappropriations played an integral part\n\nin cutting MEEI out of its fair share of the ample profit from the\n\nsale of Visudyne.    From the record developed thus far, this court\n\nsees no reason why these allegations and possibly others could not\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\fmeet all three of the 93A factors.        Under Massachusetts law,\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets alone can constitute a violation\n\nof Chapter 93A.   See, e.g., Jillian's Billiard Club of Am., Inc. v.\n\nBeloff Billiards, Inc., 619 N.E.2d 635 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993).\n\nThus, we remand MEEI's unfair trade practices claim along with its\n\nunjust enrichment and trade secret claims.\n\n                          IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.\n\n          Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. No\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\f",

The noble pursuit of curative\n\ntechnologies birthed Visudyne, a drug that treats the leading cause\n\nof vision loss in people over age fifty.              That success involved the\n\nefforts   of      multiple       institutions,     and    the   common      drive      for\n\nfinancial returns now brings us a dispute over rights to the income\n\nstream of the fastest growing ophthalmic drug in history.\n\n             The entire range of claims articulated by plaintiff-\n\nappellant was dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.\n\nThe bulk of the opinion that follows consists of our de novo review\n\nof these dismissals.             We must also address defendant-appellee's\n\ncross-appeal of several discovery-related rulings.                         Following a\n\nreview of the factual background, considered in the light most\n\nfavorable to the appellant, we will begin our analysis.\n\n                             I.    Factual Background\n\n             A.    Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n\n             Age-related         macular   degeneration     (AMD)     is    an    ocular\n\ndisease that is the predominant cause of vision loss in people over\n\nage fifty.     The illness takes two forms: \"wet\" and \"dry.\"                     The wet\n\nform, though only accounting for ten percent of the cases of age-\n\nrelated macular degeneration, leads to the debilitating condition\n\nknown as choroidal neovascularization (\"CNV\" or \"neovasculature\"),\n\nresponsible       for   ninety     percent   of   cases    of   AMD   vision          loss.\n\nNeovasculature          refers     to   conditions       characterized           by     the\n\nproliferation of unwanted blood vessels.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f            In 1989, several researchers at Massachusetts General\n\nHospital's (\"MGH\") Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine began\n\ninvestigating the use of photosensitive drugs to treat eye diseases\n\nsuch as AMD involving neovasculature.              In March 1991, the MGH\n\nresearchers      met   with    Dr.     Julia     Levy     of     appellee    QLT\n\nPhototherapeutic (\"QLT\") to discuss the possibility of utilizing\n\nbenzoporphin derivatives (\"BPD\" or \"derivatives\") developed by QLT\n\nfor the treatment of AMD.         Levy agreed to provide MGH the BPD\n\nneeded for research trials.\n\n            The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (\"MEEI\" or \"the\n\nInfirmary\"), a medical institution located next to, but distinct\n\nfrom, MGH, also sought out QLT's BPD for photodynamic therapy\n\nresearch.    Dr. Joan Miller joined the Infirmary in the fall of 1991\n\nand soon proposed conducting studies using BPD on monkeys.                    In\n\nMarch 1992, Miller applied to MEEI to investigate the use of BPD to\n\ntreat neovasculature.       Pursuant to Dr. Miller's application, MEEI\n\nand QLT signed a material transfer agreement (\"MTA\") in which MEEI\n\nwould receive BPD at no cost in exchange for providing QLT the\n\nresults     of   Miller's   pre-clinical       studies    for    use   in   QLT's\n\nregulatory filings and patent disclosures.\n\n             In September 1992, following their successful monkey\n\ntrials,   which    demonstrated      the   potential     use    of   photodynamic\n\ntherapy with BPD, Dr. Miller and her MEEI colleague, Dr. Gragoudas,\n\npresented their data confidentially to QLT representatives visiting\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fBoston.    Within the next two years, MEEI and QLT entered into two\n\nmore material transfer agreements of similar tenor.\n\n            B.    Confidential Disclosure Agreement\n\n            QLT    had    interest       in    commercial      applications   of   the\n\nInfirmary's experimental monkey trials and, in May 1993, QLT and\n\nDr.   Miller     entered      into   a    Confidential         Disclosure   Agreement\n\n(\"CDA\").    As part of this agreement, QLT promised \"not to use the\n\nConfidential Information for any purpose other than the evaluation\n\nof Products under the terms of this Agreement\" and \"to maintain\n\nConfidential Information in confidence.\"                   The parties agreed that\n\n\"misuse or improper disclosure of Confidential Information would\n\nirreparably harm the business of the disclosing party or that\n\nparty's affiliates.\"           Pursuant to the CDA, Miller continued to\n\nprovide MEEI's confidential research results to QLT, including\n\nresults of MEEI research not funded by QLT.\n\n            In July 1993, at Dr. Miller's request, QLT agreed to fund\n\nfurther experiments by the Infirmary involving the treatment of\n\nneovasculature in monkeys with the derivatives.                      The results of\n\nthese studies, as well as other studies not funded by QLT, were\n\nshared    with    QLT    in   November        1994,   in   a   report   entitled   the\n\nPreclinical BPD-MA Pharmacology Study for Macular Degeneration\n\n(\"Bolus Study\").\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           C.   QLT Partnership with CIBA Vision\n\n           In late 1993, QLT contacted the company CIBA Vision1 to\n\ncommercialize the use of photodynamic therapies with BPD to treat\n\nage-related macular degeneration.      QLT provided CIBA Vision with\n\nMEEI's confidential research results without first informing MEEI.\n\nIn February 1994, CIBA Vision sought full access to Dr. Miller's\n\nresearch results to pursue a \"high potential opportunity.\"       QLT\n\nagreed to share with CIBA Vision the \"plans and results of our\n\nocular programme,\" which included Dr. Miller's research.\n\n           Dr. Miller learned of QLT's negotiations with CIBA Vision\n\nin the Spring of 1994.    In March, she expressed concern about the\n\nconfidentiality of MEEI's research results to Julia Levy and Edwin\n\nLevy of QLT, who assured her that QLT had not disclosed and would\n\nnot disclose in the future any of MEEI's trade secret information.\n\nDr. Miller then flew to Switzerland \"to get CIBA Vision excited in\n\nthe technology,\" but during that meeting, and subsequent meetings\n\nwith CIBA Vision representatives in July and October of 1994 she\n\npresented only summaries of her research.\n\n           On May 31, 1994, CIBA Vision and QLT executed a Letter of\n\nIntent to enter into a strategic partnership for commercializing\n\nthe use of photodynamic therapy to treat neovasculature arising\n\nfrom age-related macular degeneration.    The Letter recognized that\n\nQLT had \"significant non-clinical evidence\" -- some of which came\n\n\n1\n    CIBA Vision is today known as Novartis Ophthalmics, Inc.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffrom Miller's research -- showing the success of the therapy for\n\nthis application.      The Letter indicated that \"[e]ach party will\n\nmanage the patent portfolio in collaboration with the other party.\"\n\nQLT announced the partnership to the public and MEEI announced\n\nthat:\n\n          Researchers   at    [MEEI]    in    Boston   are\n          participating in a joint worldwide project\n          with [QLT] and CIBA . . . to develop\n          photodynamic therapy, a potential treatment\n          for   certain   eye   diseases.        Infirmary\n          researchers,   since   1992,    have   performed\n          pre-clinical studies, in collaboration with\n          Wellman   Laboratories,    using    Benzoprophin\n          derivative      (BPD),       a     proprietar y\n          light-activated drug developed by [QLT].\n\nClinical trials testing the treatment on humans began in 1995, and\n\nthe Infirmary was one of several sites performing the trials under\n\na written agreement with QLT.      MEEI was paid more than one million\n\ndollars for participation in the trials and for the resulting\n\nclinical data.\n\n          On   February   6,    1995,   QLT    and   CIBA   Vision      signed   a\n\ndefinitive agreement to pursue worldwide joint development and\n\ncommercialization of photo-dynamic therapy for the treatment of\n\nchoroidal neovasculature.        The partnership aimed to obtain FDA\n\napproval for its treatment, tradenamed Visudyne, in April 2000.\n\nSales outside    the   United   States   began       in   1999,   and   Visudyne\n\nreceived FDA approval in April 2000.          As of February 2002, over two\n\nhundred twenty million dollars' worth of Visudyne had been sold\n\nworldwide.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           D.   Patent Applications\n\n           Prior to QLT's partnering with CIBA Vision, in March\n\n1994, Dr. Miller approached QLT about pursuing a patent application\n\nfor the treatment.      QLT agreed and suggested that Kate Murashige,\n\nits    long-standing    patent     attorney,        prepare    the   application.\n\nRelying on information provided by Miller, Murashige prepared a\n\npatent   application     with     serial      number    08/209,473    (\"the       '473\n\napplication\")    and    filed     it   on   March     14,   1994.     The    claimed\n\ninvention applied to methods for treating choroidal neovasculature\n\nwith photodynamic therapy using BPD; the named inventors included\n\nonly MEEI's Drs. Miller and Gragoudas and another MEEI employee,\n\nLucy Young.\n\n            Even though it was not claiming co-inventorship of the\n\n'473   application,     QLT     confirmed      that    it   would    pay    for     the\n\npreparation of the application. Murashige told MEEI that \"QLT does\n\nnot see itself as a participant in the invention other than as a\n\nsupplier of     the    material    BPD,\"      and   \"the    assignment      would    be\n\nentirely to MEEI.\"\n\n            Within months of the '473 filing, however, QLT changed\n\nits approach to the patent strategy.                On behalf of QLT, Murashige\n\nproposed to MEEI that the '473 application could be improved upon\n\nby modifying the scope of the patent claims. Murashige argued that\n\nit would strengthen the application to include methods of treating\n\nCNV with photo-dynamic therapy using liposomal formulations of BPD.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fSince QLT's Dr. Levy and the MGH inventors had contributed to the\n\ninvention of this form of treatment, the addition of these claims\n\nto the application would make them co-inventors.              QLT appreciated\n\nthe legal significance of the amplification of inventorship in the\n\n'591 application.       Jennifer Kaufman-Shaw, QLT's in-house counsel,\n\nwrote to CIBA Vision that:\n\n            at the time the invention was made, there was\n            no contractual agreement in place whereby QLT\n            would be entitled to ownership of the\n            invention.   Therefore QLT claims ownership\n            only through Dr. Julia Levy . . . . If Dr.\n            Levy were not an inventor, QLT would have no\n            rights to the patent.\n\nThus, Murashige convened the three institutions -- QLT, MEEI, and\n\nMGH -- and requested that MEEI and MGH retain their own patent\n\ncounsel.\n\n            Implementing the proposal entailed a \"continuation-in-\n\npart   application,\"      with   serial       number   08/390,591   (the    '591\n\napplication).     At the same time, Murashige removed from the '473\n\napplications those claims directed to methods of treating unwanted\n\nchoroidal    neovasculature      with    photodynamic     therapy   using    the\n\nbenzoporhin derivatives.         Those claims were joined to the '591\n\napplication.\n\n            After receiving assurances that MEEI would receive fair\n\ncompensation for its contributions, the MEEI inventors consented to\n\nthe    changes,   and     Murashige     filed    the   '591   application      on\n\nFebruary    17,   1995.     MEEI's      Miller   and   Gragoudas    executed    a\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f\"Combined Declaration of Inventorship and Power of Attorney for\n\nContinuation-in-Part Application,\" affirming that they were joint\n\ninventors along with the others of those inventions claimed in the\n\n'591 application.      Drs. Miller and Gragoudas maintained that they\n\nsigned the Declaration of Inventorship and Power of Attorney with\n\n(1)   the   expectation      that     the   proper     inventorship       would    be\n\ndetermined once final claims were allowed, and (2) in consideration\n\nfor   QLT's      express    promise    that     MEEI   would      be     compensated\n\nappropriately for Drs. Miller and Gragoudas's contributions through\n\na license agreement.\n\n            On August 25, 1998, the '591 application issued as U.S.\n\nPatent 5,798,349 (the '349 patent).               Drs. Miller and Gragoudas\n\nassigned their rights as inventors to the Infirmary, and Drs. Hasan\n\nand Schmidt-Erfurth         assigned    their    rights      to   MGH.     Dr.    Levy\n\nassigned    her    rights    to     QLT.      Among    the    assignees      of    the\n\ninventorship of the '349 patent, QLT is distinguished by its\n\nownership of the patents on the benzoporphin derivatives integral\n\nto the invented treatment. This ownership means that QLT alone can\n\nindependently exploit the rights of the '349 patent.\n\n            E.    Licensing Negotiations\n\n            In December 1995, QLT had signed a letter of intent to\n\nnegotiate exclusive licenses of MEEI's and MGH's co-ownership\n\nrights in any patent that issued from the pending '591 application.\n\nSuch a license would prevent MGH or MEEI from licensing their\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\frights under a patent issuing from the '591 application to a\n\ncompetitor of QLT.      According to the letter, \"QLT does intend to\n\nnegotiate in good faith with MEEI/MGH and other assignees to come\n\nto an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which will be\n\nconsistent with industry standards under similar circumstances.\"\n\nIn the same letter, QLT indicated \"its intent to negotiate with the\n\nMEEI/MGH for an option to license the technology which is the\n\nsubject of the ['473 application].\"         Negotiations would commence,\n\naccording to QLT, once a patent issued and the feasibility of the\n\ninvention was proven.\n\n            MEEI responded in February 1996 that the Letter of Intent\n\n\"is insufficient in that it does not address the issue of how the\n\nInfirmary will participate in the licensing or transferring of MEEI\n\ntechnology by QLT to third parties.\"           MEEI also accused QLT of\n\nentering into an agreement with CIBA Vision \"using, in part,\n\ntechnology that was developed . . . at the Infirmary.\"                   MEEI\n\nconcluded, \"If that is untrue, please advise us.          If that is true,\n\nour position is that the Infirmary should be a party to that\n\nagreement   as   well   as   any   future   agreements   relative   to   that\n\ntechnology.\"     QLT did not respond to this letter.\n\n                         II.   QLT's Cross-Appeal\n\n            The above narrative anticipates the disposition of the\n\ncross-appeal, as the picture we have painted includes information\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthat QLT wished never to disclose.2           Because QLT has challenged a\n\nnumber of evidentiary rulings, we must explain which evidence we\n\nfind properly before us.\n\n            QLT contends that the district court erroneously ordered\n\nthe production     of   certain    attorney-client       communications     with\n\nMurashige and other attorneys of her firm.                The district court\n\nfound that QLT met its burden of establishing the prima facie\n\napplicability      of    the      attorney-client        privilege    to     the\n\ncommunications in question.

The authority\n\nQLT cites, however, specifies only that the \"formulation of . . .\n\nthe . . . common-interest doctrine\" should be reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n(emphasis added).    The application of properly formulated doctrine\n\nto the facts remains a matter of discretion for the district court.\n\nId.\n\n           The   discovery   master   spelled   out   MEEI's   burden   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           MEEI must first establish that MEEI shared an\n           attorney-client relationship with Morrison &\n           Foerster [Murashige's law firm] on the\n           following matters: (1) the preparation and\n           prosecution of the '473 application (which\n           issued   as  the   '986   patent);   (2)   the\n           preparation and prosecution of the '591\n           application (which issued as the '349 patent);\n           (3) the licensing of the '986 patent; and (4)\n           the licensing of the '349 patent.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fMass. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 116-17.           QLT asserts\n\nthat the discovery master's inquiry was inadequate as a matter of\n\nlaw because MEEI not only had to show that MEEI and QLT were joint\n\nclients of Morrison & Foerster, but that, in addition, they shared\n\n\"an identical (or nearly identical) legal interest as opposed to a\n\nmerely similar interest.\"     Ogden, 202 F.3d at 461.      QLT argues that\n\nMurashige's legal work for MEEI and QLT regarding the matters was\n\nnot directed toward a nearly identical legal interest.                Absent\n\nconverging interests, parties who shared an attorney ought not have\n\naccess to their counsel's communications with the other party.\n\n           It is peculiar to address this question first as it\n\ninevitably    requires   reaching   into   the   merits   we   have   yet   to\n\ndiscuss.     But the district court had to do so, as must we.               The\n\nirony that the ensuing discovery shows just how polarized the two\n\nparties' interests may already have been is not material to the\n\ninquiry.     \"A joint attorney-client relationship remains intact\n\nuntil it is expressly terminated or until circumstances arise that\n\nreadily imply to all the joint clients that the relationship is\n\nover.\"   Ogden, 202 F.3d at 463.      The rules of discovery therefore\n\ndo not insulate from discovery the communications of a duplicitous\n\nparty who feigns common interest while scheming otherwise with a\n\nshared, trusted advisor.\n\n           We agree, for the reasons elaborated in the master's\n\nrecommendation, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 118-23, that QLT and MEEI were\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fjoint clients of Morrison & Foerster during at least part of\n\nMurashige's representation of the parties for two of the four\n\nmatters   advanced   by   MEEI:    prosecution   of   the   '473   and   '591\n\napplications.   Federal patent law shapes and limits the scope of\n\njoint inventors' interest in the successful prosecution of a\n\npatent.   Until an event affirmatively terminates the joint-client\n\nrelationship of parties relying on the same attorney for that\n\nprosecution, or otherwise \"readily impl[ies]\" that the relationship\n\nis over, as a matter of law, the joint relationship endures.\n\nBehind the scenes machinations adverse to the joint client are not\n\nnecessarily determinative.        Id. at 126.\n\n           The district court found an endpoint to joint-client\n\nstatus as of October 1, 1998:\n\n           There is no evidence in the record that MEEI's\n           and QLT's joint attorney-client relationship\n           with Morrison & Foerster for the preparation\n           and prosecution of the '473 application, or\n           for the preparation and prosecution of the\n           '591 application, was expressly terminated.\n\n           However, in a letter dated October 1, 1998,\n           MEEI informed QLT that MEEI had filed in the\n           PTO a continuation patent application of the\n           '591 application.    From the record, it is\n           clear that neither QLT nor Morrison & Foerster\n           was involved in the preparation or prosecution\n           of the continuation patent application. Thus,\n           . . . at least as of October 1, 1998, both\n           MEEI and QLT understood that their respective\n           legal interests in the '349 patent were no\n           longer the same, or nearly the same, legal\n           interest.\n           . . .\n           It is less clear when MEEI's and QLT's\n           respective legal interests in the '986 patent\n\n                                    -15-\n\f           were no longer the same, or nearly the same,\n           legal interest . . . . [However], at least as\n           of October 1, 1998, both MEEI and QLT\n           understood   that   their  respective   legal\n           interests in the '986 patent were no longer\n           the same, or nearly the same, legal interest.\n\nMass. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 167 F. Supp. 2d at 126.\n\n           QLT   does       not   disagree,     but    instead     raises   as    an\n\nalternative argument in its appeal that, if it shared a common\n\ninterest with MEEI, the common interest would have terminated more\n\nthan a year earlier, at the latest on July 31, 1997.                On that date,\n\nMEEI   contested,      by   letter,    QLT    and   MGH's   role    in   the     '591\n\ninvention. The letter from MEEI's patent attorney, Edmund Pitcher,\n\nto Murashige, expressed MEEI's view that \"the entirety of the\n\nsubject matter of the allowed claims is the invention of MEEI\n\npersonnel only, and that neither Dr. Levy [of QLT], nor Drs. Hasan\n\nor Schmidt [of MGH] made any inventive contribution.\"                       Pitcher\n\nnoted that \"Dr. Levy's presence on the application places MEEI in\n\nthe uncomfortable position of being dependent on the fairness of\n\nQLT,   despite   its    directly      adverse   economic    interest,       in    the\n\nnegotiation of a license agreement.\"                  The letter included the\n\ndemand that QLT:\n\n           make a concrete license proposal immediately\n           and/or file a continuation application to\n           permit correction of the named inventors. If\n           the Infirmary and QLT cannot come to an\n           agreement on a reasonable royalty rate and\n           other financial terms, we are instructed to\n           assume responsibility for prosecution of\n           patent applications covering subject matter\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            invented without the involvement of Dr. Levy\n            so as to try to preserve MEEI's rights.\n\nQLT responded to the district court's order with a \"Motion to Amend\n\nOrder as to Date of Termination of 'Common Interest,'\" in which\n\nQLT, for further support, drew on letters and memoranda written by\n\nMurashige and employees from QLT and CIBA Vision subsequent to\n\nMEEI's July 31 letter.      In QLT's motion, QLT argued that MEEI's\n\nletter implied to QLT that it no longer shared the same interest in\n\nthe successful prosecution of the '591 application, as MEEI was\n\nthreatening to pursue an alternative and conflicting avenue for\n\nrealizing   federal   protection    for    its   invention.     Thus,   QLT\n\ncontended that \"as a matter of fact, as a result of MEEI's July 31,\n\n1997 letter, QLT appreciated that QLT and MEEI no longer shared a\n\ncommon interest in successfully prosecuting the claimed inventions\n\nin\" the '591 application.\n\n            The discovery master denied the motion to move the date\n\nof termination of interest forward, finding, in essence, that\n\nMEEI's conflicting interest was only conditional.          That is to say,\n\nMEEI shared QLT's interest in the successful prosecution of the\n\n'591 application so long as a reasonable royalty rate was in the\n\ncards.      MEEI   argues   that   it     \"was   merely   exploring   other\n\npossibilities of protecting its rights in the event that QLT did\n\nnot live up to its promises once the '349 patent issued,\" when it\n\nfiled the 1997 application. The discovery master discussed how the\n\nletters and memoranda QLT offered supported this interpretation.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fA memorandum drafted by Jennifer Kauffman-Shaw, of QLT, to the QLT-\n\nCIBA Vision Joint Coordinating Committee, dated October 27, 1997,\n\nstated that \"the Director of Intellectual Property for MEEI, Carl\n\nFinn, has indicated that if QLT were willing to negotiate a\n\nsatisfactory license agreement for the patent, that MEEI would not\n\npursue the inventorship issue.\"   The master read\n\n          the memorandum [to] show[] that QLT understood\n          that   MEEI   remained   interested   in   the\n          successful    prosecution     of   the    '591\n          application.      Thus,   contrary  to   QLT's\n          assertions, the Kaufmann-Shaw Memorandum does\n          not show that QLT implied, from the Pitcher\n          Letter and the Finn Letter, that MEEI was no\n          longer    interested    in    the   successful\n          prosecution of the '591 application.\n\nMay 29, 2002, slip op. at 3.3\n\n          We believe that whether the common-interest exception\n\nexpires upon the implication that a party has a conditionally\n\nadverse interest of the sort at issue here is a question of law\n\nover which we should exercise de novo review.       The question is\n\n\n\n3\n   In its original objections to MEEI's motion for production, QLT\nargued that an October 21, 1997 letter by MEEI's Carl Finn to QLT's\nDolphin terminated any common interest that might have existed.\nIts later motion to terminate the interest as of July 31, 1997\nrelied upon materials released pursuant to the district court's\norder to produce privileged documents. Without entering into a\ncomplicated area of patent law that would require us to ascertain\nwhat QLT would infer from Finn's reference to a \"patent application\nrecently filed on behalf of MEEI,\" we note that the master's\nultimate conclusion that \"the October 21, 1997 letter did not\nreadily imply that MEEI's and QLT's respective legal interest in\nthe '591 application was no longer the same or nearly the same,\nlegal interest,\" 167 F. Supp. 2d at 131, relies on the same\nconditional analysis we deem worthy of de novo review.\n\n                                -18-\n\fwhether a party has \"an identical (or nearly identical) legal\n\ninterest\" with another when (1) they share a nearly identical\n\ninterest with regard to one outcome -- here successful prosecution\n\nof the '591 application -- which (2) depends on a condition that\n\npits the parties against each other –- here, negotiation of a\n\nlicense on agreeable terms.         We believe that it does.      Our view is\n\nthat the district court correctly focused on the continuing joint\n\nrepresentation    of   the    parties     by    Murashige   as   to    the   '591\n\napplication.     Insomuch as MEEI hoped to license its rights to the\n\n'591   application     to    QLT,   its   objective    depended       upon   that\n\napplication's successful prosecution.            The fact that one potential\n\noutcome, announced by MEEI in the July 31, 1997 letter, would\n\nrender its interests in the '591 application contrary to QLT's did\n\nnot of its own force terminate their joint representation as to the\n\nprosecution of that application.               Rather, it begs the factual\n\nquestion of whether Murashige ceased to represent MEEI's interests\n\nas to that prosecution.         The discovery master noted that in a\n\nNovember 25, 1997 letter from Kaufman-Shaw of QLT to MEEI, QLT\n\nindicated that it \"was willing to put aside the argument over\n\ninventorship in favor of settling upon an arrangement whereby the\n\nparticipants in the AMD/ocular neovasculature project would derive\n\na benefit from their contributions.\"            This letter also proposed a\n\nmeeting date between Murashige and MGH employees, CIBA Vision\n\nemployees, QLT employees, and MEEI employees. The discovery master\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fconcluded that this letter \"continues to show that QLT did not\n\nreadily [infer], from MEEI's letter by Pitcher and Finn, (1) that\n\nMEEI was no longer interested in the successful prosecution of the\n\n'591 application and, (2) as a result, that MEEI and QLT no longer\n\nshared the same, or nearly the same, legal interest, in the '591\n\napplication.\"       Accordingly, QLT's motion to amend the date of the\n\ntermination of the joint interest was denied.             The district court\n\ncorrectly framed the common-interest exception, and we find that it\n\nwas within its discretion in requiring disclosure of communications\n\nbetween QLT and Murashige of Morrison & Foerster relating to the\n\nprosecution of the '349 and '591 applications up until October 1,\n\n1998.\n\n                            III.     MEEI's Appeal\n\n            The pivotal moment that shapes nearly all of MEEI's\n\nclaims    involves    the   filing    of   the   continuation-in-part     '591\n\napplication, which added Dr. Julia Levy of QLT and Drs. Schmidt-\n\nErforth and Hasan of MGH as inventors on the patent.            In the course\n\nof that switch in patent strategy, QLT made numerous assurances to\n\nMEEI that it would license MEEI's patent rights on reasonable\n\nterms.    This case is before us because no licensing agreement was\n\never reached.   MEEI claims that it was injured by this failure, and\n\nfurther    harmed    by   QLT's   unlawful   disclosure    of   MEEI's   trade\n\nsecrets.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f           A.   Contract Claims\n\n           1.   Breach of Contract\n\n           The parties' disagreement regarding the existence of an\n\nenforceable contract is a legal one, and so this court reviews the\n\nquestion of contract formation de novo. Coady v. Ashcroft & Gerel,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199031\"><a href=\"/opinion/199031/coady-v-ashcraft-gerel/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 2000).       The district court determined that\n\nthe   parties   failed   to   reach   an   agreement   whose    terms    were\n\nsufficiently determinate to constitute a binding contract.               MEEI\n\ncounters that the district court erred in failing to recognize that\n\na valid contract could include terms defined by industry standards.\n\nWhile there are surely some contracts in which a crucial term could\n\nbe sufficiently defined by pegging it to industry standards, we\n\nagree   with    the   district   court's    conclusion   that    there    is\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record to find that the parties had\n\nreached a meeting of the minds.

Megathlin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703 (Mass. 1951)).\n\n           MEEI has also claimed breach of contract with regard to\n\nthe May 1993 Confidential Disclosure Agreement signed by QLT and\n\nDr. Miller.     We agree with the district court that MEEI was not a\n\nparty to this agreement and that there is no evidence that Miller\n\nwas acting as an agent of MEEI.         Furthermore, MEEI does not fall\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fwithin the limited class of third party beneficiaries who can\n\nenforce   a    contract    to    which    they      are   not    a   party.    Under\n\nMassachusetts      law,   in    order    for    a   third   party     to   enforce   a\n\ncontract, \"[i]t must appear from 'the language and circumstances of\n\nthe contract' that the parties to the contract 'clear[ly] and\n\ndefinite[ly]'      intended     the     beneficiaries       to   benefit    from   the\n\npromised performance.\"           Miller v. Mooney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550\n\n(Mass. 2000) (quoting Anderson v. Fox Hill Vill. Homeowners Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (Mass. 1997)).              Nothing in the language of the\n\nConfidential Disclosure Agreement indicates that MEEI was meant to\n\nbe either a party or a third party beneficiary.                  QLT was listed as\n\na party, and a vice president of the company signed for QLT.                         In\n\ncontrast, Dr. Miller signed only in her personal capacity without\n\nreference to MEEI.        Furthermore, the mere fact that MEEI would\n\nlikely benefit from such an agreement does not, by itself, show\n\nthat MEEI was an intended rather than an incidental beneficiary.\n\nSee Miller, 725 N.E.2d at 550 (citing Restatement (2d) of Contracts\n\n§ 302 (1981)).        Thus, MEEI cannot pursue a claim for breach of\n\ncontract as a third party beneficiary based on the Confidential\n\nDisclosure Agreement.\n\n              2.   Breach of Implied Contract\n\n              We construe MEEI's breach of implied contract claim to be\n\na claim of contract implied-in-fact rather than contract implied-\n\nin-law.   Although both causes of action exist in Massachusetts,\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fMEEI has argued principally that it reached an actual, enforceable\n\nagreement with QLT that was implied by the dealings of the two\n\nparties.          MEEI's   implied-in-law         oriented      arguments      will   be\n\naddressed in this court's analysis of the unjust enrichment claim.\n\nSee 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 1:6 (4th ed. 2004).\n\n           \"A contract implied in fact requires the same elements as\n\nan express contract and differs only in the method of expressing\n\nmutual   assent.\"          6    William   Meade     Fletcher     et     al.,   Fletcher\n\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 2580 (perm. ed.\n\nrev. vol. 2004). Thus, MEEI's implied contract claim fails for the\n\nsame reason we have rejected its express contract claim -- failure\n\nto reach agreement on the basic terms of the contract.                          In the\n\nprototypical        implied      contract      case,    the     terms    are    already\n\nsufficiently clear, and the court looks to the actions of the\n\nparties only to determine whether their actions indicate that they,\n\nin fact, agreed on those terms.                However, in this case, where the\n\nterms proposed by each side remain at odds, searching the actions\n\nof the parties for indicia of consent becomes a fruitless exercise.\n\nWithout agreement on the essential terms of the agreement, MEEI's\n\nimplied contract claim gets no further than does its express\n\ncontract claim.\n\n             3.    Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n\n             Having concluded that no contract exists, there can be no\n\nderivative    implied          covenant   of     good   faith    and    fair    dealing\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fapplicable to these parties.

In\n\nother words, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\n\ngoverns conduct of parties after they have entered into a contract;\n\nwithout a contract, there is no covenant to be breached.

Conversion and Misrepresentation Claims\n\n          1.    Conversion\n\n          MEEI    claims   that   QLT    converted   MEEI's   intellectual\n\nproperty rights in the invention of the photodynamic therapy \"by\n\ncausing MEEI to file a joint patent application with MGH and QLT so\n\nthat a patent issued would name employees of all these institutions\n\nas inventors.\"     \"Conversion requires the exercise of dominion or\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fcontrol over the personal property of another.\"                Third Nat'l Bank\n\nof Hampden Cty. v.

However, MEEI agreed to the filing of the joint patent\n\napplication.     From the moment QLT became a co-inventor of the '349\n\npatent, it too had full and equal rights to exploit the patented\n\nintellectual     property.      Under   a       more    refined   statement   of\n\nMassachusetts law, only a defendant that \"wrongfully exercises acts\n\nof ownership\" has committed conversion.                In re Halmar Distribs.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586289\"><a href=\"/opinion/586289/in-re-halmar-distributors-inc-debtors-general-electric-company-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis added) (internal\n\ncitation omitted).      Since QLT jointly owned the property at issue\n\nand since it did nothing to prevent MEEI from exercising its own\n\nrights in the property, QLT did not \"wrongfully exercise acts of\n\nownership,\" id., and thus, no conversion occurred.                Hence, it is\n\nunnecessary for us to address the district court's analysis of\n\nwhether intangible property, such as patent rights, can be the\n\nsubject of a conversion claim.\n\n            2.   Misrepresentation\n\n            MEEI claims that QLT falsely represented to MEEI that\n\nMEEI would be adequately compensated for its role in the inventions\n\nincluded    in   the   '349   patent.      In    order    to   succeed   on   its\n\nmisrepresentation claims, MEEI must show that QLT did not intend to\n\ncomply with these representations at the time they were made.                 See\n\nDoyle & H.P. Leasing, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197138\"><a href=\"/opinion/197138/boyle-v-hasbro-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"plaintiffs must allege (1) that the statement was\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fknowingly false; (2) that [defendants] made the false statement\n\nwith the intent to deceive; (3) that the statement was material to\n\nthe plaintiffs' decision . . . ; (4) that the plaintiffs reasonably\n\nrelied on the statement; and (5) that the plaintiffs were injured\n\nas a result of their reliance\") (citations omitted).               Since MEEI\n\ndoes not provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to draw\n\nthis conclusion, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.\n\n            C.     MEEI's Motion to Amend\n\n            \"We review the denial of a motion to amend under Rule\n\n15(a) for an abuse of discretion, and we defer to the district\n\ncourt if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the\n\nrecord.\"    Steir v.

In the instant case, we\n\ncannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nMEEI's    motion    to   amend   its   complaint    concerning    its   unjust\n\nenrichment claim and to include a claim of promissory estoppel.\n\n            MEEI made its motion to amend more than two years after\n\nfiling the complaint, after the court had entered summary judgment\n\nfor QLT on Counts I-IV of MEEI's complaint and the parties had\n\nfully briefed summary judgment arguments on the remaining four\n\ncounts.     \"Where the motion to amend is filed after the opposing\n\nparty has    timely      moved   for   summary   judgment,   a   plaintiff   is\n\nrequired to show 'substantial and convincing evidence' to justify\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fa belated attempt to amend a complaint.\" Id.

The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\n\nMEEI has failed to meet its burden of showing \"some valid reason\n\nfor [its] neglect and delay.\"4       Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198100\"><a href=\"/opinion/198100/acosta-mestre-v-hilton-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). Although the summary judgment motions already\n\nfiled necessarily did not apply to MEEI's newly proposed promissory\n\nestoppel theory, given the undue delay in raising this theory, the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in denying MEEI's motion\n\nto amend.\n\n            D.   Unjust Enrichment\n\n            The district court believed that MEEI's unjust enrichment\n\nclaim \"distill[ed] into a disagreement over the inventorship in the\n\n'349 patent.\"     Based on that premise, the district court reasoned\n\nthat MEEI could not use a Massachusetts unjust enrichment claim to\n\ncircumvent federal patent law, and accordingly, granted summary\n\njudgment to QLT.       We find, however, that the district court\n\n\n\n4\n   MEEI points to Corey v. Look as an instance where this court\nallowed the plaintiff to amend a complaint despite the fact that\nthe \"motion to amend came 15 months after the Authority's motion to\ndismiss.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387189\"><a href=\"/opinion/387189/joseph-l-corey-jr-v-allen-m-look/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st Cir. 1981). In that case, however,\nthe plaintiff sought only to incorporate facts in the complaint\nthat had been discovered from interrogatories. Id. Here, plaintiff\nseeks to add an entirely new legal theory. Furthermore, in Carey,\nwe decided only that it would have been within the district court's\ndiscretion to allow amendment, not, as MEEI's urges here, that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion by denying the amendment. Id.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fmisinterpreted MEEI's unjust enrichment claim, and in light of our\n\ninterpretation       of    the    claim,      we   find     summary   judgment\n\ninappropriate.\n\n          While      the   proper      inventorship    of   either    the    '473\n\napplication or the '591 application is indeed a non-negotiable\n\nquestion of federal law, the question of which application to\n\nprosecute was a choice available to the parties.               Under the U.S.\n\npatent scheme, inventors have discretion to articulate the scope of\n\ntheir patent claims.        Donald S. Chisum, 3-8 Chisum on Patents,\n\n§ 8.06[4], at 8-247 (2003) (\"An applicant may present more than one\n\nclaim and is afforded reasonable latitude in varying the scope and\n\nterminology   with    which      he   defines   his   invention.\").         MEEI's\n\noriginal '473 application's primary claim involved three main green\n\nporphyrin-based methods: a \"method to treat conditions of the eye\n\ncharacterized by unwanted neovasculature\" (claim 1); a \"method to\n\ntreat pigmented tumors in the eye\" (claim 10); and a \"method to\n\nobserve the condition of blood vessels in the eye\" (claim 19).                 The\n\nthree methods had much in common: each claim involved administering\n\ngreen porphyrin, which would then localize in the blood vessels in\n\nthe eye; the diagnostic method simply involved observing the\n\nvessels, and the two treatment methods involved irradiating the\n\nneovasculature or tumor with light.             Furthermore, each method had\n\nan associated but separate claim that specified that \"said green\n\nporphyrin is contained in a liposomal preparation\" (claims 7, 16,\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fand 24).     Based on these claims, Murashige explained in March 1994\n\nthat \"QLT does not see itself as a participant in the invention\n\nother than as a supplier of the material BPD.\"\n\n              In   December      1994,   Murashige      suggested    substantially\n\nchanging the scope and inventorship of the '473 application.\n\nFirst, she recommended spinning off the diagnostic method as a\n\nseparate patent which would be \"properly assignable solely to\n\nMEEI.\"      Second, she recommended combining the separately stated\n\nmethods for treatment of neovasculature (claim 1) and treatment of\n\npigmented tumors (claim 10) into a single method.                   The goal was to\n\n\"be able to claim treating conditions of the eye more broadly,\"\n\ni.e., expand the scope of the patent.                    In order to do this,\n\nhowever, it was necessary to \"introduce the limitation of using the\n\ngreen      porphyrin   in    a   liposomal      composition.\"        To    this   end,\n\nMurashige proposed a modified claim 1 that claimed \"administering\n\n. . . green porphyrin in a liposomal composition.\"                    As Murashige\n\nacknowledged, that \"is substantially the same as claim 1 in the\n\noriginal case except that the limitation of using a liposomal\n\ncomposition has been included.\"\n\n              Murashige explained the significance of this proposal.\n\nOn   the    one    hand,    by   broadening     claim    1   \"to   claim    treating\n\nconditions of the eye more broadly,\" the patent, if granted, would\n\nhave \"potentially broader coverage than contemplated [earlier].\"\n\nBut the only way to justify these broad claims was to \"introduce\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fthe   limitation       of   using     the    green   porphyrin      in   a     liposomal\n\ncomposition,\" which, Murashige explained, was \"a liberating device,\n\nallowing us to claim more broadly.\"\n\n            However, this change to claim 1 broadened not just\n\ncoverage    of    potential      eye   treatments,      but       also   the    list   of\n\ninventors.       Murashige explained that \"if we include conditions of\n\nthe eye generally using liposomal compositions, . . . a larger\n\ncircle of inventors would be included both because of this greater\n\nbreadth    and    by   virtue    of    the    necessity      to    supply    the     green\n\nporphyrin in liposomes.             It then appears that the inventorship\n\nwould properly include . . . Julia Levy . . . .\"                     In other words,\n\nthe very aspect of the application that was \"a liberating device,\n\nallowing [the inventors] to claim more broadly\" also happened to be\n\nthe aspect of the revised application that would require adding Dr.\n\nLevy as an inventor.         (Conversely, had liposomal preparations not\n\nbeen claimed at all, arguably the patent would be less valuable,\n\nbut Dr. Levy might not be an inventor.)                      Adding Dr. Levy, of\n\ncourse, would give QLT full co-ownership rights to exploit the\n\npatent.    Thus, QLT presented MEEI with a second viable formulation\n\nof its patent application: it asked MEEI to change the scope of its\n\npatent     application      to      QLT's     benefit   in    exchange         for    fair\n\ncompensation.5\n\n\n5\n  At times, both parties have disputed the inventor status of the\nother party.   QLT has questioned MEEI's exclusive role in the\nclaims listed in the '473 application, and MEEI has challenged\n\n                                            -30-\n\f           MEEI already possessed a valid, and seemingly defensible,\n\npatent application, when QLT sought MEEI's assent to replace the\n\n'473 application with the '591 application.6      QLT acknowledged that\n\nthe patent as MEEI envisioned it (without Levy and her claims)\n\nwould be difficult to challenge on grounds of either obviousness or\n\nnoninventorship. Nevertheless, QLT argued that the patent could be\n\nmade stronger -- in some ways both broader and more defensible --\n\nby changing the scope of the patent and adding the additional\n\ninventors who participated in the new claims.       The addition of QLT\n\ninventor   Dr.   Levy,   however,   would   drastically   reduce   MEEI's\n\npotential profits from the patent.          If MEEI agreed to the '591\n\napplication with the additional inventors, QLT would no longer need\n\na license in order to commercialize the photo-dynamic therapy that\n\nbecame known as Visudyne.       Since QLT already owned the other\n\n\nQLT's participation in the claims added in the '591 application.\nHowever, we find that at this summary judgment stage, the record\ndoes not contradict the listed inventors on either application, and\nwe assume that both applications were valid.\n6\n   The '591 application (later approved as the '349 patent) also\nadded Drs. Schmidt-Erfurth and Hasan of MGH. It is appropriate to\nnote here that, in addition to their primary arguments about\nfederal preemption, the district court and QLT rely on the fact\nthat QLT also purchased a license to MGH's co-ownership rights in\nthe '349 patent. Given this license, QLT points out that it would\nstill have full rights to exploit the patent even if QLT, itself,\nhad not played any role in the inventorship. This argument, though,\nmisses the mark entirely, as it ignores the fact that MGH, like\nQLT, only has rights to the core inventions covered by the original\n'473 patent because MEEI agreed to the later '591 application.\nQLT's redundant licensing scheme with MGH in no way undermines\nMEEI's argument that it consented to proceed with the '591\napplication on based on QLT's assurances of fair compensation.\n\n                                    -31-\n\frequired patent for the necessary BPD, QLT's inclusion in the new\n\n'591   application      enabled    it   to     commercially   exploit    Visudyne\n\nwithout MEEI.     We note that QLT was, of course, well aware that\n\nsecuring co-inventorship would put it in this uniquely lucrative\n\nposition, and it was QLT's attorney, Murashige, who, acting also as\n\npatent counsel to MEEI, spearheaded the effort to convince MEEI to\n\ngo along with the '591 application.\n\n           Not surprisingly, MEEI did not initially agree with this\n\nnew approach proposed by QLT.                Attorney Murashige nevertheless\n\nprepared   the    '591    continuation-in-part           application,    and   MEEI\n\neventually assented after being promised fair compensation for its\n\ncontribution.     Of course, MEEI and QLT never came to an agreement\n\non the critical compensation figures, and it is for that reason\n\nthat we have affirmed summary judgment for QLT on MEEI's contract\n\nclaims.    This inadequate meeting of the minds does not, however,\n\ncall for summary judgment in the context of unjust enrichment.                   A\n\nclaim of unjust enrichment is appropriate \"where an agreement is\n\ntoo indefinite to be enforced . . . [or] where no contract is made\n\nbecause    each    of    the      parties      had   a    materially    different\n\nunderstanding of the terms.\"            1-1 Corbin on Contracts, § 1.20(b)\n\n(2004).

QLT contends that § 262 creates a federal right\n\nto practice an invention without fear of suit by co-inventors,\n\npreempts state      law     claims      between   co-owners      on    the    basis   of\n\nanything    other     than    a    written      contract,      and/or    effectively\n\nrepresents a Congressional determination that any asserted wrong by\n\none co-inventor against another is not \"unjust\" unless it violates\n\nsuch a contract.\n\n            We recognize that the preemption issue here is close. It\n\nis true that allowing MEEI's claim to proceed would, to some\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fextent, impinge upon QLT's rights as a co-inventor.                    However, the\n\nstatute itself admits of an exception to those rights when there is\n\n\"any agreement to the contrary.\"        QLT suggests that this exception\n\nonly   applies   where    there   is    a       written,    legally     enforceable\n\ncontract.     But § 262 says no such thing.                Congress knew how to\n\ninsist upon a contract, and even how to specify that it must be\n\nreduced to writing.        Cf. 35 U.S.C. § 261 (holding that patent\n\nrights are    \"assignable    in   law   by       an     instrument    in     writing\")\n\n(emphasis    added).      However,          §    262    simply     speaks     of   \"any\n\nagreement.\"      MEEI has provided evidence of an agreement with QLT\n\nin which QLT promised to \"negotiate in good faith with MEEI . . .\n\nto come to an agreement on reasonable terms and royalty rates which\n\nwill   be   consistent     with   industry             standards     under     similar\n\ncircumstances.\"        We have held, supra Part III.A.1, that this\n\nagreement was not enforceable as a contract, because the terms are\n\ntoo indefinite.    However, if the fact-finder determines that there\n\nwas such an agreement, it might still qualify as an \"agreement\"\n\nunder § 262, and therefore form the basis for equitable relief on\n\na theory of unjust enrichment without presenting any conflict with\n\nthe allegedly preempting statute.\n\n            We also note that, while there is no direct precedent\n\nconcerning preemption under § 262, we may draw analogies from other\n\nsituations where patent law preemption has been alleged.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\f             First, there is precedent suggesting that a state law\n\naction alleging that the defendant secretly filed and received a\n\npatent for the plaintiff' invention, and requesting monetary or\n\nequitable relief but not a change to the patent itself, is not\n\npreempted.

Nat'l Ribbon & Carbon Paper\n\n\n8\n   In Becher, an inventor employed Becher as a machinist to help\nwork on his invention, under a confidentiality agreement. Becher\nsecretly applied for and received a patent for the invention. The\ninventor sued in state court for breach of contract and other state\ntheories, and the state court ordered a constructive trust on the\npatent rights, i.e., ordered Becher to assign the rights to the\ninventor. Becher sued in federal court to enjoin the inventor from\nfurther state court proceedings on the grounds of patent\npreemption. Justice Holmes held that the inventor's claims were\nnot preempted:\n\n     [The inventor]'s right was independent of and prior to\n     any arising out of the patent law, and it seems a strange\n     suggestion that the assertion of that right can be\n     removed from the cognizance of the tribunals established\n     to protect it by its opponent going into the patent\n     office for a later title. It is said that to establish\n     [the inventor]'s claim is to invalidate Becher's patent.\n     But, even if mistakenly, the attempt was not to\n     invalidate that patent but to get an assignment of it,\n     and an assignment was decreed.

The court never even hinted that his\nclaim was preempted.\n10\n   In Kleinerman, the inventor sued in state court alleging that\ndefendant Snitzer \"breached the trust implied in plaintiff's\ndisclosure to him of plaintiff's technology and knowingly\nmisappropriated plaintiff's technology, to plaintiff's detriment,\"\nand that another defendant, the patent attorney, helped Snitzer to\ndo so. Id. at 1-2. The complaint sought damages, not correction\nof inventorship or invalidation of the patent. Defendants argued\nthat the complaint was preempted by patent law and sought to remove\nto federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.\nThe court held that, since the plaintiff never obtained a patent\nfor the technology he claims that he invented, he therefore was not\nseeking to enjoin a defendant from infringing on his patent, but\nrather seeking damages for common law torts. It remanded the case\nfor want of federal jurisdiction. Id. at 2.\n11\n    In Zemba, plaintiff and Rodgers separately invented the same\nproduct, then decided to jointly apply for a patent.       A patent\nattorney was consulted. Rodgers and the attorney then allegedly\nconspired to process the patent application without plaintiff, and\nto represent Rodgers as the sole inventor.         See id. at 96.\n\"Rodgers falsely and fraudulently told plaintiff that the invention\nwas unpatentable, that an application would be rejected, and that\nhe had doubt as to whether the patent application would be\npursued.\" Id. With the help of the patent attorney, Rodgers filed\nand received the patent. Plaintiff sued in state court for fraud\nand various other state law theories. Defendants argued that the\nclaims were preempted by patent law and subject to exclusive\nfederal jurisdiction. See id. at 97-98. The court rejected the\nclaim of preemption, explaining:\n\n     [The complaint] depends on principles of common law and\n     equity governing fraud and disparagement, and plaintiff's\n     rights are dependent upon such principles. Plaintiff has\n     not sought a declaratory judgment to void the patent on\n     the federal grounds of non-invention.

MEEI has not\n\nprovided    evidence    that    QLT's     alleged   conduct   was     actually\n\nfraudulent.    However, arguably, the case for preemption here is\n\nweaker than in the cited cases.          In the cited cases, the plaintiff\n\nstruck at the heart of inventorship by arguing (essentially) that\n\nthe patent was applied for fraudulently and never should have\n\nissued.

The\n\ndistinction cited above is between state claims alleging misconduct\n\nby an applicant against the PTO (which are usually, if not always,\n\npreempted), and claims alleging misconduct between parties after\n\nthe patent has issued.            Here, the claim is misconduct by an\n\napplicant    against     a   co-applicant   before    the   application   is\n\ncompleted.

Purely as a\n\nhypothetical, imagine a case where the evidence clearly showed that\n\nthe defendant deceived and manipulated a naive inventor into\n\nmodifying the scope of the inventor's application (within the range\n\nof properly patentable applications) so as to force the inclusion\n\nof the defendant as a co-inventor.          Further suppose that the\n\ndefendant    deflected   all   requests   for   a   legally   enforceable\n\nlicensing contract with empty assurances of future agreements which\n\nit never intended to fulfill.       We cannot imagine that Congress\n\nintended, simply by enacting the phrase \"[i]n the absence of any\n\nagreement to the contrary,\" to preclude the inventor-plaintiff from\n\nestablishing such an agreement within the framework of an equitable\n\ncause of action under state law.     Conflict preemption applies only\n\nwhen \"there is such a direct conflict between . . . the patent code\n\nand . . . [state] law that compliance with both the patent law and\n\nstate law is a 'physical impossibility,' or . . . the state law\n\n'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\n\nfull purposes and objectives of Congress' in enacting\" the federal\n\nstatute.

Trade Secret and Unfair Trade Practices Claims\n\n            The right to control how research is used and who is\n\nprivy to trade secrets is crucial to protecting the economic\n\ninterests of non-profit research institutions like MEEI, just as it\n\nis essential to for-profit businesses.                     Without the ability to\n\nguard   their      own    data,     there    would    be     fewer    incentives       for\n\n\n13\n   Although MEEI cannot recover twice for the same conduct, MEEI\nshould have the opportunity to prove the distinct elements of its\nunjust enrichment and trade secret claims.\n\n                                        -42-\n\finstitutions like MEEI to engage in this type of cutting-edge\n\nresearch.    The allegations before this court are that QLT was\n\nentrusted with the result of MEEI's research and breached that\n\ntrust, primarily by sharing information with its partner CIBA\n\nVision without authorization from MEEI.     We now consider whether\n\nthe district court correctly found that these claims were brought\n\nby MEEI after the statute of limitations had already run.\n\n            1.   Misappropriation of Trade Secrets\n\n            MEEI claims that QLT misappropriated its trade secrets\n\nwithout MEEI's knowledge, in particular, by disclosing certain\n\nresearch results to QLT's eventual partner, CIBA Vision.       MEEI\n\nargues that the district court erred in concluding that MEEI's\n\ntrade secret claim was time barred by the three-year statute of\n\nlimitations for tort actions because, under Massachusetts law, the\n\nstatute should have been tolled.\n\n            Massachusetts law establishes two avenues by which the\n\nthree-year statute of limitations that would ordinarily apply to\n\nMEEI's trade secret claims can be tolled. The Massachusetts common\n\nlaw \"discovery rule\" provides that the statute of limitations is\n\ntolled \"until a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should have known,\n\nthat it has been harmed or may have been harmed by the defendant's\n\nconduct.\"   Taygeta Corp. v.

Thus,   under   Massachusetts'\n\ndiscovery rule, the question before the district court was when\n\nMEEI actually knew or should have known of QLT's misappropriations\n\nof its trade secrets.\n\n           Massachusetts statutory law also grants a reprieve from\n\nthe statute of limitations when a potential defendant fraudulently\n\nconceals the basis for a cause of action:\n\n           If a person liable to a personal action\n           fraudulently conceals the cause of such action\n           from the knowledge of the person entitled to\n           bring it, the period prior to the discovery of\n           his cause of action by the person so entitled\n           shall be excluded in determining the time\n           limited for the commencement of the action.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 12 (2004).      Under this law, the statute\n\nof limitations \"will be tolled if the wrongdoer either concealed\n\nthe existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act\n\ndone with intent to deceive or breached a fiduciary duty of full\n\ndisclosure.\"    Stark v.

App. Ct. 2000) (quotations and citations omitted). \"The\n\nstatute of limitations, however, is not tolled if the plaintiff has\n\nactual knowledge of the facts giving rise to his cause of action.\"\n\nId.\n\n           The district court made short work of MEEI's trade\n\nsecrets claims by finding that MEEI had actual knowledge of its\n\nclaims more than three years before bringing this suit on April 24,\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f2000.   Since    the   district   court    concluded   that   there   were\n\nsufficient facts to prove MEEI's knowledge of its claims, it did\n\nnot need to go any further in analyzing the tolling of the trade\n\nsecret claims under either the common law discovery rule or the\n\nfraudulent concealment statute.          However, we must evaluate the\n\ndistrict court's factual conclusions to determine whether they\n\nsupported summary judgment.\n\n          a.    Review of District Court Summary Judgment Decision\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       Since\n\ngenuine issues of material fact remain concerning MEEI's knowledge\n\nof QLT's misappropriations of its trade secrets -- facts that could\n\nbring MEEI's claims within the statute of limitations -- we find\n\nthat the court erred in granting summary judgment on MEEI's trade\n\nsecret claims.\n\n          \"Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment is plenary, and we read the record in the light most\n\namicable to the party contesting summary judgment.\"            Cambridge\n\nPlating Co. v.

Considered in the light most favorable to MEEI, neither\n\nthe facts singled out by the district court, nor the record as a\n\nwhole, suffice to support the district court's conclusion that MEEI\n\nhad knowledge of trade secret misappropriations.             The district\n\ncourt based its conclusion on, inter alia, MEEI's awareness of\n\nQLT's partnership with CIBA Vision, Dr. Miller's statements that\n\nshe was concerned about the confidentiality of her work, and\n\nDr. Miller's learning from CIBA Vision that some of her data had\n\nbeen shared without her permission.

We will address the question of MEEI's admitted\n\nknowledge of some disclosures below.\n\n            The district court seems to have given little weight to\n\nMEEI's claims that QLT repeatedly reassured Miller that it was not\n\ndisclosing any confidential information.           Rather, the district\n\ncourt found that in a 1996 letter to QLT, MEEI indicated that it\n\n\n\n\n                                    -46-\n\fwas already aware of its trade secrets cause of action.14                       The\n\nletter stated in part, \"[w]e believe that you may have already\n\nentered into an agreement with a third party using, in part,\n\ntechnology that was developed here at the Infirmary.                     If that is\n\nuntrue, please so advise us.\"            Tracerlab, 313 F.2d at 102.            QLT\n\nnever   responded   to    the    letter.        In   our   view,    this     letter\n\ndemonstrates    only     that     MEEI    was    aware     of    QLT's     business\n\nrelationship with CIBA Vision and about the potential for trade\n\nsecret misappropriation existing in that relationship.                   The letter\n\nmakes no precise accusations and gives no indication that MEEI was\n\naware of particular instances of misappropriation.\n\n           b.   Applying Massachusetts Tolling Law\n\n           We have held that \"the Massachusetts court does not\n\nequate suspicion with knowledge, but is explicit in requiring\n\nactual knowledge, or, as an equivalent, full means of detecting the\n\nfraud.\"    Id. (internal quotation omitted).               The district court\n\nrejected MEEI's reliance on Tracerlab, because it found that the\n\n1992 letter, among other evidence, showed that MEEI actually\n\nbelieved   it    had      a     cause    of     action     for     trade     secret\n\nmisappropriation.        The district court believed that plaintiffs\n\n\n\n14\n     The district court also placed weight on the deposition\ntestimony of MEEI's witness Lisa Petukian that Miller had said that\nsome of her data had been shared with CIBA Vision. However, from\nthis testimony, we do not know whether Miller knew anything about\nthe scope of the misappropriations or whether they were more than\nisolated events.\n\n                                        -47-\n\fclearly had more knowledge of QLT's misappropriations than the\n\nplaintiffs    had   in   Tracerlab,      where     the    court   found    that    the\n\nplaintiff's belief was based on \"gossamer threads of speculation,\n\nsuspicion and surmise.\"          Id. at 100.\n\n            However, we find Tracerlab instructive. As in this case,\n\nthe plaintiffs in Tracerlab knew that the defendants possessed the\n\ntrade secrets in question.          Id. at 99 (\"There is no question but\n\nthat [the     plaintiff]    was    aware    from    the    beginning      that    [the\n\ndefendants] knew plaintiff's trade secrets\" because they were\n\nformer employees of the plaintiff.) Furthermore, in Tracerlab, the\n\ncourt found that the plaintiff was \"well aware from the very outset\n\nthat [the defendants] had gone into the [same] field and were\n\nproducing a competitive product.\"              Id. at 100.        Still, in that\n\ncase, we found that \"all of this is a far different thing from\n\nhaving knowledge that the defendant had misappropriated and was\n\nusing the self-same . . .           trade secrets . . . underl[ying] the\n\npresent cause of action.\"         Id.   Moreover, unlike most trade secret\n\ncases, during much of the time in question in this case, use of\n\nMEEI's trade secrets by data recipients like CIBA Vision would\n\nstill have remained behind closed doors, as product development was\n\nnot yet complete.        Therefore, MEEI was even less likely to become\n\naware of any unauthorized disclosures.\n\n             \"Although the Massachusetts legislature has set statutory\n\nlimitations    periods     for    various      causes     of   action[,]    .     .   .\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\fdetermining when claims accrue 'has long been the product of\n\njudicial interpretation.'\" Cambridge Plating Co., 991 F.2d at 25\n\n(quoting   Franklin   v.

Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT\n\nPhototherapeutics, Inc., No. 00-10783, at 12 (D. Mass. Apr. 23,\n\n2002) (sealed memorandum in support of summary judgment).          This is\n\nnot a case in which MEEI claims only that it did not know how much\n\nit had been harmed; rather, MEEI claims that it did not know that\n\nit had been harmed at all.\n\n           c.   MEEI's Awareness of Some of QLT's Misappropriations\n\n           In order for the statute of limitations to start to run,\n\n\"an event or events [must] have occurred that are reasonably likely\n\nto have put the plaintiff on notice that he has been harmed.\"\n\nStark, 736 N.E.2d at 442 (citing Bowen, 557 N.E.2d at 741).          We do\n\nnot believe that in a complex case of this nature -- where trade\n\nsecrets of varying importance are alleged to have been divulged\n\n\n                                 -49-\n\fover a period of years -- that notice of one misappropriation can\n\nconstitute sufficient notice to begin tolling the statute for all\n\nmisappropriations. Although we are not prepared to state a general\n\nrule, in a case such as this one, a wronged party should not be\n\nprejudiced with regards to later torts committed against it, simply\n\nbecause a defendant started the clock running by committing similar\n\nacts at an earlier time. Statutes of limitations provide necessary\n\nclosure    and   fairness   for    potential        defendants.      However,   a\n\nplaintiff must be able to decide when the harms it has sustained\n\nrequire bringing suit, and no defendant should be able to immunize\n\nitself from later, potentially graver claims, by openly engaging in\n\nprior, similar offenses that the future plaintiff does not believe\n\nwarrant bringing suit.\n\n            MEEI has not denied knowledge of some of QLT's alleged\n\ntrade secrets misappropriations.              The record does not, however,\n\nindicate   that   MEEI    knew    of   all,    or    substantially    all,   such\n\nmisappropriations.       Furthermore, MEEI's claims are strengthened by\n\nthe existence of the Confidentiality Agreement and QLT's repeated\n\nassurances that its trade secrets were not being disclosed.                     To\n\nassume that MEEI knew the full extent of disclosure to CIBA Vision\n\nwould be to assume that MEEI was already aware that it was on the\n\nverge of being cut out of any future profits from the newly\n\ndeveloped photodynamic therapy. Though this may be the case, we do\n\n\n\n\n                                       -50-\n\fnot believe that such a factual judgment can be made at the summary\n\njudgment stage.\n\n           QLT points out that MEEI does not claim that it gained\n\nany additional knowledge in the years prior to filing suit in 2000,\n\nand thus MEEI could just as easily have filed suit more than three\n\nyears prior.     However, this fact alone is not sufficient to show\n\nthat MEEI should have filed suit earlier.          Because of the nature of\n\nthe claim, it is possible that some of MEEI's trade secret claims\n\nwere only shots in the dark at the time MEEI filed its complaint,\n\nand that MEEI only learned of the facts substantiating some of its\n\nclaim   after    receiving      discovery.     Although   the    fact   that   a\n\nplaintiff files suit is usually strong evidence that he knows the\n\nfacts underlying each of his own claims, filing suit does not\n\nprove, in itself, that he has sufficient knowledge to prevent\n\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\n\n           d.    Fraudulent Concealment or Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n           Since the district court found that MEEI had actual\n\nknowledge of QLT's alleged misappropriations, it did not need to\n\nreach   the     question   of     whether    QLT   actively     concealed   its\n\ndisclosures of MEEI's trade secrets.           Having found that the issue\n\nof MEEI's knowledge of its trade secret claims was not properly\n\ndecided on summary judgment, we believe that MEEI's claims based on\n\nfraudulent concealment should also survive summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\f              Where a \"defendant[] 'made representations [he] knew or\n\nshould have known would induce the plaintiff to put off bringing\n\nsuit and . . . the plaintiff did in fact delay in reliance on the\n\nrepresentations,'\" the statute of limitations is tolled.

Furthermore, considering\n\nthe evidence that QLT continued licensing negotiations at least in\n\npart because it feared suit by MEEI, it is reasonable at this\n\nsummary judgment stage to assume that QLT's purpose in making\n\nassurances to MEEI could have been to delay a suit that would\n\ninclude trade secret claims.\n\n              In addition, MEEI's claim that QLT owed fiduciary duties\n\nto MEEI has some persuasive force.           Fiduciary duties exist \"when a\n\nparty to a contract expressly repose[s] a trust or confidence in\n\nthe   other    party\"   or   \"where   the    contract   or   transaction   was\n\nintrinsically     fiduciary    and,   therefore,    required    perfect    good\n\nfaith.\" 26 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts, § 69:23 (4th\n\ned. 2004).      By entering into their joint research relationship,\n\nMEEI and QLT each put their valuable trade secrets in the others'\n\nhands, arguably requiring full disclosure of any misappropriation\n\nof those secrets.       Furthermore, in Massachusetts, if a defendant\n\nfails to learn of a trade secret violation due to a fiduciary's\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\ffailure to disclose, then plaintiffs do not have a duty to exercise\n\ndue diligence.

Having remanded the unjust enrichment and\n\ntrade secret     claims,    we   also   remand   MEEI's   93A   unfair   trade\n\npractices claims, noting that the success of the unfair trade\n\npractices claims is not necessarily dependent on the success of the\n\nunjust enrichment or trade secret claims.\n\n          Massachusetts General Law ch. 93A, § 2 provides that\n\n\"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\n\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" are unlawful.\n\nMass. Gen. Law ch. 93A, § 2.            In determining whether a practice\n\nviolates Chapter 93A, we look to \"(1) whether the practice . . . is\n\nwithin at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or\n\nother established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral,\n\nunethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; [and] (3) whether it causes\n\nsubstantial    injury      to    consumers   (or   competitors     or    other\n\nbusinessmen).\"     PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917 (Mass. 1975) (quotations omitted). We believe that\n\nthe same allegations underlying MEEI's unjust enrichment claim\n\ncould potentially meet these requirements. Moreover, MEEI alleges\n\nthat QLT's trade secret misappropriations played an integral part\n\nin cutting MEEI out of its fair share of the ample profit from the\n\nsale of Visudyne.    From the record developed thus far, this court\n\nsees no reason why these allegations and possibly others could not\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\fmeet all three of the 93A factors.        Under Massachusetts law,\n\nmisappropriation of trade secrets alone can constitute a violation\n\nof Chapter 93A.   See, e.g., Jillian's Billiard Club of Am., Inc. v.\n\nBeloff Billiards, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2232301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2232301/jillians-billiard-club-v-beloff-billiards/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. App. Ct. 1993).\n\nThus, we remand MEEI's unfair trade practices claim along with its\n\nunjust enrichment and trade secret claims.\n\n                          IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.\n\n          Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. No\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                -55-\n\f</pre>",
