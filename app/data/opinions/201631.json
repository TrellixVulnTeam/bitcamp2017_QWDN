Gonzáles was sworn in as United States Attorney General\non February 3, 2005.      We have therefore substituted Attorney\nGeneral Gonzáles for his predecessor in office as respondent in\nthis matter. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.        Petitioner Stella Olujoke Falae,\n\na Nigerian national, seeks review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) denying her application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).        The petitioner argues that the BIA erred in\n\nsummarily upholding an immigration judge's determination that she\n\nwas not a credible witness and that, therefore, she had failed to\n\nestablish    eligibility      for   relief.       In   the   alternative,    the\n\npetitioner argues that the BIA should have allowed her motion to\n\nremand based upon new evidence.          After careful review, we conclude\n\nthat the decision below is supported by substantial evidence and\n\nthat the BIA did not misuse its discretion in rejecting the motion\n\nto remand.     Consequently, we deny the petition for review.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            On   or   about   December      13,   1993,   the   petitioner   was\n\nadmitted as a nonimmigrant visitor to the United States through the\n\nuse of a Nigerian passport and visa obtained under a false name.\n\nShe was authorized to remain in the United States until January 12,\n\n1994.   She overstayed that authorization and, in May of 1994, she\n\nfiled an application for asylum in which she claimed, inter alia,\n\nthat she had been persecuted in her homeland due to her decision to\n\nconvert from Islam to Christianity.\n\n             The petitioner's fiancé, Michael Falae, followed her from\n\nNigeria to the United States.        After having encountered some bumps\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fin the road — Michael wed, and then divorced, another woman — the\n\ncouple   married      on    July     19,     1997.      For       a    time,    immigration\n\nproceedings     involving        the    petitioner          and    Michael      Falae    were\n\nconsolidated.        Eventually, however, the two went their separate\n\nways and the immigration proceedings were uncoupled.                           We deal here\n\nexclusively with Stella Olujoke's petition.                           We resolved Falae's\n\ncase in a companion opinion filed earlier today.                               See Falae v.\n\nGonzáles, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 04-1288].\n\n           On    May       18,   1999,       Stella    and    Michael       were    jointly\n\ninterviewed     by    an    asylum     officer,       who    found      them    lacking    in\n\ncredibility     and    referred        the    matter    of        their   status    to    the\n\nimmigration court. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(INS) instituted removal proceedings,1 the petitioner conceded\n\nremovability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the CAT.                  A series of hearings before an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ) followed.               These hearings continued through\n\nJune 18, 2002. We succinctly summarize the petitioner's testimony.\n\n           The petitioner stated that she was born in 1965 to a\n\ndevout Muslim family.              She grew up in Ondo Town, Nigeria, and\n\npracticed the Islamic religion until age fifteen.                              She was then\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\neliminated the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004). For simplicity's sake, we continue to refer to the INS\nthroughout this opinion.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fintroduced to Christianity and began to participate in local church\n\nactivities.    She eventually decided to abandon Islam entirely and\n\nbecame a member of the Celestial Church of Christ.         She fell in\n\nlove with Michael Falae, a Christian, and planned to marry him.\n\n          The    petitioner's   parents   did   not   accept    the   news\n\ngraciously.     They were outraged at the thought of their daughter\n\nmarrying out of the faith.      When she brought Falae home, family\n\nmembers   \"beat him up.\"    She too endured her parents' wrath; her\n\nfather punched her in the face, bloodying her nose.\n\n             At that point, her family began a pattern of abuse\n\ndirected against her.    This abuse ranged from the bizarre (locking\n\nher inside the local mosque) to the mundane (refusing to pay her\n\ntuition at the local college) to the physically dangerous (denying\n\nher food).\n\n          The abuse was not carried out only by family members. On\n\none occasion, the petitioner was waiting for a bus.            A passerby\n\noffered her a lift.     Once she was inside the car, he brandished a\n\nknife and told her that he had been sent by her parents to kill\n\nher.   Another incident occurred on December 25, 1992.          While the\n\npetitioner was driving home from services with fellow churchgoers,\n\neight Muslim men waylaid the car, dragged the occupants onto the\n\nstreet, doused the vehicle with gasoline, and set it on fire.         They\n\nthen chased the petitioner and stabbed her in the back with a\n\nbroken bottle, causing severe injuries.     A third incident occurred\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fon September 16, 1993; a Muslim man struck the petitioner on the\n\nhead with \"iron\" as she was en route to a religious ceremony.    The\n\nresulting injuries required \"stitches all over\" and hospitalization\n\nfor seventeen days.    She fled the country to escape from further\n\nviolence.\n\n            The IJ was unmoved by this horrific tale.   She found the\n\npetitioner wholly lacking in credibility, so much so that she\n\nconcluded that the petitioner had never been a Muslim, that she had\n\nnever been harassed, that she did not flee to escape abuse, and\n\nthat she had no reason to fear persecution should she return to\n\nNigeria.    The IJ bolstered her conclusions with specific findings.\n\nWe summarize the most pertinent findings below:\n\n            1.   The petitioner had entered the country\n            using a false passport and visa, yet offered\n            no explanation as to why she could not have\n            obtained genuine travel documents in her own\n            name.\n\n            2.     The  petitioner   presented  a   birth\n            certificate at the hearings, which was\n            reliably determined by forensic experts to be\n            fraudulent.\n\n            3.        There   were    numerous    internal\n            inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony.\n            For example, although the petitioner claimed\n            to have been raised in a devout Muslim home\n            and to have practiced the Islamic faith until\n            she was fifteen years of age, she could not\n            answer the most basic questions about that\n            religion.   Moreover, she could not read any\n            Arabic, recite any Islamic prayers, name any\n            part of the Koran, or identify any Muslim\n            holiday (other than Ramadan).\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          4.   The petitioner garbled the facts with\n          respect to the history of her relationship\n          with Michael Falae.       For example, she\n          testified that the two had met in 1990, yet\n          she had stated in the asylum interview that\n          they had met in either 1980 or 1985.\n\n          5.    The petitioner presented conflicting\n          accounts   of   the    alleged   incidents   of\n          persecution.       In    her   written   asylum\n          application, she offered one version of her\n          alleged encounter with the man sent by her\n          parents,   stating    that   he   knocked   her\n          unconscious and took her to a nearby village.\n          In her asylum interview, she neglected to\n          mention any details regarding this incident.\n          In her testimony before the IJ, she made no\n          claim that she had been knocked unconscious,\n          but said that the man brandished a knife and\n          that she had lost control of her bowels and\n          soiled herself (details glaringly absent from\n          her prior presentations). She was similarly\n          inconsistent with regard to the alleged attack\n          of September 16, 1993.          In her asylum\n          application, she claimed that she had been\n          beaten by a gang of Muslim youths and had been\n          rescued by friends. In her testimony before\n          the IJ, she related that a single individual\n          had struck her with \"iron\" and that she had\n          been admitted to the hospital for head trauma.\n          This alleged hospital stay was not mentioned\n          in the petitioner's asylum application and the\n          petitioner did not produce the hospital\n          records.2\n\n          6.   The combined demeanor of the petitioner\n          and Michael Falae (whom the petitioner had\n          called as a witness) led the IJ to conclude\n          that both her testimony and his was evasive\n          and untruthful.   The IJ noted, among other\n\n\n    2\n      She did offer a letter as \"proof\" that the hospitalization\noccurred, but the IJ had no way to authenticate the letter and\nrejected the proffer. The IJ noted that, in any event, the letter\nconflicted with the petitioner's testimony, since the letter\nrelated only that she was treated with injections and tablets,\nmaking no mention of stitches.\n\n                               -6-\n\f              things, that Falae attempted several times to\n              \"coach\" the petitioner and vice versa.\n              Moreover, the two repeatedly looked to each\n              other for answers as they testified.\n\n              The    petitioner's        case    rested      squarely    on    her    own\n\ntestimony.          Because    that     testimony     was    not   credible,    the    IJ\n\nconcluded that she had not carried her burden of proving either\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSimilarly, she had not proved that it was more likely than not that\n\nshe   would    undergo        torture    if     she   were    removed    to    Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, the IJ denied the application for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n              The petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA.                      While\n\nher appeal was pending, she moved to remand the case to the IJ\n\nbased upon new evidence:          a psychological evaluation purporting to\n\nexplain     the      petitioner's       evasive       demeanor     and   inconsistent\n\ntestimony during the hearings.                   On January 29, 2004, the BIA\n\nsummarily affirmed the IJ's decision and denied the motion to\n\nremand.     As to the latter, the BIA found that the report was not\n\n\"new evidence\" inasmuch as the underlying information on which it\n\nrested was available at the time of the hearings and could have\n\nbeen proffered to the IJ.             As an alternate ground, the BIA found\n\nthe report immaterial, as the IJ's adverse credibility finding was\n\nnot based upon demeanor alone.                  This timely petition for review\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fII.    DISCUSSION\n\n              We treat sequentially the petitioner's claims that the\n\nBIA erred (i) in summarily affirming the denial of her asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT claims, and (ii) in refusing to\n\nreopen the proceedings below.\n\n                              A.    The Asylum Claim.\n\n              We turn first to the asylum claim. In order to establish\n\nan entitlement to asylum, an alien bears the burden of showing that\n\nshe is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration laws.                        See\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nsee also 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).                    A refugee is\n\na person who cannot or will not return to her home country \"because\n\nof persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"            8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 124.\n\n              We   review     findings       of   fact    in    immigration      cases,\n\nincluding      credibility         determinations,        under   the    substantial\n\nevidence standard.          Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's asylum\n\ndetermination, we review directly the IJ's decision as if it were\n\nthe decision of the BIA.             Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 490\n\n(1st   Cir.    2005).        We    review    agency      determinations     of   fact,\n\nincluding     credibility         assessments,     under    a   highly   deferential\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fstandard.    We must affirm the findings upon which the decision\n\nrests if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"        INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).     Stated another way, the\n\nfindings must stand unless the record evidence is such as to compel\n\na reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.       See Da\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 4-5; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\n            The petitioner's claim for asylum revolves around her\n\nasseveration that she was persecuted on the basis of her religious\n\naffiliation.3    The IJ found her testimony to be incredible and\n\nsupported this finding with several subsidiary findings.         These\n\nincluded book-and-verse references to significant inconsistencies\n\nin the petitioner's testimony, her persistent resort to fraudulent\n\ndocumentation, and her demeanor during the hearings.           We have\n\nexplained before — and today reaffirm — that when \"the judicial\n\nofficer who saw and heard [a] witness makes an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination   and   supports   that   determination   with   specific\n\nfindings, an appellate court should treat that determination with\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We note in passing that the petitioner's account, even if\ncredited, likely would have been legally insufficient. In order to\nground an asylum application, persecution ordinarily must be\npracticed or at least condoned by the government. See Da Silva,\n394 F.3d at 7; Ananeh-Firempong v. INS, 766 F.2d 621, 622-23 (1st\nCir. 1985). The record in this case does not make that connection.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fgreat respect.\"   Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   This is such a case.4\n\n           That effectively ends this aspect of the matter.   When a\n\npetitioner's case depends on the veracity of her own testimony, a\n\nfully supported adverse credibility determination, without more,\n\ncan sustain a denial of asylum.    See Forgue v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 401\n\nF.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Dia v. Ashcroft, 353\n\nF.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc) (\"An alien's credibility, by\n\nitself, may satisfy his burden, or doom his claim.\").\n\n           Here, the IJ's specific findings strongly corroborate her\n\nglobal finding that the petitioner's testimony lacked credibility.\n\nThese included the petitioner's use of false documentation to enter\n\nthe country and her presentation of a bogus birth certificate to\n\nthe court. This type of fraudulent behavior, if not satisfactorily\n\nexplained,5 may reflect directly and adversely on a petitioner's\n\n\n     4\n      Section 101(a)(3) of Title I of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.\nL. No. 109-13, § 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. 231, 303 (2005) (to be\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)), contains new standards\nreferable to credibility determinations in cases involving\n\"applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from\nremoval.\" Id. § 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. at 305. These standards are\nonly applicable, however, to applications \"made on or after\" May\n11, 2005 (the date of enactment). See id. Since the petitioner's\napplication was made long prior to that date, the new standards\nhave no bearing here.\n     5\n      As the IJ noted, \"there may be a reason, fully consistent\nwith the claim of asylum, that will cause a person to possess false\ndocuments, such as the creation and use of a false document to\nescape persecution by facilitating travel.\"     Here, however, the\npetitioner put forth no evidence indicating that she had attempted\nto apply for an authentic passport, that one had been denied, or\n\n                                  -10-\n\foverall credibility.    See United States v. Williams, 986 F.2d 86,\n\n89 (4th Cir. 1993); In re O-D-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA\n\n1998).    So too the inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony,\n\nwhich went to the fundamental elements of her persecution claim.\n\nThese inconsistencies, in and of themselves, offered a solid\n\nfoundation for the IJ's determination.         See Toure v. Ashcroft, 400\n\nF.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2005); Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194\n\nF.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           To say more on this subject would be to paint the lily.\n\nWe hold, without serious question, that the IJ's decision that the\n\npetitioner failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           B.   The Withholding of Removal and CAT Claims.\n\n           The petitioner's remaining two substantive claims can be\n\nswiftly dispatched.    A claim for withholding of removal \"places a\n\nmore stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart\n\nclaim for asylum.\"     Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 123 (citing\n\nMakhoul    v.   Ashcroft,   387   F.3d   75,    82   (1st   Cir.   2004)).\n\nConsequently, the denial of the petitioner's asylum claim perforce\n\nserves to defeat her counterpart claim for withholding of removal.\n\n           The petitioner's attempt to obtain judicial review of the\n\ndenial of her claim for protection under the CAT is equally\n\n\n\nthat she feared that her persecutors would attempt to stop her if\nshe traveled under her own name.\n\n                                  -11-\n\funavailing.        The   petitioner    failed   to   make   any    developed\n\nargumentation in support of that claim before the BIA.             Thus, the\n\ndoctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bans any attempt\n\non her part to resurrect the issue here.        See Makhoul, 387 F.3d at\n\n80 (holding that the court of appeals is without jurisdiction to\n\nconsider points not squarely raised before the BIA); Alvarez-Flores\n\nv. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).\n\n                         C.   The Motion to Remand.\n\n            This leaves the BIA's denial of the motion to remand.\n\nThe petitioner requested that relief based on the contents of a\n\npsychological report proffered to explain the inconsistencies in\n\nher testimony and her demeanor while testifying.                 The report,\n\nauthored by Dr. Ronald A. Cohen (a neuropsychologist), limned the\n\nresults of a series of cognitive tests administered on May 13,\n\n2003.   Dr. Cohen's diagnosis was that the petitioner suffered from\n\nimpaired memory and diminished cognitive ability.                  He noted,\n\nhowever, that it was at least possible that the petitioner had\n\nexaggerated her symptoms during the testing.\n\n            The BIA appropriately treated this motion as a motion to\n\nreopen.    See    Falae, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 7] (citing In re\n\nCoelho, 20 I. & N. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992)).         Given concerns about\n\nfinality    and    expeditious    processing,   motions     to    reopen   are\n\ngenerally disfavored.         INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988);\n\nFesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).                Broadly\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fstated, the movant must make a showing of a \"prima facie case for\n\nthe   underlying    substantive    relief     sought\"     and    must    identify\n\n\"previously unavailable, material evidence.\"              Mabikas v. INS, 358\n\nF.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Even then, the movant\n\nmust persuade the BIA to exercise its discretion affirmatively.\n\nJupiter, 396 F.3d at 490; Mabikas, 358 F.3d at 148.                   In the last\n\nanalysis,   then,   the   granting    or    denial   of   such    a     motion   is\n\ndiscretionary on the part of the BIA.         See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S.\n\n314, 323 (1992).\n\n            Viewed against this background, we decline to disturb the\n\nBIA's ruling for three reasons.            First, the BIA's determination\n\nthat the information underlying the report was not previously\n\nunavailable is well-supported.             The report recounts that the\n\npetitioner's alleged symptomotology began to manifest itself long\n\nin advance of the hearings.       The testing could have been performed\n\nduring the several years that elapsed between the docketing of the\n\npetitioner's case and the hearings at which she testified.                       The\n\nfact that the petitioner did not deem those symptoms important\n\nenough either to present them to the IJ or to secure a professional\n\nevaluation of them in a timely manner does not make the information\n\nabout the symptoms \"previously unavailable.\" See, e.g., Gebremaria\n\nv. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 734, 739 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f           This ground is dispositive, so we allude to the other two\n\nreasons in shorthand form.     The second reason why the BIA's ruling\n\nis sustainable relates to the inconclusive nature of the report,\n\nwhich    left   open   the   possibility   that   the   petitioner   was\n\nexaggerating her symptoms during the testing.      The final reason is\n\nthat the IJ's adverse credibility determination rested on much more\n\nthan the petitioner's testimonial demeanor (and, therefore, the\n\nproffer was not material).\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the BIA's denial of merits relief is supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record and that the BIA acted well\n\nwithin the realm of its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's\n\nmotion to remand.\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f",

The petitioner argues that the BIA erred in summarily upholding an immigration judge's determination that she was not a credible witness and that, therefore, she had failed to establish eligibility for relief. In the alternative, the petitioner argues that the BIA should have allowed her motion to remand based upon new evidence. After careful review, we conclude that the decision below is supported by substantial evidence and that the BIA did not misuse its discretion in rejecting the motion to remand. Consequently, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 13, 1993, the petitioner was admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor to the United States through the use of a Nigerian passport and visa obtained under a false name. She was authorized to remain in the United States until January 12, 1994. She overstayed that authorization and, in May of 1994, she filed an application for asylum in which she claimed, inter alia, that she had been persecuted in her homeland due to her decision to convert from Islam to Christianity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fiance, Michael Falae, followed her from Nigeria to the United States. After having encountered some bumps in the road &#8212; Michael wed, and then divorced, another woman &#8212; the couple married on July 19, 1997. For a time, immigration proceedings involving the petitioner and Michael Falae were consolidated. Eventually, however, the two went their separate ways and the immigration proceedings were uncoupled. We deal here exclusively with Stella Olujoke's petition. We resolved Falae's case in a companion opinion filed earlier today. <i>See Falae v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 11, 2005 WL 1355422 (1st Cir.2005) [No. 04-1288].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 18, 1999, Stella and Michael were jointly interviewed by an asylum officer, who found them lacking in credibility and referred the matter of their status to the immigration court. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) instituted removal proceedings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the petitioner conceded removability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. A series of hearings before an immigration judge (IJ) followed. These hearings continued through June 18, 2002. We succinctly summarize the petitioner's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner stated that she was born in 1965 to a devout Muslim family. She grew up in Ondo Town, Nigeria, and practiced the Islamic religion until age fifteen. She was then introduced to Christianity and began to participate in local church activities. She eventually decided to abandon Islam entirely and became a member of the Celestial Church of Christ. She fell in love with Michael Falae, a Christian, and planned to marry him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's parents did not accept the news graciously. They were outraged at the thought of their daughter marrying out of the faith. When she brought Falae home, family members \"beat him up.\" She too endured her parents' wrath; her father punched her in the face, bloodying her nose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, her family began a pattern of abuse directed against her. This abuse ranged from the bizarre (locking her inside the local mosque) to the mundane (refusing to pay her tuition at the local college) to the physically dangerous (denying her food).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuse was not carried out only by family members. On one occasion, the petitioner was waiting for a bus. A passerby offered her a lift. Once she was inside the car, he brandished a knife and told her that he had been sent by her parents to kill her. Another incident occurred on December 25, 1992. While the petitioner was driving home from services with fellow churchgoers, eight Muslim men waylaid the car, dragged the occupants onto the street, doused the vehicle with gasoline, and set it on fire. They then chased the petitioner and stabbed her in the back with a broken bottle, causing severe injuries. A third incident occurred on September 16, 1993; a Muslim man struck the petitioner on the head with \"iron\" as she was en route to a religious ceremony. The resulting injuries required \"stitches all over\" and hospitalization for seventeen days. She fled the country to escape from further violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ was unmoved by this horrific tale. She found the petitioner wholly lacking in credibility, so much so that she concluded that the petitioner had never been a Muslim, that she had never been harassed, that she did not flee to escape abuse, and that she had no reason to fear persecution should she return to Nigeria. The IJ bolstered her conclusions with specific findings. We summarize the most pertinent findings below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The petitioner had entered the country using a false passport and visa, yet offered no explanation as to why she could not have obtained genuine travel documents in her own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The petitioner presented a birth certificate at the hearings, which was reliably determined by forensic experts to be fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. There were numerous internal inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony. For example, although the petitioner claimed to have been raised in a devout Muslim home and to have practiced the Islamic faith until she was fifteen years of age, she could not answer the most basic questions about that religion. Moreover, she could not read any Arabic, recite any Islamic prayers, name any part of the Koran, or identify any Muslim holiday (other than Ramadan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The petitioner garbled the facts with respect to the history of her relationship with Michael Falae. For example, she testified that the two had met in 1990, yet she had stated in the asylum interview that they had met in either 1980 or 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The petitioner presented conflicting accounts of the alleged incidents of persecution. In her written asylum application, she offered one version of her alleged encounter with the man sent by her parents, stating that he knocked her unconscious and took her to a nearby village. In her asylum interview, she neglected to mention any details regarding this incident. In her testimony before the IJ, she made no claim that she had been knocked unconscious, but said that the man brandished a knife and that she had lost control of her bowels and soiled herself (details glaringly absent from her prior presentations). She was similarly inconsistent with regard to the alleged attack of September 16, 1993. In her asylum application, she claimed that she had been beaten by a gang of Muslim youths and had been rescued by friends. In her testimony before the IJ, she related that a single individual had struck her with \"iron\" and that she had been admitted to the hospital for head trauma. This alleged hospital stay was not mentioned in the petitioner's asylum application and the petitioner did not produce the hospital records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The combined demeanor of the petitioner and Michael Falae (whom the petitioner had called as a witness) led the IJ to conclude that both her testimony and his was evasive and untruthful. The IJ noted, among other things, that Falae attempted several times to \"coach\" the petitioner and vice versa. Moreover, the two repeatedly looked to each other for answers as they testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's case rested squarely on her own testimony. Because that testimony was not credible, the IJ concluded that she had not carried her burden of proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Similarly, she had not proved that it was more likely than not that she would undergo torture if she were removed to Nigeria. Accordingly, the IJ denied the application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA. While her appeal was pending, she moved to remand the case to the IJ based upon new evidence: a psychological evaluation purporting to explain the petitioner's evasive demeanor and inconsistent testimony during the hearings. On January 29, 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision and denied the motion to remand. As to the latter, the BIA found that the report was not \"new evidence\" inasmuch as the underlying information on which it rested was available at the time of the hearings and could have been proffered to the IJ. As an alternate ground, the BIA found the report immaterial, as the IJ's adverse credibility finding was not based upon demeanor alone. This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat sequentially the petitioner's claims that the BIA erred (i) in summarily affirming the denial of her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, and (ii) in refusing to reopen the proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Asylum Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the asylum claim. In order to establish an entitlement to asylum, an alien bears the burden of showing that she is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration laws. <i>See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a). A refugee is a person who cannot or will not return to her home country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>see also Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 124.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review findings of fact in immigration cases, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's asylum determination, we review directly the IJ's decision as if it were the decision of the BIA. <i>Jupiter v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir.2005). We review agency determinations of fact, including credibility assessments, under a highly deferential standard. We must affirm the findings upon which the decision rests if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Stated another way, the findings must stand unless the record evidence is such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4-5; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's claim for asylum revolves around her asseveration that she was persecuted on the basis of her religious affiliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ found her testimony to be incredible and supported this finding with several subsidiary findings. These included book-and-verse references to significant inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony, her persistent resort to fraudulent documentation, and her demeanor during the hearings. We have explained before &#8212; and today reaffirm &#8212; that when \"the judicial officer who saw and heard [a] witness makes an adverse credibility determination and supports that determination with specific findings, an appellate court should treat that determination with great respect.\" <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2004). This is such a case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. When a petitioner's case depends on the veracity of her own testimony, a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum. <i>See Forgue v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> 401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005); <i>see also Dia v. Ashcroft,</i> 353 F.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc) (\"An alien's credibility, by itself, may satisfy his burden, or doom his claim.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ's specific findings strongly corroborate her global finding that the petitioner's testimony lacked credibility. These included the petitioner's use of false documentation to enter the country and her presentation of a bogus birth certificate to the court. This type of fraudulent behavior, if not satisfactorily explained,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> may reflect directly and adversely on a petitioner's overall credibility. <i>See United States v. Williams,</i> 986 F.2d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1993); <i>In re O-D-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA 1998). So too the inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony, which went to the fundamental elements of her persecution claim. These inconsistencies, in and of themselves, offered a solid foundation for the IJ's determination. <i>See Toure v. Ashcroft,</i> 400 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS,</i> 194 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this subject would be to paint the lily. We hold, without serious question, that the IJ's decision that the petitioner failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Withholding of Removal and CAT Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's remaining two substantive claims can be swiftly dispatched. A claim for withholding of removal \"places a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim for asylum.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez,</i> 398 F.3d at 123 (citing <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir.2004)). Consequently, the denial of the petitioner's asylum claim perforce serves to defeat her counterpart claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's attempt to obtain judicial review of the denial of her claim for protection under the CAT is equally unavailing. The petitioner failed to make any developed argumentation in support of that claim before the BIA. Thus, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bans any attempt on her part to resurrect the issue here. <i>See Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 80 (holding that the court of appeals is without jurisdiction to consider points not squarely raised before the BIA); <i>Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> 909 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1990) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Motion to Remand.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the BIA's denial of the motion to remand. The petitioner requested that relief based on the contents of a psychological report proffered to explain the inconsistencies in her testimony and her demeanor while testifying. The report, authored by Dr. Ronald A. Cohen (a neuropsychologist), limned the results of a series of cognitive tests administered on May 13, 2003. Dr. Cohen's diagnosis was that the petitioner suffered from impaired memory and diminished cognitive ability. He noted, however, that it was at least possible that the petitioner had exaggerated her symptoms during the testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA appropriately treated this motion as a motion to reopen. <i>See Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 7] (citing <i>In re Coelho,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992)). Given concerns about finality and expeditious processing, motions to reopen are generally disfavored. <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <i>Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Broadly stated, the movant must make a showing of a \"prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought\" and must identify \"previously unavailable, material evidence.\" <i>Mabikas v. INS,</i> 358 F.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(1). Even then, the movant must persuade the BIA to exercise its discretion affirmatively. <i>Jupiter,</i> 396 F.3d at 490; <i>Mabikas,</i> 358 F.3d at 148. In the last analysis, then, the granting or denial of such a motion is discretionary on the part of the BIA. <i>See INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this background, we decline to disturb the BIA's ruling for three reasons. First, the BIA's determination that the information underlying the report was not previously unavailable is well-supported. The report recounts that the petitioner's alleged symptomotology began to manifest itself long in advance of the hearings. The testing could have been performed during the several years that elapsed between the docketing of the petitioner's case and the hearings at which she testified. The fact that the petitioner did not deem those symptoms important enough either to present them to the IJ or to secure a professional evaluation of them in a timely manner does not make the information about the symptoms \"previously unavailable.\" <i>See, e.g., Gebremaria v. Ashcroft,</i> 378 F.3d 734, 739 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ground is dispositive, so we allude to the other two reasons in shorthand form. The second reason why the BIA's ruling is sustainable relates to the inconclusive nature of the report, which left open the possibility that the petitioner was exaggerating her symptoms during the testing. The final reason is that the IJ's adverse credibility determination rested on much more than the petitioner's testimonial demeanor (and, therefore, the proffer was not material).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the BIA's denial of merits relief is supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the BIA acted well within the realm of its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's motion to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto R.

The petitioner argues that the BIA erred in summarily upholding an immigration judge's determination that she was not a credible witness and that, therefore, she had failed to establish eligibility for relief. In the alternative, the petitioner argues that the BIA should have allowed her motion to remand based upon new evidence. After careful review, we conclude that the decision below is supported by substantial evidence and that the BIA did not misuse its discretion in rejecting the motion to remand. Consequently, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about December 13, 1993, the petitioner was admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor to the United States through the use of a Nigerian passport and visa obtained under a false name. She was authorized to remain in the United States until January 12, 1994. She overstayed that authorization and, in May of 1994, she filed an application for asylum in which she claimed, inter alia, that she had been persecuted in her homeland due to her decision to convert from Islam to Christianity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fiance, Michael Falae, followed her from Nigeria to the United States. After having encountered some bumps in the road &#8212; Michael wed, and then divorced, another woman &#8212; the couple married on July 19, 1997. For a time, immigration proceedings involving the petitioner and Michael Falae were consolidated. Eventually, however, the two went their separate ways and the immigration proceedings were uncoupled. We deal here exclusively with Stella Olujoke's petition. We resolved Falae's case in a companion opinion filed earlier today. <i>See Falae v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790569\"><a href=\"/opinion/790569/michael-olusean-falae-aka-vincent-olanrewaju-adeyemi-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1355422</span></span> (1st Cir.2005) [No. 04-1288].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 18, 1999, Stella and Michael were jointly interviewed by an asylum officer, who found them lacking in credibility and referred the matter of their status to the immigration court. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) instituted removal proceedings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the petitioner conceded removability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. A series of hearings before an immigration judge (IJ) followed. These hearings continued through June 18, 2002. We succinctly summarize the petitioner's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner stated that she was born in 1965 to a devout Muslim family. She grew up in Ondo Town, Nigeria, and practiced the Islamic religion until age fifteen. She was then introduced to Christianity and began to participate in local church activities. She eventually decided to abandon Islam entirely and became a member of the Celestial Church of Christ. She fell in love with Michael Falae, a Christian, and planned to marry him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's parents did not accept the news graciously. They were outraged at the thought of their daughter marrying out of the faith. When she brought Falae home, family members \"beat him up.\" She too endured her parents' wrath; her father punched her in the face, bloodying her nose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, her family began a pattern of abuse directed against her. This abuse ranged from the bizarre (locking her inside the local mosque) to the mundane (refusing to pay her tuition at the local college) to the physically dangerous (denying her food).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuse was not carried out only by family members. On one occasion, the petitioner was waiting for a bus. A passerby offered her a lift. Once she was inside the car, he brandished a knife and told her that he had been sent by her parents to kill her. Another incident occurred on December 25, 1992. While the petitioner was driving home from services with fellow churchgoers, eight Muslim men waylaid the car, dragged the occupants onto the street, doused the vehicle with gasoline, and set it on fire. They then chased the petitioner and stabbed her in the back with a broken bottle, causing severe injuries. A third incident occurred on September 16, 1993; a Muslim man struck the petitioner on the head with \"iron\" as she was en route to a religious ceremony. The resulting injuries required \"stitches all over\" and hospitalization for seventeen days. She fled the country to escape from further violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ was unmoved by this horrific tale. She found the petitioner wholly lacking in credibility, so much so that she concluded that the petitioner had never been a Muslim, that she had never been harassed, that she did not flee to escape abuse, and that she had no reason to fear persecution should she return to Nigeria. The IJ bolstered her conclusions with specific findings. We summarize the most pertinent findings below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The petitioner had entered the country using a false passport and visa, yet offered no explanation as to why she could not have obtained genuine travel documents in her own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The petitioner presented a birth certificate at the hearings, which was reliably determined by forensic experts to be fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. There were numerous internal inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony. For example, although the petitioner claimed to have been raised in a devout Muslim home and to have practiced the Islamic faith until she was fifteen years of age, she could not answer the most basic questions about that religion. Moreover, she could not read any Arabic, recite any Islamic prayers, name any part of the Koran, or identify any Muslim holiday (other than Ramadan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The petitioner garbled the facts with respect to the history of her relationship with Michael Falae. For example, she testified that the two had met in 1990, yet she had stated in the asylum interview that they had met in either 1980 or 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The petitioner presented conflicting accounts of the alleged incidents of persecution. In her written asylum application, she offered one version of her alleged encounter with the man sent by her parents, stating that he knocked her unconscious and took her to a nearby village. In her asylum interview, she neglected to mention any details regarding this incident. In her testimony before the IJ, she made no claim that she had been knocked unconscious, but said that the man brandished a knife and that she had lost control of her bowels and soiled herself (details glaringly absent from her prior presentations). She was similarly inconsistent with regard to the alleged attack of September 16, 1993. In her asylum application, she claimed that she had been beaten by a gang of Muslim youths and had been rescued by friends. In her testimony before the IJ, she related that a single individual had struck her with \"iron\" and that she had been admitted to the hospital for head trauma. This alleged hospital stay was not mentioned in the petitioner's asylum application and the petitioner did not produce the hospital records.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The combined demeanor of the petitioner and Michael Falae (whom the petitioner had called as a witness) led the IJ to conclude that both her testimony and his was evasive and untruthful. The IJ noted, among other things, that Falae attempted several times to \"coach\" the petitioner and vice versa. Moreover, the two repeatedly looked to each other for answers as they testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's case rested squarely on her own testimony. Because that testimony was not credible, the IJ concluded that she had not carried her burden of proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Similarly, she had not proved that it was more likely than not that she would undergo torture if she were removed to Nigeria. Accordingly, the IJ denied the application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed this decision to the BIA. While her appeal was pending, she moved to remand the case to the IJ based upon new evidence: a psychological evaluation purporting to explain the petitioner's evasive demeanor and inconsistent testimony during the hearings. On January 29, 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision and denied the motion to remand. As to the latter, the BIA found that the report was not \"new evidence\" inasmuch as the underlying information on which it rested was available at the time of the hearings and could have been proffered to the IJ. As an alternate ground, the BIA found the report immaterial, as the IJ's adverse credibility finding was not based upon demeanor alone. This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat sequentially the petitioner's claims that the BIA erred (i) in summarily affirming the denial of her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, and (ii) in refusing to reopen the proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Asylum Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the asylum claim. In order to establish an entitlement to asylum, an alien bears the burden of showing that she is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration laws. <i>See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 124 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a).

Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's asylum determination, we review directly the IJ's decision as if it were the decision of the BIA. <i>Jupiter v.

We review agency determinations of fact, including credibility assessments, under a highly deferential standard.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992). Stated another way, the findings must stand unless the record evidence is such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination. <i>See Da Silva,</i> 394 F.3d at 4-5; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's claim for asylum revolves around her asseveration that she was persecuted on the basis of her religious affiliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The IJ found her testimony to be incredible and supported this finding with several subsidiary findings. These included book-and-verse references to significant inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony, her persistent resort to fraudulent documentation, and her demeanor during the hearings. We have explained before &#8212; and today reaffirm &#8212; that when \"the judicial officer who saw and heard [a] witness makes an adverse credibility determination and supports that determination with specific findings, an appellate court should treat that determination with great respect.\" <i>Laurent v.

When a petitioner's case depends on the veracity of her own testimony, a fully supported adverse credibility determination, without more, can sustain a denial of asylum. <i>See Forgue v. U.S. Atty.

These included the petitioner's use of false documentation to enter the country and her presentation of a bogus birth certificate to the court. This type of fraudulent behavior, if not satisfactorily explained,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> may reflect directly and adversely on a petitioner's overall credibility. <i>See United States v.

Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA 1998). So too the inconsistencies in the petitioner's testimony, which went to the fundamental elements of her persecution claim. These inconsistencies, in and of themselves, offered a solid foundation for the IJ's determination. <i>See Toure v.

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004)). Consequently, the denial of the petitioner's asylum claim perforce serves to defeat her counterpart claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's attempt to obtain judicial review of the denial of her claim for protection under the CAT is equally unavailing. The petitioner failed to make any developed argumentation in support of that claim before the BIA. Thus, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies bans any attempt on her part to resurrect the issue here. <i>See Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 80 (holding that the court of appeals is without jurisdiction to consider points not squarely raised before the BIA); <i>Alvarez-Flores v.

The petitioner requested that relief based on the contents of a psychological report proffered to explain the inconsistencies in her testimony and her demeanor while testifying. The report, authored by Dr. Ronald A. Cohen (a neuropsychologist), limned the results of a series of cognitive tests administered on May 13, 2003. Dr. Cohen's diagnosis was that the petitioner suffered from impaired memory and diminished cognitive ability. He noted, however, that it was at least possible that the petitioner had exaggerated her symptoms during the testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA appropriately treated this motion as a motion to reopen. <i>See Falae,</i> 411 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 7] (citing <i>In re Coelho,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992)). Given concerns about finality and expeditious processing, motions to reopen are generally disfavored. <i>INS v.

Even then, the movant must persuade the BIA to exercise its discretion affirmatively. <i>Jupiter,</i> 396 F.3d at 490; <i>Mabikas,</i> 358 F.3d at 148. In the last analysis, then, the granting or denial of such a motion is discretionary on the part of the BIA. <i>See INS v.

First, the BIA's determination that the information underlying the report was not previously unavailable is well-supported. The report recounts that the petitioner's alleged symptomotology began to manifest itself long in advance of the hearings. The testing could have been performed during the several years that elapsed between the docketing of the petitioner's case and the hearings at which she testified. The fact that the petitioner did not deem those symptoms important enough either to present them to the IJ or to secure a professional evaluation of them in a timely manner does not make the information about the symptoms \"previously unavailable.\" <i>See, e.g., Gebremaria v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787249\"><a href=\"/opinion/787249/kefay-gebremaria-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 739 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ground is dispositive, so we allude to the other two reasons in shorthand form. The second reason why the BIA's ruling is sustainable relates to the inconclusive nature of the report, which left open the possibility that the petitioner was exaggerating her symptoms during the testing. The final reason is that the IJ's adverse credibility determination rested on much more than the petitioner's testimonial demeanor (and, therefore, the proffer was not material).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the BIA's denial of merits relief is supported by substantial evidence in the record and that the BIA acted well within the realm of its discretion in rejecting the petitioner's motion to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto R.
