Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Warren D. Hutchison, with whom David J. Hatem, Jeffrey W.\nHallahan, and Donovan Hatem, LLP were on brief, for Appellant.\n     Charles E. Schaub, Jr., with whom Hinckley, Allen & Snyder\nLLP, Robert M. Connolly, Anne E. Gorham, Mark W. Leach, and Stites\n& Harbison, PLLC were on brief, for Appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 8, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           A federal jury ruled against\n\nCaldwell Tanks, Inc., the builder of a water tank, in an action it\n\nhad instituted against Haley & Ward, Inc. (Haley), the engineer on\n\nthe     water    tank   project.       Haley     had   counterclaimed    for\n\nindemnification of its expenses in defending the action against\n\nCaldwell, relying on a broadly worded indemnity agreement that ran\n\nfrom Caldwell as builder, to both the water tank owner, the\n\nBuzzards Bay Water District, and Haley as project engineer.              The\n\njury, which had been properly instructed, found for Haley on the\n\ncounterclaim and awarded $175,000 to Haley, thus reimbursing Haley\n\nfor defense costs that indemnitor Caldwell had forced it to incur.\n\n            The district court vacated the jury verdict for Haley on\n\nthe counterclaim.       See Caldwell Tanks, Inc. v. Tnemec Co., 417 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 179, 182-83 (D. Mass. 2006).          The court held as a matter\n\nof law that under Massachusetts law there could be no indemnity\n\nfrom Caldwell to Haley unless the agreement specified an express\n\nintent to permit such indemnification in indemnitor-indemnitee\n\nlitigation.      Id. at 182.        The court also recognized that its\n\ndecision might well have been otherwise if Haley's defense costs\n\nhad been incurred in response to a third-party claim against Haley\n\nfor its work on the project.         Id. at 182-83.\n\n            Haley appeals from the district court's judgment.            To\n\ndate,    there   are    no    Massachusetts    appellate   court   decisions\n\nprecisely on point.          The question before us does not concern all\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdisputes between indemnitors and indemnitees.                  It is limited to\n\nwhether Massachusetts courts have adopted a rule that an indemnity\n\nagreement must contain an express statement -- that the contract\n\ngoverns costs and attorney's fees incurred by an indemnitee in\n\ndefense of unsuccessful claims brought by its indemnitor -- in\n\norder to depart from the normal American rule that each party bears\n\nits own attorney's fees in litigation, win or lose.                      See Alyeska\n\nPipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 257\n\n(1975); Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S.\n\n714, 717 (1967).\n\n           We hold that Massachusetts has not adopted any such rule,\n\nand so reverse.       We have no need to address what special rules\n\nMassachusetts    might        apply   to    the    construction     of     indemnity\n\nagreements in other fact settings.\n\n                                           I.\n\n           Pursuant      to    a   contract       dated   August   29,    2000   (the\n\nContract), Caldwell served as the general contractor on a project\n\nto construct a one-million-gallon elevated steel water tank for the\n\nBuzzards   Bay   Water    District         in    Buzzards   Bay,   Massachusetts.\n\nPursuant to a separate contract with the Water District, Haley\n\nserved as project engineer.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f           On    August   24,    2001,    after      the   water    tank      had    been\n\nerected, Haley and the Water District, among others,1 attended a\n\n\"test patch meeting\" to determine whether the tank was ready to be\n\npainted.   Tests performed at the meeting revealed the presence in\n\ncertain areas of a black substance between the raw steel of the\n\ntank and the primer with which it had been coated.                       A number of\n\nattendees stated that they believed the substance to be mill scale,\n\na substance that forms on steel during production, which Caldwell\n\nshould have removed and which would interfere with the adhesion of\n\nthe paint and primer to the tank.               Thereafter, Haley stated to\n\nCaldwell   that    the    tank    surface      did    not    meet       the    Contract\n\nspecifications to which Caldwell had agreed.                Haley requested that\n\nCaldwell remove the black substance and reprime the tank before it\n\nwas   painted.     Eventually,     Caldwell       agreed     to    do    so,    without\n\nadmitting liability.\n\n           On September 10, 2003, Caldwell sued Haley for negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, claiming that Haley had failed to exercise\n\nreasonable care in determining and communicating to the involved\n\nparties that the black substance was mill scale.2                        In essence,\n\n      1\n          Caldwell        was    represented         at     the    meeting          by   a\nsubcontractor.\n      2\n          Caldwell also sued Tnemec Company, Inc., which supplied\nthe primer and other coatings specified in the Contract, Robert L.\nMerithew, Inc., which served as paint inspector on the project, and\nRighter Group, Inc., which during the project provided advice about\nthe Tnemec primer. Caldwell sued Tnemec for breach of contract,\nbreach of express and implied warranties, concealment and\n\n                                         -4-\n\fCaldwell's suit alleged that the problem was not mill scale at all,\n\nand was not Caldwell's fault.     Caldwell's argument was that the\n\nblack substance had been caused by the primer that Haley had\n\nrequired Caldwell to use, and that in any event the substance did\n\nnot compromise the integrity of the tank's surface coatings and\n\ntherefore did not need to be removed.\n\n            Haley asserted a counterclaim for indemnification of its\n\ndefense costs and any judgment rendered against it based on section\n\n19.1 of the Contract, an indemnity clause that provides:\n\n            The CONTRACTOR [Caldwell] will indemnify and\n            hold harmless the OWNER [the Water District]\n            and the ENGINEER [Haley] and their agents and\n            employees from and against all claims,\n            damages,   losses   and   expenses   including\n            attorney's fees arising out of or resulting\n            from the performance of the Work, provided\n            that any such claims, damage, loss or expense\n            is attributable to bodily injury, sickness,\n            disease or death, or to injury to or\n            destruction of tangible property including the\n            loss of use resulting therefrom; and is caused\n            in whole or in part by any negligent or\n            willful act or omission of the CONTRACTOR, and\n            SUB-CONTRACTOR, anyone directly or indirectly\n            employed by any of them or anyone for whose\n            acts any of them may be liable.\n\n            The case was tried before a federal jury in the District\n\nof Massachusetts.     Both Caldwell and Haley moved for directed\n\nverdicts.    The motions were denied and the case was submitted to\n\n\n\nnondisclosure, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and selling a defective\nproduct.     It   sued   Merithew   and   Righter  for   negligent\nmisrepresentation.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe   jury.      The   district       court   instructed     the    jury    on   the\n\nindemnification counterclaim as follows:\n\n              [I]f you find that Haley & Ward is entitled to\n              indemnification   from   Caldwell,  you   must\n              determine how much that indemnification will\n              be. Pursuant to the contract, indemnification\n              is to include an amount for all claims,\n              damages, losses and expenses arising out of or\n              resulting from the Buzzards Bay project,\n              including attorney's fees.\n\nCaldwell did not object to these instructions.                The jury returned\n\na verdict for Haley as defendant on the negligent misrepresentation\n\nclaim     and   for    Haley    as     claimant    on   the    indemnification\n\ncounterclaim, and awarded Haley $175,000, the sum of its defense\n\ncosts, in expenses.3         The jury did not, of course, address the\n\nquestion of whether if Caldwell had been successful in its suit\n\nagainst Haley the Contract entitled Haley to indemnification.\n\n              Caldwell then moved under Rule 50(b) for a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding        the     verdict        on   Haley's     indemnification\n\ncounterclaim,     arguing      that   under    Massachusetts       law   indemnity\n\nclauses do not apply to inter se litigation unless they expressly\n\nstate otherwise.4      The district court allowed the motion.              Caldwell\n\nTanks, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 183.          The court concluded that \"there is\n\n      3\n          The jury also found for defendants Tnemec, Merithew, and\nRighter on all claims.\n      4\n          Caldwell also argued that Haley could not as a matter of\nlaw recover the costs of defending itself against accusations of\nits own wrongful acts or of establishing a right to indemnity, and\nthat Haley had failed to prove that Caldwell's claim was\nindemnifiable.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fno right to indemnification of claims between an indemnitor and\n\nindemnitee    unless    the    contract    expressly    contemplates     such\n\nentitlement.\"   Id. at 182.      It based this conclusion on its reading\n\nof cases applying Massachusetts law and its own reasoning that\n\n            [w]here indemnification is sought in the\n            context of indemnitor-indemnitee litigation,\n            courts generally require that the provision\n            demonstrate a specific intent by the parties\n            that the indemnity operate in that context.\n                   In this case, although the subject\n            indemnity is broad enough to encompass\n            indemnification of a claim brought by Caldwell\n            against Haley, the contract bears no explicit\n            indicia that the parties intended that\n            interpretation. Indeed, if the provision is\n            deemed to entitle Haley to indemnification of\n            claims brought by Caldwell, it would just as\n            likely also apply to opposing claims brought\n            by Haley against Caldwell, which would surely\n            violate the principle that a party seeking to\n            enforce its rights against a wrongdoer is\n            nevertheless   responsible    for    its   own\n            attorney's fees.\n\nId.   The court in essence held that Massachusetts law has adopted\n\na rule that for an indemnification clause to apply in disputes\n\nbetween   indemnitors    and    indemnitees,   the     contract   must   bear\n\n\"explicit    indicia\"     that     the     parties     intended   such     an\n\ninterpretation.    See id.\n\n            Haley appeals, arguing that Massachusetts law does not\n\nrequire explicit language to enforce indemnity agreements in inter\n\nse litigation, and that the indemnity clause of the Contract\n\npermits the recovery of its costs in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f                                  II.\n\n           A district court may grant a Rule 50 motion only when\n\n\"after   examining   the   evidence   and   all   reasonable   inferences\n\ntherefrom 'in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,' it\n\ndetermines that 'the evidence could lead a reasonable person to\n\nonly one conclusion,' favorable to the movant.\"         Aetna Cas. Sur.\n\nCo. v. P & B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1556 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\n\nGallagher v. Wilton Enters., Inc., 962 F.2d 120, 124 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1) (\"If . . . a party has\n\nbeen fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on\n\nthat issue, the court may determine the issue against that party\n\nand may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law . . . .\").\n\nSince the court's ruling turned entirely on an issue of law, our\n\nreview is de novo.   Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling\n\nCo., 152 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"We review de novo a district\n\ncourt's decision to grant a motion under Rule 50 for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\").\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, where material facts are not in\n\ndispute, interpretation of an indemnity clause is an issue of law.\n\nPost v. Belmont Country Club, Inc., 805 N.E.2d 63, 67 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2004).   True ambiguities, which may lead to questions of the\n\nintent of the parties, may be resolved by a jury.        Seaco Ins.

Custeau, 155 N.E.2d\n\n159, 161 (Mass. 1959) (\"Where the terms of a written contract are\n\nambiguous, both parties may testify as to what they understood by\n\nthe terms of the contract when they executed it.

K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1989)).                 Although\n\nneither party offered any direct evidence as to the parties'\n\nintentions in executing the indemnification agreement, because the\n\nissue was submitted to the jury, which ruled for Haley, we take it\n\nthat if there were any true ambiguity in the Contract, it has been\n\nresolved in Haley's favor.\n\n            The indemnity clause on which Haley relies expressly\n\ncontemplates        indemnification      of   litigation    costs,   including\n\nattorney's fees. Nonetheless, Caldwell argues that indemnification\n\nis inappropriate in this case because the clause does not expressly\n\nprovide for indemnification of costs incurred in the course of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\finter se litigation.             Caldwell argues that Massachusetts law\n\nrequires such specificity.           We disagree.\n\n            In Shea v. Bay State Gas Co., 418 N.E.2d 597 (Mass.\n\n1981), the Supreme Judicial Court rejected arguments that under\n\nMassachusetts law contracts of indemnity should be (1) strictly\n\nconstrued or (2) construed against the drafter.                   Id. at 600.     Shea\n\nheld that even when the indemnity claim involves losses flowing\n\nfrom the indemnitee's negligence, \"something less than an express\n\nreference     in    the   contract      to   losses      from    the    indemnitee's\n\nnegligence as indemnifiable will suffice to make them so if the\n\nintent   otherwise         sufficiently        appears     from        language    and\n\ncircumstances.\"       Id. (quoting Stern v. Larocca, 140 A.2d 403, 407\n\n(N.J. Super. Ct. 1958)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                       Shea\n\nalso cited United States v. Seckinger, 397 U.S. 203 (1970), for the\n\nproposition        that   \"a   clause    that    is   intended         to    encompass\n\nindemnification for the indemnitee's negligence . . . [need not]\n\nexplicitly     state      that    indemnification         extends       to    injuries\n\noccasioned by the indemnitee's negligence.\"                 Shea, 418 N.E.2d at\n\n600 (alteration in original) (quoting Seckinger, 397 U.S. at 213\n\nn.17) (internal quotation marks omitted).                The applicable rule of\n\nconstruction is that \"[c]ontract interpretation is largely an\n\nindividualized process, with the conclusion in a particular case\n\nturning on the particular language used against the background of\n\nother indicia of the parties' intention.\"                       Id.

H.P. Hood, Inc., 495 N.E.2d 880 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1986).      Speers held that \"an indemnity provision is no longer\n\nto be read with any bias in favor of the indemnitor and against the\n\nindemnitee; it is to be interpreted like any ordinary contract,\n\nwith attention to language, background, and purpose.\"                 Id. at 881\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n           Massachusetts law also has not adopted a special rule\n\nthat requires that indemnity contracts be read as only applying to\n\nthird parties unless there is explicit language to the contrary.\n\nSee Hill v. Cabot, No. 91-0514-E, 1994 Mass. Super. LEXIS 419, at\n\n*28 (Mass. Super. Ct.

Whittle v. Pagani Bros.\n\nConst.

See Black's Law Dictionary 784 (8th ed. 2004)\n\n(defining indemnity as \"[a] duty to make good any loss, damage, or\n\nliability incurred by another\" (emphasis added)).\n\n            The district court here implicitly and correctly ruled\n\nthat the language of the Contract did not preclude indemnity\n\narising from non-third-party suits, see Caldwell Tanks, 417 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 182, and we agree.       The language of section 19.1 of the\n\nContract is broad enough to encompass indemnity arising from suits\n\nbetween the indemnitor and indemnitee.\n\n            The district court nonetheless reasoned that because of\n\nthe particular nature of inter se claims under indemnity clauses,\n\nthe \"other indicia\" referred to in Shea must always mean \"explicit\n\nindicia.\"      Id.   In some inter se indemnity situations there may be\n\npublic policy reasons why Massachusetts law might adopt such a\n\nrule.   For example, Massachusetts could decide that for public\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fpolicy reasons it wished to avoid results that led to indemnifying\n\na wrongdoer for his own negligence.         There is some language in\n\nMassachusetts law, perhaps in tension with Shea, that supports the\n\nproposition that there must be express language to create such an\n\nobligation.    See Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co., 479 N.E.2d 1383,\n\n1384 (Mass. 1985) (\"The general rule is that there must be express\n\nlanguage creating an obligation to indemnify one against his own\n\nnegligence.\").        Even   so,     the     Post   court   held   that\n\n\"[i]ndemnification of a tortfeaser for damages caused by its own\n\nnegligence is not illegal, and is a question of the intent of the\n\nparties.\"   805 N.E.2d at 70; see also Shea, 418 N.E.2d at 600-01.\n\n            Here, however, Haley's counterclaim did not ask that it\n\nbe reimbursed for sums expended to defend against a suit in which\n\nits own negligence was established.        Rather, its counterclaim was\n\nthat it be allowed to recover expenses incurred as a result of\n\nCaldwell's suit against it, in which the jury found Haley not to\n\nhave been negligent.5    The district court relied heavily not on\n\nMassachusetts appellate authority, but rather on Petit v. BASF\n\nCorp., No. Civ.A. 96-1814A, 2001 Mass. Super. LEXIS 124 (Mass.\n\nSuper. Ct. Apr. 20, 2001), and one federal decision construing\n\nstate law, Astrolabe, Inc. v. Esoteric Techs. PTY, Ltd., No. Civ.A.\n\n01-11352, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5764 (D. Mass. Mar. 29, 2002).     See\n\n\n     5\n          Consequently,    Caldwell's   argument    that   strict\nconstruction of the indemnification clause is warranted because\nCaldwell had no control over Haley's actions is without merit.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fCaldwell Tanks, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 182.          But those cases were the\n\nreverse of this one; there, the indemnitees sought to recover their\n\nown self-inflicted costs incurred in prosecuting affirmative claims\n\nagainst an indemnitor.6     See Astrolabe, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5764,\n\nat *14-15; Petit, 2001 Mass. Super. LEXIS 124, at *2.            Moreover, in\n\nAstrolabe, the contract itself indicated that the indemnity clause\n\nwas to apply only to suits by third parties.         See 2002 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 5764, at *15-16.        In the situation exemplified by those\n\ncases, the indemnitor has strong arguments that it should not be\n\nrequired   to   reimburse   attorney's   fees,    over   which    it   had   no\n\ncontrol, for suits against it by an indemnitee.\n\n           The question here comes down to whether Massachusetts has\n\nadopted a rule that as a matter of law an indemnity contract cannot\n\nreshape the American rule in a dispute between indemnitor and\n\nindemnitee absent an express statement to that effect.             But it is\n\nwell accepted under Massachusetts law that parties may alter the\n\nAmerican rule by contract.     See, e.g., Whittle, 422 N.E.2d at 781;\n\nShea, 418 N.E.2d at 600.     The Contract here explicitly allowed for\n\n\n     6\n          In its brief, Caldwell also relies on Grant v. Hexalon\nReal Estate, Inc., No. 91-5338-D, 1997 Mass. Super. LEXIS 366\n(Mass. Super. Ct. Sept. 15, 1997), rev'd, 748 N.E.2d 1056 (Mass.\nApp. Ct. 2001), and Shan Indus., LLC v. Tyco Int'l (US), Inc., Civ.\nNo. 04-1018, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30170 (D.N.J. Nov. 30, 2005),\ntwo unpublished decisions applying Massachusetts law to determine\nwhether indemnity clauses applied to inter se lawsuits. Like Petit\nand Astrolabe, both Grant and Shan involved indemnification for the\ncost of claims brought by the indemnitee against the indemnitor,\nsee id. at *24; Grant, 1997 Mass. Super. LEXIS 366, at *7, and are\ntherefore not analogous to the case before us.\n\n                                  -14-\n\frecovery of defense costs, including attorney's fees.7                     It is\n\nequally well accepted under Massachusetts law that indemnification\n\nprovisions are construed in accordance with their ordinary and\n\nplain meaning and without any bias in favor of the indemnitor or\n\nagainst the indemnitee.           See, e.g., Herson v. New Boston Garden\n\nCorp., 667 N.E.2d 907, 911 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996); Kelly v. Dimeo,\n\nInc., 581 N.E.2d 1316, 1318 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991).\n\n               To bolster its argument, Caldwell cites to FDIC v.\n\nFedders Air Conditioning, USA, Inc., 821 F. Supp. 50 (D. Mass.\n\n1993), rev'd in part on other grounds, 35 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\na case applying Illinois law, and Hooper Assocs. Ltd. v. AGS\n\nComputers, Inc., 548 N.E.2d 903 (N.Y. 1989), and Bertaux v. Dreyfus\n\nTrust Co., Civ. A. No. 99-10815, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4077 (D.\n\nMass.       Mar.   12,   2002),   cases   applying   New   York   law,   for   the\n\nproposition that indemnity for inter se litigation should not be\n\ninferred unless explicitly provided for in the contract.                 We apply\n\nMassachusetts law.8\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          Caldwell makes much of the rule that \"[a] contract should\nbe construed to give it effect as a rational business instrument.\"\nLewis v. Chase, 505 N.E.2d 211, 214 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987).\nConstruing the indemnity clause to allow for indemnification in\nthis case, as the jury did here, is not irrational.\n        8\n          To the extent Caldwell cites to FDIC, Hooper, and Bertaux\nbecause they were relied upon by courts applying Massachusetts law\nin Grant, Petit, and Shan, we have already explained that those\ncases are inapposite.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f            Federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction are\n\nconstrained in their interpretation of state law.          See Douglas v.\n\nYork County, 433 F.3d 143, 149 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"As a federal court\n\nsitting in diversity, we try to apply our best understanding of the\n\nprinciples Maine has adopted. It is not our role to expand Maine\n\nlaw; that is left to the courts of Maine.\"); Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.\n\nof Am., 916 F.2d 731, 744 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"We have warned, time\n\nand again, that litigants who reject a state forum in order to\n\nbring suit in federal court under diversity jurisdiction cannot\n\nexpect that new trails will be blazed.\").       We lack the authority to\n\nestablish for Massachusetts new special rules for shifting defense\n\ncosts under inter se indemnity contracts like this.         Massachusetts\n\nlaw imposes no explicit statement rule for indemnity contracts\n\ngenerally, or for varying the American rule, and contains no\n\nassumption that indemnity provisions are restricted to third-party\n\nclaims.    Against that background, we will not fashion a new rule.\n\nWe hold that the district court erred.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            Caldwell makes four other arguments, any one of which, if\n\nvalid,    could   support   the   district   court's   judgment   on   other\n\ngrounds.    We discuss each briefly.\n\n            Caldwell relies on section 6.33 of the Contract and\n\nArticle 16 of the General Condition and Supplementary Conditions to\n\nargue that the Contract as a whole precludes reading section 19.1\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fto apply to disputes between Caldwell and Haley.             Section 6.33\n\nprovides:\n\n             The indemnification obligations of CONTRACTOR\n             [Caldwell] . . . shall not extend to the\n             liability of ENGINEER [Haley] and ENGINEER's\n             Consultants, officers, directors, employees or\n             agents caused by the professional negligence,\n             errors or omissions of any of them.\n\nThis, Caldwell argues, expresses an intent to specifically exclude\n\nclaims   against   the   Engineer   for    professional   negligence   from\n\nindemnification.      Article 16 requires that all claims between\n\nCaldwell and the Water District (also an indemnified party) be\n\nresolved by arbitration.     If the indemnification clause were read\n\nto apply inter se, Caldwell argues, Article 16 would be rendered\n\nmeaningless.     The issue was not argued to the trial court, and it\n\nis waived.    See States Res. Corp. v. The Architectural Team, Inc.,\n\n433 F.3d 73, 85 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[I]ssues not presented to the\n\ndistrict court cannot be raised on appeal.\"         (quoting Ouimette v.\n\nMoran, 942 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)); Violette v. Smith & Nephew Dyonics, Inc., 62 F.3d 8, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"An issue not presented to the trial court may not\n\nbe raised for the first time on appeal.\").\n\n             Caldwell also argues that judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict should enter on the basis that its claim against Haley --\n\none of negligent misrepresentation -- was not an indemnifiable\n\nclaim.   Caldwell made its argument to the district court in its\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fRule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law.              The district court\n\ndid not address the argument directly, but did state that \"the same\n\nclaim       brought   under    a   different   procedural    posture   might   be\n\nindemnifiable.\"        Caldwell Tanks, 417 F. Supp. 2d at 182.\n\n               We reject Caldwell's argument.           In finding for Haley on\n\nits counterclaim, the jury must necessarily have concluded that\n\nCaldwell's claim was indemnifiable.             A reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that Caldwell's claim met all three of the contractual\n\nrequirements for indemnification: that the claim and the resulting\n\nattorney's fees arose out of Caldwell's work on the Buzzards Bay\n\nWater Tank; that the claim was attributable to injury of tangible\n\nproperty, notably the water tank itself;9 and that the damage to\n\nthe water tank resulted from Caldwell's negligence.                    There was\n\nample evidence to that effect at trial, including testimony and\n\nquestionnaires indicating that the black substance was mill scale\n\nthat       Caldwell   should    have   removed,   and    various   reports   from\n\nindependent laboratories confirming as much.                A reasonable person\n\ncould have concluded, as the jury did, that Caldwell's negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim was indemnifiable under the Contract.                  See\n\nAetna Cas. Sur. Co., 43 F.3d at 1556.\n\n\n\n       9\n          Although the claim was for negligent misrepresentation,\nrather than for negligent conduct that actually caused the damage,\nthe dispute essentially was about whether there was damage and, if\nso, who should bear responsibility for the damage, and in that\nsense, it would have been reasonable to conclude that the claim was\nattributable to the damage.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f              Caldwell     argues      that     even      if     its      negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim was subject to the indemnification clause,\n\nHaley failed to prove its counterclaim because the jury made no\n\nfinding      that   Caldwell    was    negligent,      and     the    evidence   was\n\ninsufficient.       The argument, which arguably was preserved, fails.\n\nTo award defense costs to Haley, the jury must necessarily have\n\nfound that Caldwell was liable under the indemnity agreement.                     As\n\nwe have just noted, drawing all reasonable inferences from the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Haley, such a finding was\n\nreasonable.\n\n              Finally, Caldwell argues that Haley failed to apportion\n\nits attorney's fees to exclude those incurred in establishing its\n\nright to indemnity.        This argument was properly preserved, but it\n\nis without merit.        Caldwell cites the general rule that \"[a] claim\n\nfor attorney's fees and costs under an indemnification agreement\n\ndoes not extend to costs incurred in establishing the right of\n\nindemnity.\"     41 Am. Jur. 2d Indemnity § 30 (2006).                But here, Haley\n\nseeks   to    recover    its   costs   for    defending      against     Caldwell's\n\nnegligent misrepresentation claim.            Haley's defense to Caldwell's\n\nclaim and its proof of its counterclaim were co-extensive.                       That\n\ndefending itself against Caldwell's claim necessarily served to\n\nprove its counterclaim, and therefore its right to indemnity, does\n\nnot transform Haley's attorney's fees -- or any portion thereof --\n\nfrom indemnifiable into non-indemnifiable expenses.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f           The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\n\ncase is remanded with instructions to reinstate the verdict of the\n\njury.10   Costs are awarded to Haley.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n          Haley has indicated that it will seek indemnification of\nits attorney's fees for this appeal. That issue should be directed\nto the district court for consideration.\n\n                                -20-\n\f",

Pursuant to a separate contract with the Water District, Haley served as project engineer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 2001, after the water tank had been erected, Haley and the Water District, among others,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> attended a \"test patch meeting\" to determine whether the tank was ready to be painted. Tests performed at the meeting revealed the presence in certain areas of a black substance between the raw steel of the tank and the primer with which it had been coated. A number of attendees stated that they believed the substance to be mill scale, a substance that forms on steel during production, which Caldwell should have removed and which would interfere with the adhesion of the paint and primer to the tank. Thereafter, Haley stated to Caldwell that the tank surface did not meet the Contract specifications to which Caldwell had agreed. Haley requested that Caldwell remove the black substance and reprime the tank before it was painted. Eventually, Caldwell agreed to do so, without admitting liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 2003, Caldwell sued Haley for negligent misrepresentation, claiming that Haley had failed to exercise reasonable care in determining and communicating to the involved parties that the black substance was mill scale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In essence, Caldwell's suit alleged that the problem was not mill scale at all, and was not Caldwell's fault. Caldwell's argument was that the black substance had been caused by the primer that Haley had required Caldwell to use, and that in any event the substance did not compromise the integrity of the tank's surface coatings and therefore did not need to be removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haley asserted a counterclaim for indemnification of its defense costs and any judgment rendered against it based on section 19.1 of the Contract, an indemnity clause that provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CONTRACTOR [Caldwell] will indemnify and hold harmless the OWNER [the Water District] and the ENGINEER [Haley] and their agents and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses including attorney's fees arising out of or resulting from the performance of the Work, provided that any such claims, damage, loss or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property including the loss of use resulting therefrom; and is caused in whole or in part by any negligent or willful act or omission of the CONTRACTOR, and SUB-CONTRACTOR, anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried before a federal jury in the District of Massachusetts.

That is also true today. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary</i> 784 (8th ed.2004) (defining indemnity as \"[a] duty to make good <i>any</i> loss, damage, or liability incurred by another\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here implicitly and correctly ruled that the language of the Contract did not preclude indemnity arising from non-third-party suits, <i>see Caldwell Tanks,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 182, and we agree. The language of section 19.1 of the Contract is broad enough to encompass indemnity arising from suits between the indemnitor and indemnitee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless reasoned that because of the particular nature of inter se claims under indemnity clauses, the \"other indicia\" referred to in <i>Shea</i> must always mean \"explicit indicia.\" <i>Id.</i> In some inter se indemnity situations there may be public policy reasons why Massachusetts law might adopt such a rule. For example, Massachusetts could decide that for public policy reasons it wished to avoid results that led to indemnifying a wrongdoer for his own negligence. There is some language in Massachusetts law, perhaps in tension with <i>Shea,</i> that supports the proposition that there must be express language to create such an obligation. <i>See Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co.,</i> 395 Mass. 361, 479 N.E.2d 1383, 1384 (1985) (\"The general rule is that there must be express language creating an obligation to indemnify one against his own negligence.\"). Even so, the <i>Post</i> court held that \"[i]ndemnification of a tortfeaser for damages caused by its own negligence is not illegal, and is a question of the intent of the parties.\" 805 N.E.2d at 70; <i>see also Shea,</i> 418 N.E.2d at 600-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Haley's counterclaim did not ask that it be reimbursed for sums expended to defend against a suit in which its own negligence was established. Rather, its counterclaim was that it be allowed to recover expenses incurred as a result of Caldwell's suit against it, in which the jury found Haley not to have been negligent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court relied heavily not on Massachusetts appellate authority, but rather on <i>Petit v. BASF Corp.,</i> No. Civ.A. 96-1814A, 2001 WL 410358, 2001 Mass.Super. LEXIS 124 (Mass.Super.Ct. Apr. 20, 2001), and one federal decision construing state law, <i>Astrolabe, Inc. v. Esoteric Techs.

But those cases were the reverse of this one; there, the indemnitees sought to recover their own self-inflicted costs incurred in prosecuting affirmative claims against an indemnitor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Astrolabe,</i> 2002 WL 511520, at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist.

Moreover, in <i>Astrolabe,</i> the contract itself indicated that the indemnity clause was to apply only to suits by third parties. <i>See</i> 2002 WL 511520, at *5-6, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5764, at *15-16. In the situation exemplified by those cases, the indemnitor has strong arguments that it should not be required to reimburse attorney's fees, over which it had no control, for suits against it by an indemnitee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here comes down to whether Massachusetts has adopted a rule that as a matter of law an indemnity contract cannot reshape the American rule in a dispute between indemnitor and indemnitee absent an express statement to that effect. But it is well accepted under Massachusetts law that parties may alter the American rule by contract. <i>See, e.g., Whittle,</i> 422 N.E.2d at 781; <i>Shea,</i> 418 N.E.2d at 600. The Contract here explicitly allowed for recovery of defense costs, including attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It is equally well accepted under Massachusetts law that indemnification provisions are construed in accordance with their ordinary and plain meaning and without any bias in favor of the indemnitor or against the indemnitee. <i>See, e.g., Herson v.

We apply Massachusetts law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction are constrained in their interpretation of state law. <i>See Douglas v. York County,</i> 433 F.3d 143, 149 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"As a federal court sitting in diversity, we try to apply our best understanding of the principles Maine has adopted.

We lack the authority to establish for Massachusetts new special rules for shifting defense costs under inter se indemnity contracts like this. Massachusetts law imposes no explicit statement rule for indemnity contracts generally, or for varying the American rule, and contains no assumption that indemnity provisions are restricted to third-party claims. Against that background, we will not fashion a new rule. We hold that the district court erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell makes four other arguments, any one of which, if valid, could support the district court's judgment on other grounds. We discuss each briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell relies on section 6.33 of the Contract and Article 16 of the General and Supplementary Conditions to argue that the Contract as a whole precludes reading section 19.1 to apply to disputes between Caldwell and Haley. Section 6.33 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indemnification obligations of CONTRACTOR [Caldwell] . . . shall not extend to the liability of ENGINEER [Haley] and ENGINEER's Consultants, officers, directors, employees or agents caused by the professional negligence, errors or omissions of any of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, Caldwell argues, expresses an intent to specifically exclude claims against the Engineer for professional negligence from indemnification. Article 16 requires that all claims between Caldwell and the Water District (also an indemnified party) be resolved by arbitration. If the indemnification clause were read to apply inter se, Caldwell argues, Article 16 would be rendered meaningless. The issue was not argued to the trial court, and it is waived. <i>See States Res. Corp. v. The Architectural Team, Inc.,</i> 433 F.3d 73, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[I]ssues not presented to the district court cannot be raised on appeal.\" (quoting <i>Ouimette v. Moran,</i> 942 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Violette v. Smith &amp; Nephew Dyonics, Inc.,</i> 62 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1995) (\"An issue not presented to the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell also argues that judgment notwithstanding the verdict should enter on the basis that its claim against Haley &#8212; one of negligent misrepresentation &#8212; was not an indemnifiable claim. Caldwell made its argument to the district court in its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law. The district court did not address the argument directly, but did state that \"the same claim brought under a different procedural posture might be indemnifiable.\" <i>Caldwell Tanks,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Caldwell's argument. In finding for Haley on its counterclaim, the jury must necessarily have concluded that Caldwell's claim was indemnifiable. A reasonable jury could have found that Caldwell's claim met all three of the contractual requirements for indemnification: that the claim and the resulting attorney's fees arose out of Caldwell's work on the Buzzards Bay Water Tank; that the claim was attributable to injury of tangible property, notably the water tank itself;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and that the damage to the water tank resulted from Caldwell's negligence. There was ample evidence to that effect at trial, including testimony and questionnaires indicating that the black substance was mill scale that Caldwell should have removed, and various reports from independent laboratories confirming as much. A reasonable person could have concluded, as the jury did, that Caldwell's negligent misrepresentation claim was indemnifiable under the Contract. <i>See Aetna Cas. Sur. Co.,</i> 43 F.3d at 1556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell argues that even if its negligent misrepresentation claim was subject to the indemnification clause, Haley failed to prove its counterclaim because the jury made no finding that Caldwell was negligent, and the evidence was insufficient. The argument, which arguably was preserved, fails. To award defense costs to Haley, the jury must necessarily have found that Caldwell was liable under the indemnity agreement. As we have just noted, drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to Haley, such a finding was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Caldwell argues that Haley failed to apportion its attorney's fees to exclude those incurred in establishing its right to indemnity. This argument was properly preserved, but it is without merit. Caldwell cites the general rule that \"[a] claim for attorney's fees and costs under an indemnification agreement does not extend to costs incurred in establishing the right of indemnity.\" 41 Am.Jur.2d <i>Indemnity</i> &#167; 30 (2006). But here, Haley seeks to recover its costs for defending against Caldwell's negligent misrepresentation claim. Haley's defense to Caldwell's claim and its proof of its counterclaim were co-extensive. That defending itself against Caldwell's claim necessarily served to prove its counterclaim, and therefore its right to indemnity, does not transform Haley's attorney's fees &#8212; or any portion thereof &#8212; from indemnifiable into non-indemnifiable expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>reversed,</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> with instructions to reinstate the verdict of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Costs are awarded to Haley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Caldwell was represented at the meeting by a subcontractor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Caldwell also sued Tnemec Company, Inc., which supplied the primer and other coatings specified in the Contract, Robert L.

Pursuant to a separate contract with the Water District, Haley served as project engineer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 24, 2001, after the water tank had been erected, Haley and the Water District, among others,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> attended a \"test patch meeting\" to determine whether the tank was ready to be painted. Tests performed at the meeting revealed the presence in certain areas of a black substance between the raw steel of the tank and the primer with which it had been coated. A number of attendees stated that they believed the substance to be mill scale, a substance that forms on steel during production, which Caldwell should have removed and which would interfere with the adhesion of the paint and primer to the tank. Thereafter, Haley stated to Caldwell that the tank surface did not meet the Contract specifications to which Caldwell had agreed. Haley requested that Caldwell remove the black substance and reprime the tank before it was painted. Eventually, Caldwell agreed to do so, without admitting liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 2003, Caldwell sued Haley for negligent misrepresentation, claiming that Haley had failed to exercise reasonable care in determining and communicating to the involved parties that the black substance was mill scale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In essence, Caldwell's suit alleged that the problem was not mill scale at all, and was not Caldwell's fault. Caldwell's argument was that the black substance had been caused by the primer that Haley had required Caldwell to use, and that in any event the substance did not compromise the integrity of the tank's surface coatings and therefore did not need to be removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haley asserted a counterclaim for indemnification of its defense costs and any judgment rendered against it based on section 19.1 of the Contract, an indemnity clause that provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CONTRACTOR [Caldwell] will indemnify and hold harmless the OWNER [the Water District] and the ENGINEER [Haley] and their agents and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses including attorney's fees arising out of or resulting from the performance of the Work, provided that any such claims, damage, loss or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property including the loss of use resulting therefrom; and is caused in whole or in part by any negligent or willful act or omission of the CONTRACTOR, and SUB-CONTRACTOR, anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them or anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried before a federal jury in the District of Massachusetts. Both Caldwell and Haley moved for directed verdicts. The motions were denied and the case was submitted to the jury. The district court instructed the jury on the indemnification counterclaim as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f you find that Haley &amp; Ward is entitled to indemnification from Caldwell, you must determine how much that indemnification will be. Pursuant to the contract, indemnification is to include an amount for all claims, damages, losses and expenses arising out of or resulting from the Buzzards Bay project, including attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell did not object to these instructions. The jury returned a verdict for Haley as defendant on the negligent misrepresentation claim and for Haley as claimant on the indemnification counterclaim, and awarded Haley $175,000, the sum of its defense costs, in expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The jury did not, of course, address the question of whether if Caldwell had been successful in its suit against Haley the Contract entitled Haley to indemnification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell then moved under Rule 50(b) for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Haley's indemnification counterclaim, arguing that under Massachusetts law indemnity clauses do not apply to inter se litigation unless they expressly state otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court allowed the motion. <i>Caldwell Tanks,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 183. The court concluded that \"there is no right to indemnification of claims between an indemnitor and indemnitee unless the contract expressly contemplates such entitlement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 182. It based this conclusion on its reading of cases applying Massachusetts law and its own reasoning that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here indemnification is sought in the context of indemnitor-indemnitee litigation, courts generally require that the provision demonstrate a specific intent by the parties that the indemnity operate in that context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, although the subject indemnity is broad enough to encompass indemnification of a claim brought by Caldwell against Haley, the contract bears no explicit indicia that the parties intended that interpretation. Indeed, if the provision is deemed to entitle Haley to indemnification of claims brought by Caldwell, it would just as likely also apply to opposing claims brought by Haley against Caldwell, which would surely violate the principle that a party seeking to enforce its rights against a wrongdoer is nevertheless responsible for its own attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> The court in essence held that Massachusetts law has adopted a rule that for an indemnification clause to apply in disputes between indemnitors and indemnitees, the contract must bear \"explicit indicia\" that the parties intended such an interpretation. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Haley appeals, arguing that Massachusetts law does not require explicit language to enforce indemnity agreements in inter se litigation, and that the indemnity clause of the Contract permits the recovery of its costs in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may grant a Rule 50 motion only when \"after examining the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom `in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,' it determines that `the evidence could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion,' favorable to the movant.\" <i>Aetna Cas.

That is also true today. <i>See Black's Law Dictionary</i> 784 (8th ed.2004) (defining indemnity as \"[a] duty to make good <i>any</i> loss, damage, or liability incurred by another\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here implicitly and correctly ruled that the language of the Contract did not preclude indemnity arising from non-third-party suits, <i>see Caldwell Tanks,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 182, and we agree. The language of section 19.1 of the Contract is broad enough to encompass indemnity arising from suits between the indemnitor and indemnitee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nonetheless reasoned that because of the particular nature of inter se claims under indemnity clauses, the \"other indicia\" referred to in <i>Shea</i> must always mean \"explicit indicia.\" <i>Id.</i> In some inter se indemnity situations there may be public policy reasons why Massachusetts law might adopt such a rule. For example, Massachusetts could decide that for public policy reasons it wished to avoid results that led to indemnifying a wrongdoer for his own negligence. There is some language in Massachusetts law, perhaps in tension with <i>Shea,</i> that supports the proposition that there must be express language to create such an obligation. <i>See Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050410/rathbun-v-western-massachusetts-electric-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2050410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2050410/rathbun-v-western-massachusetts-electric-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1383</span></a></span>, 1384 (1985) (\"The general rule is that there must be express language creating an obligation to indemnify one against his own negligence.\"). Even so, the <i>Post</i> court held that \"[i]ndemnification of a tortfeaser for damages caused by its own negligence is not illegal, and is a question of the intent of the parties.\" 805 N.E.2d at 70; <i>see also Shea,</i> 418 N.E.2d at 600-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Haley's counterclaim did not ask that it be reimbursed for sums expended to defend against a suit in which its own negligence was established. Rather, its counterclaim was that it be allowed to recover expenses incurred as a result of Caldwell's suit against it, in which the jury found Haley not to have been negligent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court relied heavily not on Massachusetts appellate authority, but rather on <i>Petit v.

But those cases were the reverse of this one; there, the indemnitees sought to recover their own self-inflicted costs incurred in prosecuting affirmative claims against an indemnitor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Astrolabe,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">511520</span></span>, at *5, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

In the situation exemplified by those cases, the indemnitor has strong arguments that it should not be required to reimburse attorney's fees, over which it had no control, for suits against it by an indemnitee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here comes down to whether Massachusetts has adopted a rule that as a matter of law an indemnity contract cannot reshape the American rule in a dispute between indemnitor and indemnitee absent an express statement to that effect. But it is well accepted under Massachusetts law that parties may alter the American rule by contract. <i>See, e.g., Whittle,</i> 422 N.E.2d at 781; <i>Shea,</i> 418 N.E.2d at 600. The Contract here explicitly allowed for recovery of defense costs, including attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It is equally well accepted under Massachusetts law that indemnification provisions are construed in accordance with their ordinary and plain meaning and without any bias in favor of the indemnitor or against the indemnitee. <i>See, e.g., Herson v.

We lack the authority to establish for Massachusetts new special rules for shifting defense costs under inter se indemnity contracts like this. Massachusetts law imposes no explicit statement rule for indemnity contracts generally, or for varying the American rule, and contains no assumption that indemnity provisions are restricted to third-party claims. Against that background, we will not fashion a new rule. We hold that the district court erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell makes four other arguments, any one of which, if valid, could support the district court's judgment on other grounds. We discuss each briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell relies on section 6.33 of the Contract and Article 16 of the General and Supplementary Conditions to argue that the Contract as a whole precludes reading section 19.1 to apply to disputes between Caldwell and Haley. Section 6.33 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indemnification obligations of CONTRACTOR [Caldwell] . . . shall not extend to the liability of ENGINEER [Haley] and ENGINEER's Consultants, officers, directors, employees or agents caused by the professional negligence, errors or omissions of any of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, Caldwell argues, expresses an intent to specifically exclude claims against the Engineer for professional negligence from indemnification. Article 16 requires that all claims between Caldwell and the Water District (also an indemnified party) be resolved by arbitration. If the indemnification clause were read to apply inter se, Caldwell argues, Article 16 would be rendered meaningless. The issue was not argued to the trial court, and it is waived. <i>See States Res.

Caldwell made its argument to the district court in its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law. The district court did not address the argument directly, but did state that \"the same claim brought under a different procedural posture might be indemnifiable.\" <i>Caldwell Tanks,</i> 417 F.Supp.2d at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Caldwell's argument. In finding for Haley on its counterclaim, the jury must necessarily have concluded that Caldwell's claim was indemnifiable. A reasonable jury could have found that Caldwell's claim met all three of the contractual requirements for indemnification: that the claim and the resulting attorney's fees arose out of Caldwell's work on the Buzzards Bay Water Tank; that the claim was attributable to injury of tangible property, notably the water tank itself;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and that the damage to the water tank resulted from Caldwell's negligence. There was ample evidence to that effect at trial, including testimony and questionnaires indicating that the black substance was mill scale that Caldwell should have removed, and various reports from independent laboratories confirming as much. A reasonable person could have concluded, as the jury did, that Caldwell's negligent misrepresentation claim was indemnifiable under the Contract. <i>See Aetna Cas. Sur. Co.,</i> 43 F.3d at 1556.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caldwell argues that even if its negligent misrepresentation claim was subject to the indemnification clause, Haley failed to prove its counterclaim because the jury made no finding that Caldwell was negligent, and the evidence was insufficient. The argument, which arguably was preserved, fails. To award defense costs to Haley, the jury must necessarily have found that Caldwell was liable under the indemnity agreement. As we have just noted, drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to Haley, such a finding was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Caldwell argues that Haley failed to apportion its attorney's fees to exclude those incurred in establishing its right to indemnity. This argument was properly preserved, but it is without merit. Caldwell cites the general rule that \"[a] claim for attorney's fees and costs under an indemnification agreement does not extend to costs incurred in establishing the right of indemnity.\" 41 Am.Jur.2d <i>Indemnity</i> &#167; 30 (2006). But here, Haley seeks to recover its costs for defending against Caldwell's negligent misrepresentation claim. Haley's defense to Caldwell's claim and its proof of its counterclaim were co-extensive. That defending itself against Caldwell's claim necessarily served to prove its counterclaim, and therefore its right to indemnity, does not transform Haley's attorney's fees &#8212; or any portion thereof &#8212; from indemnifiable into non-indemnifiable expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>reversed,</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> with instructions to reinstate the verdict of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Costs are awarded to Haley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Caldwell was represented at the meeting by a subcontractor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Caldwell also sued Tnemec Company, Inc., which supplied the primer and other coatings specified in the Contract, Robert L.
