Petitioners, Sandra F. Massie and her\n\nhusband, Franky Massie (collectively, \"Petitioners\"), seek review\n\nof an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming\n\nthe   Immigration    Judge's   decision     to   deny    Sandra     Massie's\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").       Finding no merit to\n\nPetitioners' arguments, we affirm the BIA's order and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          Petitioners are natives and citizens of Indonesia—she of\n\nthe Ambonese ethnic group and he of Manadonese descent—who came to\n\nthe United States on tourist visas in December 2000.               After the\n\ncouple failed to leave the United States as required, Mrs. Massie\n\nfiled an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder CAT with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").1\n\nMr. Massie was listed as a rider on Mrs. Massie's application.\n\n          In her asylum application, Mrs. Massie stated that she\n\ndid not want to return to Indonesia because she feared that she\n\nwould be persecuted based on her religion (Protestant) and her race\n\n(Ambonese).2   She    explained   that    Christianity   was   a    minority\n\n\n\n      1\n      The functions of INS have since been transferred to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n      2\n      Mrs. Massey was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia,\nalthough her family was originally from the Moluku islands in\neastern Indonesia, of which Ambon is a part.\n\n                                  -2-\n\freligion in Indonesia, that Muslim Jihadists had killed thousands\n\nof Christians in 1998, that Christians continue to suffer because\n\nof   their   minority   status,   that      there   is   no   safe    place   for\n\nChristians to live in Indonesia, and that finding a job would be\n\ndifficult for her because of her religion and race.\n\n             After being placed in removal proceedings, Petitioners\n\ntestified before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") at an asylum hearing.\n\nNeither indicated that she/he had ever been detained, arrested, or\n\nphysically harmed while living in Indonesia.             Mrs. Massie described\n\nsome incidents of harassment and intimidation; Mr. Massie denied\n\nhaving experienced any such incidents.\n\n             Mrs.   Massie   stated   that,    while     driving     in   Jakarta\n\nsometime in 1998, she had twice been accosted on a street by some\n\nMuslim men who demanded money for \"Jihad in Ambon.\"                On the first\n\noccasion, the Muslims broke her car window before she agreed to\n\ngive them money.        On the second occasion, she gave them money\n\nwithout further incident.       Describing a riot that had occurred in\n\nher neighborhood in 1998, Mrs. Massie said that she was trapped in\n\nher house for a period of time but that nothing had happened to her\n\nhome, which she said was \"pretty safe\" because of its location.\n\nSpeaking of her parents, who—along with her sister and her in-\n\nlaws—continue to live in Indonesia,3 Mrs. Massie said that they had\n\n\n\n      3\n      Mrs. Massie's parents, in-laws, and sister are—like the\nMassies—practicing Christians.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fto meet and pray in a movie theater because a group of Jihadists\n\nhad forced the closure of their church.          Mrs. Massie did not\n\ndescribe any other mistreatment suffered by her relatives in\n\nIndonesia.\n\n          Mrs. Massie also testified that her brother had died\n\nfollowing a 1983 automobile accident.        She speculated that her\n\nbrother—a Christian—died because he received untimely, substandard\n\ncare in a Muslim-dominated government hospital.\n\n          Petitioners both testified about Mr. Massie's serious\n\nmedical problems.    Mrs. Massie said that, when they were living in\n\nNew Hampshire in 2002, her husband had undergone four operations on\n\nhis right lung.     While admitting that he was not sure whether any\n\nadditional surgery would be needed, Mr. Massie said that his doctor\n\nwas then concerned about a spot on his left lung.            Both Massies\n\nsaid they doubted that the medical community in Indonesia could or\n\nwould provide the same level of care that Mr. Massie had received\n\nin the United States.\n\n          When Mrs. Massie attempted to testify about conditions in\n\nAmbon, Respondent's counsel objected, noting that Mrs. Massey had\n\nno personal knowledge about conditions in Ambon because neither she\n\nnor her husband had ever lived in Ambon.        The IJ sustained the\n\nobjection,   explaining   that   country   reports   would    suffice   to\n\ndescribe current conditions in Ambon.\n\n          The IJ denied Petitioners' asylum claim, finding that\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fPetitioners failed to establish either past persecution or a\n\nreasonable basis for fear of future persecution.            The IJ also\n\ndetermined that, because they failed to satisfy the standard for\n\nasylum eligibility, Petitioners necessarily failed to satisfy the\n\nhigher standards for withholding of removal and for relief under\n\nCAT.   The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of all three claims, finding\n\nthat Petitioners failed to satisfy their burdens of proof with\n\nregard to all of the relief sought.\n\n            On appeal to the BIA, Petitioners complained that a\n\nportion of the testimony before the IJ—specifically, Mrs. Massie's\n\ntestimony concerning the death of her brother—was missing from the\n\nappellate record. The BIA denied Petitioner's request for an order\n\ndirecting a full transcription, explaining that Petitioners had\n\nfailed to allege that the missing testimony would \"somehow turn the\n\ncase.\" Indeed, the BIA noted that, in denying Petitioners' claims,\n\nthe IJ had relied not on Mrs. Massie's testimony regarding her\n\nbrother's medical treatment but on the lack of corroboration.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Our review, directed to the BIA's decision, is de novo on\n\nquestions    of   law   but   deferential   as   to   factual   findings.\n\nMukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Asylum applicants bear the burden of proving that they\n\nare unable or unwilling to return to their home country \"because of\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\frace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,   or    political    opinion.\"       8   U.S.C.    §   1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nApplicants may meet this burden by (1) demonstrating a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution; (2) by establishing past persecution,\n\nin which case a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution arises; or (3) by demonstrating \"compelling reasons for\n\nbeing unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of\n\nthe severity of the past persecution.\"            Mukamusoni, 390 F.3d at\n\n119; 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(ii) (1997).\n\n             Because the word \"persecution\" has not been defined by\n\nstatute, the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, has the\n\nauthority to give content to the word in the first instance.\n\nBocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st. Cir. 2005).               Although\n\nthe BIA has chosen to determine what constitutes persecution on a\n\ncase-by-case basis, it is clear that the term \"requires that the\n\ntotality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere\n\ndiscomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\"\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005); see also\n\nTopalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (upholding\n\nthe BIA’s finding of no persecution where petitioner was arrested,\n\ndetained, and beaten on seven occasions); Bocova, 412 F.3d at\n\n263-64 (upholding the BIA’s finding of no persecution where the\n\npetitioner was twice arrested, beaten, and threatened with death,\n\nwith   one    of   those   beatings   causing    the     petitioner   to   lose\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconsciousness and to be taken to the hospital); Guzman v. INS, 327\n\nF.3d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming the BIA's determination\n\nthat a serious beating did not amount to persecution).          The term,\n\nmoreover, \"always implies some connection to government action or\n\ninaction.\"    Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120-21 (quoting Harutyunyan v.\n\nGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n           Here, the BIA found that Petitioners utterly failed to\n\nestablish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.       Given the precedents and the evidence produced by\n\nPetitioners, this court must accept the BIA's fact-based findings.\n\nClearly,     the   past   incidents   of    discrimination   described   by\n\nPetitioners—sporadic incidents involving no physical abuse—did not\n\n\"add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment,\n\nor unfair treatment.\"         Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120.         Just as\n\nclearly, Petitioners offered nothing to establish a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.\n\n           Petitioners complain that the BIA erred (1) by failing to\n\norder the transcription of the missing portion of Mrs. Massie's\n\ntestimony regarding her brother's 1983 death; (2) by requiring\n\ncorroboration of Mrs. Massie's testimony regarding the cause of her\n\nbrother's death; and (3) by affirming the IJ's evidentiary ruling\n\nprohibiting Mrs. Massie from testifying about conditions in Ambon,\n\nwhere she never lived. According to Petitioners, \"there would have\n\nbeen a finding of past persecution\" had the BIA not committed such\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ferrors.   We disagree.\n\n           Where there is a failure of transcription, we have held\n\nthat a claimant \"must show 'specific prejudice to his ability to\n\nperfect an appeal' sufficient to rise to the level of a due process\n\nviolation.\"    Kheireddine v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (quoting United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)).   There can be no prejudice if the missing portion of the\n\ntranscript is not material to the issue on review, if the missing\n\nmaterial can be derived from other sources, or if the transcription\n\nfailure makes no difference to the outcome of the review.          Id. at\n\n85-86. Here, Petitioners make no effort to explain how the missing\n\ntestimony differed from other material in the record (i.e., Mrs.\n\nMassie's affidavit describing the incident involving her brother).\n\nThey do not identify anything in the missing testimony that would\n\ndraw   into   question   the   IJ's    conclusion   that   Mrs.   Massie's\n\nassertion—that her brother was denied timely, appropriate medical\n\ntreatment based on his race and religion—was speculative at best.\n\nThey altogether fail to demonstrate that the outcome of the case\n\nwould have been different had the BIA had the benefit of the\n\nmissing transcript.      Quite simply, their claim of error in this\n\nregard is meritless.\n\n           The IJ's evidentiary ruling refusing to allow Mrs. Massie\n\nto testify about conditions in Ambon is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 476 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f2005).    Because neither Mrs. Massie nor Mr. Massie ever lived in\n\nAmbon, they had no first-hand knowledge about the conditions in\n\nAmbon.    The IJ did not abuse his discretion in refusing to admit\n\nsuch testimony; and the BIA did not err in upholding the IJ's\n\nruling.\n\n           An IJ is not required to accept as true an asylum\n\napplicant's speculation as to the cause of an event.         Ziu v.\n\nGonzalez, 412 F.3d 202, 204 (1st Cir. 2005).   Here, both the IJ and\n\nthe BIA were correct in concluding that Mrs. Massie's speculation\n\nabout the cause of her brother's death lacked \"the requisite degree\n\nof specificity to sustain the petitioner’s burden of proof\" without\n\nsome sort of corroboration.    Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    Even if poor treatment were presumed based on\n\nMrs. Massie's lay testimony, Mrs. Massie could do no more than\n\nsurmise that her brother's allegedly poor treatment was the result\n\nof his race and/or religion. Furthermore, it was apparent from Mr.\n\nMassie's testimony that his concerns about medical treatment in\n\nIndonesia were based not on any fear that he would obtain poor\n\nmedical treatment because of his ethnicity or religion but rather\n\non his perception that nobody in Indonesia could give him the\n\nquality of care that he received in the United States.    Under the\n\ncircumstances, it was not error to require corroboration.\n\n                                III.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the BIA's order\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fand DENY Petitioners' petition for review.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Although it appears that Petitioners do not challenge the\nBIA's decision upholding the IJ's denial of Petitioners'\nwithholding of removal and CAT claims, we note that our decision\nregarding asylum dooms any such challenge. See Alvarez-Flores v.\nINS, 909 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that \"[s]ince the\nstandard for withholding deportation is more stringent, a\npetitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori,\nto satisfy the former\"); Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 73 (1st\nCir. 2006) (explaining that, \"[i]n order to find sanctuary under\nthe CAT, . . . an alien must show that he will more likely than not\nbe tortured upon returning to his homeland,\" \"torture\" being\ndefined as \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether\nphysical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person\").\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Finding no merit to\n\nPetitioners' arguments, we affirm the BIA's order and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          Petitioners are natives and citizens of Indonesia—she of\n\nthe Ambonese ethnic group and he of Manadonese descent—who came to\n\nthe United States on tourist visas in December 2000.

Both Massies\n\nsaid they doubted that the medical community in Indonesia could or\n\nwould provide the same level of care that Mr. Massie had received\n\nin the United States.\n\n          When Mrs. Massie attempted to testify about conditions in\n\nAmbon, Respondent's counsel objected, noting that Mrs. Massey had\n\nno personal knowledge about conditions in Ambon because neither she\n\nnor her husband had ever lived in Ambon.        The IJ sustained the\n\nobjection,   explaining   that   country   reports   would    suffice   to\n\ndescribe current conditions in Ambon.\n\n          The IJ denied Petitioners' asylum claim, finding that\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fPetitioners failed to establish either past persecution or a\n\nreasonable basis for fear of future persecution.            The IJ also\n\ndetermined that, because they failed to satisfy the standard for\n\nasylum eligibility, Petitioners necessarily failed to satisfy the\n\nhigher standards for withholding of removal and for relief under\n\nCAT.   The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of all three claims, finding\n\nthat Petitioners failed to satisfy their burdens of proof with\n\nregard to all of the relief sought.\n\n            On appeal to the BIA, Petitioners complained that a\n\nportion of the testimony before the IJ—specifically, Mrs. Massie's\n\ntestimony concerning the death of her brother—was missing from the\n\nappellate record. The BIA denied Petitioner's request for an order\n\ndirecting a full transcription, explaining that Petitioners had\n\nfailed to allege that the missing testimony would \"somehow turn the\n\ncase.\" Indeed, the BIA noted that, in denying Petitioners' claims,\n\nthe IJ had relied not on Mrs. Massie's testimony regarding her\n\nbrother's medical treatment but on the lack of corroboration.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Our review, directed to the BIA's decision, is de novo on\n\nquestions    of   law   but   deferential   as   to   factual   findings.\n\nMukamusoni v.

Given the precedents and the evidence produced by\n\nPetitioners, this court must accept the BIA's fact-based findings.\n\nClearly,     the   past   incidents   of    discrimination   described   by\n\nPetitioners—sporadic incidents involving no physical abuse—did not\n\n\"add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment,\n\nor unfair treatment.\"         Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120.         Just as\n\nclearly, Petitioners offered nothing to establish a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.\n\n           Petitioners complain that the BIA erred (1) by failing to\n\norder the transcription of the missing portion of Mrs. Massie's\n\ntestimony regarding her brother's 1983 death; (2) by requiring\n\ncorroboration of Mrs. Massie's testimony regarding the cause of her\n\nbrother's death; and (3) by affirming the IJ's evidentiary ruling\n\nprohibiting Mrs. Massie from testifying about conditions in Ambon,\n\nwhere she never lived. According to Petitioners, \"there would have\n\nbeen a finding of past persecution\" had the BIA not committed such\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ferrors.   We disagree.\n\n           Where there is a failure of transcription, we have held\n\nthat a claimant \"must show 'specific prejudice to his ability to\n\nperfect an appeal' sufficient to rise to the level of a due process\n\nviolation.\"    Kheireddine v.

There can be no prejudice if the missing portion of the\n\ntranscript is not material to the issue on review, if the missing\n\nmaterial can be derived from other sources, or if the transcription\n\nfailure makes no difference to the outcome of the review.          Id. at\n\n85-86. Here, Petitioners make no effort to explain how the missing\n\ntestimony differed from other material in the record (i.e., Mrs.\n\nMassie's affidavit describing the incident involving her brother).\n\nThey do not identify anything in the missing testimony that would\n\ndraw   into   question   the   IJ's    conclusion   that   Mrs.   Massie's\n\nassertion—that her brother was denied timely, appropriate medical\n\ntreatment based on his race and religion—was speculative at best.\n\nThey altogether fail to demonstrate that the outcome of the case\n\nwould have been different had the BIA had the benefit of the\n\nmissing transcript.      Quite simply, their claim of error in this\n\nregard is meritless.\n\n           The IJ's evidentiary ruling refusing to allow Mrs. Massie\n\nto testify about conditions in Ambon is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Sharari v.

Because neither Mrs. Massie nor Mr. Massie ever lived in\n\nAmbon, they had no first-hand knowledge about the conditions in\n\nAmbon.    The IJ did not abuse his discretion in refusing to admit\n\nsuch testimony; and the BIA did not err in upholding the IJ's\n\nruling.\n\n           An IJ is not required to accept as true an asylum\n\napplicant's speculation as to the cause of an event.

Here, both the IJ and\n\nthe BIA were correct in concluding that Mrs. Massie's speculation\n\nabout the cause of her brother's death lacked \"the requisite degree\n\nof specificity to sustain the petitioner’s burden of proof\" without\n\nsome sort of corroboration.

Even if poor treatment were presumed based on\n\nMrs. Massie's lay testimony, Mrs. Massie could do no more than\n\nsurmise that her brother's allegedly poor treatment was the result\n\nof his race and/or religion. Furthermore, it was apparent from Mr.\n\nMassie's testimony that his concerns about medical treatment in\n\nIndonesia were based not on any fear that he would obtain poor\n\nmedical treatment because of his ethnicity or religion but rather\n\non his perception that nobody in Indonesia could give him the\n\nquality of care that he received in the United States.    Under the\n\ncircumstances, it was not error to require corroboration.\n\n                                III.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the BIA's order\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fand DENY Petitioners' petition for review.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Although it appears that Petitioners do not challenge the\nBIA's decision upholding the IJ's denial of Petitioners'\nwithholding of removal and CAT claims, we note that our decision\nregarding asylum dooms any such challenge.
