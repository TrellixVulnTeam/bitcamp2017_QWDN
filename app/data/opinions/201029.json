We write mostly to amplify the\n\nmagistrate judge's rulings, mindful that \"[w]here . . . a trial\n\njudge astutely takes the measure of a case and hands down a\n\nconvincing,     well-reasoned        decision,     an   appellate    court   should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\"         Corrade Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248\n\nF.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal citations and quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n              We sketch only the factual highlights, construing the\n\nrecord in favor of TTI.         See Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 131\n\n(1st   Cir.     2000).    In   the    fall    of    1996,    James   Boyle   began\n\nnegotiations     with    Thomas      Walsh   for   Boyle's    company,   TTI,    to\n\npurchase Walsh's company, TTSales. TTSales, a General Motors truck\n\ndealer, had also sold Fisher plow equipment since the early 1970's.\n\nTTSales's distributorship agreement with Fisher, contained in a\n\ncombination of oral promises and documents, did not limit Fisher's\n\nprerogative to appoint other distributors.\n\n              In or around 1996, Fisher began discussions with Madigan\n\nabout becoming a full distributor.            When TTSales heard about these\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdiscussions, it told Fisher that it vehemently opposed Madigan's\n\nappointment. To placate TTSales, Fisher decided to appoint Madigan\n\nonly as a \"pool distributor.\"             This designation did not give\n\nMadigan full authority to sell Fisher products and forced Madigan\n\nto purchase some of its Fisher equipment from TTSales or another\n\ndistributor, Chapdelaine Truck Center.\n\n           Before TTI agreed to purchase TTSales in April of 1997,\n\nit did not discuss the pending deal with Fisher.          TTI understood,\n\nhowever, that it would need to negotiate directly with Fisher to\n\nobtain a distributorship because TTSales could not assign its\n\ndistributorship.        Around this time, TTI began discussions with\n\nFisher about becoming a distributor.         Fisher stated that it would\n\nnot begin formal distributorship talks until General Motors had\n\napproved TTI as a distributor of its trucks.         In the interim, TTI\n\nand Fisher had several conversations about the distributorship\n\nprocess.       During   these   conversations,   Fisher   representatives\n\nstated:\n\n           •     \"It's a trust situation. You do the\n                 right thing and you continue to do\n                 what [TTSales] does, you will have no\n                 problems.\"\n\n           •     \"[TTSales] has done an outstanding\n                 job.   You continue to do that stuff\n                 and you will have no problems.\"\n\n           •     \"Do what [TTSales] did, and we'll get\n                 along just fine because [it] obviously\n                 did it right.\"\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           •     \"Don't let us down and we won't let\n                 you down and it makes good sense for\n                 everyone.\"\n\n           •     The transition \"would be seamless. .\n                 . Once the credit was approved, it was\n                 seamless. There were no issues.\"\n\n           General Motors approved TTI as a distributor in September\n\n1997.    TTI then began the Fisher application process.        About that\n\ntime, TTI learned that TTSales did not have a written agreement with\n\nFisher    that   restricted   Fisher's    ability   to    appoint      other\n\ndistributors. Apparently concerned about Fisher's power to appoint\n\nother distributors,      TTI demanded that TTSales sign an \"offset\n\nagreement\" to compensate it if Fisher appointed another distributor\n\nin certain designated towns.          Despite TTI's concern, it never\n\ndiscussed the distributor network or Madigan's status with Fisher.\n\n           In October 1997, Fisher and TTI met.          At this meeting,\n\nFisher's representative stated that it \"has had a long and strong\n\nrelationship with [TTSales] and had no plans to change anything.\"\n\nAccording to TTI, it already was a distributor by the time of this\n\nmeeting, Madigan's status was not discussed at this meeting, and it\n\nonly learned of Madigan's appointment in the summer of 1998.              At\n\nthis meeting, TTI signed Fisher's \"Authorized Distributor Code of\n\nEthics    and    Responsibilities.\"       The   Code     of   Ethics     and\n\nResponsibilities did not restrict Fisher's ability to appoint other\n\ndistributors.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          TTI's first claim is for breach of contract.             TTI asserts\n\nthat Fisher's \"statements to the effect that things [would] remain\n\nthe same was the factual basis for [the] agreement that Fisher would\n\nnot change its distributor system without notice and then only for\n\nbusiness reasons.\" The magistrate judge rejected this claim because\n\nFisher's oral statements did not establish an agreement limiting its\n\nability to appoint additional distributors.\n\n          The parties agree that, absent a contrary agreement, a\n\nmanufacturer may choose distributors at will. See Jobbers Warehouse\n\nServ., Inc. v. Maremount Corp., 453 F. Supp. 840, 842 (D. Mass.\n\n1978).    Nothing    in    the     discussions      highlighted   by   TTI   is\n\nsufficiently definite to displace this principle.                 See Held v.\n\nZamparelli, 431 N.E.2d 961, 962 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982) (stating that\n\noral contract cannot be based on indefinite statements).                     The\n\ndiscussions   between     Fisher    and       TTI   concerned   only   Fisher's\n\ninclination   to   appoint   TTI    as    a    distributor.     Neither   party\n\nmentioned the distributor network or Madigan's status.             In light of\n\nthis context, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that Fisher\n\nintended its reassuring comments to TTI to limit its ability to\n\nappoint other distributors. Moreover, TTI's subsequent demand from\n\nTTSales for an \"offset agreement\" to protect it from losses if\n\nFisher appointed other distributors indicates that TTI understood\n\nthat Fisher retained the unfettered right to appoint additional\n\ndistributors. TTI's breach of contract claim is thus supported only\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fby placing certain of Fisher's statements out of context and then\n\napplying a meaning to them that the parties did not intend.1\n\n          TTI also asserts that Fisher's appointment of Madigan\n\nviolated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   This\n\ncovenant is an implied contractual term that prevents the parties\n\nfrom taking any action to injure the rights of another party to reap\n\nthe benefits of its contract.   See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC\n\nAssocs., 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (Mass. 1991).   The \"covenant may not,\n\nhowever, be invoked to create rights and duties not otherwise\n\nprovided for in the existing contractual relationship, as the\n\npurpose of the covenant is to guarantee that the parties remain\n\nfaithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in\n\ntheir performance.\"   See Uno Restaurants v. Boston Kenmore Realty\n\nCorp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 964 (Mass. 2004).     TTI claims that Fisher\n\nviolated the covenant by failing to provide adequate notice before\n\nappointing Madigan as a distributor.      But, as discussed above,\n\nFisher made no express promise to this effect.    See supra at 6.\n\n          Citing Cherick Distribs., Inc. v. Polar Corp., 669 N.E.2d\n\n218 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996),   TTI argues that Fisher's obligation to\n\nsupply reasonable notice was an implied term of the distributorship\n\nagreement.   In Cherick, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that\n\n\n     1\n       TTI also argues that the \"course of dealing\" between it and\nFisher established an agreement limiting Fisher's ability to\nappoint distributors. As the magistrate judge correctly concluded,\nthis argument fails because \"TTI had no prior relationship with\nFisher at all.\" Boyle, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 209.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fa jury could find that a manufacturer breached the implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing by terminating a distributorship\n\nagreement on only four-days notice.            Id. at 220.    The court ruled\n\nthat   the    termination   of   an    at-will     distributorship   agreement\n\nrequires reasonable notice and that four-days notice could be deemed\n\nunreasonable.     Id.   The instant case does not implicate Fisher's\n\nobligations vis-á-vis TTI's distributorship. Cherick does not hold\n\nthat a manufacturer must provide notice to its current distributors\n\nbefore appointing a new distributor.           Seemingly, in the absence of\n\na statutory command, importing such a notice requirement into\n\ndistributorship agreements is unwarranted because the harm to an\n\nexisting distributor caused by the appointment of an additional\n\ndistributor, if any, typically is not of the same magnitude as the\n\nharm caused by the termination of the agreement.             In any event, TTI\n\nhas not provided a reason or cited authority for such a rule.              See\n\nPiantes v. Pepperidge Farm, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 929, 938 (D. Mass.\n\n1995) (citing cases in which similar implied covenant of good faith\n\nand    fair      dealing    claims          have    been     rejected).\n\n             TTI's tort claims fare no better. TTI asserts that Fisher\n\nwrongfully     interfered   with      its   advantageous   relationship   with\n\nMadigan. To prevail on this claim, TTI must show that Fisher acted\n\nwith an improper motive or by improper means.                See United Truck\n\nLeasing Corp. v. Geltman, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23-24 (Mass. 1990). TTI\n\nargues that Fisher acted with an improper motive by waiting to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fappoint Madigan until TTSales was no longer a distributor, so as not\n\nto upset Fisher's longstanding relationship with TTSales.        TTI has\n\nnot set forth any facts showing that Fisher's purpose in promoting\n\nMadigan was to harm TTI.   Taken in the light most favorable to TTI,\n\nthe facts show that Fisher had an interest in promoting Madigan when\n\nit believed that it could do so without harming its established\n\nrelationship with TTSales.     This was a legitimate business purpose\n\nfor Fisher.   See Smith & Croyle, LLC v. Ridgewood Power Corp.,       111\n\nF. Supp. 2d 77, 85 n.18 (D. Mass. 2000) (stating that improper\n\nmotive cannot be established where defendant acts in pursuit of\n\n\"legitimate corporate purpose\"). That Fisher's action may have also\n\ninterfered with TTI's future plans for selling products to Madigan\n\ndoes not establish a claim.       See Hunneman Real Estate Corp. v.\n\nNorwood Realty, Inc., 765 N.E.2d 800, 808 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002)\n\n(stating   that   \"something   more\"    than   mere   interference   with\n\nrelationship is required to prove tort).\n\n           TTI also claims that Fisher committed fraud by making\n\nassurances that \"things would remain the same.\"        We agree with the\n\nmagistrate judge that TTI cannot rest a fraud claim on Fisher's\n\nstatements because \"they are too general to justify reliance.\"\n\nHinchey v. Nynex Corp., 979 F. Supp. 40, 44 (D. Mass. 1997).           As\n\ndiscussed above, the conversations during which Fisher made the\n\nrepresentations did not concern Madigan or even the distribution\n\nnetwork generally.   See supra at 6-7.    While TTI may, in hindsight,\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fwish that it had discussed Fisher's plans to appoint additional\n\ndistributors, it did not do so.\n\n           TTI's final claim asserts a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch.\n\n93A.   The magistrate judge rejected this claim because there was no\n\nevidence that Fisher engaged in deceit or other unfair practices in\n\nits dealings with TTI. TTI has not put forward a developed argument\n\nchallenging this ruling.    We therefore affirm the ruling for the\n\nreasons stated in the magistrate judge's opinion.     See Boyle, 292\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 218-220.\n\n           Having considered all of TTI's arguments and finding them\n\nto be without merit, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

In   the    fall    of    1996,    James   Boyle   began\n\nnegotiations     with    Thomas      Walsh   for   Boyle's    company,   TTI,    to\n\npurchase Walsh's company, TTSales. TTSales, a General Motors truck\n\ndealer, had also sold Fisher plow equipment since the early 1970's.\n\nTTSales's distributorship agreement with Fisher, contained in a\n\ncombination of oral promises and documents, did not limit Fisher's\n\nprerogative to appoint other distributors.\n\n              In or around 1996, Fisher began discussions with Madigan\n\nabout becoming a full distributor.            When TTSales heard about these\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdiscussions, it told Fisher that it vehemently opposed Madigan's\n\nappointment. To placate TTSales, Fisher decided to appoint Madigan\n\nonly as a \"pool distributor.\"             This designation did not give\n\nMadigan full authority to sell Fisher products and forced Madigan\n\nto purchase some of its Fisher equipment from TTSales or another\n\ndistributor, Chapdelaine Truck Center.\n\n           Before TTI agreed to purchase TTSales in April of 1997,\n\nit did not discuss the pending deal with Fisher.          TTI understood,\n\nhowever, that it would need to negotiate directly with Fisher to\n\nobtain a distributorship because TTSales could not assign its\n\ndistributorship.        Around this time, TTI began discussions with\n\nFisher about becoming a distributor.         Fisher stated that it would\n\nnot begin formal distributorship talks until General Motors had\n\napproved TTI as a distributor of its trucks.         In the interim, TTI\n\nand Fisher had several conversations about the distributorship\n\nprocess.       During   these   conversations,   Fisher   representatives\n\nstated:\n\n           •     \"It's a trust situation. You do the\n                 right thing and you continue to do\n                 what [TTSales] does, you will have no\n                 problems.\"\n\n           •     \"[TTSales] has done an outstanding\n                 job.   You continue to do that stuff\n                 and you will have no problems.\"\n\n           •     \"Do what [TTSales] did, and we'll get\n                 along just fine because [it] obviously\n                 did it right.\"\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           •     \"Don't let us down and we won't let\n                 you down and it makes good sense for\n                 everyone.\"\n\n           •     The transition \"would be seamless. .\n                 . Once the credit was approved, it was\n                 seamless. There were no issues.\"\n\n           General Motors approved TTI as a distributor in September\n\n1997.    TTI then began the Fisher application process.        About that\n\ntime, TTI learned that TTSales did not have a written agreement with\n\nFisher    that   restricted   Fisher's    ability   to    appoint      other\n\ndistributors. Apparently concerned about Fisher's power to appoint\n\nother distributors,      TTI demanded that TTSales sign an \"offset\n\nagreement\" to compensate it if Fisher appointed another distributor\n\nin certain designated towns.          Despite TTI's concern, it never\n\ndiscussed the distributor network or Madigan's status with Fisher.\n\n           In October 1997, Fisher and TTI met.          At this meeting,\n\nFisher's representative stated that it \"has had a long and strong\n\nrelationship with [TTSales] and had no plans to change anything.\"\n\nAccording to TTI, it already was a distributor by the time of this\n\nmeeting, Madigan's status was not discussed at this meeting, and it\n\nonly learned of Madigan's appointment in the summer of 1998.              At\n\nthis meeting, TTI signed Fisher's \"Authorized Distributor Code of\n\nEthics    and    Responsibilities.\"       The   Code     of   Ethics     and\n\nResponsibilities did not restrict Fisher's ability to appoint other\n\ndistributors.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          TTI's first claim is for breach of contract.             TTI asserts\n\nthat Fisher's \"statements to the effect that things [would] remain\n\nthe same was the factual basis for [the] agreement that Fisher would\n\nnot change its distributor system without notice and then only for\n\nbusiness reasons.\" The magistrate judge rejected this claim because\n\nFisher's oral statements did not establish an agreement limiting its\n\nability to appoint additional distributors.\n\n          The parties agree that, absent a contrary agreement, a\n\nmanufacturer may choose distributors at will. See Jobbers Warehouse\n\nServ., Inc. v. Maremount Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488097\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488097/jobbers-warehouse-service-v-maremont-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (D. Mass.\n\n1978).    Nothing    in    the     discussions      highlighted   by   TTI   is\n\nsufficiently definite to displace this principle.                 See Held v.\n\nZamparelli, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 962 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982) (stating that\n\noral contract cannot be based on indefinite statements).                     The\n\ndiscussions   between     Fisher    and       TTI   concerned   only   Fisher's\n\ninclination   to   appoint   TTI    as    a    distributor.     Neither   party\n\nmentioned the distributor network or Madigan's status.             In light of\n\nthis context, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that Fisher\n\nintended its reassuring comments to TTI to limit its ability to\n\nappoint other distributors. Moreover, TTI's subsequent demand from\n\nTTSales for an \"offset agreement\" to protect it from losses if\n\nFisher appointed other distributors indicates that TTI understood\n\nthat Fisher retained the unfettered right to appoint additional\n\ndistributors. TTI's breach of contract claim is thus supported only\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fby placing certain of Fisher's statements out of context and then\n\napplying a meaning to them that the parties did not intend.1\n\n          TTI also asserts that Fisher's appointment of Madigan\n\nviolated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   This\n\ncovenant is an implied contractual term that prevents the parties\n\nfrom taking any action to injure the rights of another party to reap\n\nthe benefits of its contract.   See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC\n\nAssocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820 (Mass. 1991).   The \"covenant may not,\n\nhowever, be invoked to create rights and duties not otherwise\n\nprovided for in the existing contractual relationship, as the\n\npurpose of the covenant is to guarantee that the parties remain\n\nfaithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in\n\ntheir performance.\"   See Uno Restaurants v. Boston Kenmore Realty\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 964 (Mass. 2004).     TTI claims that Fisher\n\nviolated the covenant by failing to provide adequate notice before\n\nappointing Madigan as a distributor.      But, as discussed above,\n\nFisher made no express promise to this effect.    See supra at 6.\n\n          Citing Cherick Distribs., Inc. v. Polar Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">218</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. App. Ct. 1996),   TTI argues that Fisher's obligation to\n\nsupply reasonable notice was an implied term of the distributorship\n\nagreement.   In Cherick, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that\n\n\n     1\n       TTI also argues that the \"course of dealing\" between it and\nFisher established an agreement limiting Fisher's ability to\nappoint distributors. As the magistrate judge correctly concluded,\nthis argument fails because \"TTI had no prior relationship with\nFisher at all.\" Boyle, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 209.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fa jury could find that a manufacturer breached the implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing by terminating a distributorship\n\nagreement on only four-days notice.            Id. at 220.    The court ruled\n\nthat   the    termination   of   an    at-will     distributorship   agreement\n\nrequires reasonable notice and that four-days notice could be deemed\n\nunreasonable.     Id.   The instant case does not implicate Fisher's\n\nobligations vis-á-vis TTI's distributorship. Cherick does not hold\n\nthat a manufacturer must provide notice to its current distributors\n\nbefore appointing a new distributor.           Seemingly, in the absence of\n\na statutory command, importing such a notice requirement into\n\ndistributorship agreements is unwarranted because the harm to an\n\nexisting distributor caused by the appointment of an additional\n\ndistributor, if any, typically is not of the same magnitude as the\n\nharm caused by the termination of the agreement.             In any event, TTI\n\nhas not provided a reason or cited authority for such a rule.              See\n\nPiantes v. Pepperidge Farm, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395422\"><a href=\"/opinion/1395422/piantes-v-pepperidge-farm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (D. Mass.\n\n1995) (citing cases in which similar implied covenant of good faith\n\nand    fair      dealing    claims          have    been     rejected).\n\n             TTI's tort claims fare no better. TTI asserts that Fisher\n\nwrongfully     interfered   with      its   advantageous   relationship   with\n\nMadigan. To prevail on this claim, TTI must show that Fisher acted\n\nwith an improper motive or by improper means.                See United Truck\n\nLeasing Corp. v. Geltman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23-24 (Mass. 1990). TTI\n\nargues that Fisher acted with an improper motive by waiting to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fappoint Madigan until TTSales was no longer a distributor, so as not\n\nto upset Fisher's longstanding relationship with TTSales.        TTI has\n\nnot set forth any facts showing that Fisher's purpose in promoting\n\nMadigan was to harm TTI.   Taken in the light most favorable to TTI,\n\nthe facts show that Fisher had an interest in promoting Madigan when\n\nit believed that it could do so without harming its established\n\nrelationship with TTSales.     This was a legitimate business purpose\n\nfor Fisher.   See Smith & Croyle, LLC v. Ridgewood Power Corp.,       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562163\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562163/smith-croyle-llc-v-ridgewood-power-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 2000) (stating that improper\n\nmotive cannot be established where defendant acts in pursuit of\n\n\"legitimate corporate purpose\"). That Fisher's action may have also\n\ninterfered with TTI's future plans for selling products to Madigan\n\ndoes not establish a claim.       See Hunneman Real Estate Corp. v.\n\nNorwood Realty, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808 (Mass. App. Ct. 2002)\n\n(stating   that   \"something   more\"    than   mere   interference   with\n\nrelationship is required to prove tort).\n\n           TTI also claims that Fisher committed fraud by making\n\nassurances that \"things would remain the same.\"        We agree with the\n\nmagistrate judge that TTI cannot rest a fraud claim on Fisher's\n\nstatements because \"they are too general to justify reliance.\"\n\nHinchey v. Nynex Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1447165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1447165/hinchey-v-nynex-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As\n\ndiscussed above, the conversations during which Fisher made the\n\nrepresentations did not concern Madigan or even the distribution\n\nnetwork generally.   See supra at 6-7.    While TTI may, in hindsight,\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fwish that it had discussed Fisher's plans to appoint additional\n\ndistributors, it did not do so.\n\n           TTI's final claim asserts a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch.\n\n93A.   The magistrate judge rejected this claim because there was no\n\nevidence that Fisher engaged in deceit or other unfair practices in\n\nits dealings with TTI. TTI has not put forward a developed argument\n\nchallenging this ruling.    We therefore affirm the ruling for the\n\nreasons stated in the magistrate judge's opinion.     See Boyle, 292\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 218-220.\n\n           Having considered all of TTI's arguments and finding them\n\nto be without merit, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f</pre>",
