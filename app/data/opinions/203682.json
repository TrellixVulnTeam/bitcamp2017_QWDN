In light of\n\nthe complexity of this case and the seriousness of the issues presented, the court has determined it\n\nwould be useful to obtain the views of the SEC and of amici, and to permit a response from\n\npetitioners, on the question of whether to grant the petitions solely as to the Rule 10b-5 issue. The\n\nRule 10b-5(b) issue focuses on whether primary liability extends, on the basis of an implied\n\nstatement theory, to underwriters of a mutual fund who are responsible for and direct the firm's\n\nefforts to sell shares of the fund and who, in connection with these sales efforts, disseminate\n\nprospectuses containing material statements that they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, were\n\nfalse.\n\f       In the course of addressing this issue, the briefs should also address several related\n\nconsiderations:\n\n       1. Would the panel holding also apply to private party suits and, if so, what principles, if\n       any, would limit the reach of that holding in private party actions under Rule 10b-5?\n\n       2. Assuming the SEC has stated a claim for aiding and abetting liability, what purpose is\n       served by expanding the scope of primary liability under Rule 10b-5?\n\n       3. What factual information about the role of underwriters in the securities industry is\n       pertinent to the issue?\n\n\n       The SEC brief is due 30 days from the date of this order. Amicus briefs and any responsive\n\nbriefs from petitioners, shall be due 30 days thereafter. Briefs must comply with otherwise\n\napplicable rules concerning format, number of copies, service, and other requirements. No brief may\n\nexceed 30 pages.\n\n       The Clerk is directed to serve forthwith a copy of this order on certain potential amici\n\norganizations, as listed in the attachment hereto. Other amici are welcome to file amicus briefs. All\n\namici must seek leave of the court, as otherwise required by applicable rules.\n\n\n                                                      By the Court:\n\n                                                      /s/ Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.
