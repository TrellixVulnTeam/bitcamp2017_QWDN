Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond J.

Claimant    Jane     Russell   has   appealed   a\n\ndistrict court judgment affirming the decision of the Commissioner\n\nof Health and Human Services which denied Russell's application for\n\nsupplemental security income payments.           We affirm.\n\n            Russell first claims that the Administrative Law Judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") failed to properly assess her credibility and lacked an\n\nadequate foundation for finding her subjective complaints of pain\n\n\"not entirely credible.\"        One of the reasons the ALJ partially\n\ndiscounted Russell's testimony was because \"she failed to follow\n\nprescribed treatment on a regular basis.\"             We have examined the\n\nrecord and find substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding\n\nof \"sporadic adherence to prescribed therapy.\"                   A claimant's\n\nfailure    to     follow   prescribed    medical     treatment     contradicts\n\nsubjective complaints of disabling conditions and supports an ALJ's\n\ndecision to deny benefits.       See Tsarelka v. Secretary of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 842 F.2d 529, 534 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam)\n\n(affirming denial of benefits where claimant did not follow through\n\nwith securing medical treatment); Dumas v. Schweiker, 712 F.2d\n\n1545, 1553 (2d Cir. 1983) (affirming denial of benefits where\n\nclaimant failed to heed doctor's diet recommendation which would\n\nhave helped hypertension and headaches).\n\n            Russell next claims that the ALJ erred in determining\n\nthat she had the residual functional capacity to perform light\n\nwork.     The ALJ's residual functional capacity determination has\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fsubstantial support in the record.         We have considered Russell's\n\nvarious arguments and find them without merit.\n\n              Finally, Russell claims that the ALJ erred in using the\n\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines to determine the range of work that\n\nshe   could    perform   because   her   migraine   headaches   cause   non-\n\nexertional limitations that called for testimony from a vocational\n\nexpert.   There is substantial support for the ALJ's finding that\n\nRussell's migraines had no non-exertional impact on her residual\n\nfunctional capacity.      Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in applying\n\nthe Guidelines.      Cf. Ortiz v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs.,\n\n890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam) (noting that\n\nGuidelines are not applicable where claimant has significant non-\n\nexertional impairments).\n\n              The judgment of the district court is affirmed.      See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
