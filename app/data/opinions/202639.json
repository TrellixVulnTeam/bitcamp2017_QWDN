Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Terri J.\nScadron, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Civil Division, and Mary Strimel, Trial Attorney,\nUnited States Department of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        February 16, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.   Hany Attia is a Coptic Christian and a\n\nnative and citizen of Egypt.   When placed in removal proceedings,\n\nAttia sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT). Attia maintained that he had\n\nbeen persecuted in his native Egypt on account of his religion, and\n\nthat the persecution would continue if he were returned there. The\n\nimmigration judge (IJ) denied relief on the grounds that the\n\nharassment and discrimination that Attia experienced in Egypt was\n\nnot severe enough to constitute persecution, and that there was no\n\nindication that he would be persecuted if he returned.     The Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ's decision without\n\nopinion, and Attia filed this petition for review.1\n\n            We review the BIA's decisions under the \"substantial\n\nevidence\" standard, which means we will uphold the decision if it\n\nis \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"    Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft,\n\n389 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir. 2004)(internal citation and quotation\n\nomitted).   This is a deferential standard, and we will reverse the\n\nBIA only if the evidence compels that result.   Id.   Where, as here,\n\nthe BIA summarily affirms the IJ's decision, we review the IJ's\n\ndecision.   See id. at 257.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Attia makes no specific argument in support of his CAT claim, and\nwe deem it waived.\n\n                                -2-\n\f           A petitioner can show that he is entitled to asylum by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution   on   account    of    his    race,   religion,       nationality,\n\npolitical opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Id.\n\nat 257.   To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution,\n\nthe   petitioner   must   show    that    his   fear   is   both   genuine   and\n\nobjectively reasonable.      Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155,\n\n161 (1st Cir. 2006).         To constitute persecution, the alleged\n\nmistreatment must extend beyond harassment, unpleasantness, and\n\nbasic suffering.    See Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 133 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); see also Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)(finding of persecution more likely if mistreatment is\n\nsystematic rather than a series of isolated incidents).\n\n           The IJ did not make a specific credibility finding, but\n\nrather accepted Attia's account of his experiences.                 Attia, who\n\ncame to the United States in 2001, testified regarding various acts\n\nof discrimination that he had experienced as a Christian growing up\n\nin a predominately Muslim society.         Notably, he recounted that his\n\nteachers had belittled his religion and struck him, and that a\n\ndistant relative (a priest) and his family had been killed when the\n\nrelative attempted to build a church on land adjoining the property\n\nof an influential Muslim military officer.             Attia also recounted\n\ntwo attacks upon himself.        The first occurred in 1991, when he was\n\nescorting a group of children to religious training.               Attia stated\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthat an elderly (but large) Muslim man approached him, insulted\n\nAttia's religion, and then beat him in front of the children.            The\n\nsecond incident occurred in 2000.             Attia testified that he was\n\nbaking sacramental bread in a church bakery, when Muslim merchants,\n\nangered by the heat from the bakery coming into their stores,\n\nrepeatedly attacked him.         Attia was not significantly injured in\n\neither incident.     Attia also testified that he had previously come\n\nto the United States in 2000, but returned to Egypt to be with his\n\nfamily.   Regarding his immediate family, all of whom are also\n\npracticing Coptic Christians, he stated that his father serves as\n\nthe head of taxation for the Egyptian government and that both his\n\nsisters work as accountants in Egypt.\n\n          The   IJ's    conclusion     that    Attia did not suffer past\n\npersecution is supported by substantial evidence.            Although Attia\n\nexperienced two altercations in a nine year period and a general\n\nclimate of discrimination, this does not suffice.               See Awad v.\n\nGonzales, 463 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir. 2006)(childhood bullying, being\n\nslapped   by    an     officer     during     military     service,   seeing\n\ndiscrimination against Christians, and learning a friend's sister\n\nhad been sexually assaulted by Muslims and forced to convert to\n\nIslam did not amount to persecution).           Indeed, worse mistreatment\n\nhas been found not to amount to persecution.             See, e.g., Topalli,\n\n417 F.3d at 132 (seven arrests accompanied by brief detentions and\n\nbeatings over two year period); Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (two\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbeatings    by    the   police,   accompanied    by     death   threats,   over\n\napproximately two year period);         Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 264\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)(three brief incarcerations in solitary confinement,\n\nphysical abuse during each incarceration, along with surveillance\n\nand harassment).\n\n            The    IJ's   conclusion    that    Attia    failed   to   show   a\n\nlikelihood of future persecution is also supported by substantial\n\nevidence.      As we have recently noted, religious tolerance has\n\nimproved somewhat in Egypt.        See Awad, 463 F.3d at 77.        Moreover,\n\nAttia's claim is significantly undermined by the fact that he\n\nwillingly returned to Egypt after his earlier trip to the United\n\nStates and that members of his immediate family continue live in\n\nEgypt, practice their faith, and work in the government and the\n\nprofessions without incident.        See generally Awad, 463 F.3d at 77\n\n(two returns to Egypt after international travel); Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2003) (wealthy and high profile\n\nfamily members live in Egypt without incident).\n\n            Because Attia has failed to meet the more forgiving\n\nasylum standard, he necessarily cannot meet the higher standard for\n\nwithholding of removal.       See Pan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 60, 63 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).2\n\n\n2\n Attia also alludes to a possible due process claim based upon the\nalleged inadequacy of the transcript of the proceeding before the\nIJ. But because he fails to argue that he has met the requirements\nfor such a claim, see Kheireddine v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 80, 83-87\n(1st Cir. 2005), any such claim is forfeited.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                     -6-\n\f",

As we have recently noted, religious tolerance has improved somewhat in Egypt. <i>See Awad,</i> 463 F.3d at 77. Moreover, Attia's claim is significantly undermined by the fact that he willingly returned to Egypt after his earlier trip to the United States and that members of his immediate family continue live in Egypt, practice their faith, and work in the government and the professions without incident. <i>See generally Awad,</i> 463 F.3d at 77 (two returns to Egypt after international travel); <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2003) (wealthy and high profile family members live in Egypt without incident).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Attia has failed to meet the more forgiving asylum standard, he necessarily cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <i>See Pan v.
