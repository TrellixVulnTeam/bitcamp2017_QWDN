  "plain_text": "          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 06-1514\n\n                FIRST MEDICAL HEALTH PLAN, INC.,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n         NANCY VEGA-RAMOS, as Executive Director of the\n     \"Administración de Servicios de Salud de Puerto Rico\",\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lizzie M. Portela for appellant.\n     Richard W. Siehl with whom Baker & Hostetler LLP, Alberto G.\nEstrella, Kenneth C. Suria and William Estrella Law Offices, PSC,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 22, 2007\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     This is an appeal from the entry\n\nof a preliminary injunction against Nancy Vega-Ramos, the executive\n\ndirector of the Administración de Servicios de Salud de Puerto\n\nRico   (ASES),   the   entity   responsible    for   administering   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico's Medicaid program.         The injunction\n\nrequires ASES to permit health insurance provider First Medical\n\nHealth Plan, Inc. (First Medical) to participate in Medicare\n\nPlatino, an ASES-run program designed to extend full prescription\n\ndrug coverage to Puerto Rico residents eligible for Medicare and\n\nMedicaid.    Vega also appeals the denial of her motion to dismiss\n\nFirst Medical's complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).      We vacate the injunction and remand for\n\ndismissal of the complaint.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Enacted in 1965, Medicare is a federally run health\n\ninsurance program benefitting primarily those who are 65 years of\n\nage and older.   Before the recent extension of Medicare to cover a\n\nportion of prescription drug costs, Medicare covered only inpatient\n\ncare through Part A and outpatient care through Part B.         Parts A\n\nand B are fee-for-service insurance programs operated by the\n\nfederal government.    42 U.S.C. § 1395c et seq. (Part A); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395j et seq. (Part B).   In 1997, Congress enacted Medicare Part\n\nC to allow Medicare beneficiaries to opt out of        traditional fee-\n\nfor-service coverage under Parts A and B.      42 U.S.C. § 1395w-21 et\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fseq. (Part C). Under Part C, beneficiaries can, inter alia, enroll\n\nin \"Medicare Advantage\" plans, privately-run managed care plans\n\nthat provide coverage for both inpatient and outpatient services.1\n\nId. § 1395w-22(a)(1).\n\n          Medicare beneficiaries who are indigent are referred to\n\nas \"dual eligible\" beneficiaries, meaning that they also qualify\n\nfor Medicaid assistance.     Id. § 1396u-5(c)(6)(A).    Each state\n\nadministers a Medicaid program (with substantial federal funding)\n\nto provide medical coverage to its economically disadvantaged\n\npopulation.   See id. § 1396a et seq.   Dual eligible beneficiaries\n\nreceive Medicaid coverage for health services not covered by\n\nMedicare and receive Medicaid funds to pay premiums and copayments\n\nthat they incur for Medicare-covered services.   See Omnibus Budget\n\nReconciliation Act of 1986, Pub L. No. 99-509, § 9403 (1986)\n\n(codified in scattered sections of 42 U.S.C.).\n\n          In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act\n\n(MMA) to extend partial coverage for prescription drugs to Medicare\n\nbeneficiaries under Medicare Part D.    See Pub. L. No. 173, Tit. I\n\n(2003) (Part D); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1395u-102(b) (establishing\n\nbeneficiary responsibility for a portion of prescription drug costs\n\nunder Part D).   Under the MMA, participation in Medicare Part D is\n\nvoluntary for non-dual-eligible beneficiaries.   42 U.S.C. § 1395-\n\n\n     1\n      These plans were first called \"Medicare+Choice\" plans but\nhave been renamed \"Medicare Advantage Plans.\" See Pub. L. No. 108-\n173, § 201 (2003).\n\n                                -3-\n\f101(a).       Medicare Advantage plans may offer Part D coverage to\n\ntheir enrollees.          Id. § 1395-101(a)(1)(b)(i).          Thus, Medicare\n\nAdvantage plan enrollees may receive all of their Medicare coverage\n\nthrough a single managed care plan.                  If, however, a Medicare\n\nbeneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan that does not\n\noffer      Part   D    coverage,   id.    §     1395-101(a)(B)(iii),    or   the\n\nbeneficiary is not enrolled in Part C at all, id. § 1395w-101(A),\n\nthe beneficiary may join a \"Prescription Drug Plan\" to obtain Part\n\nD benefits.2\n\n              Unlike other Medicare beneficiaries, a dual eligible\n\nbeneficiary must join a Part D plan (either a Medicare Advantage\n\nplan that offers Part D coverage or a Prescription Drug Plan).                 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1395w-101(b)(1)(C).         If a dual eligible beneficiary fails\n\nto do so, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary)\n\nautomatically enrolls the beneficiary in such a plan.             Id.   But, as\n\nmentioned above, because Part D provides only partial prescription\n\ndrug       coverage,    dual   eligible        beneficiaries   typically     need\n\nadditional assistance to pay their portion of prescription drug\n\ncosts.       The MMA addresses this problem differently depending on\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Prescription Drug Plans are plans offered by private\ninsurance companies, approved by Medicare, which provide Part D\ncoverage for those Medicare beneficiaries who do not receive Part\nD coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan.    See id. § 1395-\n151(a)(14).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwhether the dual eligible beneficiary lives in one of the fifty\n\nstates or in one of the United States' territories.3\n\n                 Prior to the MMA, Medicaid typically paid prescription\n\ndrug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries.              The MMA ended this\n\npractice for dual eligible beneficiaries living in the states. Id.\n\n§ 1396u-5(d)(1).        The MMA prohibits state Medicaid programs -- but\n\nnot territory Medicaid programs -- from paying for any portion of\n\nprescription drug costs normally shouldered by the beneficiary\n\nunder Part D.         Id.; 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-5(e) (excluding territories\n\nfrom       the   prohibition    on   Medicaid   providing   prescription   drug\n\nassistance). Rather than allowing Medicaid to pay these costs, the\n\nMMA creates a subsidy program through which Medicare provides funds\n\ndirectly to indigent Part D beneficiaries to help them pay their\n\nshare of drug costs.           Id. § 1395w-114.\n\n                 The MMA excludes the dual eligible population residing in\n\nthe territories from receiving these Medicare subsidies. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395w-114(a)(3)(F).           Instead, the MMA authorizes each territory\n\nto seek approval from the Secretary to implement a plan to provide\n\nfull prescription drug coverage for its dual eligible population.\n\nId. § 1396u-5(e).        If the Secretary approves the territory's plan,\n\nthe federal government increases the territory's Medicaid allotment\n\nto help pay for this assistance.            Id. § 1396u-5(e)(3).\n\n\n\n       3\n      For purposes of the MMA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is\nincluded as a territory.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           In accord with this provision, ASES submitted to the\n\nSecretary a plan entitled \"Medicare Platino\" to provide assistance\n\nfor Puerto Rico's dual eligible population to pay its share of Part\n\nD covered drug costs.        As part of the plan, ASES stated that it\n\nwould extend coverage to the dual eligible population by, inter\n\nalia,   contracting   with    various   Medicare    Advantage   plans   that\n\noffered Part D coverage.\n\n           After receiving approval from the Secretary for Medicare\n\nPlatino, ASES sought applications from qualified Medicare Advantage\n\nplans to participate. In its request for applications, ASES stated\n\nthat under Puerto Rico Law 72, it could not allow any Medicare\n\nAdvantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan owned or\n\noperated health facilities that could provide covered services to\n\na Medicare Platino covered beneficiary.        See 24 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n7033(c).   That is, under Puerto Rico law, ASES could not permit a\n\nMedicare Advantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan could\n\nengage in self-dealing.\n\n           First Medical, a federally qualified Medicare Advantage\n\nplan operating in Puerto Rico, applied to participate in Medicare\n\nPlatino.   ASES rejected First Medical's application under Law 72\n\nbecause First Medical owned health care facilities that could\n\nprovide covered services to Medicare Platino beneficiaries.             First\n\nMedical responded by filing suit in federal district court, arguing\n\nthat Law 72 was preempted by federal law.          First Medical relied on\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fan   MMA    provision     providing   that    \"standards    established    by\n\n[Medicare] supersede any State law or regulation (other than State\n\nlicensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with\n\nrespect to [Medicare Advantage] plans which are offered by a\n\nMedicare Advantage Organization under . . . Part\" C of Medicare.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3).       The complaint alleged that Law 72 was\n\npreempted    in   these    circumstances     because   it   constitutes   an\n\nimpermissible standard governing First Medical's operation as a\n\nMedicare Advantage plan under Medicare Part C.\n\n            Vega moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state\n\na claim, and First Medical moved for a preliminary injunction to\n\npermit it to join Medicare Platino.          The district court denied the\n\nmotion to dismiss and entered the preliminary injunction.                 The\n\ncourt ruled that First Medical is a Medicare Advantage plan, and\n\nthat the preemption provision contained in 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n26(b)(3) prevents ASES from enforcing Law 72 to bar First Medical\n\nfrom joining Medicare Platino.          Vega appealed the entry of the\n\npreliminary injunction and the denial of the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            A.      Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n            Before addressing the merits of the district court's\n\nrulings, we confront First Medical's challenge to our jurisdiction\n\nto consider the denial of Vega's motion to dismiss.           First Medical\n\nargues that the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fruling over which we have no jurisdiction unless the district court\n\nhas certified the order for appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), which\n\nit did not do.\n\n            First Medical is correct that, under the final judgment\n\nrule, we typically may not review the denial of a motion to dismiss\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         See, e.g., Marie v. Allied Home\n\nMort. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 6 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).                But where, as\n\nhere, we have before us an interlocutory appeal from the entry of\n\na preliminary injunction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), there is an\n\nexception to this general principle.\n\n            In Deckert v. Indep. Shares Corp., 311 U.S. 282, 287\n\n(1940), the Supreme Court ruled that a court of appeals correctly\n\nconsidered the denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state\n\na claim in conjunction with an interlocutory appeal from an order\n\ngranting a preliminary injunction.        The Court explained that the\n\n\"power    [to   hear   interlocutory    appeals   from   the    entry   of   a\n\npreliminary injunction] is not limited to mere consideration of,\n\nand action upon, the order appealed from. If insuperable objection\n\nto maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and\n\nthe litigation terminated.\"       Id.    This rule serves the salutary\n\npurpose of saving \"both parties the needless expense of further\n\nprosecution of the suit\" where the pleadings demonstrate that the\n\nsuit is hopeless.        N.C. R.R. Co. v. Story, 268 U.S. 288, 292\n\n(1925).    Appellate review of the denial of a motion to dismiss as\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fpart of an interlocutory appeal from the grant of a preliminary\n\ninjunction       is    permissible     where    the   underlying    facts   are\n\nundisputed, the parties have had a fair opportunity to brief the\n\nlegal issues, and the court of appeals can resolve the case as a\n\nmatter of law.        See, e.g., SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare,\n\nL.P. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 211 F.3d            21, 24-25 (2d Cir. 2000);\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Camblos, 155 F.3d 352, 359-61 (4th Cir.\n\n1998); Doe v. Sundquist, 106 F.3d 702, 707-08 (6th Cir. 1997);\n\nMagnolia Marine Transp. Co. v. Laplace Towing Corp., 964 F.2d 1571,\n\n1580 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n            Here, the parties agree that the material facts are not\n\nin dispute and that only legal questions are presented.              Moreover,\n\nthe parties had ample opportunity to brief these issues before the\n\ndistrict court and, as will be seen, the issues can be resolved as\n\na matter of law.            Thus, we have jurisdiction over the denial of\n\nVega's motion to dismiss.\n\n            B.          The Merits\n\n             We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for an\n\nabuse of discretion.          See Ross-Simon of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat,\n\nInc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating the elements\n\nnecessary for obtaining a preliminary injunction).             But we review\n\nquestions    of       law   embedded   within   the   preliminary   injunction\n\nframework de novo, New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom,\n\nInc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002), and will vacate the injunction\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fwhere there has been a legal error, see McClure v. Galvin, 386 F.3d\n\n36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).   We review a ruling on a motion to dismiss\n\nfor failure to state a claim de novo.       See Martin v. Applied\n\nCellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).   Here, because\n\nthe grant of the injunction turned exclusively on legal rulings, we\n\napply the same de novo standard for reviewing the denial of the\n\nmotion to dismiss and the grant of the injunction.     See McClure,\n\n386 F.3d at 41.\n\n          The primary issue before us is whether 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n26(b)(3) expressly preempts application of Puerto Rico Law 72 in\n\nthese circumstances.   \"Express preemption occurs when Congress has\n\nunmistakably . . . ordained that its enactments alone are to\n\nregulate a subject matter and state laws regulating that subject\n\nmust fall.\"   Mass. Ass'n of Health Maintenance Orgs. v. Ruthardt,\n\n194 F.3d 176, 179 (1st Cir. 1999).       Congress's intent \"is the\n\nultimate touchstone\" of an express preemption analysis. Medtronic,\n\nInc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996).        In determining the\n\npreemptive scope of a congressional enactment, courts rely on the\n\nplain language of the statute and its legislative history to\n\ndevelop \"a reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress\n\nintended the statute\" to operate.     N.H. Motor Transp. Ass'n v.\n\nRowe, 448 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The federal preemption provision relied on by First\n\nMedical states that \"the standards established\" under federal law\n\n\n                               -10-\n\ffor Medicare Advantage plans operating under Medicare Part C shall\n\n\"supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing\n\nlaws or State laws related to plan solvency).\"   42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n26(b)(3). The legislative history of this provision clarified that\n\n\"the [Medicare Advantage Program] is a federal program operated\n\nunder Federal rules and that State laws, do not, and should not\n\napply, with the exception of state licensing laws or state laws\n\nrelated to plan solvency.\"      H. Conf. Rep. 108-391      at    557,\n\nreprinted in 2003 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1926; see also Uhm v. Humana,\n\nInc., No. 06-0815, 2006 WL 1587443, at *2-3 (W.D. Wash. June 2,\n\n2006) (holding that a state-law tort action based on alleged false\n\nadvertising by Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare\n\nPart C was preempted by § 1395w-26(b)(3)).\n\n          As set forth above, First Medical persuaded the district\n\ncourt to find preemption on the ground that it is a Medicare\n\nAdvantage plan seeking to participate in a Medicare program,\n\nnamely, Medicare Platino.    Vega challenges this ruling, arguing\n\nthat Medicare Platino is not a Medicare program but rather is a\n\nMedicaid program and is outside the preemptive scope of § 1395w-\n\n26(b)(3). She contends that, while ASES invited Medicare Advantage\n\nplans to join Medicare Platino, Medicare Platino is the vehicle\n\nthrough which the Commonwealth's Medicaid system extends full\n\nprescription drug coverage to its dual eligible population.     Under\n\nthis view, Law 72 is not a prohibited Commonwealth \"standard\" for\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fthe operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare\n\nPart C, but rather a permissible eligibility requirement for an\n\nentity wishing to participate in a Puerto Rico Medicaid program.\n\nWe agree.\n\n            Congress has not precluded Medicaid programs operated by\n\nthe territories from offering prescription drug coverage to its\n\ndual eligible population.         42 U.S.C. § 1396u-5(e).            As we have\n\nexplained, the prohibition adopted by Congress applies only to\n\nMedicaid programs operated by the states.               Id. § 1396u-5(d)(1).\n\nWith respect to the territories, Congress adopted an entirely\n\ndifferent scheme which permits each territory to adopt a plan to\n\nprovide assistance to its dual eligible beneficiaries to pay their\n\nshare of Part D covered drug costs.             Id. § 1396u-5(e)(2).           As an\n\nincentive   for    each   territory     to    enact   such   a   plan,    Congress\n\npromised that it would increase the territory's Medicaid funding if\n\nthe plan was approved by the Secretary.                  Id. § 1396u-5(e)(3)\n\n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 1308(f) & (g)).           Thus, Congress did not mandate\n\nthat the federal Medicare program pay for full prescription drug\n\ncoverage    for    the    dual   eligible      population        living   in     the\n\nterritories.      Nor did it bar the territories from using Medicaid\n\nfunds to provide full prescription drug coverage to their dual\n\neligible    populations.         Id.     §     1396u-5(e)(1)(A)       (excluding\n\nterritories from the prohibition on using Medicaid funds to provide\n\nprescription drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries).\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            Additionally,   the   Secretary's   rules    for   approving   a\n\nterritory's proposed plan for providing prescription drug coverage\n\ndo not limit the methods through which a territory may provide drug\n\ncoverage for its residents.       The regulations provide only that a\n\nterritory must submit a plan that describes the type of medical\n\nassistance to be provided, the number of eligible residents, and an\n\nassurance that no more than ten percent of the increased Medicaid\n\nfunding will be used for administrative expenses.         See 42 C.F.R. §\n\n423.907.    There is no requirement that a territory use an entity\n\nestablished by the Medicare laws to provide drug coverage for its\n\ndual eligible population.\n\n            As mentioned above, Congress's purpose in enacting §\n\n1395w-26(b)(3) was to protect the purely federal nature of Medicare\n\nAdvantage plans operating under Medicare.        But here, ASES was not\n\nregulating the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating\n\nunder Medicare Part C;4 it was preventing an existing Medicare\n\nAdvantage   plan   from   participating   in    Puerto   Rico's   Medicaid\n\nprogram. By excluding First Medical from participating in Medicare\n\nPlatino, ASES was not setting a standard for the operation of a\n\nMedicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare.          Rather, it was\n\nacting to protect the integrity of the Puerto Rico Medicaid system\n\nin its role as the Commonwealth's Medicaid administrator.          See Rio\n\n\n     4\n      Indeed, it is undisputed that First Medical operates as a\nMedicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico without having to satisfy\nCommonwealth standards unrelated to licensing or plan solvency.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fGrande Cmty.

Nothing in federal Medicare law prohibits this.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that, in the circumstances presented,\n\nPuerto Rico Law 72 has not been preempted by 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n26(b)(3).\n\n               First   Medical    offers   an   alternative   argument   for\n\naffirmance.       It argues that, even if Law 72 has not been preempted\n\nby § 1395w-26(b)(3), ASES did not have authority under federal\n\nMedicaid law to exclude it from participating in Medicare Platino.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n               While Medicaid is a state-run program,5 Puerto Rico\n\naccepts federal Medicaid funds and thus must comply with federal\n\nMedicaid laws.         See Rio Grande Cmty. Heath Ctr., 397 F.3d at 61.\n\nFederal Medicaid law establishes that \"in addition to any other\n\nauthority, a State may exclude any individual or entity [from\n\nparticipating in its Medicaid program] for any for reason which the\n\nSecretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation\n\nin [Medicare].\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p).\n\n               First Medical interprets this statute to limit ASES's\n\nauthority to exclude entities from participating in its Medicaid\n\nprogram to those reasons for which the Secretary could prohibit an\n\n\n\n       5\n           Puerto Rico is treated is a state for purposes of Medicaid\nlaw.

According to First Medical,\n\nLaw 72 establishes a basis for exclusion that does not exist under\n\nMedicare.\n\n            First   Medical    incorrectly       interprets   the   Medicaid\n\nexclusion   statute.     The   statute      expressly   grants    states   the\n\nauthority to exclude entities from their Medicaid programs for\n\nreasons that the Secretary could use to exclude entities from\n\nparticipating in Medicare.           But it also preserves the state's\n\nability to exclude entities from participating in Medicaid under\n\n\"any other authority.\" The legislative history clarifies that this\n\n\"any other authority\" language was intended to permit a state to\n\nexclude   an   entity   from   its    Medicaid    program   for   any   reason\n\nestablished by state law.      The Senate Report states:\n\n            The Committee bill clarifies current Medicaid\n            Law by expressly granting States the authority\n            to exclude individuals or entities from\n            participation in their Medicaid programs for\n            any reason that constitutes a basis for an\n            exclusion from Medicare . . . .

Before the recent extension of Medicare to cover a portion of prescription drug costs, Medicare covered only inpatient care through Part A and outpatient care through Part B. Parts A and B are fee-for-service insurance programs operated by the federal government. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395c <i>et seq.</i> (Part A); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395j <i>et seq.</i> (Part B). In 1997, Congress enacted Medicare Part C to allow Medicare beneficiaries to opt out of traditional fee-for-service coverage under Parts A and B. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-21 <i>et seq.</i> (Part C). Under Part C, beneficiaries can, <i>inter alia,</i> enroll in \"Medicare Advantage\" plans, privately-run managed care plans that provide coverage for both inpatient and outpatient services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395w-22(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare beneficiaries who are indigent are referred to as \"dual eligible\" beneficiaries, meaning that they also qualify for Medicaid assistance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(c)(6)(A). Each state administers a Medicaid program (with substantial federal funding) to provide medical coverage to its economically disadvantaged population. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1396a <i>et seq.</i> Dual eligible beneficiaries receive Medicaid coverage for health services not covered by Medicare and receive Medicaid funds to pay premiums and copayments that they incur for Medicare-covered services. <i>See</i> Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub L. No. 99-509, &#167; 9403 (1986) (codified in scattered sections of 42 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) to extend partial coverage for prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries under Medicare Part D. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 173, Tit. I (2003) (Part D); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395u-102(b) (establishing beneficiary responsibility for a portion of prescription drug costs under Part D). Under the MMA, participation in Medicare Part D is voluntary for non-dual-eligible beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395-101(a). Medicare Advantage plans may offer Part D coverage to their enrollees. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395-101(a)(1)(b)(i). Thus, Medicare Advantage plan enrollees may receive all of their Medicare coverage through a single managed care plan. If, however, a Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan that does not offer Part D coverage, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1395-101(a)(B)(iii), or the beneficiary is not enrolled in Part C at all, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1395w-101(A), the beneficiary may join a \"Prescription Drug Plan\" to obtain Part D benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike other Medicare beneficiaries, a dual eligible beneficiary <i>must</i> join a Part D plan (either a Medicare Advantage plan that offers Part D coverage or a Prescription Drug Plan). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-101(b)(1)(C). If a dual eligible beneficiary fails to do so, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) automatically enrolls the beneficiary in such a plan. <i>Id.</i> But, as mentioned above, because Part D provides only partial prescription drug coverage, dual eligible beneficiaries typically need additional assistance to pay their portion of prescription drug costs. The MMA addresses this problem differently depending on whether the dual eligible beneficiary lives in one of the fifty states or in one of the United States' territories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the MMA, Medicaid typically paid prescription drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries. The MMA ended this practice for dual eligible beneficiaries living in the states. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(d)(1). The MMA prohibits state Medicaid programs&#8212;but not territory Medicaid programs&#8212;from paying for any portion of prescription drug costs normally shouldered by the beneficiary under Part D. <i>Id.;</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396u-5(e) (excluding territories from the prohibition on Medicaid providing prescription drug assistance). Rather than allowing Medicaid to pay these costs, the MMA creates a subsidy program through which Medicare provides funds directly to indigent Part D beneficiaries to help them pay their share of drug costs. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395w-114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MMA excludes the dual eligible population residing in the territories from receiving these <i>Medicare</i> subsidies. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-114(a)(3)(F). Instead, the MMA authorizes each territory to seek approval from the Secretary to implement a plan to provide full prescription drug coverage for its dual eligible population. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e). If the Secretary approves the territory's plan, the federal government increases the territory's <i>Medicaid</i> allotment to help pay for this assistance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accord with this provision, ASES submitted to the Secretary a plan entitled \"Medicare Platino\" to provide assistance for Puerto Rico's dual eligible population to pay its share of Part D covered drug costs. As part of the plan, ASES stated that it would extend coverage to the dual eligible population by, <i>inter alia,</i> contracting with various Medicare Advantage plans that offered Part D coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving approval from the Secretary for Medicare Platino, ASES sought applications from qualified Medicare Advantage plans to participate. In its request for applications, ASES stated that under Puerto Rico Law 72, it could not allow any Medicare Advantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan owned or operated health facilities that could provide covered services to a Medicare Platino covered beneficiary. <i>See</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 7033(c). That is, under Puerto Rico law, ASES could not permit a Medicare Advantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan could engage in self-dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical, a federally qualified Medicare Advantage plan operating in Puerto Rico, applied to participate in Medicare Platino. ASES rejected First Medical's application under Law 72 because First Medical owned health care facilities that could provide covered services to Medicare Platino beneficiaries. First Medical responded by filing suit in federal district court, arguing that Law 72 was preempted by federal law. First Medical relied on an MMA provision providing that \"standards established by [Medicare] supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to [Medicare Advantage] plans which are offered by a Medicare Advantage Organization under . . . Part\" C of Medicare. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3). The complaint alleged that Law 72 was preempted in these circumstances because it constitutes an impermissible standard governing First Medical's operation as a Medicare Advantage plan under Medicare Part C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and First Medical moved for a preliminary injunction to permit it to join Medicare Platino. The district court denied the motion to dismiss and entered the preliminary injunction. The court ruled that First Medical is a Medicare Advantage plan, and that the preemption provision contained in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) prevents ASES from enforcing Law 72 to bar First Medical from joining Medicare Platino. Vega appealed the entry of the preliminary injunction and the denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of the district court's rulings, we confront First Medical's challenge to our jurisdiction to consider the denial of Vega's motion to dismiss. First Medical argues that the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory ruling over which we have no jurisdiction unless the district court has certified the order for appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b), which it did not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical is correct that, under the final judgment rule, we typically may not review the denial of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See, e.g., Marie v. Allied Home Mort. Corp.,</i> 402 F.3d 1, 6 n. 1 (1st Cir.2005). But where, as here, we have before us an interlocutory appeal from the entry of a preliminary injunction, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1), there is an exception to this general principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Deckert v. Indep. Shares Corp.,</i> 311 U.S. 282, 287, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940), the Supreme Court ruled that a court of appeals correctly considered the denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in conjunction with an interlocutory appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction. The Court explained that the \"power [to hear interlocutory appeals from the entry of a preliminary injunction] is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from. If insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.\" <i>Id.</i> This rule serves the salutary purpose of saving \"both parties the needless expense of further prosecution of the suit\" where the pleadings demonstrate that the suit is hopeless. <i>N.C. R.R. Co. v. Story,</i> 268 U.S. 288, 292, 45 S.Ct. 531, 69 L.Ed. 959 (1925). Appellate review of the denial of a motion to dismiss as part of an interlocutory appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction is permissible where the underlying facts are undisputed, the parties have had a fair opportunity to brief the legal issues, and the court of appeals can resolve the case as a matter of law. <i>See, e.g., SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, L.P. v. Watson Pharms., Inc.,</i> 211 F.3d 21, 24-25 (2d Cir. 2000); <i>Planned Parenthood v. Camblos,</i> 155 F.3d 352, 359-61 (4th Cir.1998); <i>Doe v.

Moreover, the parties had ample opportunity to brief these issues before the district court and, as will be seen, the issues can be resolved as a matter of law.

We review a ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo. <i>See Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). Here, because the grant of the injunction turned exclusively on legal rulings, we apply the same de novo standard for reviewing the denial of the motion to dismiss and the grant of the injunction. <i>See McClure,</i> 386 F.3d at 41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary issue before us is whether 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) expressly preempts application of Puerto Rico Law 72 in these circumstances. \"Express preemption occurs when Congress has unmistakably ... ordained that its enactments alone are to regulate a subject matter and state laws regulating that subject must fall.\" <i>Mass. Ass'n of Health Maintenance Orgs. v. Ruthardt,</i> 194 F.3d 176, 179 (1st Cir.1999). Congress's intent \"is the ultimate touchstone\" of an express preemption analysis. <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). In determining the preemptive scope of a congressional enactment, courts rely on the plain language of the statute and its legislative history to develop \"a reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute\" to operate. <i>N.H.

The legislative history of this provision clarified that \"the [Medicare Advantage Program] is a federal program operated under Federal rules and that State laws, do not, and should not apply, with the exception of state licensing laws or state laws related to plan solvency.\" H.

June 2, 2006) (holding that a state-law tort action based on alleged false advertising by Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C was preempted by &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As set forth above, First Medical persuaded the district court to find preemption on the ground that it is a Medicare Advantage plan seeking to participate in a Medicare program, namely, Medicare Platino. Vega challenges this ruling, arguing that Medicare Platino is <i>not</i> a Medicare program but rather is a <i>Medicaid</i> program and is outside the preemptive scope of &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3). She contends that, while ASES invited Medicare Advantage plans to join Medicare Platino, Medicare Platino is the vehicle through which the Commonwealth's Medicaid system extends full prescription drug coverage to its dual eligible population. Under this view, Law 72 is not a prohibited Commonwealth \"standard\" for the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C, but rather a permissible eligibility requirement for an entity wishing to participate in a Puerto Rico Medicaid program. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has not precluded Medicaid programs operated by the territories from offering prescription drug coverage to its dual eligible population. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396u-5(e). As we have explained, the prohibition adopted by Congress applies only to Medicaid programs operated by the <i>states. Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(d)(1). With respect to the <i>territories,</i> Congress adopted an entirely different scheme which permits each territory to adopt a plan to provide assistance to its dual eligible beneficiaries to pay their share of Part D covered drug costs. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(2). As an incentive for each territory to enact such a plan, Congress promised that it would increase the territory's <i>Medicaid</i> funding if the plan was approved by the Secretary. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(3) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1308(f) &amp; (g)). Thus, Congress did <i>not</i> mandate that the <i>federal Medicare program</i> pay for full prescription drug coverage for the dual eligible population living in the territories. Nor did it bar the territories from using Medicaid funds to provide full prescription drug coverage to their dual eligible populations. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(1)(A) (excluding territories from the prohibition on using Medicaid funds to provide prescription drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Secretary's rules for approving a territory's proposed plan for providing prescription drug coverage do not limit the methods through which a territory may provide drug coverage for its residents. The regulations provide only that a territory must submit a plan that describes the type of medical assistance to be provided, the number of eligible residents, and an assurance that no more than ten percent of the increased Medicaid funding will be used for administrative expenses. <i>See</i> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 423.907. There is <i>no</i> requirement that a territory use an entity established by the Medicare laws to provide drug coverage for its dual eligible population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, Congress's purpose in enacting &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) was to protect the purely federal nature of Medicare Advantage plans operating under Medicare. But here, ASES was not regulating the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it was preventing an existing Medicare Advantage plan from participating in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. By excluding First Medical from participating in Medicare Platino, ASES was not setting a standard for the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare. Rather, it was acting to protect the integrity of the Puerto Rico Medicaid system in its role as the Commonwealth's Medicaid administrator. <i>See Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan,</i> 397 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Medicaid ... is ... directly administered by state governments\"). Nothing in federal Medicare law prohibits this. Accordingly, we conclude that, in the circumstances presented, Puerto Rico Law 72 has not been preempted by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical offers an alternative argument for affirmance. It argues that, even if Law 72 has not been preempted by &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3), ASES did not have authority under federal <i>Medicaid</i> law to exclude it from participating in Medicare Platino.

Before the recent extension of Medicare to cover a portion of prescription drug costs, Medicare covered only inpatient care through Part A and outpatient care through Part B. Parts A and B are fee-for-service insurance programs operated by the federal government. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395c <i>et seq.</i> (Part A); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395j <i>et seq.</i> (Part B). In 1997, Congress enacted Medicare Part C to allow Medicare beneficiaries to opt out of traditional fee-for-service coverage under Parts A and B. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-21 <i>et seq.</i> (Part C). Under Part C, beneficiaries can, <i>inter alia,</i> enroll in \"Medicare Advantage\" plans, privately-run managed care plans that provide coverage for both inpatient and outpatient services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395w-22(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medicare beneficiaries who are indigent are referred to as \"dual eligible\" beneficiaries, meaning that they also qualify for Medicaid assistance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(c)(6)(A). Each state administers a Medicaid program (with substantial federal funding) to provide medical coverage to its economically disadvantaged population. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1396a <i>et seq.</i> Dual eligible beneficiaries receive Medicaid coverage for health services not covered by Medicare and receive Medicaid funds to pay premiums and copayments that they incur for Medicare-covered services. <i>See</i> Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub L. No. 99-509, &#167; 9403 (1986) (codified in scattered sections of 42 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) to extend partial coverage for prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries under Medicare Part D. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 173, Tit. I (2003) (Part D); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395u-102(b) (establishing beneficiary responsibility for a portion of prescription drug costs under Part D). Under the MMA, participation in Medicare Part D is voluntary for non-dual-eligible beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395-101(a). Medicare Advantage plans may offer Part D coverage to their enrollees. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395-101(a)(1)(b)(i). Thus, Medicare Advantage plan enrollees may receive all of their Medicare coverage through a single managed care plan. If, however, a Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan that does not offer Part D coverage, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1395-101(a)(B)(iii), or the beneficiary is not enrolled in Part C at all, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1395w-101(A), the beneficiary may join a \"Prescription Drug Plan\" to obtain Part D benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike other Medicare beneficiaries, a dual eligible beneficiary <i>must</i> join a Part D plan (either a Medicare Advantage plan that offers Part D coverage or a Prescription Drug Plan). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-101(b)(1)(C). If a dual eligible beneficiary fails to do so, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) automatically enrolls the beneficiary in such a plan. <i>Id.</i> But, as mentioned above, because Part D provides only partial prescription drug coverage, dual eligible beneficiaries typically need additional assistance to pay their portion of prescription drug costs. The MMA addresses this problem differently depending on whether the dual eligible beneficiary lives in one of the fifty states or in one of the United States' territories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the MMA, Medicaid typically paid prescription drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries. The MMA ended this practice for dual eligible beneficiaries living in the states. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(d)(1). The MMA prohibits state Medicaid programs&#8212;but not territory Medicaid programs&#8212;from paying for any portion of prescription drug costs normally shouldered by the beneficiary under Part D. <i>Id.;</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396u-5(e) (excluding territories from the prohibition on Medicaid providing prescription drug assistance). Rather than allowing Medicaid to pay these costs, the MMA creates a subsidy program through which Medicare provides funds directly to indigent Part D beneficiaries to help them pay their share of drug costs. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1395w-114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MMA excludes the dual eligible population residing in the territories from receiving these <i>Medicare</i> subsidies. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-114(a)(3)(F). Instead, the MMA authorizes each territory to seek approval from the Secretary to implement a plan to provide full prescription drug coverage for its dual eligible population. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e). If the Secretary approves the territory's plan, the federal government increases the territory's <i>Medicaid</i> allotment to help pay for this assistance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accord with this provision, ASES submitted to the Secretary a plan entitled \"Medicare Platino\" to provide assistance for Puerto Rico's dual eligible population to pay its share of Part D covered drug costs. As part of the plan, ASES stated that it would extend coverage to the dual eligible population by, <i>inter alia,</i> contracting with various Medicare Advantage plans that offered Part D coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving approval from the Secretary for Medicare Platino, ASES sought applications from qualified Medicare Advantage plans to participate. In its request for applications, ASES stated that under Puerto Rico Law 72, it could not allow any Medicare Advantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan owned or operated health facilities that could provide covered services to a Medicare Platino covered beneficiary. <i>See</i> 24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 7033(c). That is, under Puerto Rico law, ASES could not permit a Medicare Advantage plan to join Medicare Platino if the plan could engage in self-dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical, a federally qualified Medicare Advantage plan operating in Puerto Rico, applied to participate in Medicare Platino. ASES rejected First Medical's application under Law 72 because First Medical owned health care facilities that could provide covered services to Medicare Platino beneficiaries. First Medical responded by filing suit in federal district court, arguing that Law 72 was preempted by federal law. First Medical relied on an MMA provision providing that \"standards established by [Medicare] supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to [Medicare Advantage] plans which are offered by a Medicare Advantage Organization under . . . Part\" C of Medicare. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3). The complaint alleged that Law 72 was preempted in these circumstances because it constitutes an impermissible standard governing First Medical's operation as a Medicare Advantage plan under Medicare Part C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and First Medical moved for a preliminary injunction to permit it to join Medicare Platino. The district court denied the motion to dismiss and entered the preliminary injunction. The court ruled that First Medical is a Medicare Advantage plan, and that the preemption provision contained in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) prevents ASES from enforcing Law 72 to bar First Medical from joining Medicare Platino. Vega appealed the entry of the preliminary injunction and the denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of the district court's rulings, we confront First Medical's challenge to our jurisdiction to consider the denial of Vega's motion to dismiss. First Medical argues that the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory ruling over which we have no jurisdiction unless the district court has certified the order for appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b), which it did not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical is correct that, under the final judgment rule, we typically may not review the denial of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See, e.g., Marie v.

The Court explained that the \"power [to hear interlocutory appeals from the entry of a preliminary injunction] is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from. If insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.\" <i>Id.</i> This rule serves the salutary purpose of saving \"both parties the needless expense of further prosecution of the suit\" where the pleadings demonstrate that the suit is hopeless. <i>N.C.

Conf. Rep. 108-391 at 557, <i>reprinted in</i> 2003 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1926; <i>see also Uhm v. Humana, Inc.,</i> No. 06-0815, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1587443</span></span>, at *2-3 (W.D.Wash. June 2, 2006) (holding that a state-law tort action based on alleged false advertising by Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C was preempted by &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As set forth above, First Medical persuaded the district court to find preemption on the ground that it is a Medicare Advantage plan seeking to participate in a Medicare program, namely, Medicare Platino. Vega challenges this ruling, arguing that Medicare Platino is <i>not</i> a Medicare program but rather is a <i>Medicaid</i> program and is outside the preemptive scope of &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3). She contends that, while ASES invited Medicare Advantage plans to join Medicare Platino, Medicare Platino is the vehicle through which the Commonwealth's Medicaid system extends full prescription drug coverage to its dual eligible population. Under this view, Law 72 is not a prohibited Commonwealth \"standard\" for the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C, but rather a permissible eligibility requirement for an entity wishing to participate in a Puerto Rico Medicaid program. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has not precluded Medicaid programs operated by the territories from offering prescription drug coverage to its dual eligible population. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396u-5(e). As we have explained, the prohibition adopted by Congress applies only to Medicaid programs operated by the <i>states. Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(d)(1). With respect to the <i>territories,</i> Congress adopted an entirely different scheme which permits each territory to adopt a plan to provide assistance to its dual eligible beneficiaries to pay their share of Part D covered drug costs. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(2). As an incentive for each territory to enact such a plan, Congress promised that it would increase the territory's <i>Medicaid</i> funding if the plan was approved by the Secretary. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(3) (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1308(f) &amp; (g)). Thus, Congress did <i>not</i> mandate that the <i>federal Medicare program</i> pay for full prescription drug coverage for the dual eligible population living in the territories. Nor did it bar the territories from using Medicaid funds to provide full prescription drug coverage to their dual eligible populations. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396u-5(e)(1)(A) (excluding territories from the prohibition on using Medicaid funds to provide prescription drug coverage for dual eligible beneficiaries).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Secretary's rules for approving a territory's proposed plan for providing prescription drug coverage do not limit the methods through which a territory may provide drug coverage for its residents. The regulations provide only that a territory must submit a plan that describes the type of medical assistance to be provided, the number of eligible residents, and an assurance that no more than ten percent of the increased Medicaid funding will be used for administrative expenses. <i>See</i> 42 C.F.R. &#167; 423.907. There is <i>no</i> requirement that a territory use an entity established by the Medicare laws to provide drug coverage for its dual eligible population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, Congress's purpose in enacting &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) was to protect the purely federal nature of Medicare Advantage plans operating under Medicare. But here, ASES was not regulating the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare Part C;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it was preventing an existing Medicare Advantage plan from participating in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. By excluding First Medical from participating in Medicare Platino, ASES was not setting a standard for the operation of a Medicare Advantage plan operating under Medicare. Rather, it was acting to protect the integrity of the Puerto Rico Medicaid system in its role as the Commonwealth's Medicaid administrator. <i>See Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201446\"><a href=\"/opinion/201446/rio-grande-community-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Medicaid ... is ... directly administered by state governments\"). Nothing in federal Medicare law prohibits this. Accordingly, we conclude that, in the circumstances presented, Puerto Rico Law 72 has not been preempted by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical offers an alternative argument for affirmance. It argues that, even if Law 72 has not been preempted by &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3), ASES did not have authority under federal <i>Medicaid</i> law to exclude it from participating in Medicare Platino. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Medicaid is a state-run program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Puerto Rico accepts federal Medicaid funds and thus must comply with federal Medicaid laws. <i>See Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr.,</i> 397 F.3d at 61. Federal Medicaid law establishes that \"in addition to any other authority, a State may exclude any individual or entity [from participating in its Medicaid program] for any for reason which the Secretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation in [Medicare].\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(p).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical interprets this statute to limit ASES's authority to exclude entities from participating in its Medicaid program to those reasons for which the Secretary could prohibit an entity from participating in Medicare. According to First Medical, Law 72 establishes a basis for exclusion that does not exist under Medicare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Medical incorrectly interprets the Medicaid exclusion statute. The statute expressly grants states the authority to exclude entities from their Medicaid programs for reasons that the Secretary could use to exclude entities from participating in Medicare. But it also preserves the state's ability to exclude entities from participating in Medicaid under \"any other authority.\" The legislative history clarifies that this \"any other authority\" language was intended to permit a state to exclude an entity from its Medicaid program for <i>any</i> reason established by state law. The Senate Report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Committee bill clarifies current Medicaid Law by expressly granting States the authority to exclude individuals or entities from participation in their Medicaid programs for any reason that constitutes a basis for an exclusion from Medicare . . . . <i>This provision is not intended to preclude a State from establishing, under State law, any other bases for excluding individuals or entities from its Medicaid program.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S. Rep. 100-109 at 20, reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 700 (emphasis supplied). ASES was thus free, under federal Medicaid law, to enforce Law 72 to exclude First Medical from participating in Medicare Platino.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, Puerto Rico Law 72 has not been preempted by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395w-26(b)(3) and ASES was not precluded by federal Medicaid law from enforcing Law 72 to exclude First Medical from participating in Medicare Platino.
