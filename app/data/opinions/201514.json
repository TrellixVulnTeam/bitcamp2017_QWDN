This case arose from dealings that a Cayman\n\nIslands construction firm had with a client, Paul Gargano, a\n\nMassachusetts lawyer who is also a resident of the Cayman Islands\n\nby grant of status, owns property there, and sought to build a home\n\nthere.

After\n\nthe business relationship broke down over payment issues, Gargano\n\nfiled suit in federal district court in Massachusetts, asserting\n\nvarious contract, fraud, and unfair practices claims.\n\n           The magistrate judge recommended granting a motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.
