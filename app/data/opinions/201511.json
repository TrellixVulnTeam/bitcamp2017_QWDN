Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 29, 2005\n\f           Per   Curiam.         The     government     originally   charged\n\npetitioner-appellant Jaime Rivera Alicea in a five-count felony\n\nindictment.    A trial yielded a split decision.         The jury convicted\n\nthe petitioner of aiding and abetting the possession with intent to\n\ndistribute eighteen kilos of cocaine on May 23, 1996 (count 1);\n\nconspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute on that\n\ndate (count 2); and aiding and abetting the use and carriage of a\n\nfirearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime (count 3).            See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c).               At the same\n\ntime, the jury acquitted the petitioner of a charge that he had\n\nattempted to kill, intimidate, or interfere with Carlos Montalvo,\n\na federal agent, while Montalvo was performing his official duties\n\n(count 4); and a charge that he had attempted to kill, intimidate,\n\nor interfere with Carmen D. Ortíz Díaz, a cross-designated agent\n\nassisting Customs Service personnel in the execution of their\n\nduties (count 5).     The district court sentenced the petitioner to\n\nconcurrent 360-month incarcerative terms on the first two counts\n\nand a consecutive five-year term on the third count.            Judgment was\n\nentered on May 29, 1998.\n\n           The petitioner unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on\n\nthe ground of newly discovered evidence, see Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33(a),   and   then   appealed    to    this   court.     We   affirmed   the\n\nconvictions, the sentence, and the denial of the motion for new\n\ntrial.   United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            On December 6, 2000, the petitioner served a pro se\n\nmotion to vacate and set aside the convictions and sentence.                        See\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255.        The district court, through a magistrate judge,\n\nwisely    appointed      counsel    for    the   petitioner        and    ordered   the\n\ngovernment to respond.            Following receipt of the response, the\n\nmagistrate judge eschewed an evidentiary hearing and issued a\n\nreport and recommendation suggesting that relief under section 2255\n\nbe denied.      Rivera Alicea v. United States, No. 00-2544 (D.P.R.\n\nJan. 21, 2004) (unpublished report and recommendation).\n\n            The petitioner filed timely objections to the report and\n\nrecommendation.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).             On March 29, 2004, the\n\ndistrict court, without pausing to convene an evidentiary hearing,\n\nadopted   the    magistrate       judge's    report   and    recommendation         and\n\ndismissed the section 2255 petition with prejudice.                      Rivera Alicea\n\nv. United States, No. 00-2544, slip op. (D.P.R. Mar. 29, 2004)\n\n(unpublished).     This timely appeal followed.\n\n            We granted a certificate of appealability, see 28 U.S.C.\n\n§   2253(c),    limited    to    the    petitioner's       claim    of    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.          That claim was premised on trial counsel's\n\nputative failure to investigate, interview, and subpoena Raquelina\n\nMejías and      Aleida    Gotay    as     witnesses   at    the    criminal    trial.\n\nBriefing and oral argument ensued.\n\n            We need not tarry. In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668 (1984), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fto counsel in a criminal case is the right to the effective\n\nassistance of counsel.           Id. at 686.         In order to obtain reversal of\n\na conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant\n\nmust       show    both   that       counsel's      representation   fell     below    an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness, id. at 687-88, and that there\n\nis a reasonable probability that, but for such unprofessional\n\nerrors, the conviction would not have transpired, id. at 694. Such\n\na claim may be raised collaterally by means of a petition for\n\nhabeas relief.            See, e.g., Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 53\n\n(1985); Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                  In   this   case,     the    principal       witness   against      the\n\npetitioner on the counts of conviction was José Alberto Vásquez-\n\nHernández         (Vásquez),     a    coconspirator      who   became    a   government\n\nwitness.      The petitioner alleges that, while incarcerated to await\n\ntrial, he had conversations with Vásquez's girlfriend (Raquelina\n\nMejías) and with a cooperating government witness (Aleida Gotay).\n\nThe petitioner claims that both of these women told him that\n\nVásquez had admitted that he intended to lie about the petitioner's\n\ninvolvement in the drug-trafficking enterprise in order to curry\n\nfavor with the authorities and obtain a sentence reduction.1                          The\n\npetitioner further alleges that he informed his trial counsel,\n\nRamón García-García (García), well before the trial, about these\n\n\n       1\n      Mejías had provided a corroborative statement, which was\nannexed to a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing on the habeas\npetition.\n\n                                              -4-\n\fpotential witnesses, but that the lawyer failed to investigate or\n\notherwise   act   upon   this   information.         When   the    petitioner\n\nquestioned this inaction, García assured him (inaccurately, as\n\nmatters turned out) that the government had no proof and that the\n\ntrial would culminate in a favorable verdict.\n\n            These allegations, made on the petitioner's personal\n\nknowledge, are neither inherently improbable nor compromised by the\n\ntrial   transcript.      Indeed,   they    stand    uncontradicted    on   the\n\nexisting record.      In its response to the section 2255 motion, the\n\ngovernment provided no statement from García and the court held no\n\nevidentiary hearing.      Under the circumstances, there was a prima\n\nfacie showing of objectively unreasonable attorney performance in\n\nfailing either to investigate the situation or, at least, to\n\ninterview two potentially crucial witnesses.          See, e.g., Horton v.\n\nAllen, 370 F.3d 75, 87 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that, in certain\n\ncircumstances,    \"the   failure   of     defense   counsel   to    interview\n\nwitnesses can establish the deficient performance prong of the\n\nStrickland analysis\"); cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 371\n\n(2000) (finding deficient performance for defense counsel's failure\n\nto discover and present significant mitigating evidence at the\n\nsentencing hearing).\n\n            We say \"prima facie\" because it may be that García was\n\nnot so informed by the petitioner and/or that García made no such\n\nrepresentation.    Were such evidence forthcoming — and we have no\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fway of telling — it would undercut the petitioner's prima facie\n\nshowing.    We must, however, deal with the record as it stands,\n\nwithout    speculating   as   to   what   may   turn   up   upon   further\n\ninvestigation.\n\n           A similar problem surrounds the question of prejudice.\n\nGiven the absence of an evidentiary hearing, it is difficult to\n\ngauge what Mejías and Gotay actually would have said under the\n\nprodding of direct and cross-examination. By the same token, it is\n\nnearly impossible to assess either their credibility or the impact\n\nthat their testimony might have had on the jury.       Added to this, we\n\nknow that Vásquez — the target of the proffered impeachment — was\n\nthe government's key witness against the petitioner; that the\n\ntestimony of the next most critical witness, Montalvo, was open to\n\nsome question; that the government's case against the petitioner\n\nwas not overwhelming; and that the jury returned a split verdict,\n\nexonerating the petitioner on two of the five counts.         Under these\n\ncircumstances, the existence of prejudice vel non is unusually hard\n\nto evaluate.     Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 696 (explaining that \"a\n\nverdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more\n\nlikely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming\n\nrecord support); Stephens v. Hall, 294 F.3d 210, 218 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (similar).\n\n           To its credit, the government, at oral argument, conceded\n\nthat an evidentiary hearing would have been useful and advised us\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthat it had no objection to a remand for that purpose.     We think\n\nthat it is in the interests of justice to accept the government's\n\nconcession.   Consequently, we vacate the order appealed from and\n\nremand the case so that the district court may hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n           We need go no further. We caution that nothing contained\n\nherein should be read as intimating any view on our part as to the\n\ncorrect outcome on remand.   We leave that decision, at least in the\n\nfirst instance, in the capable hands of the district judge.\n\n\n\n           The order dismissing the section 2255 petition is vacated\n\nand the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

A trial yielded a split decision. The jury convicted the petitioner of aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute eighteen kilos of cocaine on May 23, 1996 (count 1); conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute on that date (count 2); and aiding and abetting the use and carriage of a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime (count 3). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 924(c). At the same time, the jury acquitted the petitioner of a charge that he had attempted to kill, intimidate, or interfere with Carlos Montalvo, a federal agent, while Montalvo was performing his official duties (count 4); and a charge that he had attempted to kill, intimidate, or interfere with Carmen D. Ortiz Diaz, a cross-designated agent assisting Customs Service personnel in the execution of their duties (count 5). The district court sentenced the petitioner to concurrent 360-month incarcerative terms on the first two counts and a consecutive five-year term on the third count. Judgment was entered on May 29, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a), and then appealed to this court. We affirmed the convictions, the sentence, and the denial of the motion for new trial. <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 2000, the petitioner served a pro se motion to vacate and set aside the convictions and sentence. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. The district court, through a magistrate judge, wisely appointed counsel for the petitioner and ordered the government to respond. Following receipt of the response, the magistrate judge eschewed an evidentiary hearing and issued a report and recommendation suggesting that relief under section 2255 be denied. <i>Rivera Alicea v. United States,</i> No. 00-2544 (D.P.R. Jan. 21, 2004) (unpublished report and recommendation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner filed timely objections to the report and recommendation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). On March 29, 2004, the district court, without pausing to convene an evidentiary hearing, adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and dismissed the section 2255 petition with prejudice. <i>Rivera Alicea v. United States,</i> No. 00-2544, slip op. (D.P.R. Mar. 29, 2004) (unpublished). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We granted a certificate of appealability, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c), limited to the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. That claim was premised on trial counsel's putative failure to investigate, interview, and subpoena Raquelina Mejias and Aleida Gotay as witnesses at the criminal trial. Briefing and oral argument ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. In <i>Strickland v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a criminal case is the right to the effective assistance of counsel. <i>Id.</i> at 686, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In order to obtain reversal of a conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show both that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, <i>id.</i> at 687-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>, and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for such unprofessional errors, the conviction would not have transpired, <i>id.</i> at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. Such a claim may be raised collaterally by means of a petition for habeas relief. <i>See, e.g., Hill v. Lockhart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (1985); <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the principal witness against the petitioner on the counts of conviction was Jose Alberto Vasquez-Hernandez (Vasquez), a coconspirator who became a government witness. The petitioner alleges that, while incarcerated to await trial, he had conversations with Vasquez's girlfriend (Raquelina Mejias) and with a cooperating government witness (Aleida Gotay). The petitioner claims that both of these women told him that Vasquez had admitted that he intended to lie about the petitioner's involvement in the drug-trafficking enterprise in order to curry favor with the authorities and obtain a sentence reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The petitioner further alleges that he informed his trial counsel, Ramon Garcia-Garcia (Garcia), well before the trial, about these potential witnesses, but that the lawyer failed to investigate or otherwise act upon this information. When the petitioner questioned this inaction, Garcia assured him (inaccurately, as matters turned out) that the government had no proof and that the trial would culminate in a favorable verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations, made on the petitioner's personal knowledge, are neither inherently improbable nor compromised by the trial transcript. Indeed, they stand uncontradicted on the existing record. In its response to the section 2255 motion, the government provided no statement from Garcia and the court held no evidentiary hearing. Under the circumstances, there was a prima facie showing of objectively unreasonable attorney performance in failing either to investigate the situation or, at least, to interview two potentially crucial witnesses. <i>See, e.g., Horton v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201031\"><a href=\"/opinion/201031/horton-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that, in certain circumstances, \"the failure of defense counsel to interview witnesses can establish the deficient performance prong of the <i>Strickland</i> analysis\"); <i>cf. Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span> (2000) (finding deficient performance for defense counsel's failure to discover and present significant mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"prima facie\" because it may be that Garcia was not so informed by the petitioner and/or that Garcia made no such representation. Were such evidence forthcoming &#8212; and we have no way of telling &#8212; it would undercut the petitioner's prima facie showing. We must, however, deal with the record as it stands, without speculating as to what may turn up upon further investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar problem surrounds the question of prejudice. Given the absence of an evidentiary hearing, it is difficult to gauge what Mejias and Gotay actually would have said under the prodding of direct and cross-examination. By the same token, it is nearly impossible to assess either their credibility or the impact that their testimony might have had on the jury. Added to this, we know that Vasquez &#8212; the target of the proffered impeachment &#8212; was the government's key witness against the petitioner; that the testimony of the next most critical witness, Montalvo, was open to some question; that the government's case against the petitioner was not overwhelming; and that the jury returned a split verdict, exonerating the petitioner on two of the five counts. Under these circumstances, the existence of prejudice vel non is unusually hard to evaluate. <i>Cf. Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 696, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span> (explaining that \"a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support\"); <i>Stephens v. Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200011\"><a href=\"/opinion/200011/stephens-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.2002) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To its credit, the government, at oral argument, conceded that an evidentiary hearing would have been useful and advised us that it had no objection to a remand for that purpose. We think that it is in the interests of justice to accept the government's concession. Consequently, we vacate the order appealed from and remand the case so that the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We caution that nothing contained herein should be read as intimating any view on our part as to the correct outcome on remand. We leave that decision, at least in the first instance, in the capable hands of the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The order dismissing the section 2255 petition is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mejias had provided a corroborative statement, which was annexed to a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing on the habeas petition</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
