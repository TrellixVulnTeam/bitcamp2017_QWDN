This petition for review is\n\nthe latest chapter in a long-running dispute between Joan Taylor\n\n(\"Taylor\")   and    Beverly     M.   Migliore   (\"Migliore\")        (collectively\n\n\"appellants\") on the one hand, and the State of Rhode Island\n\n(\"State\")    and    the   Rhode      Island   Department     of     Environmental\n\nManagement (\"RIDEM\") on the other.            We last encountered this case\n\nin 2002, when appellants sought review of a district court order\n\nthat prevented the United States Department of Labor (\"Department\n\nof Labor\") from adjudicating their complaints that they had been\n\nfired in retaliation for reporting potential violations of the\n\nSolid Waste Disposal Act (\"SWDA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901-6992k.                     See\n\nRhode Island Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States (RIDEM v.\n\nUnited States), 304 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            In that case, we upheld the district court's order but\n\nmodified it in that we allowed the Department of Labor to act where\n\nthe   Assistant     Secretary     for   Occupational       Safety    and   Health\n\n(\"Assistant Secretary\") intervened in the proceedings to remove any\n\nsovereign immunity bar.           Following our decision, the Assistant\n\nSecretary attempted to intervene in one suit brought by Migliore\n\nbut declined to intervene in other suits by the appellants against\n\nthe State and RIDEM.        In this petition, appellants contest this\n\ndecision    not    to   intervene     and   argue   that   regardless      of   the\n\nAssistant Secretary's inaction, they should be allowed to pursue\n\ntheir suits because the State has waived its sovereign immunity\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthrough other means. We disagree, and after careful consideration,\n\nwe deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the\n\nAdministrative Review Board (\"ARB\") of the Department of Labor.\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n          This case has a complicated history.   In 1988, Migliore,\n\nan employee of RIDEM, filed with the Assistant Secretary three\n\ncomplaints against RIDEM, alleging that the state agency had\n\nviolated the whistleblower provisions of the SWDA.   In particular,\n\nMigliore claimed that RIDEM violated the SWDA by retaliating\n\nagainst her for reporting what she believed to be RIDEM's failure\n\nto implement properly the SWDA.    After an investigation, however,\n\nthe Assistant Secretary determined that the state agency had not\n\nviolated the SWDA.   Migliore objected to the Assistant Secretary's\n\nfindings and, as was her right, requested a hearing before an\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") at the Department of Labor.1     On\n\nAugust 13, 1999, following a lengthy hearing, the ALJ to whom the\n\ncase had been assigned issued a recommended decision awarding\n\nMigliore both equitable relief and damages (Migliore I).      RIDEM\n\nthen appealed the ALJ's decision to the ARB.\n\n          On August 31, 1999, Migliore filed another complaint with\n\nthe Assistant Secretary (Migliore II) alleging that RIDEM had\n\nretaliated against her for pursuing her initial complaint.   After\n\n\n\n1\n   For a full discussion of the administrative scheme established\nby the SWDA, see RIDEM, 304 F.3d at 37-38.\n\n                                  -4-\n\finvestigating, the Assistant Secretary found that RIDEM had indeed\n\nviolated the whistleblower provisions of the SWDA by, among other\n\nthings, issuing a statement to the media that attacked Migliore's\n\ncredibility personally and went \"beyond mere disagreement\" with the\n\nALJ's findings in Migliore I. The order accompanying the Assistant\n\nSecretary's determination awarded Migliore $10,000 in damages.\n\nRIDEM objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and order in\n\nMigliore II and requested an ALJ hearing to appeal these matters.\n\nIn its hearing request letter, RIDEM did not invoke a defense of\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n           Also following the ALJ's decision in Migliore I, two of\n\nMigliore's co-workers, Taylor and Barbara Raddatz (\"Raddatz\"),\n\nfiled   whistleblower   complaints   with   the   Assistant   Secretary\n\nalleging retaliation by RIDEM for their participation in Migliore\n\nI.   After the Assistant Secretary quickly issued his determination\n\nthat Raddatz's complaint lacked merit, Raddatz requested an ALJ\n\nhearing.   During this period, the Assistant Secretary continued to\n\ninvestigate Taylor's complaint.\n\n           On February 21, 2000, while Migliore I was pending before\n\nthe ARB and the Migliore II and Raddatz cases were pending before\n\nan ALJ, and while Taylor's complaint was being investigated by the\n\nAssistant Secretary, the State and RIDEM sought injunctive relief\n\nin federal district court.    Alleging a violation of its sovereign\n\nimmunity, the State sought to enjoin the Department of Labor from\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\ffurther   investigation    and    adjudication      of    the   complaints    of\n\nMigliore, Raddatz, and Taylor. On September 29, 2000, the district\n\ncourt enjoined the Department of Labor's adjudication of the\n\ncomplaints   but   declined    to    enjoin   the    Assistant      Secretary's\n\ninvestigation of Taylor's complaint.          See Rhode Island v. United\n\nStates, 115 F. Supp. 2d 269, 279 (D.R.I. 2000).            Shortly after this\n\ndecision was handed down, the Assistant Secretary, in November\n\n2000, issued a determination in Taylor's favor finding that her\n\nallegations had merit.        He also ordered RIDEM to pay to Taylor\n\n$7,170 to reimburse her for her legal fees.           RIDEM objected to the\n\nAssistant Secretary's findings and order and requested a hearing\n\nbefore an ALJ.\n\n           The appellants, along with Raddatz, then appealed the\n\norder of the district court.           In 2002, this Court upheld the\n\ndistrict court's order but modified it in one important respect.\n\nSee RIDEM, 304 F.3d at 53-54.        We held that the Secretary of Labor\n\nwas not prohibited \"from intervening in the enjoined proceedings\n\nand removing the sovereign immunity bar.\"2               Id.    Distinguishing\n\ncases that are barred by sovereign immunity, i.e., those pursued by\n\nprivate parties in federal courts or administrative tribunals\n\nagainst states, from cases that are not barred, i.e., those brought\n\nagainst   states   by   federal     administrative       agencies   to   enforce\n\n\n2\n   This Court's reference to \"the Secretary of Labor\" includes not\nonly the Secretary of Labor herself, but also those working under\nher, such as the Assistant Secretary.\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffederal laws, we concluded that intervention by the Secretary in\n\nthe enjoined cases would remove the sovereign immunity bar.                See\n\nid. at 39, 53-54 (quoting from the district court's discussion of\n\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999)).\n\n            On August 8, 2003, the Assistant Secretary filed a motion\n\nto intervene in Migliore I.3         Rhode Island objected, contending\n\nthat    intervention      would   violate   the   district   court's      2000\n\ninjunction, as modified by this Court's 2002 decision in RIDEM.\n\nRhode Island therefore returned to district court seeking to enjoin\n\nthe Assistant Secretary from intervening. On January 29, 2004, the\n\ndistrict court granted Rhode Island's motion, ruling that the\n\nAssistant Secretary could not intervene in Migliore I, because\n\nRhode Island's sovereign immunity is violated if intervention\n\noccurs at the time the case is before the ARB.           Any intervention,\n\nstated the district court, had to occur \"at or before the ALJ\n\nstage.\"    See Rhode Island v. United States, 301 F. Supp. 2d 151,\n\n156    (D.R.I.   2004).     Since   the   Assistant   Secretary   could    not\n\nintervene, the sovereign immunity bar was upheld, and the ARB was\n\ncompelled to dismiss the case on April 30, 2004.\n\n            On May 13, 2004, the Secretary of Labor advised the\n\nappellants that she would not intervene in their suits against the\n\nState and RIDEM (Taylor and Migliore II).             As a result, the ALJ\n\ndismissed, on sovereign immunity grounds, Migliore's complaint on\n\n\n3\n    Recall that this case was already before the ARB at this point.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJuly 14, 2004, and Taylor's complaint on August 12, 2004.4   Because\n\nthe Secretary had decided not to intervene, the sovereign immunity\n\nbar remained.\n\n          The appellants then appealed the ALJ's dismissal of their\n\ncomplaints to the ARB.     In two separate proceedings, the ARB\n\naffirmed the ALJ's actions.   Although the ARB provided a number of\n\nreasons for its decisions to affirm, there are two grounds in\n\nparticular that appellants challenge here.   First, appellants had\n\nargued, using the reasoning of Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of the\n\nUniv. Sys. of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613 (2002), that the State had\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity merely by requesting a hearing before\n\nthe ALJ to contest the Assistant Secretary's initial findings. The\n\nARB, however, dismissed this argument for two reasons.       It held\n\nthat our analysis of Lapides in RIDEM   -- where we concluded that\n\nthe State's pursuit of injunctive relief in the federal district\n\ncourt did not constitute a waiver of its sovereign immunity -- was\n\nequally applicable to the State's requests for ALJ hearings in the\n\nTaylor and Migliore II cases.   It also recognized that there is a\n\ndistinction between the stage during which the Assistant Secretary\n\ninvestigates complaints and the stage in which the ALJ adjudicates\n\n\n\n4\n   The Secretary of Labor also advised Raddatz at this time that\nshe would not intervene in her suit against the State and RIDEM.\nAs a result, the ALJ subsequently dismissed her complaint. Raddatz\nthen appealed the ALJ's dismissal to the ARB.        After the ARB\naffirmed the ALJ's dismissal, Raddatz, unlike the appellants here,\ndeclined to contest the ARB's decision before this Court.\n\n                                -8-\n\fthose complaints.        The ARB held that sovereign immunity can be\n\nraised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory\n\nto the adjudicatory stage.         The only mechanism for moving the\n\ncomplaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity\n\ndefense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the\n\nparties to request a hearing.               In making this request for a\n\nhearing,   the   party    is   merely    clarifying    its      entitlement   to\n\nsovereign immunity, not waiving it.\n\n           Second, in affirming the ALJ's dismissal of the Taylor\n\ncase, the ARB, noting that the Secretary had decided not to\n\nintervene, agreed with the ALJ that \"neither the federal court\n\ndecisions granting injunctive relief to Rhode Island nor other\n\nlegal   authorities\"      compelled     the    Secretary   to    intervene    to\n\nprosecute Taylor's complaint.         In re Joan Taylor, ARB Case No. 04-\n\n166 (Nov. 29, 2004).      The ARB also cited this Court's statement in\n\nRIDEM that the Secretary may intervene \"if she so chooses,\" 304\n\nF.3d at 55, as well as the regulation at 29 C.F.R. § 24.6(f)(1),\n\nwhich states that the Secretary's designee may participate in the\n\nproceedings \"at [his] discretion.\"            Id.\n\n           It is the ARB's dismissals on these two grounds that the\n\nappellants challenge here.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f                                  II.   Discussion\n\nA. Standard of review\n\n            In     RIDEM,    we     held    that      \"the      Secretary's     final\n\ndeterminations under the whistleblower provisions [of the SWDA] are\n\nsubject to review in the court of appeals in accordance with\n\njudicial review provisions of the APA [Administrative Procedure\n\nAct].\"    RIDEM, 304 F.3d at 38.                 Accordingly, the Secretary's\n\ndecisions     will    be    upheld      unless    they     are    \"unsupported     by\n\nsubstantial evidence\" or are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"                     5 U.S.C. §§\n\n706(2)(A),(E).       See also Sasse v. Dep't of Labor, 409 F.3d 773, 778\n\n(6th Cir. 2005); Simon v. Simmons Foods, 49 F.3d 386, 389-90 (8th\n\nCir. 1995).\n\nB. Sovereign immunity\n\n            Appellants' first claim is that despite the Secretary's\n\nrefusal to intervene in their cases, the State has waived its\n\nsovereign immunity through other means.                        A state's sovereign\n\nimmunity is \"a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure.\"\n\nClark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447 (1883).                     We have previously\n\nstated that \"[a] state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity to\n\nsuit in three ways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to\n\nsubmit    itself     to    the    jurisdiction        of   a    federal    court   or\n\nadministrative proceeding; (2) by consent to or participation in a\n\nfederal   program     for   which       waiver   of    immunity     is    an   express\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fcondition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\"       New\n\nHampshire v. Ramsey, 366 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n                                1.\n\n            Appellants here invoke two separate kinds of waiver.\n\nFirst, they claim that the State has waived its sovereign immunity\n\nthrough its litigation conduct -- namely, by requesting hearings\n\nbefore an ALJ following the initial investigative findings by the\n\nAssistant Secretary.   We note initially that we have confronted a\n\nsimilar argument in two of our recent cases.     In both RIDEM and\n\nRamsey, it was claimed that a state waived its sovereign immunity\n\nsolely by seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative\n\ndecision.    In both cases, however, we rejected this argument,\n\nnoting that the mere \"seeking of judicial review of an agency\n\ndecision . . . by a state that was a defendant before the agency\"\n\nwas insufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity.   Ramsey, 366\n\nF.3d at 20; see also RIDEM, 304 F.3d at 49-50.   The argument made\n\nhere is slightly different, as it relates to the review of an\n\nadministrative decision not before a federal Article III court, but\n\nrather before an federal administrative law judge.   Nevertheless,\n\nwe believe that the reasoning of our earlier opinions applies in\n\nthis instance as well.   See also Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South\n\nCarolina State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 760 (2002) (finding that\n\nthe sovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fapplies in adjudications conducted by a federal administrative\n\nagency); Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 513-14 (1978) (noting the\n\nsimilarities between adjudication by an administrative law judge in\n\na federal administrative agency and adjudication by judges in a\n\ncourt).\n\n            We also find unconvincing an offshoot of this argument --\n\nnamely, appellants' claim that the State has waived its immunity\n\nthrough its litigation conduct because it has selectively invoked\n\nits immunity to gain a litigation advantage.        Appellants draw this\n\nidea from two cases in particular: Lapides and Ramsey. In Lapides,\n\nthe Supreme Court confronted a case in which the plaintiff had\n\nbrought suit against the state in state court on a claim in which\n\nthe state had statutorily waived its immunity.              The state, in\n\nresponse, removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss,\n\nasserting that it was immune from suit in federal court under the\n\nEleventh Amendment.    The Court held that in removing the case, the\n\nstate had \"voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal\n\ncourt\" and therefore had waived its immunity by its litigation\n\nconduct.    Lapides, 535 U.S. at 622.         This decision was based in\n\npart on the inequity of allowing the state to reverse its statutory\n\nwaiver by a change in forum.\n\n            In Ramsey (in a part of the opinion different from that\n\ndiscussed   above),   we   were   similarly    distressed   by   a   state's\n\nexploitation of its sovereign immunity to obtain unfair litigation\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fadvantages.        In that case, the State of New Hampshire made a\n\n\"voluntary    and    calculated\"    choice       to    attempt    to   obtain   the\n\ndismissal of a federal court action, wanting instead to litigate\n\ncertain claims through a state administrative grievance procedure.\n\nOnce the dismissal was granted, the state participated in the\n\nadministrative grievance procedure, knowing that the procedure\n\nultimately provided for federal judicial review. When the case did\n\nactually reach a federal court, the state tried to assert its\n\nsovereign immunity.       We held, however, that because New Hampshire\n\nparticipated to its advantage in the grievance procedure to the\n\ndetriment of its opponents, the state had waived its immunity by\n\nits litigation conduct.        We said, in other words, that \"the state,\n\nhaving gained the advantage that it sought, is bound by the choice\n\nthat it made.\"       Ramsey, 366 F.3d at 18.\n\n             Appellants argue that this case is similar to Lapides and\n\nRamsey and that the State here has waived its immunity because it\n\ntoo   used   its    immunity   to   gain    a    litigation       advantage.    In\n\nparticular,    the    appellants    point       to    how   the   State   requested\n\nhearings before the ALJ when it was not compelled to do so.                  It had\n\nother means of preserving its rights -- namely, it could have\n\nsimply waited for the determinations of the Assistant Secretary to\n\nbecome final and then defended in enforcement proceedings by\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fasserting sovereign immunity at that point.5         Such a course of\n\naction would have come with a price.      The State would have faced\n\nthe   daunting   prospect   of   Secretarial   involvement,   and   such\n\ninvolvement would have precluded the State from asserting its\n\nsovereign immunity.6    ALJ hearings, by contrast, posed no such\n\nrisk, according to the appellants, because in such a setting the\n\nState would be permitted to invoke sovereign immunity \"at its\n\npleasure.\"7   In light of the litigation advantages that came with\n\n\n5\n   Here, appellants are relying on a provision in 29 C.F.R. § 24.4\n(d)(2), which states: \"If a request for [an ALJ] hearing is not\ntimely filed, the notice of determination shall become the final\norder of the Secretary.\" Although we did not squarely address it,\nthe appellees in Ramsey made an identical argument. See Ramsey,\n366 F.3d at 20.\n6\n   If Taylor and/or Migliore had brought suit personally against\nthe State in federal court to enforce the determinations of the\nAssistant Secretary, the State would have been able to invoke\nsovereign immunity. See 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(A) (noting that\ncitizen civil suits under 42 U.S.C. § 6972 may enforce the SWDA's\nsubstantive provisions only to the extent permitted by the Eleventh\nAmendment to the Constitution). If, however, the Secretary was the\none to bring the enforcement action, the State would potentially\nface liability, as the Secretary is allowed to bring an action\nagainst a state to enforce a federal law without worrying about the\nsovereign immunity bar. See United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621,\n644-45 (1892).\n7\n   There are two problems with this argument. First, appellants\nargue that the State could invoke its sovereign immunity \"at its\npleasure\" before an ALJ because \"the posture of the cases would\nbecome individuals versus the State.\" Appellants Reply Br. 5. We\nare not certain that this proposition is true. At the time that\nthe State was deciding whether to request ALJ hearings in this\ncase, in 1999 and 2000, the question of whether a state could claim\nsovereign immunity in an administrative proceeding remained an open\none.   This question was only resolved in 2002 with the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Federal Maritime Comm'n, which held that the\nsovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also applies\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthe State's conscious decision to preserve its rights through ALJ\n\nhearings, appellants argue that we should hold that the State\n\nwaived its immunity through its litigation conduct.\n\n          Such a choice, however, is different from the situation\n\npresented in Lapides or Ramsey.    The State here never made a prior\n\ndecision that affected its ability to invoke its immunity, as was\n\nthe case in Lapides or Ramsey.    To be sure, the choice faced by the\n\nState in this case related to immunity.     But the State's decision\n\nto preserve its rights through an ALJ hearing (rather than through\n\nwaiting for an enforcement action) was the first time it made any\n\ndecision relating to that immunity.     Indeed, it had to be.   As the\n\nARB correctly recognized, there is a clear distinction between the\n\nstage in which the Assistant Secretary investigates complaints and\n\nthe stage in which the ALJ adjudicates those complaints. Sovereign\n\nimmunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from\n\nthe investigatory to the adjudicatory stage.      The only mechanism\n\n\n\nin adjudications conducted by a federal administrative agency. 535\nU.S. at 760. Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, we assume\nhere that the appellants are correct and that the State could\ninvoke its sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure\" in an ALJ hearing.\nSecond, appellants are simply assuming that the Secretary would not\nintervene in an ALJ hearing. However, according to the regulations\nin effect in 1999 and 2000, the Assistant Secretary had the right\nto intervene.   See 29 C.F.R. § 24.6(f)(1) (1999) and 29 C.F.R.\n§ 24.6(f)(1) (2000). Since at that time the parties did not have\nthe benefit of our 2002 decision in RIDEM saying that such\nintervention by the Assistant Secretary would remove the sovereign\nimmunity bar, the effect of Secretarial intervention was perhaps\nnot clear. Therefore, we decline to base our holding on such an\nargument and simply assume that the appellants are correct.\n\n                                 -15-\n\ffor moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the\n\nsovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is\n\nfor one of the parties to request a hearing, as the State did here.\n\nThus, this is not a situation, such as in Lapides, where the state\n\nhas attempted \"to regain, by a change in forum, [a] litigation\n\nadvantage that [it] . . . already renounced by a general statute.\"\n\nRamsey, 366 F.3d at 20 (discussing Lapides), or one such as in\n\nRamsey, where New Hampshire tried to reverse the effects of a\n\nchoice it had earlier made.     In requesting ALJ hearings, the State\n\nhere took advantage of its first opportunity to assert a sovereign\n\nimmunity    defense,   a   defense    that   was   not   available   at   the\n\ninvestigatory stage of the administrative proceedings.\n\n            The State here may have obtained a litigation advantage\n\nfrom its decision to pursue ALJ hearings.          The Lapides-Ramsey line\n\nof cases, however, does not prevent a litigant from obtaining any\n\nsort of advantage relating to immunity in pursuing his case.              They\n\nonly condemn those litigation advantages that are \"inconsistent\" or\n\n\"unfair.\"    See Lapides, 535 U.S. at 622 (noting that the rules\n\ngoverning waiver by litigation conduct are motivated by \"problems\n\nof inconsistency and unfairness\").            Where the state tries to\n\nbacktrack on immunity decisions it has already made, as was the\n\ncase in both Lapides and Ramsey, such inconsistency and unfairness\n\nare evident.    Nothing the State did in this case, however, can be\n\ndeemed \"unfair\" or \"inconsistent.\"           See RIDEM, 304 F.3d at 49\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f(noting that the state has \"consistently asserted its sovereign\n\nimmunity . . . in the administrative proceeding\").8           Therefore, we\n\ndecline to find that the State waived its sovereign immunity as a\n\nresult of its litigation conduct.\n\n                                       2.\n\n            Appellants also argue that the State has waived its\n\nsovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1, which waives the\n\nState's immunity \"in all actions of tort in the same manner as a\n\nprivate individual or corporation.\"           Appellants argue that their\n\nemployment discrimination claims here are tort actions in order to\n\nshow that the State has waived its sovereign immunity in this case.\n\nThey also state that their claims closely resemble discrimination\n\nactions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which have been\n\nrecognized as one type of claim that is covered by R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§ 9-31-1.   See Marrapese v. Rhode Island, 500 F. Supp. 1207 (D.R.I.\n\n1980).\n\n            Whatever   the   merits    of    these   arguments,   appellants'\n\nreliance on R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 is misplaced.            Following this\n\nCourt's decision in RIDEM, Taylor and Migliore never raised before\n\neither the ALJ or the ARB the applicability of the Rhode Island\n\n\n\n8\n   See also Ramsey, 366 F.3d at 21 (noting, in its discussion of\nwaiver of immunity from damages [as opposed to its discussion of\nwaiver of immunity from prospective equitable relief], that New\nHampshire gained no unfair litigation advantage as to damages by\nseeking judicial review of the grievance procedure because it\n\"consistently asserted its immunity from damages when at issue.\").\n\n                                      -17-\n\fstatute   to    their    administrative    cases.   Nor    is     the   argument\n\nreferenced anywhere in the administrative record.                 Accordingly,\n\nappellants have forfeited the argument by failing to raise it\n\nduring the administrative proceedings.         See Disabled Americans for\n\nEqual Access, Inc. v. Ferries del Caribe, Inc., 405 F.3d 60, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (noting that legal theories raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal are waived); Okmyansky v. Herbalife Int'l of Am.,\n\nInc., 415 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 2005) (same); RIDEM, 304 F.3d at\n\n50 (noting that \"[c]laims of waiver of immunity are like any other\n\nlegal argument and may themselves be waived or forfeited if not\n\nseasonably asserted.\").\n\n           In    their    reply   brief,   appellants     claim    that   these\n\narguments relating to forfeiture invoke the doctrine of exhaustion\n\n-- i.e., that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nbefore proceeding before a court.           In their attempt to show the\n\ninapplicability of such a doctrine here, appellants point out that\n\nthe exhaustion doctrine is subject to certain exceptions.                   For\n\nexample, they note that a party is not required to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies where it would be futile for it to do so.\n\nSee, e.g., Drinkwater v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 846 F.2d 821,\n\n826 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing exhaustion in the context of\n\nERISA).   Appellants argue that it would have been futile in this\n\ncase for them to raise R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 before the Secretary\n\nor her designees because these individuals had \"no expertise in the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\finterpretation   of   Rhode   Island   law.\"     They   also    note,\n\nalternatively, that exhaustion is not mandated and that it is\n\nwithin the discretion of the court as to whether to apply the\n\ndoctrine (citing Acción Social de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Viera Pérez,\n\n831 F.2d 365, 369 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n          Appellants, however, are incorrect.     Our discussion of\n\nforfeiture has nothing to do with exhaustion. There is no question\n\nthat the appellants here did exhaust their administrative remedies.\n\nThey first brought their cases before the Assistant Secretary, then\n\nfaced an appeal before an ALJ, and finally appealed the dismissal\n\nof their actions before the ARB.   There is nothing more they can be\n\nexpected to do in the administrative setting.   Our concern is that\n\nthe appellants are raising this issue for the first time in this\n\nCourt.   If this petition is properly to be considered a review of\n\nthe ARB's action, the appellants are required to have raised their\n\narguments about R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 before the ARB, the ALJ, or\n\nthe Assistant Secretary.   See Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine\n\nFisheries v. Daley, 170 F.3d 23, 28 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Where\n\nagency action is taken upon an administrative record, it must . . .\n\nbe reviewed based on that record.\") (citation omitted).        Because\n\nappellants did not raise the issue earlier, their argument about a\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fC.   Intervention by the Secretary\n\n            Finally, Taylor and Migliore claim that the Secretary's\n\ndecision not to intervene in their cases violated the SWDA, because\n\nunder that statute the Secretary has no discretion whether to\n\nenforce if a violation is found.           Appellees, however, state that\n\nthis is a non-issue, arguing that the Secretary's decision on\n\nwhether to intervene is unreviewable by this Court under the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832\n\n(1985).    In that case, the Supreme Court held that an agency's\n\ndecision    not    to   take   requested    action   where    the   action   is\n\n\"committed    to    agency     discretion    by   law\"   is    presumptively\n\nunreviewable (quoting the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 701(a)(2)).      The Court stated that review is not to be had in\n\nsuch instances because \"a court would have no meaningful standard\n\nagainst which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.\"\n\nHeckler, 470 U.S. at 830.\n\n            The appellants, in response, argue that the Court in\n\nHeckler also stated that the presumption of unreviewability may be\n\nrebutted \"where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for\n\nthe agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.\" Id. at\n\n832-33.    In other words, where there is a sufficient or meaningful\n\nstandard provided in the governing statute, courts have something\n\n\"against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion,\" and\n\njudicial review is allowed.        Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fGroup, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 852 F.2d 9,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830).                  The\n\nappellants point to 42 U.S.C. § 6971(b) as providing a standard\n\nsufficient to guide judicial review in this case.\n\n          The   key    question,   then,   is   whether   a    \"meaningful\n\nstandard\" exists here against which we can judge the Secretary's\n\ndecision not to intervene in the appellants' cases.           Id.   We need\n\nnot resolve such a question, however, for even assuming that the\n\nappellants are correct and that 42 U.S.C. § 6971(b) provides such\n\na standard, we find, after undertaking the requisite judicial\n\nreview, that the Secretary's refusal to intervene in this instance\n\nwas proper.\n\n          As we have already mentioned, appellants argue that where\n\nviolations of the SWDA's employee protection provision have been\n\nfound, the Secretary is required to act.          In support of their\n\nargument, they cite to the text of 42 U.S.C. § 6971(b):\n\n          [Upon receipt of a complaint, the Secretary of\n          Labor shall cause such investigation to be\n          made as he deems appropriate.] . . . Upon\n          receiving the report of such investigation,\n          the Secretary of Labor shall make findings of\n          fact.   If he finds that such violation did\n          occur,    he   shall    issue   a    decision,\n          incorporating an order therein and his\n          findings, requiring the party committing such\n          violation to take such affirmative action to\n          abate the violation as the Secretary of Labor\n          deems appropriate . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 6971(b).    Appellants are arguing, in other words, that\n\nonce a violation is found, the Secretary has no discretion -- he\n\n                                   -21-\n\fhas mandatory duties that he must perform.                    To emphasize the\n\nmandatory nature of the Secretary's duties, appellants point to how\n\nin the section cited, Congress used the word \"shall\" to describe\n\nthe Secretary's obligations no less than seven times (with the\n\nappellants citing instances not quoted in the above paragraph).\n\nThey also note that \"the word 'shall' is ordinarily the 'language\n\nof   command'\"     (quoting    Alabama     v.   Bozeman,    533    U.S.    146,   153\n\n(2001)).\n\n             Appellants are correct that there is a procedure that the\n\nSecretary is required to follow in dealing with whistleblower\n\ncomplaints.       Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, pt. 24\n\nimplements the employee protection provision provided for in the\n\nSWDA,   42      U.S.C.   §   6971,   and    provides      procedures      for   Labor\n\nDepartment officials to follow when they receive a whistleblower\n\ncomplaint.       The regulations appoint the Assistant Secretary to act\n\nfor the Secretary and to undertake and complete an investigation\n\nwithin thirty days of the receipt of a complaint.                         29 C.F.R.\n\n24.4(d)(1). If the Assistant Secretary finds a violation, he is to\n\nissue a \"notice of determination\" that includes, among other\n\nthings,    an    order   requiring    the    party   at    fault   to     abate   the\n\nviolation. Any order, however, is only preliminary at the time the\n\nnotice of determination is released. According to the regulations,\n\nany party desiring review of the determination or any part thereof\n\nis required to file a request for a hearing with the Chief\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fAdministrative Law Judge within five business days.                 \"If a request\n\nfor a hearing is timely filed, the notice of determination of the\n\nAssistant    Secretary      shall    be   inoperative,       and    shall     become\n\noperative only if the case is later dismissed.\"                     See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 24.4(d)(1) & (2).             When the notice of determination becomes\n\ninoperative, so does any order contained within it.\n\n            In the instant case, the Assistant Secretary, as per the\n\nregulations, made his determinations that there had been violations\n\nof the SWDA with regard to Taylor and Migliore and included orders\n\nrequiring    RIDEM   to    abate    those     violations.         RIDEM,    however,\n\ndisagreed with the Assistant Secretary and therefore decided to\n\nappeal the determinations before an ALJ.               When RIDEM filed these\n\nappeals, the determinations of the Assistant Secretary (including\n\nthe orders accompanying them) automatically became inoperative.\n\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 24.4(d)(1) & (2).            Thus, the appellants are correct\n\n-- that if the Assistant Secretary finds that a violation [of the\n\nSWDA] did occur, he shall issue a decision \"incorporating [his]\n\nfindings    and   either    order    relief     or   dismiss      the    complaint.\"\n\nAppellant Br. 14 (citing to 42 U.S.C. § 6971(b)).                 We find that the\n\nAssistant Secretary performed his mandatory duty here.\n\n            However,      the    Assistant    Secretary     [or    his     boss,   the\n\nSecretary] was not required to do more than this.                        As we have\n\nstated, once the Assistant Secretary issues his determinations and\n\nany orders, his mandatory duties are at an end.                   It then becomes\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fthe responsibility of the parties, if they disagree with either\n\nthose determinations or the accompanying orders, to appeal to the\n\nChief Administrative Law Judge for a hearing.       If such a hearing\n\ntakes place, the Assistant Secretary is permitted to intervene \"at\n\n[his] discretion,\" but nothing requires him to do so.            See 29\n\nC.F.R.   24.6(f)(1).    We   find,   therefore,   that   the   Assistant\n\nSecretary was not required to intervene in the ALJ proceedings in\n\nthis case.\n\n           In the alternative, appellants concede that the Secretary\n\n[or through her, the Assistant Secretary] had broad discretion to\n\ndetermine whether or not to intervene. They contend, however, that\n\nwhen the Secretary exercised that discretion, she was required to\n\nprovide an explanation for her decision.      Here, appellants claim,\n\nsuch an explanation was absent.         We find, however, nothing in\n\neither the controlling statute or the regulations that requires the\n\nSecretary or the Assistant Secretary to explain his or her reasons,\n\nand we decline to read such a requirement into these authorities.9\n\n\n9\n   Appellants also argue that an explanation was required in light\nof the fact that the Secretary's failure to intervene was contrary\nto \"immediate past precedent\" -- namely, the Secretary's decision\nto intervene in Migliore I. That case, however, was already before\nthe ARB when the Secretary made her decision to intervene. Here,\nthe Secretary faced a decision as to whether intervene before the\nALJ.   Considerations that may have been relevant to an appeal\nbefore the ARB may not have been relevant before the ALJ, and vice\nversa.   For example, the Secretary may have had a sense that\nMigliore had a better chance of success before the ARB than before\nthe ALJ. Therefore, because the circumstances of the two cases are\nnot the same, Migliore I is not properly to be considered\n\"immediate past precedent,\" as appellants suggest.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fAlthough the Assistant Secretary must provide a \"statement of\n\nreasons\" when he issues his initial determination, he is not\n\nrequired to issue such a statement when he refuses to intervene\n\nbefore an ALJ.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we deny the petition for\n\nreview and affirm the decision of the Administrative Review Board\n\nof the Department of Labor.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f",

In 1988, Migliore, an employee of RIDEM, filed with the Assistant Secretary three complaints against RIDEM, alleging that the state agency had violated the whistle-blower provisions of the SWDA. In particular, Migliore claimed that RIDEM violated the SWDA by retaliating against her for reporting what she believed to be RIDEM's failure to implement properly the SWDA. After an investigation, however, the Assistant Secretary determined that the state agency had not violated the SWDA. Migliore objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and, as was her right, requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") at the Department of Labor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On August 13, 1999, following a lengthy hearing, the ALJ to whom the case had been assigned issued a recommended decision awarding Migliore both equitable relief and damages (<i>Migliore I</i>). RIDEM then appealed the ALJ's decision to the ARB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1999, Migliore filed another complaint with the Assistant Secretary (<i>Migliore II</i>) alleging that RIDEM had retaliated against her for pursuing her initial complaint. After investigating, the Assistant Secretary found that RIDEM had indeed violated the whistleblower provisions of the SWDA by, among other things, issuing a statement to the media that attacked Migliore's credibility personally and went \"beyond mere disagreement\" with the ALJ's findings in <i>Migliore I.</i> The order accompanying the Assistant Secretary's determination awarded Migliore $10,000 in damages. RIDEM objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and order in <i>Migliore II</i> and requested an ALJ hearing to appeal these matters. In its hearing request letter, RIDEM did not invoke a defense of sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also following the ALJ's decision in <i>Migliore I,</i> two of Migliore's co-workers, Taylor and Barbara Raddatz (\"Raddatz\"), filed whistleblower complaints with the Assistant Secretary alleging retaliation by RIDEM for their participation in <i>Migliore I.</i> After the Assistant Secretary quickly issued his determination that Raddatz's complaint lacked merit, Raddatz requested an ALJ hearing. During this period, the Assistant Secretary continued to investigate Taylor's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2000, while <i>Migliore I</i> was pending before the ARB and the <i>Migliore II</i> and Raddatz cases were pending before an ALJ, and while Taylor's complaint was being investigated by the Assistant Secretary, the State and RIDEM sought injunctive relief in federal district court. Alleging a violation of its sovereign immunity, the State sought to enjoin the Department of Labor from further investigation and adjudication of the complaints of Migliore, Raddatz, and Taylor. On September 29, 2000, the district court enjoined the Department of Labor's adjudication of the complaints but declined to enjoin the Assistant Secretary's investigation of Taylor's complaint. <i>See Rhode Island v. United States,</i> 115 F.Supp.2d 269, 279 (D.R.I.2000). Shortly after this decision was handed down, the Assistant Secretary, in November 2000, issued a determination in Taylor's favor finding that her allegations had merit. He also ordered RIDEM to pay to Taylor $7,170 to reimburse her for her legal fees. RIDEM objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and order and requested a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, along with Raddatz, then appealed the order of the district court. In 2002, this Court upheld the district court's order but modified it in one important respect. <i>See RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 53-54. We held that the Secretary of Labor was not prohibited \"from intervening in the enjoined proceedings and removing the sovereign immunity bar.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Distinguishing cases that are barred by sovereign immunity, i.e., those pursued by private parties in federal courts or administrative tribunals against states, from cases that are not barred, i.e., those brought against states by federal administrative agencies to enforce federal laws, we concluded that intervention by the Secretary in the enjoined cases would remove the sovereign immunity bar. <i>See id.</i> at 39, 53-54 (quoting from the district court's discussion of <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 8, 2003, the Assistant Secretary filed a motion to intervene in <i>Migliore I.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Rhode Island objected, contending that intervention would violate the district court's 2000 injunction, as modified by this Court's 2002 decision in <i>RIDEM.</i> Rhode Island therefore returned to district court seeking to enjoin the Assistant Secretary from intervening. On January 29, 2004, the district court granted Rhode Island's motion, ruling that the Assistant Secretary could not intervene in <i>Migliore I,</i> because Rhode Island's sovereign immunity is violated if intervention occurs at the time the case is before the ARB. Any intervention, stated the district court, had to occur \"at or before the ALJ stage.\" <i>See Rhode Island v. United States,</i> 301 F.Supp.2d 151, 156 (D.R.I.2004). Since the Assistant Secretary could not intervene, the sovereign immunity bar was upheld, and the ARB was compelled to dismiss the case on April 30, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2004, the Secretary of Labor advised the appellants that she would not intervene in their suits against the State and RIDEM (<i>Taylor</i> and <i>Migliore II</i>). As a result, the ALJ dismissed, on sovereign immunity grounds, Migliore's complaint on July 14, 2004, and Taylor's complaint on August 12, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because the Secretary had decided not to intervene, the sovereign immunity bar remained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants then appealed the ALJ's dismissal of their complaints to the ARB. In two separate proceedings, the ARB affirmed the ALJ's actions. Although the ARB provided a number of reasons for its decisions to affirm, there are two grounds in particular that appellants challenge here. First, appellants had argued, using the reasoning of <i>Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Georgia,</i> 535 U.S. 613, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002), that the State had waived its sovereign immunity merely by requesting a hearing before the ALJ to contest the Assistant Secretary's initial findings. The ARB, however, dismissed this argument for two reasons. It held that our analysis of <i>Lapides</i> in <i>RIDEM</i>&#8212;where we concluded that the State's pursuit of injunctive relief in the federal district court did not constitute a waiver of its sovereign immunity&#8212; was equally applicable to the State's requests for ALJ hearings in the <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Migliore II</i> cases. It also recognized that there is a distinction between the stage during which the Assistant Secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the ALJ adjudicates those complaints. The ARB held that sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage. The only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing. In making this request for a hearing, the party is merely clarifying its entitlement to sovereign immunity, not waiving it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in affirming the ALJ's dismissal of the <i>Taylor</i> case, the ARB, noting that the Secretary had decided not to intervene, agreed with the ALJ that \"neither the federal court decisions granting injunctive relief to Rhode Island nor other legal authorities\" compelled the Secretary to intervene to prosecute Taylor's complaint. <i>In re Joan Taylor,</i> ARB Case No. 04-166 (Nov. 29, 2004). The ARB also cited this Court's statement in <i>RIDEM</i> that the Secretary may intervene \"if she so chooses,\" 304 F.3d at 55, as well as the regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1), which states that the Secretary's designee may participate in the proceedings \"at [his] discretion.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the ARB's dismissals on these two grounds that the appellants challenge here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>RIDEM,</i> we held that \"the Secretary's final determinations under the whistleblower provisions [of the SWDA] are subject to review in the court of appeals in accordance with judicial review provisions of the APA [Administrative Procedure Act].\" <i>RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 38. Accordingly, the Secretary's decisions will be upheld unless they are \"unsupported by substantial evidence\" or are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 706(2)(A),(E). <i>See also Sasse v. Dep't of Labor,</i> 409 F.3d 773, 778 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Simon v. Simmons Foods,</i> 49 F.3d 386, 389-90 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sovereign immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' first claim is that despite the Secretary's refusal to intervene in their cases, the State has waived its sovereign immunity through other means. A state's sovereign immunity is \"a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure.\" <i>Clark v. Barnard,</i> 108 U.S. 436, 447, 2 S.Ct. 878, 27 L.Ed. 780 (1883). We have previously stated that \"[a] state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in three ways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the jurisdiction of a federal court or administrative proceeding; (2) by consent to or participation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\" <i>New Hampshire v. Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants here invoke two separate kinds of waiver. First, they claim that the State has waived its sovereign immunity through its litigation conduct&#8212; namely, by requesting hearings before an ALJ following the initial investigative findings by the Assistant Secretary. We note initially that we have confronted a similar argument in two of our recent cases. In both <i>RIDEM</i> and <i>Ramsey,</i> it was claimed that a state waived its sovereign immunity solely by seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative decision. In both cases, however, we rejected this argument, noting that the mere \"seeking of judicial review of an agency decision ... by a state that was a defendant before the agency\" was insufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity. <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20; <i>see also RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 49-50. The argument made here is slightly different, as it relates to the review of an administrative decision not before a federal Article III court, but rather before an federal administrative law judge. Nevertheless, we believe that the reasoning of our earlier opinions applies in this instance as well. <i>See also Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth.,</i> 535 U.S. 743, 760, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (finding that the sovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also applies in adjudications conducted by a federal administrative agency); <i>Butz v. Economou,</i> 438 U.S. 478, 513-14, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978) (noting the similarities between adjudication by an administrative law judge in a federal administrative agency and adjudication by judges in a court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find unconvincing an offshoot of this argument&#8212;namely, appellants' claim that the State has waived its immunity through its litigation conduct because it has selectively invoked its immunity to gain a litigation advantage. Appellants draw this idea from two cases in particular: <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey.</i> In <i>Lapides,</i> the Supreme Court confronted a case in which the plaintiff had brought suit against the state in state court on a claim in which the state had statutorily waived its immunity. The state, in response, removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss, asserting that it was immune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. The Court held that in removing the case, the state had \"voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court\" and therefore had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct. <i>Lapides,</i> 535 U.S. at 622, 122 S.Ct. 1640. This decision was based in part on the inequity of allowing the state to reverse its statutory waiver by a change in forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Ramsey</i> (in a part of the opinion different from that discussed above), we were similarly distressed by a state's exploitation of its sovereign immunity to obtain unfair litigation advantages. In that case, the State of New Hampshire made a \"voluntary and calculated\" choice to attempt to obtain the dismissal of a federal court action, wanting instead to litigate certain claims through a state administrative grievance procedure. Once the dismissal was granted, the state participated in the administrative grievance procedure, knowing that the procedure ultimately provided for federal judicial review. When the case did actually reach a federal court, the state tried to assert its sovereign immunity. We held, however, that because New Hampshire participated to its advantage in the grievance procedure to the detriment of its opponents, the state had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct. We said, in other words, that \"the state, having gained the advantage that it sought, is bound by the choice that it made.\" <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that this case is similar to <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey</i> and that the State here has waived its immunity because it too used its immunity to gain a litigation advantage. In particular, the appellants point to how the State requested hearings before the ALJ when it was not compelled to do so. It had other means of preserving its rights&#8212;namely, it could have simply waited for the determinations of the Assistant Secretary to become final and then defended in enforcement proceedings by asserting sovereign immunity at that point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a course of action would have come with a price. The State would have faced the daunting prospect of Secretarial involvement, and such involvement would have precluded the State from asserting its sovereign immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> ALJ hearings, by contrast, posed no such risk, according to the appellants, because in such a setting the State would be permitted to invoke sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In light of the litigation advantages that came with the State's conscious decision to preserve its rights through ALJ hearings, appellants argue that we should hold that the State waived its immunity through its litigation conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a choice, however, is different from the situation presented in <i>Lapides</i> or <i>Ramsey.</i> The State here never made a prior decision that affected its ability to invoke its immunity, as was the case in <i>Lapides</i> or <i>Ramsey.</i> To be sure, the choice faced by the State in this case related to immunity. But the State's decision to preserve its rights through an ALJ hearing (rather than through waiting for an enforcement action) was the first time it made any decision relating to that immunity. Indeed, it had to be. As the ARB correctly recognized, there is a clear distinction between the stage in which the Assistant Secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the ALJ adjudicates those complaints. Sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage. The only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing, as the State did here. Thus, this is not a situation, such as in <i>Lapides,</i> where the state has attempted \"to regain, by a change in forum, [a] litigation advantage that [it] . . . already renounced by a general statute.\" <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20 (discussing <i>Lapides</i>), or one such as in <i>Ramsey,</i> where New Hampshire tried to reverse the effects of a choice it had earlier made. In requesting ALJ hearings, the State here took advantage of its first opportunity to assert a sovereign immunity defense, a defense that was not available at the investigatory stage of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State here may have obtained a litigation advantage from its decision to pursue ALJ hearings. The <i>Lapides-Ramsey</i> line of cases, however, does not prevent a litigant from obtaining any sort of advantage relating to immunity in pursuing his case. They only condemn those litigation advantages that are \"inconsistent\" or \"unfair.\" <i>See Lapides,</i> 535 U.S. at 622, 122 S.Ct. 1640 (noting that the rules governing waiver by litigation conduct are motivated by \"problems of inconsistency and unfairness\"). Where the state tries to backtrack on immunity decisions it has already made, as was the case in both <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey,</i> such inconsistency and unfairness are evident. Nothing the State did in this case, however, can be deemed \"unfair\" or \"inconsistent.\" <i>See RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 49 (noting that the state has \"consistently asserted its sovereign immunity . . . in the administrative proceeding\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Therefore, we decline to find that the State waived its sovereign immunity as a result of its litigation conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the State has waived its sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1, which waives the State's immunity \"in all actions of tort in the same manner as a private individual or corporation.\" Appellants argue that their employment discrimination claims here are tort actions in order to show that the State has waived its sovereign immunity in this case. They also state that their claims closely resemble discrimination actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which have been recognized as one type of claim that is covered by R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1. <i>See Marrapese v. Rhode Island,</i> 500 F.Supp. 1207 (D.R.I.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the merits of these arguments, appellants' reliance on R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 is misplaced. Following this Court's decision in <i>RIDEM,</i> Taylor and Migliore never raised before either the ALJ or the ARB the applicability of the Rhode Island statute to their administrative cases. Nor is the argument referenced anywhere in the administrative record. Accordingly, appellants have forfeited the argument by failing to raise it during the administrative proceedings. <i>See Disabled Americans for Equal Access, Inc. v. Ferries del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 405 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that legal theories raised for the first time on appeal are waived); <i>Okmyansky v. Herbalife Int'l of Am., Inc.,</i> 415 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <i>RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 50 (noting that \"[c]laims of waiver of immunity are like any other legal argument and may themselves be waived or forfeited if not seasonably asserted.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their reply brief, appellants claim that these arguments relating to forfeiture invoke the doctrine of exhaustion&#8212;i.e., that a party must exhaust his administrative remedies before proceeding before a court. In their attempt to show the inapplicability of such a doctrine here, appellants point out that the exhaustion doctrine is subject to certain exceptions. For example, they note that a party is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies where it would be futile for it to do so. <i>See, e.g., Drinkwater v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> 846 F.2d 821, 826 (1st Cir.1988) (discussing exhaustion in the context of ERISA). Appellants argue that it would have been futile in this case for them to raise R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 before the Secretary or her designees because these individuals had \"no expertise in the interpretation of Rhode Island law.\" They also note, alternatively, that exhaustion is not mandated and that it is within the discretion of the court as to whether to apply the doctrine (citing <i>Acci&#243;n Social de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Viera P&#233;rez,</i> 831 F.2d 365, 369 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, however, are incorrect. Our discussion of forfeiture has nothing to do with exhaustion. There is no question that the appellants here did exhaust their administrative remedies. They first brought their cases before the Assistant Secretary, then faced an appeal before an ALJ, and finally appealed the dismissal of their actions before the ARB. There is nothing more they can be expected to do in the administrative setting. Our concern is that the appellants are raising this issue for the first time in this Court. If this petition is properly to be considered a review of the ARB's action, the appellants are required to have raised their arguments about R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 before the ARB, the ALJ, or the Assistant Secretary. <i>See Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> 170 F.3d 23, 28 n. 4 (1st Cir.1999) (\"Where agency action is taken upon an administrative record, it must . . . be reviewed based on that record.\") (citation omitted). Because appellants did not raise the issue earlier, their argument about a waiver of sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Intervention by the Secretary</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Taylor and Migliore claim that the Secretary's decision not to intervene in their cases violated the SWDA, because under that statute the Secretary has no discretion whether to enforce if a violation is found. Appellees, however, state that this is a non-issue, arguing that the Secretary's decision on whether to intervene is unreviewable by this Court under the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> 470 U.S. 821, 832, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an agency's decision not to take requested action where the action is \"committed to agency discretion by law\" is presumptively unreviewable (quoting the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2)). The Court stated that review is not to be had in such instances because \"a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.\" <i>Heckler,</i> 470 U.S. at 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, in response, argue that the Court in <i>Heckler</i> also stated that the presumption of unreviewability may be rebutted \"where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 832-33, 105 S.Ct. 1649. In other words, where there is a sufficient or meaningful standard provided in the governing statute, courts have something \"against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion,\" and judicial review is allowed. <i>Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research Group, Inc. v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n,</i> 852 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing <i>Heckler,</i> 470 U.S. at 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649). The appellants point to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b) as providing a standard sufficient to guide judicial review in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key question, then, is whether a \"meaningful standard\" exists here against which we can judge the Secretary's decision not to intervene in the appellants' cases. <i>Id.</i> We need not resolve such a question, however, for even assuming that the appellants are correct and that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b) provides such a standard, we find, after undertaking the requisite judicial review, that the Secretary's refusal to intervene in this instance was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already mentioned, appellants argue that where violations of the SWDA's employee protection provision have been found, the Secretary is required to act. In support of their argument, they cite to the text of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Upon receipt of a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate.]. . . Upon receiving the report of such investigation, the Secretary of Labor shall make findings of fact. If he finds that such violation did occur, he shall issue a decision, incorporating an order therein and his findings, requiring the party committing such violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary of Labor deems appropriate....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b). Appellants are arguing, in other words, that once a violation is found, the Secretary has no discretion&#8212;he has mandatory duties that he must perform. To emphasize the mandatory nature of the Secretary's duties, appellants point to how in the section cited, Congress used the word \"shall\" to describe the Secretary's obligations no less than seven times (with the appellants citing instances not quoted in the above paragraph). They also note that \"the word `shall' is ordinarily the `language of command'\" (quoting <i>Alabama v. Bozeman,</i> 533 U.S. 146, 153, 121 S.Ct. 2079, 150 L.Ed.2d 188 (2001)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are correct that there is a procedure that the Secretary is required to follow in dealing with whistleblower complaints. Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, pt. 24 implements the employee protection provision provided for in the SWDA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971, and provides procedures for Labor Department officials to follow when they receive a whistleblower complaint. The regulations appoint the Assistant Secretary to act for the Secretary and to undertake and complete an investigation within thirty days of the receipt of a complaint. 29 C.F.R. 24.4(d)(1). If the Assistant Secretary finds a violation, he is to issue a \"notice of determination\" that includes, among other things, an order requiring the party at fault to abate the violation. Any order, however, is only preliminary at the time the notice of determination is released. According to the regulations, any party desiring review of the determination or any part thereof is required to file a request for a hearing with the Chief Administrative Law Judge within five business days. \"If a request for a hearing is timely filed, the notice of determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be inoperative, and shall become operative only if the case is later dismissed.\" <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(1) &amp; (2). When the notice of determination becomes inoperative, so does any order contained within it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Assistant Secretary, as per the regulations, made his determinations that there had been violations of the SWDA with regard to Taylor and Migliore and included orders requiring RIDEM to abate those violations. RIDEM, however, disagreed with the Assistant Secretary and therefore decided to appeal the determinations before an ALJ. When RIDEM filed these appeals, the determinations of the Assistant Secretary (including the orders accompanying them) automatically became inoperative. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(1) &amp; (2). Thus, the appellants are correct&#8212;that if the Assistant Secretary finds that a violation [of the SWDA] did occur, he <i>shall</i> issue a decision \"incorporating [his] findings and either order relief or dismiss the complaint.\" Appellant Br. 14 (citing to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b)). We find that the Assistant Secretary performed his mandatory duty here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Assistant Secretary [or his boss, the Secretary] was not required to do more than this. As we have stated, once the Assistant Secretary issues his determinations and any orders, his mandatory duties are at an end. It then becomes the responsibility of the parties, if they disagree with either those determinations or the accompanying orders, to appeal to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for a hearing. If such a hearing takes place, the Assistant Secretary is permitted to intervene \"at [his] discretion,\" but nothing requires him to do so. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. 24.6(f)(1). We find, therefore, that the Assistant Secretary was not required to intervene in the ALJ proceedings in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, appellants concede that the Secretary [or through her, the Assistant Secretary] had broad discretion to determine whether or not to intervene. They contend, however, that when the Secretary exercised that discretion, she was required to provide an explanation for her decision. Here, appellants claim, such an explanation was absent. We find, however, nothing in either the controlling statute or the regulations that requires the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary to explain his or her reasons, and we decline to read such a requirement into these authorities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Although the Assistant Secretary must provide a \"statement of reasons\" when he issues his initial determination, he is not required to issue such a statement when he refuses to intervene before an ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

As a result, the ALJ subsequently dismissed her complaint. Raddatz then appealed the ALJ's dismissal to the ARB. After the ARB affirmed the ALJ's dismissal, Raddatz, unlike the appellants here, declined to contest the ARB's decision before this Court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Here, appellants are relying on a provision in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(2), which states: \"If a request for [an ALJ] hearing is not timely filed, the notice of determination shall become the final order of the Secretary.\" Although we did not squarely address it, the appellees in<i>Ramsey</i> made an identical argument. <i>See Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> If Taylor and/or Migliore had brought suit personally against the State in federal court to enforce the determinations of the Assistant Secretary, the State would have been able to invoke sovereign immunity<i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(A) (noting that citizen civil suits under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972 may enforce the SWDA's substantive provisions only to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution). If, however, the Secretary was the one to bring the enforcement action, the State would potentially face liability, as the Secretary is allowed to bring an action against a state to enforce a federal law without worrying about the sovereign immunity bar. <i>See United States v. Texas,</i> 143 U.S. 621, 644-45, 12 S.Ct. 488, 36 L.Ed. 285 (1892).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> There are two problems with this argument. First, appellants argue that the State could invoke its sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure\" before an ALJ because \"the posture of the cases would become individuals versus the State.\" Appellants Reply Br. 5. We are not certain that this proposition is true. At the time that the State was deciding whether to request ALJ hearings in this case, in 1999 and 2000, the question of whether a state could claim sovereign immunity in an administrative proceeding remained an open one. This question was only resolved in 2002 with the Supreme Court's decision in<i>Federal Maritime Comm'n,</i> which held that the sovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also applies in adjudications conducted by a federal administrative agency. 535 U.S. at 760, 122 S.Ct. 1864. Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, we assume here that the appellants are correct and that the State could invoke its sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure\" in an ALJ hearing. Second, appellants are simply assuming that the Secretary would not intervene in an ALJ hearing. However, according to the regulations in effect in 1999 and 2000, the Assistant Secretary had the right to intervene. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1) (1999) and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1) (2000). Since at that time the parties did not have the benefit of our 2002 decision in <i>RIDEM</i> saying that such intervention by the Assistant Secretary would remove the sovereign immunity bar, the effect of Secretarial intervention was perhaps not clear. Therefore, we decline to base our holding on such an argument and simply assume that the appellants are correct.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> <i>See also Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 21 (noting, in its discussion of waiver of immunity from damages [as opposed to its discussion of waiver of immunity from prospective equitable relief], that New Hampshire gained no unfair litigation advantage as to damages by seeking judicial review of the grievance procedure because it \"consistently asserted its immunity from damages when at issue.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Appellants also argue that an explanation was required in light of the fact that the Secretary's failure to intervene was contrary to \"immediate past precedent\"&#8212;namely, the Secretary's decision to intervene in<i>Migliore I.</i> That case, however, was already before the ARB when the Secretary made her decision to intervene. Here, the Secretary faced a decision as to whether intervene before the ALJ. Considerations that may have been relevant to an appeal before the ARB may not have been relevant before the ALJ, and vice versa. For example, the Secretary may have had a sense that Migliore had a better chance of success before the ARB than before the ALJ. Therefore, because the circumstances of the two cases are not the same, <i>Migliore I</i> is not properly to be considered \"immediate past precedent,\" as appellants suggest.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We last encountered this case in 2002, when appellants sought review of a district court order that prevented the United States Department of Labor (\"Department of Labor\") from adjudicating their complaints that they had been fired in retaliation for reporting potential violations of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"SWDA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6901-6992k. <i>See Rhode Island Dep't of Envtl.

Following our decision, the Assistant Secretary attempted to intervene in one suit brought by Migliore but declined to intervene in other suits by the appellants against the State and RIDEM. In this petition, appellants contest this decision not to intervene and argue that regardless of the Assistant Secretary's inaction, they should be allowed to pursue their suits because the State has waived its sovereign immunity through other means. We disagree, and after careful consideration, we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the Administrative Review Board (\"ARB\") of the Department of Labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has a complicated history. In 1988, Migliore, an employee of RIDEM, filed with the Assistant Secretary three complaints against RIDEM, alleging that the state agency had violated the whistle-blower provisions of the SWDA. In particular, Migliore claimed that RIDEM violated the SWDA by retaliating against her for reporting what she believed to be RIDEM's failure to implement properly the SWDA. After an investigation, however, the Assistant Secretary determined that the state agency had not violated the SWDA. Migliore objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and, as was her right, requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") at the Department of Labor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On August 13, 1999, following a lengthy hearing, the ALJ to whom the case had been assigned issued a recommended decision awarding Migliore both equitable relief and damages (<i>Migliore I</i>). RIDEM then appealed the ALJ's decision to the ARB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1999, Migliore filed another complaint with the Assistant Secretary (<i>Migliore II</i>) alleging that RIDEM had retaliated against her for pursuing her initial complaint. After investigating, the Assistant Secretary found that RIDEM had indeed violated the whistleblower provisions of the SWDA by, among other things, issuing a statement to the media that attacked Migliore's credibility personally and went \"beyond mere disagreement\" with the ALJ's findings in <i>Migliore I.</i> The order accompanying the Assistant Secretary's determination awarded Migliore $10,000 in damages. RIDEM objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and order in <i>Migliore II</i> and requested an ALJ hearing to appeal these matters. In its hearing request letter, RIDEM did not invoke a defense of sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also following the ALJ's decision in <i>Migliore I,</i> two of Migliore's co-workers, Taylor and Barbara Raddatz (\"Raddatz\"), filed whistleblower complaints with the Assistant Secretary alleging retaliation by RIDEM for their participation in <i>Migliore I.</i> After the Assistant Secretary quickly issued his determination that Raddatz's complaint lacked merit, Raddatz requested an ALJ hearing. During this period, the Assistant Secretary continued to investigate Taylor's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2000, while <i>Migliore I</i> was pending before the ARB and the <i>Migliore II</i> and Raddatz cases were pending before an ALJ, and while Taylor's complaint was being investigated by the Assistant Secretary, the State and RIDEM sought injunctive relief in federal district court. Alleging a violation of its sovereign immunity, the State sought to enjoin the Department of Labor from further investigation and adjudication of the complaints of Migliore, Raddatz, and Taylor. On September 29, 2000, the district court enjoined the Department of Labor's adjudication of the complaints but declined to enjoin the Assistant Secretary's investigation of Taylor's complaint. <i>See Rhode Island v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580277\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580277/rhode-island-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 279 (D.R.I.2000). Shortly after this decision was handed down, the Assistant Secretary, in November 2000, issued a determination in Taylor's favor finding that her allegations had merit. He also ordered RIDEM to pay to Taylor $7,170 to reimburse her for her legal fees. RIDEM objected to the Assistant Secretary's findings and order and requested a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, along with Raddatz, then appealed the order of the district court. In 2002, this Court upheld the district court's order but modified it in one important respect. <i>See RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 53-54. We held that the Secretary of Labor was not prohibited \"from intervening in the enjoined proceedings and removing the sovereign immunity bar.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Distinguishing cases that are barred by sovereign immunity, i.e., those pursued by private parties in federal courts or administrative tribunals against states, from cases that are not barred, i.e., those brought against states by federal administrative agencies to enforce federal laws, we concluded that intervention by the Secretary in the enjoined cases would remove the sovereign immunity bar. <i>See id.</i> at 39, 53-54 (quoting from the district court's discussion of <i>Alden v.

On January 29, 2004, the district court granted Rhode Island's motion, ruling that the Assistant Secretary could not intervene in <i>Migliore I,</i> because Rhode Island's sovereign immunity is violated if intervention occurs at the time the case is before the ARB. Any intervention, stated the district court, had to occur \"at or before the ALJ stage.\" <i>See Rhode Island v.

Since the Assistant Secretary could not intervene, the sovereign immunity bar was upheld, and the ARB was compelled to dismiss the case on April 30, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 2004, the Secretary of Labor advised the appellants that she would not intervene in their suits against the State and RIDEM (<i>Taylor</i> and <i>Migliore II</i>). As a result, the ALJ dismissed, on sovereign immunity grounds, Migliore's complaint on July 14, 2004, and Taylor's complaint on August 12, 2004.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because the Secretary had decided not to intervene, the sovereign immunity bar remained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants then appealed the ALJ's dismissal of their complaints to the ARB. In two separate proceedings, the ARB affirmed the ALJ's actions. Although the ARB provided a number of reasons for its decisions to affirm, there are two grounds in particular that appellants challenge here. First, appellants had argued, using the reasoning of <i>Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span> (2002), that the State had waived its sovereign immunity merely by requesting a hearing before the ALJ to contest the Assistant Secretary's initial findings. The ARB, however, dismissed this argument for two reasons. It held that our analysis of <i>Lapides</i> in <i>RIDEM</i>&#8212;where we concluded that the State's pursuit of injunctive relief in the federal district court did not constitute a waiver of its sovereign immunity&#8212; was equally applicable to the State's requests for ALJ hearings in the <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Migliore II</i> cases. It also recognized that there is a distinction between the stage during which the Assistant Secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the ALJ adjudicates those complaints. The ARB held that sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage. The only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing. In making this request for a hearing, the party is merely clarifying its entitlement to sovereign immunity, not waiving it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in affirming the ALJ's dismissal of the <i>Taylor</i> case, the ARB, noting that the Secretary had decided not to intervene, agreed with the ALJ that \"neither the federal court decisions granting injunctive relief to Rhode Island nor other legal authorities\" compelled the Secretary to intervene to prosecute Taylor's complaint. <i>In re Joan Taylor,</i> ARB Case No. 04-166 (Nov. 29, 2004). The ARB also cited this Court's statement in <i>RIDEM</i> that the Secretary may intervene \"if she so chooses,\" 304 F.3d at 55, as well as the regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1), which states that the Secretary's designee may participate in the proceedings \"at [his] discretion.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the ARB's dismissals on these two grounds that the appellants challenge here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

A state's sovereign immunity is \"a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure.\" <i>Clark v. Barnard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90876\"><a href=\"/opinion/90876/clark-v-barnard/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 447, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></span> (1883). We have previously stated that \"[a] state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in three ways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to the jurisdiction of a federal court or administrative proceeding; (2) by consent to or participation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\" <i>New Hampshire v.

First, they claim that the State has waived its sovereign immunity through its litigation conduct&#8212; namely, by requesting hearings before an ALJ following the initial investigative findings by the Assistant Secretary. We note initially that we have confronted a similar argument in two of our recent cases. In both <i>RIDEM</i> and <i>Ramsey,</i> it was claimed that a state waived its sovereign immunity solely by seeking judicial review of an adverse administrative decision. In both cases, however, we rejected this argument, noting that the mere \"seeking of judicial review of an agency decision ... by a state that was a defendant before the agency\" was insufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity. <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20; <i>see also RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 49-50. The argument made here is slightly different, as it relates to the review of an administrative decision not before a federal Article III court, but rather before an federal administrative law judge. Nevertheless, we believe that the reasoning of our earlier opinions applies in this instance as well. <i>See also Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118511\"><a href=\"/opinion/118511/federal-maritime-commn-v-south-carolina-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span>, 760, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118511\"><a href=\"/opinion/118511/federal-maritime-commn-v-south-carolina-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Appellants draw this idea from two cases in particular: <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey.</i> In <i>Lapides,</i> the Supreme Court confronted a case in which the plaintiff had brought suit against the state in state court on a claim in which the state had statutorily waived its immunity. The state, in response, removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss, asserting that it was immune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment. The Court held that in removing the case, the state had \"voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court\" and therefore had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct. <i>Lapides,</i> 535 U.S. at 622, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1640</span></a></span>. This decision was based in part on the inequity of allowing the state to reverse its statutory waiver by a change in forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Ramsey</i> (in a part of the opinion different from that discussed above), we were similarly distressed by a state's exploitation of its sovereign immunity to obtain unfair litigation advantages. In that case, the State of New Hampshire made a \"voluntary and calculated\" choice to attempt to obtain the dismissal of a federal court action, wanting instead to litigate certain claims through a state administrative grievance procedure. Once the dismissal was granted, the state participated in the administrative grievance procedure, knowing that the procedure ultimately provided for federal judicial review. When the case did actually reach a federal court, the state tried to assert its sovereign immunity. We held, however, that because New Hampshire participated to its advantage in the grievance procedure to the detriment of its opponents, the state had waived its immunity by its litigation conduct. We said, in other words, that \"the state, having gained the advantage that it sought, is bound by the choice that it made.\" <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that this case is similar to <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey</i> and that the State here has waived its immunity because it too used its immunity to gain a litigation advantage. In particular, the appellants point to how the State requested hearings before the ALJ when it was not compelled to do so. It had other means of preserving its rights&#8212;namely, it could have simply waited for the determinations of the Assistant Secretary to become final and then defended in enforcement proceedings by asserting sovereign immunity at that point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a course of action would have come with a price. The State would have faced the daunting prospect of Secretarial involvement, and such involvement would have precluded the State from asserting its sovereign immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> ALJ hearings, by contrast, posed no such risk, according to the appellants, because in such a setting the State would be permitted to invoke sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In light of the litigation advantages that came with the State's conscious decision to preserve its rights through ALJ hearings, appellants argue that we should hold that the State waived its immunity through its litigation conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a choice, however, is different from the situation presented in <i>Lapides</i> or <i>Ramsey.</i> The State here never made a prior decision that affected its ability to invoke its immunity, as was the case in <i>Lapides</i> or <i>Ramsey.</i> To be sure, the choice faced by the State in this case related to immunity. But the State's decision to preserve its rights through an ALJ hearing (rather than through waiting for an enforcement action) was the first time it made any decision relating to that immunity. Indeed, it had to be. As the ARB correctly recognized, there is a clear distinction between the stage in which the Assistant Secretary investigates complaints and the stage in which the ALJ adjudicates those complaints. Sovereign immunity can be raised as a defense only once the case moves from the investigatory to the adjudicatory stage. The only mechanism for moving the complaint to the adjudicatory stage where the sovereign immunity defense can be raised in the first instance is for one of the parties to request a hearing, as the State did here. Thus, this is not a situation, such as in <i>Lapides,</i> where the state has attempted \"to regain, by a change in forum, [a] litigation advantage that [it] . . . already renounced by a general statute.\" <i>Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20 (discussing <i>Lapides</i>), or one such as in <i>Ramsey,</i> where New Hampshire tried to reverse the effects of a choice it had earlier made. In requesting ALJ hearings, the State here took advantage of its first opportunity to assert a sovereign immunity defense, a defense that was not available at the investigatory stage of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State here may have obtained a litigation advantage from its decision to pursue ALJ hearings. The <i>Lapides-Ramsey</i> line of cases, however, does not prevent a litigant from obtaining any sort of advantage relating to immunity in pursuing his case. They only condemn those litigation advantages that are \"inconsistent\" or \"unfair.\" <i>See Lapides,</i> 535 U.S. at 622, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1640</span></a></span> (noting that the rules governing waiver by litigation conduct are motivated by \"problems of inconsistency and unfairness\"). Where the state tries to backtrack on immunity decisions it has already made, as was the case in both <i>Lapides</i> and <i>Ramsey,</i> such inconsistency and unfairness are evident. Nothing the State did in this case, however, can be deemed \"unfair\" or \"inconsistent.\" <i>See RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 49 (noting that the state has \"consistently asserted its sovereign immunity . . . in the administrative proceeding\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Therefore, we decline to find that the State waived its sovereign immunity as a result of its litigation conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the State has waived its sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1, which waives the State's immunity \"in all actions of tort in the same manner as a private individual or corporation.\" Appellants argue that their employment discrimination claims here are tort actions in order to show that the State has waived its sovereign immunity in this case. They also state that their claims closely resemble discrimination actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which have been recognized as one type of claim that is covered by R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1. <i>See Marrapese v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1409039\"><a href=\"/opinion/1409039/marrapese-v-state-of-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 is misplaced. Following this Court's decision in <i>RIDEM,</i> Taylor and Migliore never raised before either the ALJ or the ARB the applicability of the Rhode Island statute to their administrative cases. Nor is the argument referenced anywhere in the administrative record. Accordingly, appellants have forfeited the argument by failing to raise it during the administrative proceedings. <i>See Disabled Americans for Equal Access, Inc. v. Ferries del Caribe, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201557\"><a href=\"/opinion/201557/disabled-americans-v-ferries-del-caribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that legal theories raised for the first time on appeal are waived); <i>Okmyansky v.

In their attempt to show the inapplicability of such a doctrine here, appellants point out that the exhaustion doctrine is subject to certain exceptions. For example, they note that a party is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies where it would be futile for it to do so. <i>See, e.g., Drinkwater v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506053\"><a href=\"/opinion/506053/richard-drinkwater-v-metropolitan-life-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 826 (1st Cir.1988) (discussing exhaustion in the context of ERISA). Appellants argue that it would have been futile in this case for them to raise R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 before the Secretary or her designees because these individuals had \"no expertise in the interpretation of Rhode Island law.\" They also note, alternatively, that exhaustion is not mandated and that it is within the discretion of the court as to whether to apply the doctrine (citing <i>Acci&#243;n Social de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Viera P&#233;rez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496184\"><a href=\"/opinion/496184/accion-social-de-puerto-rico-inc-v-norberto-viera-perez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 369 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, however, are incorrect. Our discussion of forfeiture has nothing to do with exhaustion. There is no question that the appellants here did exhaust their administrative remedies. They first brought their cases before the Assistant Secretary, then faced an appeal before an ALJ, and finally appealed the dismissal of their actions before the ARB. There is nothing more they can be expected to do in the administrative setting. Our concern is that the appellants are raising this issue for the first time in this Court. If this petition is properly to be considered a review of the ARB's action, the appellants are required to have raised their arguments about R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 before the ARB, the ALJ, or the Assistant Secretary. <i>See Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198334\"><a href=\"/opinion/198334/commonwealth-v-daley-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 28 n. 4 (1st Cir.1999) (\"Where agency action is taken upon an administrative record, it must . . . be reviewed based on that record.\") (citation omitted). Because appellants did not raise the issue earlier, their argument about a waiver of sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-31-1 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Intervention by the Secretary</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Taylor and Migliore claim that the Secretary's decision not to intervene in their cases violated the SWDA, because under that statute the Secretary has no discretion whether to enforce if a violation is found. Appellees, however, state that this is a non-issue, arguing that the Secretary's decision on whether to intervene is unreviewable by this Court under the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Heckler v. Chaney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 832, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span> (1985). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an agency's decision not to take requested action where the action is \"committed to agency discretion by law\" is presumptively unreviewable (quoting the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2)). The Court stated that review is not to be had in such instances because \"a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.\" <i>Heckler,</i> 470 U.S. at 830, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1649</span></a></span>. In other words, where there is a sufficient or meaningful standard provided in the governing statute, courts have something \"against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion,\" and judicial review is allowed. <i>Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research Group, Inc. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1649</span></a></span>). The appellants point to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b) as providing a standard sufficient to guide judicial review in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key question, then, is whether a \"meaningful standard\" exists here against which we can judge the Secretary's decision not to intervene in the appellants' cases. <i>Id.</i> We need not resolve such a question, however, for even assuming that the appellants are correct and that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b) provides such a standard, we find, after undertaking the requisite judicial review, that the Secretary's refusal to intervene in this instance was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already mentioned, appellants argue that where violations of the SWDA's employee protection provision have been found, the Secretary is required to act. In support of their argument, they cite to the text of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Upon receipt of a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate.]. . . Upon receiving the report of such investigation, the Secretary of Labor shall make findings of fact. If he finds that such violation did occur, he shall issue a decision, incorporating an order therein and his findings, requiring the party committing such violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary of Labor deems appropriate....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b). Appellants are arguing, in other words, that once a violation is found, the Secretary has no discretion&#8212;he has mandatory duties that he must perform. To emphasize the mandatory nature of the Secretary's duties, appellants point to how in the section cited, Congress used the word \"shall\" to describe the Secretary's obligations no less than seven times (with the appellants citing instances not quoted in the above paragraph). They also note that \"the word `shall' is ordinarily the `language of command'\" (quoting <i>Alabama v. Bozeman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, 153, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, pt. 24 implements the employee protection provision provided for in the SWDA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971, and provides procedures for Labor Department officials to follow when they receive a whistleblower complaint. The regulations appoint the Assistant Secretary to act for the Secretary and to undertake and complete an investigation within thirty days of the receipt of a complaint. 29 C.F.R. 24.4(d)(1). If the Assistant Secretary finds a violation, he is to issue a \"notice of determination\" that includes, among other things, an order requiring the party at fault to abate the violation. Any order, however, is only preliminary at the time the notice of determination is released. According to the regulations, any party desiring review of the determination or any part thereof is required to file a request for a hearing with the Chief Administrative Law Judge within five business days. \"If a request for a hearing is timely filed, the notice of determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be inoperative, and shall become operative only if the case is later dismissed.\" <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(1) &amp; (2). When the notice of determination becomes inoperative, so does any order contained within it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Assistant Secretary, as per the regulations, made his determinations that there had been violations of the SWDA with regard to Taylor and Migliore and included orders requiring RIDEM to abate those violations. RIDEM, however, disagreed with the Assistant Secretary and therefore decided to appeal the determinations before an ALJ. When RIDEM filed these appeals, the determinations of the Assistant Secretary (including the orders accompanying them) automatically became inoperative. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(1) &amp; (2). Thus, the appellants are correct&#8212;that if the Assistant Secretary finds that a violation [of the SWDA] did occur, he <i>shall</i> issue a decision \"incorporating [his] findings and either order relief or dismiss the complaint.\" Appellant Br. 14 (citing to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6971(b)). We find that the Assistant Secretary performed his mandatory duty here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Assistant Secretary [or his boss, the Secretary] was not required to do more than this. As we have stated, once the Assistant Secretary issues his determinations and any orders, his mandatory duties are at an end. It then becomes the responsibility of the parties, if they disagree with either those determinations or the accompanying orders, to appeal to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for a hearing. If such a hearing takes place, the Assistant Secretary is permitted to intervene \"at [his] discretion,\" but nothing requires him to do so. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. 24.6(f)(1). We find, therefore, that the Assistant Secretary was not required to intervene in the ALJ proceedings in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, appellants concede that the Secretary [or through her, the Assistant Secretary] had broad discretion to determine whether or not to intervene. They contend, however, that when the Secretary exercised that discretion, she was required to provide an explanation for her decision. Here, appellants claim, such an explanation was absent. We find, however, nothing in either the controlling statute or the regulations that requires the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary to explain his or her reasons, and we decline to read such a requirement into these authorities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Although the Assistant Secretary must provide a \"statement of reasons\" when he issues his initial determination, he is not required to issue such a statement when he refuses to intervene before an ALJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the Administrative Review Board of the Department of Labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For a full discussion of the administrative scheme established by the SWDA, see<i>RIDEM,</i> 304 F.3d at 37-38.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This Court's reference to \"the Secretary of Labor\" includes not only the Secretary of Labor herself, but also those working under her, such as the Assistant Secretary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Recall that this case was already before the ARB at this point</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Secretary of Labor also advised Raddatz at this time that she would not intervene in her suit against the State and RIDEM. As a result, the ALJ subsequently dismissed her complaint. Raddatz then appealed the ALJ's dismissal to the ARB. After the ARB affirmed the ALJ's dismissal, Raddatz, unlike the appellants here, declined to contest the ARB's decision before this Court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Here, appellants are relying on a provision in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.4(d)(2), which states: \"If a request for [an ALJ] hearing is not timely filed, the notice of determination shall become the final order of the Secretary.\" Although we did not squarely address it, the appellees in<i>Ramsey</i> made an identical argument. <i>See Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 20.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> If Taylor and/or Migliore had brought suit personally against the State in federal court to enforce the determinations of the Assistant Secretary, the State would have been able to invoke sovereign immunity<i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(A) (noting that citizen civil suits under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972 may enforce the SWDA's substantive provisions only to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution). If, however, the Secretary was the one to bring the enforcement action, the State would potentially face liability, as the Secretary is allowed to bring an action against a state to enforce a federal law without worrying about the sovereign immunity bar. <i>See United States v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93289\"><a href=\"/opinion/93289/united-states-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 644-45, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, appellants argue that the State could invoke its sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure\" before an ALJ because \"the posture of the cases would become individuals versus the State.\" Appellants Reply Br. 5. We are not certain that this proposition is true. At the time that the State was deciding whether to request ALJ hearings in this case, in 1999 and 2000, the question of whether a state could claim sovereign immunity in an administrative proceeding remained an open one. This question was only resolved in 2002 with the Supreme Court's decision in<i>Federal Maritime Comm'n,</i> which held that the sovereign immunity enjoyed by states in federal courts also applies in adjudications conducted by a federal administrative agency. 535 U.S. at 760, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118511\"><a href=\"/opinion/118511/federal-maritime-commn-v-south-carolina-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1864</span></a></span>. Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, we assume here that the appellants are correct and that the State could invoke its sovereign immunity \"at its pleasure\" in an ALJ hearing. Second, appellants are simply assuming that the Secretary would not intervene in an ALJ hearing. However, according to the regulations in effect in 1999 and 2000, the Assistant Secretary had the right to intervene. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1) (1999) and 29 C.F.R. &#167; 24.6(f)(1) (2000). Since at that time the parties did not have the benefit of our 2002 decision in <i>RIDEM</i> saying that such intervention by the Assistant Secretary would remove the sovereign immunity bar, the effect of Secretarial intervention was perhaps not clear. Therefore, we decline to base our holding on such an argument and simply assume that the appellants are correct.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> <i>See also Ramsey,</i> 366 F.3d at 21 (noting, in its discussion of waiver of immunity from damages [as opposed to its discussion of waiver of immunity from prospective equitable relief], that New Hampshire gained no unfair litigation advantage as to damages by seeking judicial review of the grievance procedure because it \"consistently asserted its immunity from damages when at issue.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Appellants also argue that an explanation was required in light of the fact that the Secretary's failure to intervene was contrary to \"immediate past precedent\"&#8212;namely, the Secretary's decision to intervene in<i>Migliore I.</i> That case, however, was already before the ARB when the Secretary made her decision to intervene. Here, the Secretary faced a decision as to whether intervene before the ALJ. Considerations that may have been relevant to an appeal before the ARB may not have been relevant before the ALJ, and vice versa. For example, the Secretary may have had a sense that Migliore had a better chance of success before the ARB than before the ALJ. Therefore, because the circumstances of the two cases are not the same, <i>Migliore I</i> is not properly to be considered \"immediate past precedent,\" as appellants suggest.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
