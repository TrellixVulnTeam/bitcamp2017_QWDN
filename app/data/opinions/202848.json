Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, Mariana D. Negrón-\nVargas, Deputy Solicitor General and Maite D. Oronoz-Rodríguez,\nDeputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellee López Bonilla\nin his personal capacity.\n\n\n                          July 18, 2007\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           This is an appeal of an award of\n\nsummary judgment to the mayor of Rincón, Puerto Rico (in his\n\nindividual and official capacities), his wife, their conjugal\n\npartnership, and the municipality itself, on claims that they\n\nengaged     in     unlawful      political     discrimination            against     two\n\ndevelopers, their development company, and related persons and\n\nentities.     The principal defendant, the mayor, is Carlos López-\n\nBonilla;    the    principal      plaintiffs,       a   father-son        real   estate\n\ndevelopment       team,    are   Benjamín     Carrero-Nazario            and   Benjamín\n\nCarrero-Martínez.         The mayor is a member of Puerto Rico's Popular\n\nDemocratic       Party.       The     developers        describe     themselves       as\n\n\"activists\" in Puerto Rico's New Progressive Party and are related\n\nby marriage to the former mayor of Rincón, whom López-Bonilla\n\ndefeated in the November 2000 election.\n\n            In    1997,    Carrero-Nazario         approached      the    Puerto   Rico\n\nIndustrial       Development     Company     and    expressed      an     interest    in\n\npurchasing a parcel of land in Rincón owned by the Company.                          He\n\nwanted to develop a shopping center with a large grocery store.\n\nNegotiations ensued and, in June 1999, the parties reached a\n\npreliminary agreement.              In November 2000, just following the\n\nmayoral election, the Puerto Rico Planning Board approved the\n\nproject and zoned the property for commercial use.\n\n            Shortly after taking office in early 2001, the mayor\n\nbegan a campaign to halt the project.                   Over the next two years,\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fprior to the formalization of the sale (which occurred on May 9,\n\n2003), the mayor repeatedly wrote the Development Company, the\n\nPlanning Board and others, expressing strong disagreement with the\n\nCompany's decision to permit the property to be used for the\n\ndevelopment of commercial, rather than industrial, infrastructure.\n\nHe also repeatedly suggested that the project only had been made\n\npossible because of nepotism -- i.e., that it would not have gotten\n\noff the ground without the helpful intercessions of the former\n\nmayor, who is the father-in-law of Carrero-Martínez.    When he was\n\nunable to derail the project, the mayor began to express interest\n\nin purchasing the property on behalf of the municipality.       The\n\nDevelopment Company rebuffed these efforts, explaining that the\n\nprocess was too far along with the developers.      Undeterred, the\n\nmayor initiated eminent domain proceedings and obtained unanimous\n\nresolutions from the appropriate legislative bodies in support of\n\nthe proposed taking and then funding for the compensation to be\n\nmade to the developers.    So far as we can tell, the eminent domain\n\nproceedings are ongoing.\n\n          In June 2004, the developers initiated this lawsuit under\n\nfederal and Puerto Rico law.     Their primary allegation, that the\n\nmayor's crusade was materially motivated by unlawful political\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\n\nsurvived dismissal but prompted a motion for summary judgment from\n\nthe mayor on a number of grounds.       The developers received an\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fextension of time to oppose the motion and then, on the day their\n\nopposition was due, filed a second motion for a one-day extension\n\nbecause they were experiencing \"technical difficulties\" in their\n\nattorneys' office.      Late in the day, the district court denied the\n\nmotion by margin order.         The developers were able to file their\n\nopposition and     statement of contested facts on time, but not the\n\nexhibits in support of their opposition.               The following day, the\n\ndevelopers filed a motion asking the court to accept their exhibits\n\n(which were attached to the motion), explaining that the technical\n\ndifficulties      experienced    the    prior    day     \"related   to   [their\n\nattorneys'] office scanner.\" The court denied the motion, again by\n\nmargin order.\n\n           Subsequently, the district court granted the mayor's\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the political discrimination claim\n\nand declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Puerto\n\nRico claims.    In its opinion and order, the court stated that \"the\n\nuncontested facts permit no inference that the defendants' conduct\n\nwas   motivated    by   discriminatory       animus.\"      In   reaching   this\n\nconclusion, the court explained that, because the developers had\n\nnot filed any exhibits in support of their opposition to the\n\nsummary judgment motion, it would apply Local Rule Civ. P. 56 and\n\ncredit \"all the defendants' proposed uncontested facts supported by\n\nexhibits which would be admissible at trial.\"             Crucially, however,\n\nthe court also stated that its conclusion as to animus would be\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\funaffected even if it were to take the developers' opposition\n\nmaterials into account.\n\n            The developers' appeal starts with an argument that the\n\ndistrict court's strict enforcement of the filing deadline was\n\nunfair and an abuse of the court's discretion.               We will go so far\n\nas to say that it would have been preferable had the court\n\nexplained    its    harsh   enforcement       decision.      Nevertheless,     the\n\njudgment should stand, even if we assume an abuse of discretion and\n\ncredit the evidence the developers attempted to submit, and even if\n\nwe by-pass a number of alternative grounds for affirmance involving\n\nimmunity defenses, intervening causes, and the viability of the\n\ndevelopers' case theory.\n\n            In support of their claimed entitlement to present their\n\npolitical discrimination claim to a jury, the developers rely on\n\nthe mayor's admittedly unsupportable charges of nepotism, the\n\nmayor's acknowledged awareness that the developers were heavily\n\ninvolved    with    a   rival     political   party,   the   lack    of   evidence\n\nsupporting    the       mayor's    claim   that   a    number   of    industrial\n\ncorporations would be interested in locating their operations on\n\nthe parcel in question, the mayor's failure to establish the\n\nunavailability of similarly sized adjoining properties, and the\n\noverall irrationality of the mayor's opposition to a project that\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwas certain to create jobs within the town.1   But we think it clear\n\nthat this is not enough to ground a finding that the developers'\n\nparty membership constituted a \"substantial factor or a motivating\n\nfactor driving\" the mayor's opposition to their project.     Centro\n\nMédico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Mt. Healthy Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)) (internal quotation marks and\n\nellipses omitted).\n\n            A jury could perhaps find that the mayor's position on\n\nthe project was unsound and driven by an unfounded concern that the\n\nproject was nothing more than a boondoggle designed to enrich the\n\nformer mayor's family.    But that is as far as a jury reasonably\n\ncould go.    Such an inference – which is hardly inevitable on the\n\nrecord before us – simply does not, by itself, warrant a further\n\ninference that unlawful political discrimination was prompting the\n\nmayor's course of conduct.   The line between reasonable inference\n\nand unwarranted speculation is not always easy to draw, but we are\n\nconfident about the side of the line on which this case belongs.\n\nAssuming that a cause of action for political discrimination could\n\nlie against the mayor in circumstances such as these2 – a matter on\n\n\n1\n The developers also allege that the mayor supported less worthy\nprojects sponsored by members of his own party, but have failed to\nsupport these allegations with admissible evidence.\n2\n See, e.g., Padilla-Garcia v. Rodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.\n2000) (noting that \"circumstantial evidence . . . could alone\ncreate an issue of fact on discriminatory animus\").\n\n                                -7-\n\fwhich   we   take   no   position   –   such   a   claim   does   not   become\n\ntrialworthy simply because a jury could find that the defendant\n\nelected official knows the political affiliation of those whose\n\nproject he opposes, that political affiliation is not the same as\n\nhis own, and a case could be made that the official's position is\n\nnot grounded in sensible public policy. Otherwise, it would be too\n\neasy for a political opponent of an elected official who is\n\nnegatively affected by a discretionary decision of the official to\n\ngum up the machinery of government by bringing a federal civil\n\nrights lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the decision.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

Otherwise, it would be too\n\neasy for a political opponent of an elected official who is\n\nnegatively affected by a discretionary decision of the official to\n\ngum up the machinery of government by bringing a federal civil\n\nrights lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the decision.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f</pre>",
