Following a lengthy trial, a petit\n\njury convicted defendant-appellant Jose Gerardo Cruz-Arroyo on four\n\ncounts involving Hobbs Act extortion and related money laundering.\n\nIn this venue, the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence and the constitutionality of convictions based mainly on\n\nevidence neither identified in the indictment nor previewed before\n\nthe grand jury.    We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Because    the   appellant    mounts    a   challenge     to   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, we rehearse the relevant facts in the\n\nlight most hospitable to the verdict, consistent with record\n\nsupport.   See United States v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In the 1990s, Puerto Rico began the substantive process\n\nof privatizing government-owned hospitals. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n24 §§ 3301-3325 (repealed 2003).        The enabling legislation, among\n\nother things, authorized the Department of Health (the DOH) to\n\ncontract out certain health-care services and to sell off public\n\nhospitals. That aspect of the legislation required the DOH, acting\n\nin concert with the Government Development Bank (the GDB), to\n\napprove each such transaction.      See id. § 3303.\n\n           Sales     of   public   hospitals      typically    had   to    be\n\naccomplished through competitive bidding.         See id.     If, however, a\n\nfinancially sound investor already was administering the affairs of\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fa particular public hospital, the DOH could short-circuit the\n\nbidding process and negotiate directly with that investor for a\n\nsale of the hospital.        See id. § 3306.        In an effort to take\n\nadvantage of the direct-sale option, Caribbean Anesthesia Services,\n\nInc.   (CAS)   sought   to   assume    an     existing   contract   for   the\n\nadministration of the Dr. Alejandro Otero López Hospital (the\n\nHospital) in Manatí, Puerto Rico.           The contract was, at the time,\n\nheld by Caribbean Hospital Corporation (CHC).\n\n           As part of a push to gain the DOH's approval for the\n\ncontract assumption, a CAS consultant arranged a luncheon between\n\nCAS shareholders and the appellant, who was the chief legal adviser\n\nto the Secretary of Health (the Secretary) and the director of the\n\nDOH's law department.    At this luncheon — attended on CAS's behalf\n\nby, among others, José De Jesús-Toro, José Ivan Ramos Cubano, and\n\nAlvin Ramirez Ortiz — the appellant learned of CAS's interest in\n\ntaking over the Hospital's management contract and, ultimately, in\n\npurchasing the facility outright.            When the meeting ended, the\n\nappellant said that he would help CAS in whatever way he could.\n\nThe CAS shareholders thereafter agreed that De Jesús-Toro would\n\nshepherd the relationship with the DOH generally and with the\n\nappellant specifically.\n\n           From that point forward, the appellant served as CAS's\n\nears and eyes in the government, keeping De Jesús-Toro abreast of\n\nall developments. CAS soon learned of two potential snags. First,\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthere were other groups interested in acquiring the Hospital.\n\nSecond, the GDB's counsel had issued an opinion that highlighted a\n\ndispute over whether CAS would be responsible for monies owed to\n\nthe DOH by its assignor (CHC).     This dispute was significant both\n\nbecause of the size of the debt and because, under Puerto Rico law,\n\nan entity in debt to the DOH could not take advantage of the\n\ndirect-sale option. See id. § 3306. Since the management contract\n\nhad only a short time left to run, the GDB's counsel argued that\n\nthe Hospital should be auctioned off through an open bidding\n\nprocess.\n\n           In   October   of   1997,    the   DOH   overrode   the   GDB's\n\nobjections, approved CAS's proposed acquisition of the management\n\ncontract, and gave CAS until June 30, 1998 to negotiate terms for\n\na direct sale of the Hospital.         CAS took over management of the\n\nfacility the next month.\n\n           On November 25, 1997, while the direct-sale negotiations\n\nwere in full flower, De Jesús-Toro wired $15,000 from a CAS account\n\nto the appellant's bank account.       On January 10, 1998 — more than\n\na month later — the appellant instructed his bank to return the\n\nmoney because it did not belong to him.       However, a mere four days\n\nthereafter, De Jesús-Toro withdrew $35,000 from a CAS account and\n\nused the funds to procure fourteen money orders, each in the amount\n\nof $2,500.   Without exception, the proceeds of these money orders\n\nfound their way into the appellant's possession before the direct-\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fsale deadline.     The appellant used the funds for a variety of\n\npersonal    purposes   (e.g.,      to    make     a    down     payment   on    a    new\n\nautomobile, to pay for his children's private schooling, and to\n\naugment individual retirement accounts held by him and his wife).\n\n            In June of 1998, CAS sent a letter of intent for the\n\nHospital    purchase   to    the    GDB     and       the    DOH.      Although      the\n\nprivatization committee found CAS to be a suitable purchaser, an\n\nauditor's report indicated that the debt dispute had not been\n\nresolved.    A meeting was arranged between the GDB, the DOH, the\n\nGovernor's chief of staff, and CAS.             José Quirós, who held a twenty\n\npercent equity interest in CAS, met with the appellant beforehand\n\nin order to present his views on the matter.                     When the four-way\n\nmeeting occurred, the Governor's chief of staff requested that the\n\nappellant draft a legal opinion to resolve the uncertainty.\n\n            In an initial opinion, dated September 4, 1998, the\n\nappellant found that CAS was responsible for the debts amassed by\n\nits   predecessor-in-interest           (CHC).        Shortly       thereafter,      the\n\nappellant did an about-face and prepared a revised opinion, dated\n\nSeptember   14,   1998,     in   which    he     concluded      that   CAS     was   not\n\nresponsible for the debts amassed by CHC.                   The revised opinion was\n\naccepted by the agencies involved and made CAS eligible to purchase\n\nthe Hospital without the hindrance of competitive bidding.                           The\n\nparties closed on the direct sale three days later (although CAS\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fand the DOH continued to debate financial issues that arose out of\n\nCAS's earlier management of the Hospital).\n\n            At the same time that the DOH was dickering with CAS over\n\nthe debt issue, the appellant was negotiating sub rosa to become\n\nin-house counsel for Pinnacle (a company controlled by Quirós). In\n\nthose negotiations, the appellant presented Pinnacle with a wish\n\nlist that included a $144,000 annual salary, a luxury car, a\n\nretirement plan, health benefits, sick leave, paid vacation, and\n\nsummer camp for his children.     In Quirós's words, he and De Jesús-\n\nToro \"felt obliged\" to hire the appellant, notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat his demands far exceeded what Pinnacle had budgeted for the\n\nposition.\n\n            In August of 2000, while both the appellant's employment\n\nnegotiations and CAS's debt negotiations were ongoing, De Jesús-\n\nToro leased an Audi for the appellant's use.        CAS not only footed\n\nthe bill but also gave the appellant the use of a gasoline credit\n\ncard, free of charge.\n\n            On October 6, 2000, Pinnacle, through Quirós, formally\n\noffered the appellant the in-house counsel position.         CAS and the\n\nDOH resolved their remaining financial issues the next month.          The\n\nappellant started work at Pinnacle in January of 2001.            The jury\n\nsupportably could have found that these events were not merely\n\ncoincidental    but,   rather,   inextricably     intertwined;    Pinnacle\n\nmanaged   two   medical   centers,    including   CAS's   newly   acquired\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fHospital, and these two institutions jointly paid the salaries of\n\nall Pinnacle's employees (including Pinnacle's neophyte in-house\n\ncounsel).\n\n               In   due    course,    a    federal    grand     jury   indicted the\n\nappellant and four codefendants (including De Jesús-Toro, Ramos\n\nCubano, and Ramirez Ortiz).               The indictment charged the appellant\n\nwith two counts of extortion (viz., one count of conspiracy to\n\ninterfere with commerce by extortion and one count of interference\n\nwith commerce by extortion) and two counts of conspiracy to commit\n\nmoney laundering.          See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951, 1956.          After a forty-one\n\nday trial, a petit jury found the appellant guilty across the\n\nboard.     This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n               Before us, the appellant advances three assignments of\n\nerror.     First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict on the Hobbs Act extortion charges (counts 1\n\nand 2).    Second, and relatedly, he maintains that this same dearth\n\nof evidence undermines his convictions for money laundering (counts\n\n3 and 4) because the alleged extortion served as the underlying\n\npredicate offense on which those charges were based.                     Third, he\n\nposits that his convictions on all four counts must be set aside\n\ndue   to   a   fatal      variance:   those       convictions   were   premised   on\n\nevidence neither submitted to the grand jury nor referenced in the\n\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\findictment. We address the three components of this asseverational\n\narray sequentially.\n\n                        A.   Counts 1 and 2.\n\n           We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nde novo, assessing the proof in the light most hospitable to the\n\nverdict.   See United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 526 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   The test is whether the evidence, including all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, would permit a rational juror to conclude\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the\n\ncrime charged.   See United States v. Maldonado-García, 446 F.3d\n\n227, 231 (1st Cir. 2006).      We administer the test without any\n\nindependent evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses.     See\n\nUnited States v. Franky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nFinally, we caution that to achieve a passing grade on this test,\n\nthe prosecution need not have succeeded in negating every possible\n\ntheory consistent with the defendant's innocence.   See Maldonado-\n\nGarcía, 446 F.3d at 231.\n\n           The Hobbs Act criminalizes conduct that \"in any way or\n\ndegree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of\n\nany article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n\nattempts or conspires so to do.\"   18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).   To support\n\nthe Hobbs Act charges in this case then, the government needed to\n\nestablish that the appellant committed extortion and that his\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\factions affected interstate or international commerce. See id. We\n\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence as to each such element.\n\n           1.   Extortion.      The Hobbs Act defines extortion as \"the\n\nobtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by\n\nwrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or\n\nunder color of official right.\"          Id. § 1951(b)(2).        The indictment\n\ncharged the appellant with extortion both under color of official\n\nright and through inducement by economic fear.                    The \"color of\n\nofficial    right\"       and    \"fear\"     prongs       provide     alternative,\n\nindependently    sufficient     grounds    for   finding     extortion;     thus,\n\nadequate proof of one obviates any need for proof of the other.\n\nSee United States v. Bucci, 839 F.2d 825, 827 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(explaining that \"the prosecution can establish a violation by\n\nshowing that a defendant induced payment either through the use of\n\n. . . fear, or under color of official right\"); United States v.\n\nHathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 393 (1st Cir. 1976) (similar).\n\n           The appellant contends that in a Hobbs Act \"color of\n\nofficial right\" case, the government must show that the official\n\nsomehow \"induced\" the payment.             This emphasis exaggerates the\n\ngovernment's burden.       To establish guilt for extortion under color\n\nof   official   right,    the   prosecution      must    show     only   that   the\n\ndefendant, a public official, has received an emolument that he was\n\nnot entitled to receive, with knowledge that the emolument was\n\ntendered in exchange for some official act.               See Evans v. United\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fStates,   504   U.S.    255,    268    (1992);    United    States    v.    Cruzado-\n\nLaureano, 404 F.3d 470, 481 (1st Cir. 2005).               The government is not\n\nrequired to prove any affirmative act of inducement on the part of\n\nthe corrupt official.          See Evans, 504 U.S. at 268.\n\n           Here, the evidence reveals that the appellant accepted\n\n$35,000 in serial money orders derived from a CAS account.                        He\n\nreceived and spent these funds while the DOH's approval of CAS's\n\nproposal to acquire the Hospital hung in the balance.                      Given the\n\nappellant's pivotal role in the DOH's triage of hospital purchase\n\nproposals, the importance attached to his opinion by the Governor's\n\nchief of staff, and his resultant power to impact CAS's financial\n\ninterests, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the money\n\norders were intended as reciprocity for official acts, past or\n\nfuture — and that the appellant knew as much.\n\n           In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellant suggests that these payments were simply the fruits of\n\nhis \"special relationship\" with De Jesús-Toro.                 That relationship,\n\nthe appellant muses, inspired De Jesús-Toro to make a generous, no-\n\nstrings-attached       gift.      We    need     not   dwell    on   the    inherent\n\nimplausibility of such an explanation; it suffices to say that the\n\ngovernment need not refute every alternative theory consistent with\n\nthe defendant's innocence in order to defeat a sufficiency of the\n\nevidence challenge. See United States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 56\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).       In this instance, the jury acted well within its\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fproper province in rejecting the somewhat fanciful claim that the\n\nappellant received a considerable sum of money due to friendship\n\nwith a man who just happened to be a beneficiary of his official\n\nacts.   Cf. United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (explaining that \"jurors are neither required to divorce\n\nthemselves from their common sense nor to abandon the dictates of\n\nmature experience\").\n\n          We have said enough on this score.     Since a plausible\n\nview of the evidence supports a finding that the appellant accepted\n\nthe money orders in exchange for official acts, the proposition\n\nthat the government failed to establish extortion under color of\n\nofficial right necessarily fails.\n\n          Although this finding, without more, establishes the\n\nextortion element, we note for the sake of completeness that the\n\nevidence also suffices to ground a finding of extortion induced\n\nthrough fear.   We explain briefly.\n\n          Under the Hobbs Act, \"fear\" encompasses fear of economic\n\nloss, including the loss of business opportunities. See Bucci, 839\n\nF.2d at 827.    To establish that kind of fear, the government must\n\nshow that the victim reasonably feared that noncompliance with the\n\nputative extortionist's terms would result in economic loss.   See\n\nUnited States v. Rivera Rangel, 396 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe evidence in this case satisfies that criterion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f            CAS made a substantial investment when it assumed the\n\nmanagement contract for the Hospital — and it risked forfeiting\n\nboth that investment and the prospect of future profits if the DOH\n\ndid not endorse its purchase proposal.           The appellant played a key\n\nrole in the negotiating pavane and, thus, had the potential to\n\ninfluence (perhaps to dictate) the success or failure of CAS's\n\nbusiness plan.        A rational jury surely could have inferred that,\n\ngiven the circumstances, De Jesús-Toro and Quirós would have been\n\napprehensive that noncompliance with the appellant's demands (such\n\nas his esurient terms for future employment at Pinnacle) would\n\nresult in the foreclosure of a lucrative business opportunity. The\n\nplausibility     of    this   inference    was   strengthened    by   Quirós's\n\ntestimony that he had been considering a more experienced candidate\n\nfor the Pinnacle in-house counsel position; that he had budgeted a\n\nlower wage for that post; but that he nonetheless \"felt obliged\" to\n\nhire the appellant at the more munificent salary that the appellant\n\nstipulated. In this regard, the jury reasonably could have thought\n\nthat     \"fe[eling]    obliged\"   was     a   euphemism    for   fearing     the\n\nconsequences of rejecting the appellant's demands.\n\n            To cinch matters, the events that transpired demonstrate\n\nbeyond    hope   of    contradiction      that   CAS's    economic    fear   was\n\nreasonable.      The appellant's initial opinion letter, which was\n\nunfavorable to CAS, attained the Secretary's endorsement.               It was\n\nonly when the appellant reversed field and revised his legal\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fopinion (which otherwise would have barred any direct sale) that a\n\npathway opened for CAS's acquisition of the Hospital.             The timing\n\namply illustrates the salience of this about-face: the parties\n\nclosed on the sale of the Hospital a scant three days after the\n\nappellant issued his revised opinion.\n\n          We    hold,    therefore,     that   the   government     provided\n\nsufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the appellant was\n\nguilty of extortion induced by fear of economic loss.             Cf. United\n\nStates v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 595 (1st Cir. 1992) (warning that\n\n\"[o]ne would have to believe in the Tooth Fairy to think [a\n\nparticular sequence of events] merely coincidental\").\n\n          2. Commerce. In addition to establishing extortion, the\n\ngovernment also must show that the extortionate conduct obstructed,\n\ndelayed, or affected interstate or international commerce.            See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1951(a).       As to this prong, the case law erects a low\n\nthreshold: a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to\n\nsustain a Hobbs Act conviction.       See Vega Molina, 407 F.3d at 527.\n\n          The   appellant    advances    two   contentions   in    hopes   of\n\nshowing that the government failed to cross even this modest\n\nthreshold.   Neither contention is persuasive.\n\n          The appellant's principal argument is that there was no\n\neffect on interstate commerce because the money orders that he\n\nreceived were purchased by De Jesús-Toro personally.               Since De\n\nJesús-Toro earned his livelihood as a physician and only practiced\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fhis profession in local hospitals, this thesis runs, an extortion\n\nof his funds could not have interfered with interstate commerce.\n\nThis exercise in legal legerdemain does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n            While De Jesús-Toro bought the money orders, the record\n\nconfirms that he first withdrew a sum equal to their cost — $35,000\n\n— from a CAS account.       He then used the appropriated funds to buy\n\nthe money orders.         Hence, the distinction between business and\n\npersonal funds that the appellant relies on here is purely one of\n\nform, not of substance.\n\n            The jurisprudence of the Hobbs Act does not recognize\n\nthat kind of artificial distinction.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\nDevin, 918 F.2d 280, 293-94 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding an effect on\n\ninterstate commerce when defendant had received money from the\n\npresident of a corporation who, in turn, had derived the money from\n\nthe coffers of the corporation — which was engaged in interstate\n\ncommerce).    A temporary interval of personal possession may serve\n\nto weaken the causal connection between funds and interstate\n\ncommerce, but that connection remains strong enough to forge the\n\nnecessary link — a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.            See\n\nid. at 293.\n\n            The appellant's fallback argument is that the government\n\nfailed to prove that any of CAS's funds entered into the stream of\n\ninterstate commerce.        This argument comprises little more than\n\nwhistling    past   the   graveyard.      The    government   establishes   a\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fcognizable effect on interstate commerce if it shows that the\n\nextortionate conduct depleted the assets of a business engaged in\n\ninterstate commerce.    See United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano, 425\n\nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2005) (upholding a finding of an effect on\n\ninterstate commerce where money stolen in housebreaks belonged to\n\nbusinesses — a hardware store and a gas station, respectively —\n\nthat purchased products out of state).\n\n          That principle is determinative in the instant case. The\n\ngovernment adduced evidence showing that the money orders the\n\nappellant accepted could be traced to a CAS account; that CAS\n\nmanaged, and later owned, the Hospital; and that the Hospital\n\nbought much of its equipment from the United States mainland. This\n\nevidence formed a sufficient predicate for an inference that any\n\npayments that depleted CAS's assets affected interstate commerce.\n\n          To sum up, we conclude, without serious question, that\n\nthe government provided adequate proof to establish both of the\n\nelements needed to ground convictions on the Hobbs Act counts: the\n\ncommission   of   extortion   and   a   concomitant   interference   with\n\ninterstate commerce.\n\n                        B.    Counts 3 and 4.\n\n          The appellant's second claim of error stands or falls on\n\nthe merits of the appellant's first claim of error. The applicable\n\nmoney laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, imposes criminal\n\nliability on any person who, \"knowing that the property involved in\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fa financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of\n\nunlawful   activity,\"   engages   in   a   financial   transaction   that\n\nconstitutes money laundering.       Id. § 1956(a)(1).      In fine, the\n\nstatute requires proof of the commission of some antecedent offense\n\n(the specified \"unlawful activity\"), the avails of which are then\n\n\"laundered\" by the defendant.      Here, the relevant counts in the\n\nindictment (counts 3 and 4) charged the extortion as the antecedent\n\noffense.\n\n           Seizing on this tiered statutory structure, the appellant\n\nclaims, in effect, that the evidence was insufficient to support a\n\nfinding of extortion and that, therefore, the absence of the\n\nlinchpin predicate offense rendered the evidence insufficient to\n\nsupport his money laundering convictions.       This claim is hopeless.\n\nAfter all, we already have rebuffed the appellant's challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence in connection with the extortion\n\ncharges. See supra Part II(A). Consequently, his challenge to his\n\nmoney laundering convictions collapses of its own weight.\n\n                            C.    Variance.\n\n           The appellant next complains that the verdict cannot\n\nstand on any of the four counts of conviction because it rests\n\npredominantly on facts that the government failed either to present\n\nto the grand jury or to plead in the indictment.        We first sketch\n\nthe background for this plaint and then address its merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f          In responding to a question on the verdict form, the\n\npetit jury found that the offenses of conviction involved $35,000.\n\nIn the appellant's view, that calculation means that the jury found\n\nhim liable only for the money orders that De Jesús-Toro passed\n\nalong to him.   But the government did not adduce any evidence about\n\nthis alleged bribe before the grand jury; and the grand jury, in\n\nturn, did not mention the money orders in the indictment. Building\n\non this foundation, the appellant argues that his convictions rest\n\nupon a prejudicial variance, thereby violating his rights under the\n\nFifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n          Though vigorously advanced, this argument lacks force.\n\nFirst and foremost, the fact that the jury found the appellant\n\nliable for $35,000 is by no means a conclusive indication that the\n\nmoney orders constituted the only evidence upon which the jury\n\nfound him guilty.      See, e.g., United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23,\n\n64 n.56 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating that there is no foolproof way of\n\ntelling what parts of the evidence the jury credited when it did\n\nnot make specific findings on the overt acts alleged in the\n\nindictment).     And    even   were   we     to   assume,   favorably   to   the\n\nappellant, the validity of his premise anent the money orders, the\n\nconclusion that he reaches would not follow.\n\n          A variance occurs \"when the facts proved at trial differ\n\nfrom those alleged in the indictment.\"            United States v. Fisher, 3\n\nF.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir. 1993).        Even if a variance occurs, however,\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fthat fact alone does not suffice to displace a conviction. Rather,\n\na variance requires that a conviction be set aside only when it is\n\nprejudicial, that is, when it affects the defendant's substantial\n\nrights. See United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Fermin Castillo, 829 F.2d 1194, 1196\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).              There is no prejudicial variance so long as an\n\nindictment provides the defendant with sufficient detail to allow\n\nhim to prepare a defense, avoid unfair surprise at trial, and plead\n\ndouble jeopardy when appropriate.                   See Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d at\n\n1115.        The law recognizes that the government need not lay out the\n\nwhole of its proof in the indictment.                          See United States v.\n\nMarrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 773 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                  That brings us to the case at bar.            Here, the indictment\n\nlimned the nucleus of operative facts giving rise to the charges\n\nagainst          the   appellant.     It    not    only    listed    some    overt   acts\n\nreferable to the charged conspiracies (e.g., it described the\n\n$15,000 payment that the appellant received and returned,1 the Audi\n\nthat        De   Jesús-Toro     leased    for    him,    and   his   cushy   employment\n\narrangement            with   Pinnacle)    but    also    referred    to    the   general\n\nagreement among CAS's shareholders that \"De Jesús-Toro would take\n\n        1\n      The appellant insists that his return of this payment\nconclusively demonstrates his innocence. In view of his subsequent\nreceipt and retention of a larger sum, however, the jury was free\nto conclude that his return of the $15,000 payment may have had\nsome other, less attractive explanation (say, a belief either that\nthe amount was too paltry or that the source of the funds was too\neasily traced).\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\fcare of the payments to [the appellant].\"          Taken in the ensemble,\n\nthese allegations served to put the appellant on notice that any\n\npecuniary benefit he had received from or through De Jesús-Toro\n\nmight be relevant to the government's case.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 478 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding no\n\nprejudicial variance when an indictment charged a defendant with\n\nconspiring to distribute drugs and the government introduced proof\n\nof two deals not listed as overt acts because the evidence fell\n\n\"squarely within the scope of th[e] alleged conspiracy\").\n\n            In short, the indictment gave the appellant fair warning\n\nas to the nature of the charges that he faced and allowed him to\n\ndefend intelligently against those charges.         No more was exigible.\n\nConsequently,   no   variance   (or,   at    the   least,   no   prejudicial\n\nvariance) occurred.    See Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d at 773.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.          For aught that appears, the\n\nappellant was fairly tried and justly convicted.                 His appeal,\n\ntherefore, cannot prosper.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

In this venue, the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of convictions based mainly on evidence neither identified in the indictment nor previewed before the grand jury. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant mounts a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the verdict, consistent with record support. <i>See United States v. S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1990s, Puerto Rico began the substantive process of privatizing government-owned hospitals. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24 &#167;&#167; 3301-3325 (repealed 2003). The enabling legislation, among other things, authorized the Department of Health (the DOH) to contract out certain health-care services and to sell off public hospitals. That aspect of the legislation required the DOH, acting in concert with the Government Development Bank (the GDB), to approve each such transaction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sales of public hospitals typically had to be accomplished through competitive bidding. <i>See id.</i> If, however, a financially sound investor already was administering the affairs of a particular public hospital, the DOH could short-circuit the bidding process and negotiate directly with that investor for a sale of the hospital. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3306. In an effort to take advantage of the direct-sale option, Caribbean Anesthesia Services, Inc. (CAS) sought to assume an existing contract for the administration of the Dr. Alejandro Otero L&#243;pez Hospital (the Hospital) in Manat&#237;, Puerto Rico. The contract was, at the time, held by Caribbean Hospital Corporation (CHC).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of a push to gain the DOH's approval for the contract assumption, a CAS consultant arranged a luncheon between CAS shareholders and the appellant, who was the chief legal adviser to the Secretary of Health (the Secretary) and the director of the DOH's law department. At this luncheon &#8212; attended on CAS's behalf by, among others, Jos&#233; De Jes&#250;s-Toro, Jos&#233; Ivan Ramos Cubano, and Alvin Ramirez Ortiz &#8212; the appellant learned of CAS's interest in taking over the Hospital's management contract and, ultimately, in purchasing the facility outright. When the meeting ended, the appellant said that he would help CAS in whatever way he could. The CAS shareholders thereafter agreed that De Jes&#250;s-Toro would shepherd the relationship with the DOH generally and with the appellant specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, the appellant served as CAS's ears and eyes in the government, keeping De Jes&#250;s-Toro abreast of all developments. CAS soon learned of two potential snags. First, there were other groups interested in acquiring the Hospital. Second, the GDB's counsel had issued an opinion that highlighted a dispute over whether CAS would be responsible for monies owed to the DOH by its assignor (CHC). This dispute was significant both because of the size of the debt and because, under Puerto Rico law, an entity in debt to the DOH could not take advantage of the direct-sale option. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3306. Since the management contract had only a short time left to run, the GDB's counsel argued that the Hospital should be auctioned off through an open bidding process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1997, the DOH overrode the GDB's objections, approved CAS's proposed acquisition of the management contract, and gave CAS until June 30, 1998 to negotiate terms for a direct sale of the Hospital. CAS took over management of the facility the next month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1997, while the direct-sale negotiations were in full flower, De Jes&#250;s-Toro wired $15,000 from a CAS account to the appellant's bank account. On January 10, 1998 &#8212; more than a month later &#8212; the appellant instructed his bank to return the money because it did not belong to him. However, a mere four days thereafter, De Jes&#250;s-Toro withdrew $35,000 from a CAS account and used the funds to procure fourteen money orders, each in the amount of $2,500. Without exception, the proceeds of these money orders found their way into the appellant's possession before the direct-sale deadline. The appellant used the funds for a variety of personal purposes (e.g., to make a down payment on a new automobile, to pay for his children's private schooling, and to augment individual retirement accounts held by him and his wife).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1998, CAS sent a letter of intent for the Hospital purchase to the GDB and the DOH. Although the privatization committee found CAS to be a suitable purchaser, an auditor's report indicated that the debt dispute had not been resolved. A meeting was arranged between the GDB, the DOH, the Governor's chief of staff, and CAS. Jos&#233; Quir&#243;s, who held a twenty percent equity interest in CAS, met with the appellant beforehand in order to present his views on the matter. When the four-way meeting occurred, the Governor's chief of staff requested that the appellant draft a legal opinion to resolve the uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an initial opinion, dated September 4, 1998, the appellant found that CAS was responsible for the debts amassed by its predecessor-in-interest (CHC). Shortly thereafter, the appellant did an about-face and prepared a revised opinion, dated September 14, 1998, in which he concluded that CAS was not responsible for the debts amassed by CHC. The revised opinion was accepted by the agencies involved and made CAS eligible to purchase the Hospital without the hindrance of competitive bidding. The parties closed on the direct sale three days later (although CAS and the DOH continued to debate financial issues that arose out of CAS's earlier management of the Hospital).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time that the DOH was dickering with CAS over the debt issue, the appellant was negotiating <i>sub rosa</i> to become in-house counsel for Pinnacle (a company controlled by Quir&#243;s). In those negotiations, the appellant presented Pinnacle with a wish list that included a $144,000 annual salary, a luxury car, a retirement plan, health benefits, sick leave, paid vacation, and summer camp for his children. In Quir&#243;s's words, he and De Jes&#250;s-Toro \"felt obliged\" to hire the appellant, notwithstanding the fact that his demands far exceeded what Pinnacle had budgeted for the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 2000, while both the appellant's employment negotiations and CAS's debt negotiations were ongoing, De Jes&#250;s-Toro leased an Audi for the appellant's use. CAS not only footed the bill but also gave the appellant the use of a gasoline credit card, free of charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 2000, Pinnacle, through Quir&#243;s, formally offered the appellant the in-house counsel position. CAS and the DOH resolved their remaining financial issues the next month. The appellant started work at Pinnacle in January of 2001. The jury supportably could have found that these events were not merely coincidental but, rather, inextricably intertwined; Pinnacle managed two medical centers, including CAS's newly acquired Hospital, and these two institutions jointly paid the salaries of all Pinnacle's employees (including Pinnacle's neophyte in-house counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury indicted the appellant and four codefendants (including De Jes&#250;s-Toro, Ramos Cubano, and Ramirez Ortiz). The indictment charged the appellant with two counts of extortion (viz., one count of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion and one count of interference with commerce by extortion) and two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951, 1956. After a forty-one day trial, a petit jury found the appellant guilty across the board. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances three assignments of error. First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict on the Hobbs Act extortion charges (counts 1 and 2). Second, and relatedly, he maintains that this same dearth of evidence undermines his convictions for money laundering (counts 3 and 4) because the alleged extortion served as the underlying predicate offense on which those charges were based. Third, he posits that his convictions on all four counts must be set aside due to a fatal variance: those convictions were premised on evidence neither submitted to the grand jury nor referenced in the indictment. We address the three components of this asseverational array sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Counts 1 and 2.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, assessing the proof in the light most hospitable to the verdict. <i>See United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 526 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Valle,</i> 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995). The test is whether the evidence, including all reasonable inferences therefrom, would permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 231 (1st Cir. 2006). We administer the test without any independent evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses. <i>See United States v. Franky-Ortiz,</i> 230 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir. 2000). Finally, we caution that to achieve a passing grade on this test, the prosecution need not have succeeded in negating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence. <i>See Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d at 231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act criminalizes conduct that \"in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). To support the Hobbs Act charges in this case then, the government needed to establish that the appellant committed extortion and that his actions affected interstate or international commerce. <i>See id.</i> We consider the sufficiency of the evidence as to each such element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Extortion.</i> The Hobbs Act defines extortion as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1951(b)(2). The indictment charged the appellant with extortion both under color of official right and through inducement by economic fear. The \"color of official right\" and \"fear\" prongs provide alternative, independently sufficient grounds for finding extortion; thus, adequate proof of one obviates any need for proof of the other. <i>See United States v. Bucci,</i> 839 F.2d 825, 827 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that \"the prosecution can establish a violation by showing that a defendant induced payment <i>either</i> through the use of . . . fear, <i>or</i> under color of official right\"); <i>United States v. Hathaway,</i> 534 F.2d 386, 393 (1st Cir.1976) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that in a Hobbs Act \"color of official right\" case, the government must show that the official somehow \"induced\" the payment. This emphasis exaggerates the government's burden. To establish guilt for extortion under color of official right, the prosecution must show only that the defendant, a public official, has received an emolument that he was not entitled to receive, with knowledge that the emolument was tendered in exchange for some official act. <i>See Evans v. United States,</i> 504 U.S. 255, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1881, 119 L.Ed.2d 57 (1992); <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d 470, 481 (1st Cir.2005). The government is not required to prove any affirmative act of inducement on the part of the corrupt official. <i>See Evans,</i> 504 U.S. at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1881.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence reveals that the appellant accepted $35,000 in serial money orders derived from a CAS account. He received and spent these funds while the DOH's approval of CAS's proposal to acquire the Hospital hung in the balance. Given the appellant's pivotal role in the DOH's triage of hospital purchase proposals, the importance attached to his opinion by the Governor's chief of staff, and his resultant power to impact CAS's financial interests, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the money orders were intended as reciprocity for official acts, past or future &#8212; and that the appellant knew as much.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the appellant suggests that these payments were simply the fruits of his \"special relationship\" with De Jes&#250;s-Toro. That relationship, the appellant muses, inspired De Jes&#250;s-Toro to make a generous, no-strings-attached gift. We need not dwell on the inherent implausibility of such an explanation; it suffices to say that the government need not refute every alternative theory consistent with the defendant's innocence in order to defeat a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. <i>See United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.1998). In this instance, the jury acted well within its proper province in rejecting the somewhat fanciful claim that the appellant received a considerable sum of money due to friendship with a man who just happened to be a beneficiary of his official acts. <i>Cf. United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"jurors are neither required to divorce themselves from their common sense nor to abandon the dictates of mature experience\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Since a plausible view of the evidence supports a finding that the appellant accepted the money orders in exchange for official acts, the proposition that the government failed to establish extortion under color of official right necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this finding, without more, establishes the extortion element, we note for the sake of completeness that the evidence also suffices to ground a finding of extortion induced through fear. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Hobbs Act, \"fear\" encompasses fear of economic loss, including the loss of business opportunities. <i>See Bucci,</i> 839 F.2d at 827. To establish that kind of fear, the government must show that the victim reasonably feared that noncompliance with the putative extortionist's terms would result in economic loss. <i>See United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> 396 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir.2005). The evidence in this case satisfies that criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAS made a substantial investment when it assumed the management contract for the Hospital &#8212; and it risked forfeiting both that investment and the prospect of future profits if the DOH did not endorse its purchase proposal. The appellant played a key role in the negotiating pavane and, thus, had the potential to influence (perhaps to dictate) the success or failure of CAS's business plan. A rational jury surely could have inferred that, given the circumstances, De Jes&#250;s-Toro and Quir&#243;s would have been apprehensive that noncompliance with the appellant's demands (such as his esurient terms for future employment at Pinnacle) would result in the foreclosure of a lucrative business opportunity. The plausibility of this inference was strengthened by Quir&#243;s's testimony that he had been considering a more experienced candidate for the Pinnacle in-house counsel position; that he had budgeted a lower wage for that post; but that he nonetheless \"felt obliged\" to hire the appellant at the more munificent salary that the appellant stipulated. In this regard, the jury reasonably could have thought that \"fe[eling] obliged\" was a euphemism for fearing the consequences of rejecting the appellant's demands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the events that transpired demonstrate beyond hope of contradiction that CAS's economic fear was reasonable. The appellant's initial opinion letter, which was unfavorable to CAS, attained the Secretary's endorsement. It was only when the appellant reversed field and revised his legal opinion (which otherwise would have barred any direct sale) that a pathway opened for CAS's acquisition of the Hospital. The timing amply illustrates the salience of this about-face: the parties closed on the sale of the Hospital a scant three days after the appellant issued his revised opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the appellant was guilty of extortion induced by fear of economic loss. <i>Cf. United States v. Doyle,</i> 981 F.2d 591, 595 (1st Cir.1992) (warning that \"[o]ne would have to believe in the Tooth Fairy to think [a particular sequence of events] merely coincidental\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Commerce.</i> In addition to establishing extortion, the government also must show that the extortionate conduct obstructed, delayed, or affected interstate or international commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). As to this prong, the case law erects a low threshold: a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to sustain a Hobbs Act conviction. <i>See Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 527.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances two contentions in hopes of showing that the government failed to cross even this modest threshold. Neither contention is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's principal argument is that there was no effect on interstate commerce because the money orders that he received were purchased by De Jes&#250;s-Toro personally. Since De Jes&#250;s-Toro earned his livelihood as a physician and only practiced his profession in local hospitals, this thesis runs, an extortion of his funds could not have interfered with interstate commerce. This exercise in legal legerdemain does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While De Jes&#250;s-Toro bought the money orders, the record confirms that he first withdrew a sum equal to their cost &#8212; $35,000 &#8212; from a CAS account. He then used the appropriated funds to buy the money orders. Hence, the distinction between business and personal funds that the appellant relies on here is purely one of form, not of substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisprudence of the Hobbs Act does not recognize that kind of artificial distinction. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 293-94 (1st Cir.1990) (finding an effect on interstate commerce when defendant had received money from the president of a corporation who, in turn, had derived the money from the coffers of the corporation &#8212; which was engaged in interstate commerce). A temporary interval of personal possession may serve to weaken the causal connection between funds and interstate commerce, but that connection remains strong enough to forge the necessary link &#8212; a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback argument is that the government failed to prove that any of CAS's funds entered into the stream of interstate commerce. This argument comprises little more than whistling past the graveyard. The government establishes a cognizable effect on interstate commerce if it shows that the extortionate conduct depleted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2005) (upholding a finding of an effect on interstate commerce where money stolen in housebreaks belonged to businesses &#8212; a hardware store and a gas station, respectively &#8212; that purchased products out of state).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That principle is determinative in the instant case. The government adduced evidence showing that the money orders the appellant accepted could be traced to a CAS account; that CAS managed, and later owned, the Hospital; and that the Hospital bought much of its equipment from the United States mainland. This evidence formed a sufficient predicate for an inference that any payments that depleted CAS's assets affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude, without serious question, that the government provided adequate proof to establish both of the elements needed to ground convictions on the Hobbs Act counts: the commission of extortion and a concomitant interference with interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Counts 3 and 4.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second claim of error stands or falls on the merits of the appellant's first claim of error. The applicable money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, imposes criminal liability on any person who, \"knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" engages in a financial transaction that constitutes money laundering. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1). In fine, the statute requires proof of the commission of some antecedent offense (the specified \"unlawful activity\"), the avails of which are then \"laundered\" by the defendant. Here, the relevant counts in the indictment (counts 3 and 4) charged the extortion as the antecedent offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seizing on this tiered statutory structure, the appellant claims, in effect, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of extortion and that, therefore, the absence of the linchpin predicate offense rendered the evidence insufficient to support his money laundering convictions. This claim is hopeless. After all, we already have rebuffed the appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in connection with the extortion charges. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Consequently, his challenge to his money laundering convictions collapses of its own weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Variance.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next complains that the verdict cannot stand on any of the four counts of conviction because it rests predominantly on facts that the government failed either to present to the grand jury or to plead in the indictment. We first sketch the background for this plaint and then address its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In responding to a question on the verdict form, the petit jury found that the offenses of conviction involved $35,000. In the appellant's view, that calculation means that the jury found him liable only for the money orders that De Jes&#250;s-Toro passed along to him. But the government did not adduce any evidence about this alleged bribe before the grand jury; and the grand jury, in turn, did not mention the money orders in the indictment. Building on this foundation, the appellant argues that his convictions rest upon a prejudicial variance, thereby violating his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though vigorously advanced, this argument lacks force. First and foremost, the fact that the jury found the appellant liable for $35,000 is by no means a conclusive indication that the money orders constituted the only evidence upon which the jury found him guilty. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 64 n. 56 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating that there is no foolproof way of telling what parts of the evidence the jury credited when it did not make specific findings on the overt acts alleged in the indictment). And even were we to assume, favorably to the appellant, the validity of his premise anent the money orders, the conclusion that he reaches would not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variance occurs \"when the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir.1993). Even if a variance occurs, however, that fact alone does not suffice to displace a conviction. Rather, a variance requires that a conviction be set aside only when it is prejudicial, that is, when it affects the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d 1103, 1115 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Fermin Castillo,</i> 829 F.2d 1194, 1196 (1st Cir. 1987). There is no prejudicial variance so long as an indictment provides the defendant with sufficient detail to allow him to prepare a defense, avoid unfair surprise at trial, and plead double jeopardy when appropriate. <i>See Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d at 1115. The law recognizes that the government need not lay out the whole of its proof in the indictment. <i>See United States v. Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d 768, 773 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That brings us to the case at bar. Here, the indictment limned the nucleus of operative facts giving rise to the charges against the appellant. It not only listed some overt acts referable to the charged conspiracies (e.g., it described the $15,000 payment that the appellant received and returned,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the Audi that De Jes&#250;s-Toro leased for him, and his cushy employment arrangement with Pinnacle) but also referred to the general agreement among CAS's shareholders that \"De Jes&#250;s-Toro would take care of the payments to [the appellant].\" Taken in the ensemble, these allegations served to put the appellant on notice that any pecuniary benefit he had received from or through De Jes&#250;s-Toro might be relevant to the government's case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 478 (1st Cir.1993) (finding no prejudicial variance when an indictment charged a defendant with conspiring to distribute drugs and the government introduced proof of two deals not listed as overt acts because the evidence fell \"squarely within the scope of th[e] alleged conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the indictment gave the appellant fair warning as to the nature of the charges that he faced and allowed him to defend intelligently against those charges. No more was exigible. Consequently, no variance (or, at the least, no prejudicial variance) occurred. <i>See Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d at 773.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and justly convicted. His appeal, therefore, cannot prosper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The appellant insists that his return of this payment conclusively demonstrates his innocence. In view of his subsequent receipt and retention of a larger sum, however, the jury was free to conclude that his return of the $15,000 payment may have had some other, less attractive explanation (say, a belief either that the amount was too paltry or that the source of the funds was too easily traced)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant mounts a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the verdict, consistent with record support. <i>See United States v. S&#225;nchez-Berr&#237;os,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1990s, Puerto Rico began the substantive process of privatizing government-owned hospitals. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24 &#167;&#167; 3301-3325 (repealed 2003). The enabling legislation, among other things, authorized the Department of Health (the DOH) to contract out certain health-care services and to sell off public hospitals. That aspect of the legislation required the DOH, acting in concert with the Government Development Bank (the GDB), to approve each such transaction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sales of public hospitals typically had to be accomplished through competitive bidding. <i>See id.</i> If, however, a financially sound investor already was administering the affairs of a particular public hospital, the DOH could short-circuit the bidding process and negotiate directly with that investor for a sale of the hospital. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3306. In an effort to take advantage of the direct-sale option, Caribbean Anesthesia Services, Inc. (CAS) sought to assume an existing contract for the administration of the Dr. Alejandro Otero L&#243;pez Hospital (the Hospital) in Manat&#237;, Puerto Rico. The contract was, at the time, held by Caribbean Hospital Corporation (CHC).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of a push to gain the DOH's approval for the contract assumption, a CAS consultant arranged a luncheon between CAS shareholders and the appellant, who was the chief legal adviser to the Secretary of Health (the Secretary) and the director of the DOH's law department. At this luncheon &#8212; attended on CAS's behalf by, among others, Jos&#233; De Jes&#250;s-Toro, Jos&#233; Ivan Ramos Cubano, and Alvin Ramirez Ortiz &#8212; the appellant learned of CAS's interest in taking over the Hospital's management contract and, ultimately, in purchasing the facility outright. When the meeting ended, the appellant said that he would help CAS in whatever way he could. The CAS shareholders thereafter agreed that De Jes&#250;s-Toro would shepherd the relationship with the DOH generally and with the appellant specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that point forward, the appellant served as CAS's ears and eyes in the government, keeping De Jes&#250;s-Toro abreast of all developments. CAS soon learned of two potential snags. First, there were other groups interested in acquiring the Hospital. Second, the GDB's counsel had issued an opinion that highlighted a dispute over whether CAS would be responsible for monies owed to the DOH by its assignor (CHC). This dispute was significant both because of the size of the debt and because, under Puerto Rico law, an entity in debt to the DOH could not take advantage of the direct-sale option. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3306. Since the management contract had only a short time left to run, the GDB's counsel argued that the Hospital should be auctioned off through an open bidding process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1997, the DOH overrode the GDB's objections, approved CAS's proposed acquisition of the management contract, and gave CAS until June 30, 1998 to negotiate terms for a direct sale of the Hospital. CAS took over management of the facility the next month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1997, while the direct-sale negotiations were in full flower, De Jes&#250;s-Toro wired $15,000 from a CAS account to the appellant's bank account. On January 10, 1998 &#8212; more than a month later &#8212; the appellant instructed his bank to return the money because it did not belong to him. However, a mere four days thereafter, De Jes&#250;s-Toro withdrew $35,000 from a CAS account and used the funds to procure fourteen money orders, each in the amount of $2,500. Without exception, the proceeds of these money orders found their way into the appellant's possession before the direct-sale deadline. The appellant used the funds for a variety of personal purposes (e.g., to make a down payment on a new automobile, to pay for his children's private schooling, and to augment individual retirement accounts held by him and his wife).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1998, CAS sent a letter of intent for the Hospital purchase to the GDB and the DOH. Although the privatization committee found CAS to be a suitable purchaser, an auditor's report indicated that the debt dispute had not been resolved. A meeting was arranged between the GDB, the DOH, the Governor's chief of staff, and CAS. Jos&#233; Quir&#243;s, who held a twenty percent equity interest in CAS, met with the appellant beforehand in order to present his views on the matter. When the four-way meeting occurred, the Governor's chief of staff requested that the appellant draft a legal opinion to resolve the uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an initial opinion, dated September 4, 1998, the appellant found that CAS was responsible for the debts amassed by its predecessor-in-interest (CHC). Shortly thereafter, the appellant did an about-face and prepared a revised opinion, dated September 14, 1998, in which he concluded that CAS was not responsible for the debts amassed by CHC. The revised opinion was accepted by the agencies involved and made CAS eligible to purchase the Hospital without the hindrance of competitive bidding. The parties closed on the direct sale three days later (although CAS and the DOH continued to debate financial issues that arose out of CAS's earlier management of the Hospital).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time that the DOH was dickering with CAS over the debt issue, the appellant was negotiating <i>sub rosa</i> to become in-house counsel for Pinnacle (a company controlled by Quir&#243;s). In those negotiations, the appellant presented Pinnacle with a wish list that included a $144,000 annual salary, a luxury car, a retirement plan, health benefits, sick leave, paid vacation, and summer camp for his children. In Quir&#243;s's words, he and De Jes&#250;s-Toro \"felt obliged\" to hire the appellant, notwithstanding the fact that his demands far exceeded what Pinnacle had budgeted for the position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 2000, while both the appellant's employment negotiations and CAS's debt negotiations were ongoing, De Jes&#250;s-Toro leased an Audi for the appellant's use. CAS not only footed the bill but also gave the appellant the use of a gasoline credit card, free of charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 2000, Pinnacle, through Quir&#243;s, formally offered the appellant the in-house counsel position. CAS and the DOH resolved their remaining financial issues the next month. The appellant started work at Pinnacle in January of 2001. The jury supportably could have found that these events were not merely coincidental but, rather, inextricably intertwined; Pinnacle managed two medical centers, including CAS's newly acquired Hospital, and these two institutions jointly paid the salaries of all Pinnacle's employees (including Pinnacle's neophyte in-house counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury indicted the appellant and four codefendants (including De Jes&#250;s-Toro, Ramos Cubano, and Ramirez Ortiz). The indictment charged the appellant with two counts of extortion (viz., one count of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion and one count of interference with commerce by extortion) and two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951, 1956. After a forty-one day trial, a petit jury found the appellant guilty across the board. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances three assignments of error. First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict on the Hobbs Act extortion charges (counts 1 and 2). Second, and relatedly, he maintains that this same dearth of evidence undermines his convictions for money laundering (counts 3 and 4) because the alleged extortion served as the underlying predicate offense on which those charges were based. Third, he posits that his convictions on all four counts must be set aside due to a fatal variance: those convictions were premised on evidence neither submitted to the grand jury nor referenced in the indictment.

To support the Hobbs Act charges in this case then, the government needed to establish that the appellant committed extortion and that his actions affected interstate or international commerce. <i>See id.</i> We consider the sufficiency of the evidence as to each such element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Extortion.</i> The Hobbs Act defines extortion as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1951(b)(2). The indictment charged the appellant with extortion both under color of official right and through inducement by economic fear. The \"color of official right\" and \"fear\" prongs provide alternative, independently sufficient grounds for finding extortion; thus, adequate proof of one obviates any need for proof of the other. <i>See United States v.

The government is not required to prove any affirmative act of inducement on the part of the corrupt official. <i>See Evans,</i> 504 U.S. at 268, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112738\"><a href=\"/opinion/112738/evans-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He received and spent these funds while the DOH's approval of CAS's proposal to acquire the Hospital hung in the balance. Given the appellant's pivotal role in the DOH's triage of hospital purchase proposals, the importance attached to his opinion by the Governor's chief of staff, and his resultant power to impact CAS's financial interests, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the money orders were intended as reciprocity for official acts, past or future &#8212; and that the appellant knew as much.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the appellant suggests that these payments were simply the fruits of his \"special relationship\" with De Jes&#250;s-Toro. That relationship, the appellant muses, inspired De Jes&#250;s-Toro to make a generous, no-strings-attached gift. We need not dwell on the inherent implausibility of such an explanation; it suffices to say that the government need not refute every alternative theory consistent with the defendant's innocence in order to defeat a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. <i>See United States v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198059\"><a href=\"/opinion/198059/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.1998). In this instance, the jury acted well within its proper province in rejecting the somewhat fanciful claim that the appellant received a considerable sum of money due to friendship with a man who just happened to be a beneficiary of his official acts. <i>Cf. United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"jurors are neither required to divorce themselves from their common sense nor to abandon the dictates of mature experience\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Since a plausible view of the evidence supports a finding that the appellant accepted the money orders in exchange for official acts, the proposition that the government failed to establish extortion under color of official right necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this finding, without more, establishes the extortion element, we note for the sake of completeness that the evidence also suffices to ground a finding of extortion induced through fear. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Hobbs Act, \"fear\" encompasses fear of economic loss, including the loss of business opportunities. <i>See Bucci,</i> 839 F.2d at 827. To establish that kind of fear, the government must show that the victim reasonably feared that noncompliance with the putative extortionist's terms would result in economic loss. <i>See United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201439\"><a href=\"/opinion/201439/united-states-v-rivera-rangel/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 483 (1st Cir.2005). The evidence in this case satisfies that criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAS made a substantial investment when it assumed the management contract for the Hospital &#8212; and it risked forfeiting both that investment and the prospect of future profits if the DOH did not endorse its purchase proposal. The appellant played a key role in the negotiating pavane and, thus, had the potential to influence (perhaps to dictate) the success or failure of CAS's business plan. A rational jury surely could have inferred that, given the circumstances, De Jes&#250;s-Toro and Quir&#243;s would have been apprehensive that noncompliance with the appellant's demands (such as his esurient terms for future employment at Pinnacle) would result in the foreclosure of a lucrative business opportunity. The plausibility of this inference was strengthened by Quir&#243;s's testimony that he had been considering a more experienced candidate for the Pinnacle in-house counsel position; that he had budgeted a lower wage for that post; but that he nonetheless \"felt obliged\" to hire the appellant at the more munificent salary that the appellant stipulated. In this regard, the jury reasonably could have thought that \"fe[eling] obliged\" was a euphemism for fearing the consequences of rejecting the appellant's demands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the events that transpired demonstrate beyond hope of contradiction that CAS's economic fear was reasonable. The appellant's initial opinion letter, which was unfavorable to CAS, attained the Secretary's endorsement. It was only when the appellant reversed field and revised his legal opinion (which otherwise would have barred any direct sale) that a pathway opened for CAS's acquisition of the Hospital. The timing amply illustrates the salience of this about-face: the parties closed on the sale of the Hospital a scant three days after the appellant issued his revised opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the appellant was guilty of extortion induced by fear of economic loss. <i>Cf. United States v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 595 (1st Cir.1992) (warning that \"[o]ne would have to believe in the Tooth Fairy to think [a particular sequence of events] merely coincidental\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Commerce.</i> In addition to establishing extortion, the government also must show that the extortionate conduct obstructed, delayed, or affected interstate or international commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a). As to this prong, the case law erects a low threshold: a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to sustain a Hobbs Act conviction. <i>See Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d at 527.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances two contentions in hopes of showing that the government failed to cross even this modest threshold. Neither contention is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's principal argument is that there was no effect on interstate commerce because the money orders that he received were purchased by De Jes&#250;s-Toro personally. Since De Jes&#250;s-Toro earned his livelihood as a physician and only practiced his profession in local hospitals, this thesis runs, an extortion of his funds could not have interfered with interstate commerce. This exercise in legal legerdemain does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While De Jes&#250;s-Toro bought the money orders, the record confirms that he first withdrew a sum equal to their cost &#8212; $35,000 &#8212; from a CAS account. He then used the appropriated funds to buy the money orders. Hence, the distinction between business and personal funds that the appellant relies on here is purely one of form, not of substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisprudence of the Hobbs Act does not recognize that kind of artificial distinction. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Devin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551278\"><a href=\"/opinion/551278/united-states-v-francis-e-devin/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 293-94 (1st Cir.1990) (finding an effect on interstate commerce when defendant had received money from the president of a corporation who, in turn, had derived the money from the coffers of the corporation &#8212; which was engaged in interstate commerce). A temporary interval of personal possession may serve to weaken the causal connection between funds and interstate commerce, but that connection remains strong enough to forge the necessary link &#8212; a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. <i>See id.</i> at 293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback argument is that the government failed to prove that any of CAS's funds entered into the stream of interstate commerce. This argument comprises little more than whistling past the graveyard. The government establishes a cognizable effect on interstate commerce if it shows that the extortionate conduct depleted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce. <i>See United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Casiano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201838\"><a href=\"/opinion/201838/united-states-v-rodriguez-casiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2005) (upholding a finding of an effect on interstate commerce where money stolen in housebreaks belonged to businesses &#8212; a hardware store and a gas station, respectively &#8212; that purchased products out of state).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That principle is determinative in the instant case. The government adduced evidence showing that the money orders the appellant accepted could be traced to a CAS account; that CAS managed, and later owned, the Hospital; and that the Hospital bought much of its equipment from the United States mainland. This evidence formed a sufficient predicate for an inference that any payments that depleted CAS's assets affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude, without serious question, that the government provided adequate proof to establish both of the elements needed to ground convictions on the Hobbs Act counts: the commission of extortion and a concomitant interference with interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Counts 3 and 4.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second claim of error stands or falls on the merits of the appellant's first claim of error. The applicable money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, imposes criminal liability on any person who, \"knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,\" engages in a financial transaction that constitutes money laundering. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1956(a)(1). In fine, the statute requires proof of the commission of some antecedent offense (the specified \"unlawful activity\"), the avails of which are then \"laundered\" by the defendant. Here, the relevant counts in the indictment (counts 3 and 4) charged the extortion as the antecedent offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seizing on this tiered statutory structure, the appellant claims, in effect, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of extortion and that, therefore, the absence of the linchpin predicate offense rendered the evidence insufficient to support his money laundering convictions. This claim is hopeless. After all, we already have rebuffed the appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in connection with the extortion charges. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Consequently, his challenge to his money laundering convictions collapses of its own weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Variance.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next complains that the verdict cannot stand on any of the four counts of conviction because it rests predominantly on facts that the government failed either to present to the grand jury or to plead in the indictment. We first sketch the background for this plaint and then address its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In responding to a question on the verdict form, the petit jury found that the offenses of conviction involved $35,000. In the appellant's view, that calculation means that the jury found him liable only for the money orders that De Jes&#250;s-Toro passed along to him. But the government did not adduce any evidence about this alleged bribe before the grand jury; and the grand jury, in turn, did not mention the money orders in the indictment. Building on this foundation, the appellant argues that his convictions rest upon a prejudicial variance, thereby violating his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though vigorously advanced, this argument lacks force. First and foremost, the fact that the jury found the appellant liable for $35,000 is by no means a conclusive indication that the money orders constituted the only evidence upon which the jury found him guilty. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 64 n. 56 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating that there is no foolproof way of telling what parts of the evidence the jury credited when it did not make specific findings on the overt acts alleged in the indictment). And even were we to assume, favorably to the appellant, the validity of his premise anent the money orders, the conclusion that he reaches would not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variance occurs \"when the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194868\"><a href=\"/opinion/194868/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 462 (1st Cir.1993). Even if a variance occurs, however, that fact alone does not suffice to displace a conviction. Rather, a variance requires that a conviction be set aside only when it is prejudicial, that is, when it affects the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See United States v. Tormos-Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580292\"><a href=\"/opinion/580292/united-states-v-jose-tormos-vega-united-states-of-america-v-juan-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span>, 1115 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Fermin Castillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495010\"><a href=\"/opinion/495010/united-states-v-jose-cristobal-fermin-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir. 1987). There is no prejudicial variance so long as an indictment provides the defendant with sufficient detail to allow him to prepare a defense, avoid unfair surprise at trial, and plead double jeopardy when appropriate. <i>See Tormos-Vega,</i> 959 F.2d at 1115. The law recognizes that the government need not lay out the whole of its proof in the indictment. <i>See United States v. Marrero-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198207\"><a href=\"/opinion/198207/united-states-v-marrero-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 773 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That brings us to the case at bar. Here, the indictment limned the nucleus of operative facts giving rise to the charges against the appellant. It not only listed some overt acts referable to the charged conspiracies (e.g., it described the $15,000 payment that the appellant received and returned,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the Audi that De Jes&#250;s-Toro leased for him, and his cushy employment arrangement with Pinnacle) but also referred to the general agreement among CAS's shareholders that \"De Jes&#250;s-Toro would take care of the payments to [the appellant].\" Taken in the ensemble, these allegations served to put the appellant on notice that any pecuniary benefit he had received from or through De Jes&#250;s-Toro might be relevant to the government's case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Innamorati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.1993) (finding no prejudicial variance when an indictment charged a defendant with conspiring to distribute drugs and the government introduced proof of two deals not listed as overt acts because the evidence fell \"squarely within the scope of th[e] alleged conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the indictment gave the appellant fair warning as to the nature of the charges that he faced and allowed him to defend intelligently against those charges. No more was exigible. Consequently, no variance (or, at the least, no prejudicial variance) occurred. <i>See Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d at 773.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and justly convicted.

In view of his subsequent receipt and retention of a larger sum, however, the jury was free to conclude that his return of the $15,000 payment may have had some other, less attractive explanation (say, a belief either that the amount was too paltry or that the source of the funds was too easily traced)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
