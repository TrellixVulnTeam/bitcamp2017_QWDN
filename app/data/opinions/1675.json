Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Lorenzo J. Palomares, with whom Lorenzo Palomares, P.S.C. was\non brief, for appellant.\n     Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Appellate\nChief), were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         April 14, 2010\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.          Defendant-appellant José Cintrón-\n\nEchautegui,     who    pleaded   guilty    to   a   charge     of    conspiracy   to\n\ndistribute controlled substances, alleges that the district court\n\nerred in calculating drug quantity and, therefore, imposed an\n\noverly harsh sentence. Discerning no error, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\n           Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the\n\nfacts    from    the     change-of-plea         colloquy,      the     presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the\n\ndisposition hearing.       See United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136,\n\n138 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n           A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto\n\nRico indicted a number of suspected participants in a notorious\n\ndrug ring known as \"Las Avispas.\" These individuals, including the\n\nappellant, were charged with conspiring to distribute controlled\n\nsubstances.     See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.\n\n           The appellant initially maintained his innocence.                 Along\n\nwith several codefendants, he went to trial on February 11, 2008.\n\nAfter five days, however, he opted out of the trial and entered a\n\nstraight   guilty      plea,     unaccompanied      by   any    plea    agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial continued as to six of his codefendants, all\n\nof whom were eventually found guilty.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f           During    his     change-of-plea       hearing,   the   prosecutor\n\nmaintained that the appellant had sold drugs for Las Avispas during\n\na four-year span from 2003 to 2007.           The appellant accepted this\n\naccount.     In addition, he admitted to possessing 255 capsules of\n\ncrack cocaine, which contained, in the aggregate, 17.53 grams of\n\ncocaine base.\n\n           In accordance with the customary routine, the district\n\ncourt directed the probation department to prepare the PSI Report.\n\nThat report, when completed, was delivered to the prosecutor, the\n\nappellant (through his counsel), and the court.                 We summarize\n\ncertain pertinent entries.\n\n           According to the PSI Report, Las Avispas purveyed an\n\nassortment    of   drugs,    including    crack    cocaine   (cocaine   base),\n\nheroin, and marijuana.       The report referenced trial testimony from\n\na cooperating witness, José Rivera-Díaz, who confirmed that Las\n\nAvispas ran two drug points, each of which operated twenty-four\n\nhours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year (with the\n\nexception of Holy Friday).\n\n           Each drug point was manned by three shifts of sellers\n\ndaily — a morning shift, an afternoon shift, and a night shift.            On\n\naverage,   each    shift    participant   would    sell   approximately    200\n\ncapsules of crack cocaine, together with other kinds of drugs,\n\nduring each morning and afternoon shift.             The night shifts were\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbusier; each night-shift vendor would sell, on average, between 700\n\nand 900 capsules of crack, along with other drugs.\n\n          The PSI Report summarized the trial testimony of a\n\nforensic scientist.     This portion of the report related that a\n\ntypical crack cocaine capsule sold by Las Avispas contained, on\n\naverage, .075 grams of cocaine base.             Conservatively assuming\n\naverage sales of 1,000 capsules per day, the drug ring had annual\n\nsales of 27.3 kilograms of cocaine base.           Thus, during its four\n\nyears of operations, the drug ring sold an estimated total of 109.2\n\nkilograms of cocaine base.\n\n          The   PSI   Report   further   noted     that,   at    trial,   the\n\nscientist had been cross-examined about the methodology used to\n\ndetermine the per-capsule amount of cocaine base.              The scientist\n\nresponded that sampling was the method he had used, and that the\n\nsamples used were capsules actually seized from the Las Avispas\n\ndrug points.    In the scientist's opinion, this sampling permitted\n\na reasoned determination of an average drug weight per capsule.\n\n          The   PSI   Report   indicated,   too,    that   a    confidential\n\ninformant (CI) had identified the appellant as a seller of drugs\n\nfor Las Avispas.   The CI stated that the appellant was \"usually\" at\n\none of the drug points, \"dealing drugs\" with two other members of\n\nthe ring (whom he named).       Both of these men had been indicted\n\nalongside the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           The PSI Report contained more information from the CI\n\nabout the appellant.      For example, the CI identified the appellant\n\nas having stored both guns and drugs for Las Avispas.             Moreover,\n\nthe CI said that, on one occasion, the appellant had warned him\n\n(the CI) that the police were en route to one of the drug points.\n\n           The PSI Report went into some detail anent possible\n\nsentencing options.      Among other things, the probation department\n\nrecommended a series of sentencing calculations premised on the\n\nNovember 2007 edition of the guidelines (which controls here).            It\n\nsuggested a base offense level of 38, premised on a drug quantity\n\nof more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. See USSG §2D1.1(a)(5),\n\n(c)(1).    It arrived at a total offense level of 40 after applying\n\nvarious enhancing and mitigating adjustments, none of which is\n\ncontroverted here.       Placing the appellant in criminal history\n\ncategory   I,    the   probation   department    envisioned   a   guideline\n\nsentencing range (GSR) of 292-365 months.           See id. Ch. 5, Pt. A\n\n(sentencing table).\n\n           The    appellant   interposed    a   timely   objection   to   the\n\nproposed drug quantity determination and, by fair implication, to\n\nthe calculations employed therein.         He argued that the PSI Report\n\nrested this determination on unreliable computations and, thus,\n\nexaggerated his role in the conspiracy.1\n\n\n     1\n       The appellant initially objected to an upward adjustment for\nuse of a weapon in connection with a drug-trafficking offense, USSG\n§2D1.1(b)(1), but he waived this objection at the disposition\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nMay 20, 2008.    The appellant renewed his objection to the proposed\n\ndrug quantity.    The government endorsed it.   The court concluded\n\nthat the estimates for both the number of capsules sold and the\n\nper-capsule drug weight were accurate.      Nevertheless, the court\n\ndecided to use a set of related assumptions even \"more favorable to\n\nthe [appellant]\": it assumed that the appellant worked only daytime\n\nshifts; that he worked only three shifts a week; and that he sold\n\nan average of 200 capsules per shift.\n\n           Based on these assumptions, the court attributed 2.3\n\nkilograms of cocaine base per year to the appellant.    Taking into\n\naccount the four-year life of the conspiracy, the court attributed\n\na total drug quantity of 9.2 kilograms of crack to the appellant.2\n\nAll of these findings were grounded in the recitals contained in\n\nthe PSI Report.\n\n           With the drug quantity contretemps resolved, the court\n\nproceeded to sentence the appellant to a 292-month incarcerative\n\nterm (the low end of the GSR).    This timely appeal followed.\n\n\nhearing.\n     2\n       The transcript of the disposition hearing lists this\nquantity as 94.2 kilograms. This is obviously a scrivener's error;\nthe calculations elucidated by the court lead inexorably to a\nquantity of 9.2 kilograms. Thus, we accept the latter figure. Cf.\nUnited States v. Zapata, 1 F.3d 46, 47 n.2 (1st Cir. 1993)\n(explaining that when a sentencing court refers to the wrong\nedition of the guidelines but its \"calculations faithfully track\nthe [correct] version,\" we will disregard the obvious slip of the\ntongue).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f              The appellant advances two principal claims of error.3\n\nFirst, he argues that the sentencing court failed to make an\n\nindividualized finding of drug quantity.        Second, he argues that,\n\nin all events, the drug quantity determination was not supported by\n\ncompetent evidence.      We deal with these claims sequentially.\n\n              We begin with the nature of the sentencing court's drug\n\nquantity determination.      The appellant argues that the court made\n\na   conspiracy-wide    determination   rather   than   an   individualized\n\ndetermination.       Because the question of whether the district\n\ncourt's drug quantity determination was based on an individualized\n\ndetermination or not presents a question of law, our review is de\n\nnovo.       See United States v. Colón-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 102 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       If, however, the district court has engaged in an\n\nindividualized determination, our review is for clear error.\n\n              Sentences in drug cases are largely driven by the amount\n\nand type of drugs involved.      United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1196-97 (1st Cir. 1993).     When sentencing a participant in a\n\n\n\n        3\n       The appellant also argues that the district court erred in\nusing a special verdict form that was completed and returned by the\njury.   He says, correctly, that by the time the verdict was\nreturned, he had pleaded guilty and, therefore, was not bound by\nthe verdict. But this argument is belied by the record. While the\ncourt alluded to the special verdict form in passing, the appellant\nis not mentioned on it. Moreover, the record does not indicate\nthat the court used either the form or the information contained\ntherein in constructing the appellant's sentence.      Finally, the\nconspiracy-wide drug quantity shown on the special verdict form —\n\"[f]ifty (50) grams or more\" — bears no real relationship to the\ncourt's drug quantity determination vis-à-vis the appellant.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fdrug-trafficking      conspiracy,         the    district   court   must    make    an\n\nindividualized       finding        concerning      the     quantity    of    drugs\n\nattributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the offender.4\n\nColón-Solis, 354 F.3d at 103.             In this case the sentencing court —\n\ncontrary to the appellant's allegation — recognized that rule and\n\ncomplied with it. Although the court mentioned the conspiracy-wide\n\ndrug quantity — that figure was certainly relevant as a check on\n\nthe integers used in determining the amount of drugs attributable\n\nto the appellant — it clearly made an individualized determination.\n\nSpecifically, the court attributed 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to\n\nthe appellant personally.            This individualized determination, in\n\nturn, guided the court in fixing the appellant's base offense level\n\n(38).       See USSG §2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1).             Given the state of the\n\nrecord, the appellant's first claim of error fizzles.\n\n              This   brings    us    to    the    appellant's   claim      that    the\n\nsentencing court's drug quantity determination was insupportable.\n\nThe appellant advances three rationales in service of this claim.\n\n              First, the appellant suggests that the court erred by\n\nsentencing him on the basis of a drug quantity beyond that which he\n\nacknowledged at the change-of-plea hearing.                 This suggestion does\n\nnot accurately reflect the law.\n\n\n        4\n       There is an exception to this paradigm for cases in which\nthe defendant's sentence is controlled by a mandatory minimum term\nof imprisonment required by an applicable statute.      See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2003). This\nis not such a case.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f           Under the guidelines, a defendant may be held responsible\n\nat   sentencing    for   relevant   conduct,   including     \"all   acts   and\n\nomissions committed . . . by the defendant.\"         USSG §1B1.3(a)(1)(A);\n\nsee United States v. Ortiz-Torres, 449 F.3d 61, 78-79 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Relevant conduct for which the defendant may be sentenced\n\nalso includes, \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity . . . all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of\n\nothers in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\"\n\nUSSG   §1B1.3(a)(1)(B).       Thus,    relevant    conduct   beyond   what   a\n\ndefendant may admit during a plea colloquy may factor into the\n\nsentencing calculus. See Ortiz-Torres, 449 F.3d at 78-80 (upholding\n\nuse of drug quantity greater than that admitted during change-of-\n\nplea hearing).\n\n           This principle controls here.          The appellant's admission\n\nduring the change-of-plea colloquy to possessing 17.53 grams of\n\ncocaine base served primarily as an explicit factual basis for his\n\nguilty plea.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).       It did not serve as\n\na ceiling on the amount of drugs that could properly be attributed\n\nto him for sentencing purposes.         \"As an admitted participant in a\n\ndrug trafficking conspiracy, [the appellant] is responsible . . .\n\nfor drugs he himself sold, transported, or negotiated, as well as\n\nfor drug quantities attributable to others that are reasonably\n\nforeseeable to him . . . .\"     Ortiz-Torres, 449 F.3d at 78-79.           This\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fis true    even if the relevant conduct is uncharged, see USSG\n\n§1B1.3(a); Santos, 357 F.3d at 140, or unconfessed.\n\n            Second,   the   appellant    contests   the   quality   of   the\n\nevidence in the sentencing record.       In particular, he asserts that\n\nhis inability to cross-examine the witnesses whose testimony was\n\nrecounted in the PSI Report requires vacation of his sentence. This\n\nassertion does not hold water.\n\n            The evidentiary requirements that obtain at sentencing\n\nare considerably less rigorous than those that obtain in criminal\n\ntrials. See United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    At sentencing, the court \"may consider relevant information\n\nwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence\n\napplicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient\n\nindicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"           United\n\nStates v. Zapata, 589 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting USSG\n\n§6A1.3(a)).\n\n            In addition, a sentencing court has wide discretion to\n\ndecide whether particular evidence is sufficiently reliable to be\n\nused at sentencing.    United States v. Green, 426 F.3d 64, 66 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287.              Under this generous\n\nformulation, the court may rely upon \"virtually any dependable\n\ninformation.\"    United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    This includes information that has never been subjected to\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcross-examination.     See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 28\n\n(1st Cir. 1997); Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287. Similarly, a sentencing\n\ncourt generally may rely upon information contained in a presentence\n\nreport.   See, e.g., United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (en banc); United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    These    tenets   are   fully   applicable   to    drug    quantity\n\ndeterminations.     See, e.g., Zapata, 589 F.3d at 485; United States\n\nv. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984, 989 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           That ends this aspect of our inquiry. We previously have\n\nheld that \"for sentencing purposes the court may rely upon evidence\n\nadduced at a coconspirator's trial as long as the defendant receives\n\nnotice prior to its use and has the opportunity to challenge its\n\nreliability.\"     Cruz, 120 F.3d at 2.    Here, the challenged evidence\n\ncame from witnesses who testified at the trial, and the PSI Report\n\ngave ample notice to the appellant of both the existence and the\n\npotential utility of this evidence.       Under these circumstances, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in using this evidence at sentencing.\n\nSee Brewster, 127 F.3d at 28 (stating that facts contained in a\n\npresentence report \"usually are deemed reliable enough to be used\n\nfor   sentencing    purposes\");    Zuleta-Alvarez,     922    F.2d    at   37\n\n(explaining that statements made under oath have \"strong indicia of\n\nreliability\").\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f               Third,    and     lastly,       the   appellant   contends     that   the\n\nsentencing court's drug quantity determination was faulty.                            We\n\nreject this contention.\n\n               The sentencing court must determine drug quantity only by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.                 See United States v. Rodríguez,\n\n525     F.3d    85,    107   (1st       Cir.    2008).       A   sentencing    court's\n\ndetermination of drug quantity is a finding of fact and, as such,\n\nwill be upheld on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. Id. Clear\n\nerror    will    be     found    only    when,       upon   whole-record-review,      an\n\ninquiring court \"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake\n\nhas been made.\" Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n               The court below did not clearly err in making its drug\n\nquantity determination.             A finding of drug quantity need not be\n\nexact so long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate\n\nof actual quantity.             See, e.g., Santos, 357 F.3d at 141; United\n\nStates v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 2003).                   In making such\n\na reasoned estimate, the court is entitled to draw reasonable\n\ninferences from information contained in the sentencing record. See\n\nSantos, 357 F.3d at 141.\n\n               In this instance, the court derived its drug quantity\n\ndetermination by making plausible extrapolations from the available\n\ninformation.          The court used the average drug weight per capsule\n\nsuggested by the scientific evidence and the average drug sales per\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fshift suggested by the cooperating witness to arrive at a sensible\n\nstarting point.     This starting point was, in itself, favorable to\n\nthe appellant because it left out of the equation drugs other than\n\ncrack cocaine (e.g., heroin, marijuana) routinely marketed by Las\n\nAvispas at the two drug points.\n\n            The court then took into account the appellant's four-\n\nyear tenure with the drug ring and attributed a quantity of drugs\n\nto him based on two assumptions: that the appellant worked only\n\nthree shifts per week and that all of these were daytime shifts.\n\nThese assumptions, too, were favorable to the appellant.         The CI\n\nstated that the appellant was \"usually\" at one of the drug points,\n\ntoiling as a seller.    Three shifts per week seems to understate the\n\nregularity of his presence.

Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Appellate Chief), were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before Lynch, Chief Judge, Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant José Cintrón-Echautegui, who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, alleges that the district court erred in calculating drug quantity and, therefore, imposed an overly harsh sentence. Discerning no error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santos,</i> 357 F.3d 136, 138 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico indicted a number of suspected participants in a notorious drug ring known as \"Las Avispas.\" These individuals, including the appellant, were charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> The appellant initially maintained his innocence. Along with several codefendants, he went to trial on February 11, 2008. After five days, however, he opted out of the trial and entered a straight guilty plea, unaccompanied by any plea agreement. Meanwhile, the trial continued as to six of his codefendants, all of whom were eventually found guilty.</p>\n<p>During his change-of-plea hearing, the prosecutor maintained that the appellant had sold drugs for Las Avispas during a four-year span from 2003 to 2007. The appellant accepted this account. In addition, he admitted to possessing 255 capsules of crack cocaine, which contained, in the aggregate, 17.53 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the customary routine, the district court directed the probation department to prepare the PSI Report. That report, when completed, was delivered to the prosecutor, the appellant (through his counsel), and the court. We summarize certain pertinent entries.</p>\n<p>According to the PSI Report, Las Avispas purveyed an assortment of drugs, including crack cocaine (cocaine base), heroin, and marijuana. The report referenced trial testimony from a cooperating witness, José Rivera-Díaz, who confirmed that Las Avispas ran two drug points, each of which operated twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year (with the exception of Holy Friday).</p>\n<p>Each drug point was manned by three shifts of sellers dailya morning shift, an afternoon shift, and a night shift. On average, each shift participant would sell approximately 200 capsules of crack cocaine, together with other kinds of drugs, during each morning and afternoon shift. The night shifts were busier; each night-shift vendor would sell, on average, between 700 and 900 capsules of crack, along with other drugs.</p>\n<p>The PSI Report summarized the trial testimony of a forensic scientist. This portion of the report related that a typical crack cocaine capsule sold by Las Avispas contained, on average, .075 grams of cocaine base. Conservatively assuming average sales of 1,000 capsules per day, the drug ring had annual sales of 27.3 kilograms of cocaine base. Thus, during its four years of operations, the drug ring sold an estimated total of 109.2 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>The PSI Report further noted that, at trial, the scientist had been cross-examined about the methodology used to determine the per-capsule amount of cocaine base. The scientist responded that sampling was the method he had used, and that the samples used were capsules actually seized from the Las Avispas drug points. In the scientist's opinion, this sampling permitted a reasoned determination of an average drug weight per capsule.</p>\n<p>The PSI Report indicated, too, that a confidential informant (CI) had identified the appellant as a seller of drugs for Las Avispas. The CI stated that the appellant was \"usually\" at one of the drug points, \"dealing drugs\" with two other members of the ring (whom he named). Both of these men had been indicted alongside the appellant.</p>\n<p>The PSI Report contained more information from the CI about the appellant. For example, the CI identified the appellant as having stored both guns and drugs for Las Avispas. Moreover, the CI said that, on one occasion, the appellant had warned him (the CI) that the police were en route to one of the drug points.</p>\n<p>The PSI Report went into some detail anent possible sentencing options. Among other things, the probation department recommended a series of sentencing calculations premised on the November 2007 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> edition of the guidelines (which controls here). It suggested a base offense level of 38, premised on a drug quantity of more than 4 .5 kilograms of cocaine base. <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1). It arrived at a total offense level of 40 after applying various enhancing and mitigating adjustments, none of which is controverted here. Placing the appellant in criminal history category I, the probation department envisioned a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 292-365 months. <i>See id.</i> Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n<p>The appellant interposed a timely objection to the proposed drug quantity determination and, by fair implication, to the calculations employed therein. He argued that the PSI Report rested this determination on unreliable computations and, thus, exaggerated his role in the conspiracy.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court convened the disposition hearing on May 20, 2008. The appellant renewed his objection to the proposed drug quantity. The government endorsed it. The court concluded that the estimates for both the number of capsules sold and the per-capsule drug weight were accurate. Nevertheless, the court decided to use a set of related assumptions even \"more favorable to the [appellant]\": it assumed that the appellant worked only daytime shifts; that he worked only three shifts a week; and that he sold an average of 200 capsules per shift.</p>\n<p>Based on these assumptions, the court attributed 2.3 kilograms of cocaine base per year to the appellant. Taking into account the four-year life of the conspiracy, the court attributed a total drug quantity of 9.2 kilograms of crack to the appellant.<sup>[2]</sup> All of these findings were grounded in the recitals contained in the PSI Report.</p>\n<p>With the drug quantity contretemps resolved, the court proceeded to sentence the appellant to a 292-month incarcerative term (the low end of the GSR). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The appellant advances two principal claims of error.<sup>[3]</sup> First, he argues that the sentencing court failed to make an individualized finding of drug quantity. Second, he argues that, in all events, the drug quantity determination was not supported by competent evidence. We deal with these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p>We begin with the nature of the sentencing court's drug quantity determination. The appellant argues that the court made a conspiracy-wide determination rather than an individualized determination. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Because the question of whether the district court's drug quantity determination was based on an individualized determination or not presents a question of law, our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Colón-Solis,</i> 354 F.3d 101, 102 (1st Cir.2004). If, however, the district court has engaged in an individualized determination, our review is for clear error.</p>\n<p>Sentences in drug cases are largely driven by the amount and type of drugs involved. <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1993). When sentencing a participant in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the district court must make an individualized finding concerning the quantity of drugs attributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the offender.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Colón-Solis,</i> 354 F.3d at 103. In this case the sentencing courtcontrary to the appellant's allegationrecognized that rule and complied with it. Although the court mentioned the conspiracy-wide drug quantitythat figure was certainly relevant as a check on the integers used in determining the amount of drugs attributable to the appellantit clearly made an individualized determination. Specifically, the court attributed 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant personally. This individualized determination, in turn, guided the court in fixing the appellant's base offense level (38). <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1). Given the state of the record, the appellant's first claim of error fizzles.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the appellant's claim that the sentencing court's drug quantity determination was insupportable. The appellant advances three rationales in service of this claim.</p>\n<p>First, the appellant suggests that the court erred by sentencing him on the basis of a drug quantity beyond that which he acknowledged at the change-of-plea hearing. This suggestion does not accurately reflect the law.</p>\n<p>Under the guidelines, a defendant may be held responsible at sentencing for relevant conduct, including \"all acts and omissions committed ... by the defendant.\" USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d 61, 78-79 (1st Cir.2006). Relevant conduct for which the defendant may be sentenced also includes, \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ... all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). Thus, relevant conduct beyond what a defendant may admit during a plea colloquy may factor into the sentencing calculus. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 78-80 (upholding use of drug quantity greater than that admitted during change-of-plea hearing).</p>\n<p>This principle controls here. The appellant's admission during the change-of-plea colloquy to possessing 17.53 grams of cocaine base served primarily as an explicit factual basis for his guilty plea. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). It did not serve as a ceiling on the amount of drugs that could properly be attributed to him for sentencing purposes. \"As an admitted participant in a drug trafficking conspiracy, [the appellant] is responsible ... for drugs he himself sold, transported, or negotiated, as well as for drug quantities attributable to others that are reasonably foreseeable to him....\" <i>Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 78-79. This is true even if the relevant conduct is uncharged, <i>see</i> USSG <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> § 1B1.3(a); <i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 140, or unconfessed.</p>\n<p>Second, the appellant contests the quality of the evidence in the sentencing record. In particular, he asserts that his inability to cross-examine the witnesses whose testimony was recounted in the PSI Report requires vacation of his sentence. This assertion does not hold water.</p>\n<p>The evidentiary requirements that obtain at sentencing are considerably less rigorous than those that obtain in criminal trials. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez,</i> 922 F.2d 33, 36 (1st Cir.1990). At sentencing, the court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 589 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting USSG § 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n<p>In addition, a sentencing court has wide discretion to decide whether particular evidence is sufficiently reliable to be used at sentencing. <i>United States v. Green,</i> 426 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287. Under this generous formulation, the court may rely upon \"virtually any dependable information.\" <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 110 (1st Cir.1990). This includes information that has never been subjected to cross-examination. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287. Similarly, a sentencing court generally may rely upon information contained in a presentence report. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc); <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993). These tenets are fully applicable to drug quantity determinations. <i>See, e.g., Zapata,</i> 589 F.3d at 485; <i>United States v. Scalia,</i> 993 F.2d 984, 989 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of our inquiry. We previously have held that \"for sentencing purposes the court may rely upon evidence adduced at a coconspirator's trial as long as the defendant receives notice prior to its use and has the opportunity to challenge its reliability.\" <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 2. Here, the challenged evidence came from witnesses who testified at the trial, and the PSI Report gave ample notice to the appellant of both the existence and the potential utility of this evidence. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in using this evidence at sentencing. <i>See </i><i>Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d at 28 (stating that facts contained in a presentence report \"usually are deemed reliable enough to be used for sentencing purposes\"); <i>Zuleta-Alvarez,</i> 922 F.2d at 37 (explaining that statements made under oath have \"strong indicia of reliability\").</p>\n<p>Third, and lastly, the appellant contends that the sentencing court's drug quantity determination was faulty. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p>The sentencing court must determine drug quantity only by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d 85, 107 (1st Cir.2008). A sentencing court's determination of drug quantity is a finding of fact and, as such, will be upheld on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>Id.</i> Clear error will be found only when, upon whole-record-review, an inquiring court \"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,</i> 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The court below did not clearly err in making its drug quantity determination. A finding of drug quantity need not be exact so long as the approximation represents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> a reasoned estimate of actual quantity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 141; <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d 84, 88 (1st Cir.2003). In making such a reasoned estimate, the court is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from information contained in the sentencing record. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 141.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the court derived its drug quantity determination by making plausible extrapolations from the available information. The court used the average drug weight per capsule suggested by the scientific evidence and the average drug sales per shift suggested by the cooperating witness to arrive at a sensible starting point. This starting point was, in itself, favorable to the appellant because it left out of the equation drugs other than crack cocaine (e.g., heroin, marijuana) routinely marketed by Las Avispas at the two drug points.</p>\n<p>The court then took into account the appellant's four-year tenure with the drug ring and attributed a quantity of drugs to him based on two assumptions: that the appellant worked only three shifts per week and that all of these were daytime shifts. These assumptions, too, were favorable to the appellant. The CI stated that the appellant was \"usually\" at one of the drug points, toiling as a seller. Three shifts per week seems to understate the regularity of his presence. Similarly, by assuming that the appellant worked only daytime shifts, the court eschewed any use of the greater sales volumes associated with the night shifts.</p>\n<p>Using this methodology, the court attributed 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant.<sup>[5]</sup> The court stated that in making these findings it had taken a \"conservative\" view of the evidence. We agree. For aught that appears, the court took reasonable steps to estimate the drug quantity attributable to the appellant and, in doing so, made modest and defensible assumptions. In fine, the court followed the admonition that, in such matters, it should \"err on the side of caution.\" <i>Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d at 113. We discern no clear error.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the appellant's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The appellant initially objected to an upward adjustment for use of a weapon in connection with a drug-trafficking offense, USSG § 2D1.1(b)(1), but he waived this objection at the disposition hearing.</p>\n<p>[2]  The transcript of the disposition hearing lists this quantity as 94.2 kilograms. This is obviously a scrivener's error; the calculations elucidated by the court lead inexorably to a quantity of 9.2 kilograms. Thus, we accept the latter figure. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 1 F.3d 46, 47 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that when a sentencing court refers to the wrong edition of the guidelines but its \"calculations faithfully track the [correct] version,\" we will disregard the obvious slip of the tongue).</p>\n<p>[3]  The appellant also argues that the district court erred in using a special verdict form that was completed and returned by the jury. He says, correctly, that by the time the verdict was returned, he had pleaded guilty and, therefore, was not bound by the verdict. But this argument is belied by the record. While the court alluded to the special verdict form in passing, the appellant is not mentioned on it. Moreover, the record does not indicate that the court used either the form or the information contained therein in constructing the appellant's sentence. Finally, the conspiracy-wide drug quantity shown on the special verdict form\"[f]ifty (50) grams or more\" bears no real relationship to the court's drug quantity determination vis-à-vis the appellant.</p>\n<p>[4]  There is an exception to this paradigm for cases in which the defendant's sentence is controlled by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment required by an applicable statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Goodine,</i> 326 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir.2003). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p>[5]  The court multiplied three shifts per week by 200 capsules per shift by .075 grams of cocaine base per capsule, resulting in 2.3 kilograms per year (rounded down). Multiplying by his four-year participation in the conspiracy, the court attributed a total of 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant.</p>\n\n</div>",

Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1993). When sentencing a participant in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the district court must make an individualized finding concerning the quantity of drugs attributable to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the offender.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Colón-Solis,</i> 354 F.3d at 103. In this case the sentencing courtcontrary to the appellant's allegationrecognized that rule and complied with it. Although the court mentioned the conspiracy-wide drug quantitythat figure was certainly relevant as a check on the integers used in determining the amount of drugs attributable to the appellantit clearly made an individualized determination. Specifically, the court attributed 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant personally. This individualized determination, in turn, guided the court in fixing the appellant's base offense level (38). <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(1). Given the state of the record, the appellant's first claim of error fizzles.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the appellant's claim that the sentencing court's drug quantity determination was insupportable. The appellant advances three rationales in service of this claim.</p>\n<p>First, the appellant suggests that the court erred by sentencing him on the basis of a drug quantity beyond that which he acknowledged at the change-of-plea hearing. This suggestion does not accurately reflect the law.</p>\n<p>Under the guidelines, a defendant may be held responsible at sentencing for relevant conduct, including \"all acts and omissions committed ... by the defendant.\" USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A); <i>see </i><i>United States v. Ortiz-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794461\"><a href=\"/opinion/794461/united-states-v-orlando-ortiz-torres-aka-landy-aka-orlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 78-79 (1st Cir.2006). Relevant conduct for which the defendant may be sentenced also includes, \"in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ... all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\" USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). Thus, relevant conduct beyond what a defendant may admit during a plea colloquy may factor into the sentencing calculus. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 78-80 (upholding use of drug quantity greater than that admitted during change-of-plea hearing).</p>\n<p>This principle controls here. The appellant's admission during the change-of-plea colloquy to possessing 17.53 grams of cocaine base served primarily as an explicit factual basis for his guilty plea. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). It did not serve as a ceiling on the amount of drugs that could properly be attributed to him for sentencing purposes. \"As an admitted participant in a drug trafficking conspiracy, [the appellant] is responsible ... for drugs he himself sold, transported, or negotiated, as well as for drug quantities attributable to others that are reasonably foreseeable to him....\" <i>Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 78-79. This is true even if the relevant conduct is uncharged, <i>see</i> USSG <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> § 1B1.3(a); <i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 140, or unconfessed.</p>\n<p>Second, the appellant contests the quality of the evidence in the sentencing record. In particular, he asserts that his inability to cross-examine the witnesses whose testimony was recounted in the PSI Report requires vacation of his sentence. This assertion does not hold water.</p>\n<p>The evidentiary requirements that obtain at sentencing are considerably less rigorous than those that obtain in criminal trials. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Tardiff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553331\"><a href=\"/opinion/553331/united-states-v-john-jairo-zuleta-alvarez-aka-john-zuleta-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1990). At sentencing, the court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></span>, 485 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting USSG § 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n<p>In addition, a sentencing court has wide discretion to decide whether particular evidence is sufficiently reliable to be used at sentencing. <i>United States v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201860\"><a href=\"/opinion/201860/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287. Under this generous formulation, the court may rely upon \"virtually any dependable information.\" <i>United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1990). This includes information that has never been subjected to cross-examination. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Tardiff,</i> 969 F.2d at 1287. Similarly, a sentencing court generally may rely upon information contained in a presentence report. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc); <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 872 (1st Cir.1993). These tenets are fully applicable to drug quantity determinations. <i>See, e.g., Zapata,</i> 589 F.3d at 485; <i>United States v. Scalia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607107\"><a href=\"/opinion/607107/united-states-v-rickie-albert-scalia/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 989 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of our inquiry. We previously have held that \"for sentencing purposes the court may rely upon evidence adduced at a coconspirator's trial as long as the defendant receives notice prior to its use and has the opportunity to challenge its reliability.\" <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 2. Here, the challenged evidence came from witnesses who testified at the trial, and the PSI Report gave ample notice to the appellant of both the existence and the potential utility of this evidence. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in using this evidence at sentencing. <i>See </i><i>Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d at 28 (stating that facts contained in a presentence report \"usually are deemed reliable enough to be used for sentencing purposes\"); <i>Zuleta-Alvarez,</i> 922 F.2d at 37 (explaining that statements made under oath have \"strong indicia of reliability\").</p>\n<p>Third, and lastly, the appellant contends that the sentencing court's drug quantity determination was faulty. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p>The sentencing court must determine drug quantity only by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 107 (1st Cir.2008). A sentencing court's determination of drug quantity is a finding of fact and, as such, will be upheld on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>Id.</i> Clear error will be found only when, upon whole-record-review, an inquiring court \"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>The court below did not clearly err in making its drug quantity determination. A finding of drug quantity need not be exact so long as the approximation represents <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> a reasoned estimate of actual quantity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 141; <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784542\"><a href=\"/opinion/784542/united-states-v-rafael-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.2003). In making such a reasoned estimate, the court is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from information contained in the sentencing record. <i>See </i><i>Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 141.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the court derived its drug quantity determination by making plausible extrapolations from the available information. The court used the average drug weight per capsule suggested by the scientific evidence and the average drug sales per shift suggested by the cooperating witness to arrive at a sensible starting point. This starting point was, in itself, favorable to the appellant because it left out of the equation drugs other than crack cocaine (e.g., heroin, marijuana) routinely marketed by Las Avispas at the two drug points.</p>\n<p>The court then took into account the appellant's four-year tenure with the drug ring and attributed a quantity of drugs to him based on two assumptions: that the appellant worked only three shifts per week and that all of these were daytime shifts. These assumptions, too, were favorable to the appellant. The CI stated that the appellant was \"usually\" at one of the drug points, toiling as a seller. Three shifts per week seems to understate the regularity of his presence. Similarly, by assuming that the appellant worked only daytime shifts, the court eschewed any use of the greater sales volumes associated with the night shifts.</p>\n<p>Using this methodology, the court attributed 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant.<sup>[5]</sup> The court stated that in making these findings it had taken a \"conservative\" view of the evidence. We agree. For aught that appears, the court took reasonable steps to estimate the drug quantity attributable to the appellant and, in doing so, made modest and defensible assumptions. In fine, the court followed the admonition that, in such matters, it should \"err on the side of caution.\" <i>Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d at 113. We discern no clear error.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the appellant's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The appellant initially objected to an upward adjustment for use of a weapon in connection with a drug-trafficking offense, USSG § 2D1.1(b)(1), but he waived this objection at the disposition hearing.</p>\n<p>[2]  The transcript of the disposition hearing lists this quantity as 94.2 kilograms. This is obviously a scrivener's error; the calculations elucidated by the court lead inexorably to a quantity of 9.2 kilograms. Thus, we accept the latter figure. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194834\"><a href=\"/opinion/194834/united-states-v-zapata-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that when a sentencing court refers to the wrong edition of the guidelines but its \"calculations faithfully track the [correct] version,\" we will disregard the obvious slip of the tongue).</p>\n<p>[3]  The appellant also argues that the district court erred in using a special verdict form that was completed and returned by the jury. He says, correctly, that by the time the verdict was returned, he had pleaded guilty and, therefore, was not bound by the verdict. But this argument is belied by the record. While the court alluded to the special verdict form in passing, the appellant is not mentioned on it. Moreover, the record does not indicate that the court used either the form or the information contained therein in constructing the appellant's sentence. Finally, the conspiracy-wide drug quantity shown on the special verdict form\"[f]ifty (50) grams or more\" bears no real relationship to the court's drug quantity determination vis-à-vis the appellant.</p>\n<p>[4]  There is an exception to this paradigm for cases in which the defendant's sentence is controlled by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment required by an applicable statute. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Goodine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781604\"><a href=\"/opinion/781604/united-states-v-brian-goodine-aka-dwayne-goodine/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 32-33 (1st Cir.2003). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p>[5]  The court multiplied three shifts per week by 200 capsules per shift by .075 grams of cocaine base per capsule, resulting in 2.3 kilograms per year (rounded down). Multiplying by his four-year participation in the conspiracy, the court attributed a total of 9.2 kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant.</p>\n\n</div>",
