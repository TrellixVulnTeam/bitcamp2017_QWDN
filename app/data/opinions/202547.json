Jorge   A.   Vázquez-Rivera\n\n(\"Vázquez\") was convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute\n\ncocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.                    The district court\n\nsentenced Vázquez to 210 months in prison.              Vázquez appealed, and\n\nwe remanded his case for re-sentencing in accordance with United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).           United States v. Vázquez-\n\nRivera, 407 F.3d 476 (1st Cir. 2005).                On remand, the district\n\ncourt again sentenced Vázquez to 210 months in prison. Vázquez now\n\nappeals this sentence.     After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n           On June 16, 1999, Vázquez and four other persons were\n\nindicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.                   Vázquez\n\nvoluntarily surrendered to the police on July 28, 1999.                    All of\n\nVázquez's co-defendants pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and\n\nreceived   sentences    ranging    from    24   to    120    months   in   prison.\n\nVázquez contested the charges against him.                   At trial, various\n\nprosecution witnesses testified as to the amounts of cocaine which\n\nthey had sold or observed being sold to Vázquez.                  Witnesses also\n\ntestified as to the presence of weapons at the drug point that\n\nVázquez administered. After a jury trial, Vázquez was convicted on\n\nthe sole count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.                    The court\n\nsentenced Vázquez to 210 months in prison based, in part, on the\n\nmandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Vázquez appealed his conviction and his sentence to this\n\nCourt.   We affirmed Vázquez's conviction, but remanded his case to\n\nthe district court for resentencing on the ground that his original\n\nsentence was pronounced in violation of Booker.    Vázquez-Rivera,\n\n407 F.3d 476.\n\n           Prior to resentencing, Vázquez submitted a sentencing\n\nmemorandum to the district court.     In the memorandum, he argued\n\nthat the evidence supported neither the drug quantity that the pre-\n\nsentence report attributed to him nor the finding in the pre-\n\nsentence report that he could have foreseen the involvement of a\n\nweapon in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.       Vázquez also\n\nargued that the court should deviate from the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange to reduce sentencing disparities between him and his co-\n\ndefendants.     Lastly, Vázquez suggested that the nature of his\n\noffense and his personal characteristics warranted a sentence below\n\nthe Guidelines range.\n\n           The court held a sentencing hearing for Vázquez on\n\nSeptember 30, 2005.   During the hearing, the court stated:\n\n           We are not in agreement with the grounds put\n           forth whereby we should depart from a\n           Guidelines sentence in this case.     Let me\n           state for the record that this court, this\n           Judge, that it will generally heed to the\n           Guidelines in imposing criminal punishment.\n           No doubt some criminal defendants will be\n           disappointed by this result, yet in the long\n           run such an approach may be the best way to\n           develop a fair and consistent sentencing\n           scheme around the country for the benefit of\n           defendants, victims and the public.      The\n\n                                -3-\n\f          Congressional view of how to structure that\n          sentencing will surely be informed by how\n          judges conform to the new advisory guideline\n          system.    If that discretion is exercised\n          responsibly Congress may be inclined to give\n          judges greater flexibility under a new\n          sentencing system. On the other hand if that\n          discretion is abused by sentences that thwart\n          Congressional objectives, Congress has ample\n          reason to deny us that flexibility.        The\n          course, in my opinion today, is to faithfully\n          implement    the     Congressional    purposes\n          underlying the sentences format by following\n          the Guidelines in all but unusual cases.     I\n          find that this is not an unusual case and that\n          the   application   of   the  Guidelines   are\n          reasonable in this case.\n\nThe court then sentenced Vázquez to 210 months in prison.       Vázquez\n\nnow appeals from this sentence.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n          Vázquez contests his sentence on two grounds.          First,\n\nVázquez argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to\n\nsupport various aspects of his sentence.       Second, Vázquez contends\n\nthat his sentence is procedurally defective because the sentencing\n\ncourt   failed    to   adequately    explain   his   sentence   and   is\n\nsubstantively unreasonable because the court gave improper weight\n\nto the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n          A.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Vázquez's first argument is that the evidence presented\n\nat trial was insufficient to support either the individualized drug\n\nquantity or the involvement of weapons that were used to determine\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhis sentence.1   We review a sentencing court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error and their conclusions of law de novo.             United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 82 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                      1.   Drug Quantity\n\n            Vázquez contends that the court erred in calculating the\n\nquantity of drugs personally attributable to him for sentencing\n\npurposes.    In Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), we held that:\n\n            [o]nce the jury has determined that the\n            conspiracy involved a type and quantity of\n            drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above\n            the default statutory maximum and has found a\n            particular defendant guilty of participation\n            in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may\n            determine the drug quantity attributable to\n            that defendant and sentence him accordingly.\n\nThe judge may determine the drug quantity by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.    United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            Vázquez    concedes   that     the   sentencing    court   had   the\n\nfollowing testimony.       First, Edwin Meléndez-Negrón testified that\n\non \"approximately\" 20 occasions, he either sold or purchased one\n\nkilogram of cocaine to or from Vázquez.            Second, Alberto Negrón-\n\n\n1\n     Vázquez also states that he challenges the sentencing\nenhancement for his role as supervisor in the drug conspiracy.\nHowever, beyond this statement, he provides no additional reasoning\nor argument why this was error. As such, we decline to address the\nargument. United States v. Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 31 (1st Cir.\n2003) (\"Because this argument is made in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by any effort at developed argumentation, it has been\nwaived.\").\n\n                                     -5-\n\fConstantino testified that he had sold \"some kilos\" to Vázquez's\n\nbrother, which were, in fact, destined for Vázquez himself. Third,\n\nJosé Borrero Feliciano testified that the Ceiba drug point, which\n\nVázquez managed, sold \"an eighth\" of cocaine on a daily basis.\n\nVázquez argues that because some of these witnesses prefaced their\n\ncalculations with the word \"around\" or \"approximately,\" their\n\ntestimony    is     inherently   unreliable.             However,    we   have    said\n\npreviously that a sentencing court need not determine an exact\n\namount of drugs, but may instead make a \"reasoned estimate\" of the\n\ndrug quantity attributable to the defendant.                   United States v.\n\nHuddleston,    194    F.3d    214,    224    (1st   Cir.    1999).        Given   this\n\ntestimony, we conclude that the court had ample evidence on which\n\nto base its conclusion that at least five kilograms of cocaine were\n\nattributable to Vázquez.\n\n                      2.    Weapons in the Conspiracy\n\n             Vázquez also argues that the court had insufficient\n\nevidence to support the enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1)\n\nfor possession of a \"dangerous weapon (including a firearm).\"                      We\n\nhave held that a defendant charged with conspiracy is accountable\n\nfor all \"'reasonably foreseeable' conduct undertaken by others\" in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.              United States v. Bianco, 922 F.2d\n\n910,   912   (1st    Cir.    1991).     Thus,       to   determine    whether     the\n\nsentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon can be\n\nimposed, the sentencing court may consider not only whether Vázquez\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpersonally possessed a dangerous weapon, but also whether \"it was\n\nreasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a gun in\n\nfurtherance of the [conspiracy to distribute cocaine].\"              United\n\nStates v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 129 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The sentencing court had the following evidence about the\n\ninvolvement of firearms in the conspiracy.      First, Alberto Negrón-\n\nConstantino testified that he sold firearms to \"Hiram,\" who was a\n\nrunner for the drug point managed by Vázquez.           Second, Alexander\n\nFigueroa testified that he gave a shotgun to the person in charge\n\nof storing firearms at the drug point. Third, David Sánchez Ortiz,\n\nwho sold drugs to Vázquez through his brother, testified that he\n\nregularly   carried   a   firearm   for   protection.      Lastly,    Edwin\n\nMeléndez-Negrón, who purchased cocaine from Vázquez, testified that\n\nhe also carried a firearm for protection.\n\n            We find that this is sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nuse of firearms to further the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.\n\nFurther, we believe that the evidence presented is sufficient to\n\nallow an inference that Vázquez, who was the manager of the drug\n\npoint, was likely aware or could have foreseen that many of the\n\npeople who worked for him carried or used firearms.           As we have\n\nnoted before, \"a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a\n\nconspiracy in which he is participating . . . frequently will\n\nsuffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of\n\ncoconspirators.\" United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 229 (1st\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fCir. 1994).    As Vázquez has conceded, testimony at trial showed\n\nthat Vázquez \"allegedly exercised decision making authority to\n\nfacilitate the delivery of narcotics, was in charge of buying,\n\nprocessing, and distributing the narcotics to the peddlers, and he\n\nwould be responsible for retrieving the proceeds, verifying the\n\nstatus of the inventory and supervising the day-to-day operation of\n\nthe drug point.\"    Appellant's Br. 10.    Given Vázquez's intimate\n\ninvolvement in the operations of the drug point, the court did not\n\nerr in concluding that Vázquez could have foreseen that many of his\n\nemployees and suppliers were armed.\n\n          B.   Reasonableness of the Sentence\n\n          Next, Vázquez argues that his sentence is procedurally\n\nand substantively flawed.      He first argues that the sentencing\n\ncourt inadequately explained its justification for his sentence as\n\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c). Vázquez alternatively argues that\n\neven if the district court complied with § 3553(c), it gave undue\n\nweight to the Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence.\n\nWe review sentences for reasonableness.    United States v. Booker,\n\n543 U.S. 220, 260-63 (2005); see also Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n76.\n\n                   1.   Justification for the Sentence\n\n          Vázquez claims that the court did not adequately explain\n\nthe reasoning behind his sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3553\n\n(c).   We said in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre that \"it is\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fimportant for us to have the district court's reasons for its\n\nsentence\"; however, the reasons need not be explicit: \"[A] court's\n\nreasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the\n\nparties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge\n\ndid.\" 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006);see also United States v.\n\nNavedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The more\n\nobvious the reasons for a [sentencing] choice, the less that needs\n\nto be explained.\"). Although the court did not specifically reject\n\nVázquez's arguments during the pronouncement of the sentence, it\n\ndid explain that it had found by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat at least five kilograms of cocaine could be attributed to\n\nVázquez, that a weapon was foreseeable, and that it considered\n\nevery one of the factors enumerated in § 3553(a) that it is\n\nrequired to consider.   The court further stated that it was basing\n\nits sentence on the fact that\n\n          [D]efendant was a runner or administrator of a\n          drug point, he had decision making authority\n          to facilitate the delivery of narcotics, was\n          in   charge   of    buying,   processing,  and\n          distributing drugs at the drug point. He was\n          also   responsible     for   supervising   the\n          operations of the drug point. Moreover there\n          were   people    who   participated   in  this\n          conspiracy that possessed, carried, used and\n          brandished firearms and defendant was aware of\n          the same.\n\n          In addition, prior to the pronouncement of sentence, the\n\ncourt specifically stated that it did not agree with Vázquez's\n\ndisparity argument because plea bargains were \"very valuable for\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fthe system.\"        Given these explanations, we find it easy to infer\n\nthat    the    sentencing     court    did     not    find   Vázquez's    arguments\n\nregarding sentencing disparities or the sufficiency of the evidence\n\npersuasive and that it thought that a sentence based on the\n\nGuidelines recommendation was warranted.                Accordingly, we find the\n\nsentencing court's reasoning to be sufficient to comply with 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(c) and to provide us with a base to analyze Vázquez's\n\nother claims.\n\n               C.   Consideration of Sentencing Factors\n\n               The crux of Vázquez's argument regarding sentencing is\n\nthat,    had     the    sentencing    court     not    treated     the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines as applicable in all but unusual cases, it would have\n\nbeen free to give more weight to other sentencing factors, namely\n\nsentencing disparity.         As an initial matter, we think it necessary\n\nto point out that the sentencing court misconstrued the role of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines. As we stated in Jiménez-Beltre, \"[a]lthough\n\nmaking the guidelines 'presumptive' or 'per se reasonable' does not\n\nmake them mandatory, it tends in that direction.\"                440 F.3d at 518.\n\nBy stating that it will \"heed\" to the Sentencing Guidelines, the\n\nsentencing      court    in   the    present    case    appeared    to   treat   the\n\nSentencing Guidelines as presumptively applicable. By stating that\n\nit would apply the Guidelines in all but \"unusual cases,\" the\n\ncourt's language arguably went even further than the language at\n\nissue in Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d at 57, that we described as a\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fmodest variance from Jiménez-Beltre. Our holding in Jiménez-Beltre\n\nmakes it clear that a case need not be unusual for a sentencing\n\ncourt to consider the other factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3353(a).\n\n           Our    review    of    Vázquez's      sentence,    however,    is   for\n\nreasonableness.       Considering         the   substantial    weight     of   the\n\nSentencing Guidelines and the § 3553(a) factors, we do not find\n\nthat his sentence was unreasonable.             Vázquez suggests that had the\n\nsentencing court not construed the Guidelines as applicable in all\n\nbut   unusual    cases,    it    would   have   been   free   to    consider   his\n\nsuggestion of a lower sentence to reduce sentencing disparities.\n\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), the sentencing court is obliged to\n\nconsider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\" among\n\nsimilarly situated defendants (emphasis added).                    Vázquez argues\n\nthat the sentence he received is unwarranted because it punishes\n\nhis decision to contest the charges against him rather than enter\n\ninto a plea bargain.\n\n           It is well established that the plea bargaining system\n\ndoes not impermissibly punish a defendant's choice to go to trial\n\nrather than to plead guilty: \"The legitimacy of the practice of\n\n'plea bargaining,' . . . has not been doubted and where 'properly\n\nadministered' it is to be 'encouraged' as an 'essential' and\n\n'desirable' 'component of the administration of justice.'\" Chaffin\n\nv. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 31 n.18 (1973) (quoting Santobello v.\n\nNew York, 404 U.S. 257, 260-61 (1971)).            In United States v. Yeje-\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fCabrera, we held that \"a defendant simply has no right to a\n\nsentence, after trial, that is as lenient as a sentence he could\n\nhave had earlier in a plea bargain.\"               430 F.3d 1, 26-27 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); see also United States v. Rodríguez, 162 F.3d 135, 152 (1st\n\nCir.    1998)   (stating     that   plea     bargains      lead       to   \"sentencing\n\ndisparity for the defendants who chose to put the government to its\n\nburden in proving its case.              Nevertheless, the law allows the\n\ngovernment to do this, even if it results in sentences of such\n\ndisparity as would strike many as unfair.\").                   Although a district\n\ncourt may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining\n\na sentence, we do not find Vázquez's sentence to be unreasonable\n\nsimply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in\n\nexchange for reduced sentences. See United States v.

The district court sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison. V&#225;zquez appealed, and we remanded his case for re-sentencing in accordance with <i>United States v.

On remand, the district court again sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison. V&#225;zquez now appeals this sentence. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 1999, V&#225;zquez and four other persons were indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. V&#225;zquez voluntarily surrendered to the police on July 28, 1999. All of V&#225;zquez's co-defendants pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and received sentences ranging from 24 to 120 months in prison. V&#225;zquez contested the charges against him. At trial, various prosecution witnesses testified as to the amounts of cocaine which they had sold or observed being sold to V&#225;zquez. Witnesses also testified as to the presence of weapons at the drug point that V&#225;zquez administered. After a jury trial, V&#225;zquez was convicted on the sole count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The court sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison based, in part, on the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez appealed his conviction and his sentence to this Court. We affirmed V&#225;zquez's conviction, but remanded his case to the district court for resentencing on the ground that his original sentence was pronounced in violation of <i>Booker. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d 476.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to resentencing, V&#225;zquez submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court. In the memorandum, he argued that the evidence supported neither the drug quantity that the pre-sentence report attributed to him nor the finding in the pre-sentence report that he could have foreseen the involvement of a weapon in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine. V&#225;zquez also argued that the court should deviate from the Sentencing Guidelines range to reduce sentencing disparities between him and his co-defendants. Lastly, V&#225;zquez suggested that the nature of his offense and his personal characteristics warranted a sentence below the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a sentencing hearing for V&#225;zquez on September 30, 2005. During the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not in agreement with the grounds put forth whereby we should depart from a Guidelines sentence in this case. Let me state for the record that this court, this Judge, that it will generally heed to the Guidelines in imposing criminal punishment. No doubt some criminal defendants will be disappointed by this result, yet in the long run such an approach may be the best way to develop a fair and consistent sentencing scheme around the country for the benefit of defendants, victims and the public. The Congressional view of how to structure that sentencing will surely be informed by how judges conform to the new advisory guideline system. If that discretion is exercised responsibly Congress may be inclined to give judges greater flexibility under a new sentencing system. On the other hand if that discretion is abused by sentences that thwart Congressional objectives, Congress has ample reason to deny us that flexibility. The course, in my opinion today, is to faithfully implement the Congressional purposes underlying the sentences format by following the Guidelines in all but unusual cases. I find that this is not an unusual case and that the application of the Guidelines are reasonable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison. V&#225;zquez now appeals from this sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez contests his sentence on two grounds. First, V&#225;zquez argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support various aspects of his sentence. Second, V&#225;zquez contends that his sentence is procedurally defective because the sentencing court failed to adequately explain his sentence and is substantively unreasonable because the court gave improper weight to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez's first argument is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support either the individualized drug quantity or the involvement of weapons that were used to determine his sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We review a sentencing court's findings of fact for clear error and their conclusions of law <i>de novo. United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 82 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Drug Quantity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez contends that the court erred in calculating the quantity of drugs personally attributable to him for sentencing purposes. In <i>Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2002), we held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]nce the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge may determine the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Santos,</i> 357 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez concedes that the sentencing court had the following testimony. First, Edwin Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n testified that on \"approximately\" 20 occasions, he either sold or purchased one kilogram of cocaine to or from V&#225;zquez. Second, Alberto Negr&#243;n-Constantino testified that he had sold \"some kilos\" to V&#225;zquez's brother, which were, in fact, destined for V&#225;zquez himself. Third, Jos&#233; Borrero Feliciano testified that the Ceiba drug point, which V&#225;zquez managed, sold \"an eighth\" of cocaine on a daily basis. V&#225;zquez argues that because some of these witnesses prefaced their calculations with the word \"around\" or \"approximately,\" their testimony is inherently unreliable. However, we have said previously that a sentencing court need not determine an exact amount of drugs, but may instead make a \"reasoned estimate\" of the drug quantity attributable to the defendant. <i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir.1999). Given this testimony, we conclude that the court had ample evidence on which to base its conclusion that at least five kilograms of cocaine were attributable to V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Weapons in the Conspiracy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez also argues that the court had insufficient evidence to support the enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a \"dangerous weapon (including a firearm).\" We have held that a defendant charged with conspiracy is accountable for all \"`reasonably foreseeable' conduct undertaken by others\" in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Bianco,</i> 922 F.2d 910, 912 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, to determine whether the sentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon can be imposed, the sentencing court may consider not only whether V&#225;zquez personally possessed a dangerous weapon, but also whether \"it was reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a gun in furtherance of the [conspiracy to distribute cocaine].\" <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 129 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court had the following evidence about the involvement of firearms in the conspiracy. First, Alberto Negr&#243;n-Constantino testified that he sold firearms to \"Hiram,\" who was a runner for the drug point managed by V&#225;zquez. Second, Alexander Figueroa testified that he gave a shotgun to the person in charge of storing firearms at the drug point. Third, David S&#225;nchez Ortiz, who sold drugs to V&#225;zquez through his brother, testified that he regularly carried a firearm for protection. Lastly, Edwin Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n, who purchased cocaine from V&#225;zquez, testified that he also carried a firearm for protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this is sufficient evidence to establish the use of firearms to further the conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Further, we believe that the evidence presented is sufficient to allow an inference that V&#225;zquez, who was the manager of the drug point, was likely aware or could have foreseen that many of the people who worked for him carried or used firearms. As we have noted before, \"a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating . . . frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.\" <i>United States v. LaCroix,</i> 28 F.3d 223, 229 (1st Cir.1994). As V&#225;zquez has conceded, testimony at trial showed that V&#225;zquez \"allegedly exercised decision making authority to facilitate the delivery of narcotics, was in charge of buying, processing, and distributing the narcotics to the peddlers, and he would be responsible for retrieving the proceeds, verifying the status of the inventory and supervising the day-to-day operation of the drug point.\" Appellant's Br. 10. Given V&#225;zquez's intimate involvement in the operations of the drug point, the court did not err in concluding that V&#225;zquez could have foreseen that many of his employees and suppliers were armed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Reasonableness of the Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, V&#225;zquez argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively flawed. He first argues that the sentencing court inadequately explained its justification for his sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). V&#225;zquez alternatively argues that even if the district court complied with &#167; 3553(c), it gave undue weight to the Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence. We review sentences for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 260-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <i>see also Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Justification for the Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez claims that the court did not adequately explain the reasoning behind his sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). We said in <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> that \"it is important for us to have the district court's reasons for its sentence\"; however, the reasons need not be explicit: \"[A] court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\" 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also United States v. Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir.2006) (\"The more obvious the reasons for a [sentencing] choice, the less that needs to be explained.\"). Although the court did not specifically reject V&#225;zquez's arguments during the pronouncement of the sentence, it did explain that it had found by a preponderance of the evidence that at least five kilograms of cocaine could be attributed to V&#225;zquez, that a weapon was foreseeable, and that it considered every one of the factors enumerated in &#167; 3553(a) that it is required to consider. The court further stated that it was basing its sentence on the fact that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendant was a runner or administrator of a drug point, he had decision making authority to facilitate the delivery of narcotics, was in charge of buying, processing, and distributing drugs at the drug point. He was also responsible for supervising the operations of the drug point. Moreover there were people who participated in this conspiracy that possessed, carried, used and brandished firearms and defendant was aware of the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, prior to the pronouncement of sentence, the court specifically stated that it did not agree with V&#225;zquez's disparity argument because plea bargains were \"very valuable for the system.\" Given these explanations, we find it easy to infer that the sentencing court did not find V&#225;zquez's arguments regarding sentencing disparities or the sufficiency of the evidence persuasive and that it thought that a sentence based on the Guidelines recommendation was warranted. Accordingly, we find the sentencing court's reasoning to be sufficient to comply with 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) and to provide us with a base to analyze V&#225;zquez's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Consideration of Sentencing Factors</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of V&#225;zquez's argument regarding sentencing is that, had the sentencing court not treated the Sentencing Guidelines as applicable in all but unusual cases, it would have been free to give more weight to other sentencing factors, namely sentencing disparity. As an initial matter, we think it necessary to point out that the sentencing court misconstrued the role of the Sentencing Guidelines. As we stated in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> \"[a]lthough making the guidelines `presumptive' or `per se reasonable' does not make them mandatory, it tends in that direction.\" 440 F.3d at 518. By stating that it will \"heed\" to the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing court in the present case appeared to treat the Sentencing Guidelines as presumptively applicable. By stating that it would apply the Guidelines in all but \"unusual cases,\" the court's language arguably went even further than the language at issue in <i>Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d at 57, that we described as a modest variance from <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> Our holding in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> makes it clear that a case need not be unusual for a sentencing court to consider the other factors in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3353(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of V&#225;zquez's sentence, however, is for reasonableness. Considering the substantial weight of the Sentencing Guidelines and the &#167; 3553(a) factors, we do not find that his sentence was unreasonable. V&#225;zquez suggests that had the sentencing court not construed the Guidelines as applicable in all but unusual cases, it would have been free to consider his suggestion of a lower sentence to reduce sentencing disparities. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(6), the sentencing court is obliged to consider \"the need to avoid <i>unwarranted</i> sentence disparities\" among similarly situated defendants (emphasis added). V&#225;zquez argues that the sentence he received is unwarranted because it punishes his decision to contest the charges against him rather than enter into a plea bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that the plea bargaining system does not impermissibly punish a defendant's choice to go to trial rather than to plead guilty: \"The legitimacy of the practice of `plea bargaining,' . . . has not been doubted and where `properly administered' it is to be `encouraged' as an `essential' and `desirable' `component of the administration of justice.'\" <i>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe,</i> 412 U.S. 17, 31 n. 18, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973) (quoting <i>Santobello v. New York,</i> 404 U.S. 257, 260-61, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971)). In <i>United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> we held that \"a defendant simply has no right to a sentence, after trial, that is as lenient as a sentence he could have had earlier in a plea bargain.\" 430 F.3d 1, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>see also United States v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 162 F.3d 135, 152 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that plea bargains lead to \"sentencing disparity for the defendants who chose to put the government to its burden in proving its case. Nevertheless, the law allows the government to do this, even if it results in sentences of such disparity as would strike many as unfair.\"). Although a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, we do not find V&#225;zquez's sentence to be unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences. <i>See United States v. Thurston,</i> 456 F.3d 211, 216-17 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that a defendant who chooses to enter into a plea bargain is not similarly situated to a defendant who contests the charges); <i>see also Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d at 60 (\"The district judge was not required to reduce [the appellant's] sentence simply because he&#8212;unlike the other defendants&#8212;chose to go to trial\"). Further, the fact that V&#225;zquez was gainfully employed and is now married, as he notes in his brief on appeal, simply makes his participation in this conspiracy all the more unfortunate; however, this fact does not make his sentence, already at the lower end of the Guidelines range, unreasonable. Thus, given the Sentencing Guidelines recommendation, to which we attach substantial weight, and the absence of any &#167; 3553(a) factors militating in favor of a lower sentence, we conclude that the sentence that the court imposed on V&#225;zquez was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> V&#225;zquez also states that he challenges the sentencing enhancement for his role as supervisor in the drug conspiracy. However, beyond this statement, he provides no additional reasoning or argument why this was error. As such, we decline to address the argument<i>United States v.

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 1999, V&#225;zquez and four other persons were indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. V&#225;zquez voluntarily surrendered to the police on July 28, 1999. All of V&#225;zquez's co-defendants pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and received sentences ranging from 24 to 120 months in prison. V&#225;zquez contested the charges against him. At trial, various prosecution witnesses testified as to the amounts of cocaine which they had sold or observed being sold to V&#225;zquez. Witnesses also testified as to the presence of weapons at the drug point that V&#225;zquez administered. After a jury trial, V&#225;zquez was convicted on the sole count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The court sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison based, in part, on the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez appealed his conviction and his sentence to this Court. We affirmed V&#225;zquez's conviction, but remanded his case to the district court for resentencing on the ground that his original sentence was pronounced in violation of <i>Booker. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to resentencing, V&#225;zquez submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court. In the memorandum, he argued that the evidence supported neither the drug quantity that the pre-sentence report attributed to him nor the finding in the pre-sentence report that he could have foreseen the involvement of a weapon in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine. V&#225;zquez also argued that the court should deviate from the Sentencing Guidelines range to reduce sentencing disparities between him and his co-defendants. Lastly, V&#225;zquez suggested that the nature of his offense and his personal characteristics warranted a sentence below the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a sentencing hearing for V&#225;zquez on September 30, 2005. During the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not in agreement with the grounds put forth whereby we should depart from a Guidelines sentence in this case. Let me state for the record that this court, this Judge, that it will generally heed to the Guidelines in imposing criminal punishment. No doubt some criminal defendants will be disappointed by this result, yet in the long run such an approach may be the best way to develop a fair and consistent sentencing scheme around the country for the benefit of defendants, victims and the public. The Congressional view of how to structure that sentencing will surely be informed by how judges conform to the new advisory guideline system. If that discretion is exercised responsibly Congress may be inclined to give judges greater flexibility under a new sentencing system. On the other hand if that discretion is abused by sentences that thwart Congressional objectives, Congress has ample reason to deny us that flexibility. The course, in my opinion today, is to faithfully implement the Congressional purposes underlying the sentences format by following the Guidelines in all but unusual cases. I find that this is not an unusual case and that the application of the Guidelines are reasonable in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then sentenced V&#225;zquez to 210 months in prison.

First, V&#225;zquez argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support various aspects of his sentence. Second, V&#225;zquez contends that his sentence is procedurally defective because the sentencing court failed to adequately explain his sentence and is substantively unreasonable because the court gave improper weight to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez's first argument is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support either the individualized drug quantity or the involvement of weapons that were used to determine his sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We review a sentencing court's findings of fact for clear error and their conclusions of law <i>de novo.

In <i>Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2002), we held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]nce the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge may determine the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v.

First, Edwin Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n testified that on \"approximately\" 20 occasions, he either sold or purchased one kilogram of cocaine to or from V&#225;zquez. Second, Alberto Negr&#243;n-Constantino testified that he had sold \"some kilos\" to V&#225;zquez's brother, which were, in fact, destined for V&#225;zquez himself. Third, Jos&#233; Borrero Feliciano testified that the Ceiba drug point, which V&#225;zquez managed, sold \"an eighth\" of cocaine on a daily basis. V&#225;zquez argues that because some of these witnesses prefaced their calculations with the word \"around\" or \"approximately,\" their testimony is inherently unreliable. However, we have said previously that a sentencing court need not determine an exact amount of drugs, but may instead make a \"reasoned estimate\" of the drug quantity attributable to the defendant. <i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.1999). Given this testimony, we conclude that the court had ample evidence on which to base its conclusion that at least five kilograms of cocaine were attributable to V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Weapons in the Conspiracy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez also argues that the court had insufficient evidence to support the enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a \"dangerous weapon (including a firearm).\" We have held that a defendant charged with conspiracy is accountable for all \"`reasonably foreseeable' conduct undertaken by others\" in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Bianco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553837\"><a href=\"/opinion/553837/united-states-v-nicholas-bianco-united-states-of-america-v-daniel-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 912 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, to determine whether the sentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon can be imposed, the sentencing court may consider not only whether V&#225;zquez personally possessed a dangerous weapon, but also whether \"it was reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a gun in furtherance of the [conspiracy to distribute cocaine].\" <i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200815\"><a href=\"/opinion/200815/united-states-v-casas/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 129 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court had the following evidence about the involvement of firearms in the conspiracy. First, Alberto Negr&#243;n-Constantino testified that he sold firearms to \"Hiram,\" who was a runner for the drug point managed by V&#225;zquez. Second, Alexander Figueroa testified that he gave a shotgun to the person in charge of storing firearms at the drug point. Third, David S&#225;nchez Ortiz, who sold drugs to V&#225;zquez through his brother, testified that he regularly carried a firearm for protection. Lastly, Edwin Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n, who purchased cocaine from V&#225;zquez, testified that he also carried a firearm for protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this is sufficient evidence to establish the use of firearms to further the conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Further, we believe that the evidence presented is sufficient to allow an inference that V&#225;zquez, who was the manager of the drug point, was likely aware or could have foreseen that many of the people who worked for him carried or used firearms. As we have noted before, \"a defendant's awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating . . . frequently will suffice to prove the defendant's ability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.\" <i>United States v. LaCroix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195454\"><a href=\"/opinion/195454/united-states-v-lacroix/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1994). As V&#225;zquez has conceded, testimony at trial showed that V&#225;zquez \"allegedly exercised decision making authority to facilitate the delivery of narcotics, was in charge of buying, processing, and distributing the narcotics to the peddlers, and he would be responsible for retrieving the proceeds, verifying the status of the inventory and supervising the day-to-day operation of the drug point.\" Appellant's Br. 10. Given V&#225;zquez's intimate involvement in the operations of the drug point, the court did not err in concluding that V&#225;zquez could have foreseen that many of his employees and suppliers were armed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Reasonableness of the Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, V&#225;zquez argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively flawed. He first argues that the sentencing court inadequately explained its justification for his sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). V&#225;zquez alternatively argues that even if the district court complied with &#167; 3553(c), it gave undue weight to the Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence. We review sentences for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 260-63, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005); <i>see also Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Justification for the Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez claims that the court did not adequately explain the reasoning behind his sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). We said in <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> that \"it is important for us to have the district court's reasons for its sentence\"; however, the reasons need not be explicit: \"[A] court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 519 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also United States v. Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202256\"><a href=\"/opinion/202256/united-states-v-navedo-concepcion/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2006) (\"The more obvious the reasons for a [sentencing] choice, the less that needs to be explained.\"). Although the court did not specifically reject V&#225;zquez's arguments during the pronouncement of the sentence, it did explain that it had found by a preponderance of the evidence that at least five kilograms of cocaine could be attributed to V&#225;zquez, that a weapon was foreseeable, and that it considered every one of the factors enumerated in &#167; 3553(a) that it is required to consider. The court further stated that it was basing its sentence on the fact that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendant was a runner or administrator of a drug point, he had decision making authority to facilitate the delivery of narcotics, was in charge of buying, processing, and distributing drugs at the drug point. He was also responsible for supervising the operations of the drug point. Moreover there were people who participated in this conspiracy that possessed, carried, used and brandished firearms and defendant was aware of the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, prior to the pronouncement of sentence, the court specifically stated that it did not agree with V&#225;zquez's disparity argument because plea bargains were \"very valuable for the system.\" Given these explanations, we find it easy to infer that the sentencing court did not find V&#225;zquez's arguments regarding sentencing disparities or the sufficiency of the evidence persuasive and that it thought that a sentence based on the Guidelines recommendation was warranted. Accordingly, we find the sentencing court's reasoning to be sufficient to comply with 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) and to provide us with a base to analyze V&#225;zquez's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Consideration of Sentencing Factors</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of V&#225;zquez's argument regarding sentencing is that, had the sentencing court not treated the Sentencing Guidelines as applicable in all but unusual cases, it would have been free to give more weight to other sentencing factors, namely sentencing disparity. As an initial matter, we think it necessary to point out that the sentencing court misconstrued the role of the Sentencing Guidelines. As we stated in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> \"[a]lthough making the guidelines `presumptive' or `per se reasonable' does not make them mandatory, it tends in that direction.\" 440 F.3d at 518. By stating that it will \"heed\" to the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing court in the present case appeared to treat the Sentencing Guidelines as presumptively applicable. By stating that it would apply the Guidelines in all but \"unusual cases,\" the court's language arguably went even further than the language at issue in <i>Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d at 57, that we described as a modest variance from <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre.</i> Our holding in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> makes it clear that a case need not be unusual for a sentencing court to consider the other factors in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3353(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of V&#225;zquez's sentence, however, is for reasonableness. Considering the substantial weight of the Sentencing Guidelines and the &#167; 3553(a) factors, we do not find that his sentence was unreasonable. V&#225;zquez suggests that had the sentencing court not construed the Guidelines as applicable in all but unusual cases, it would have been free to consider his suggestion of a lower sentence to reduce sentencing disparities. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(6), the sentencing court is obliged to consider \"the need to avoid <i>unwarranted</i> sentence disparities\" among similarly situated defendants (emphasis added). V&#225;zquez argues that the sentence he received is unwarranted because it punishes his decision to contest the charges against him rather than enter into a plea bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that the plea bargaining system does not impermissibly punish a defendant's choice to go to trial rather than to plead guilty: \"The legitimacy of the practice of `plea bargaining,' . . . has not been doubted and where `properly administered' it is to be `encouraged' as an `essential' and `desirable' `component of the administration of justice.'\" <i>Chaffin v.

Although a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, we do not find V&#225;zquez's sentence to be unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences. <i>See United States v. Thurston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></span>, 216-17 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that a defendant who chooses to enter into a plea bargain is not similarly situated to a defendant who contests the charges); <i>see also Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d at 60 (\"The district judge was not required to reduce [the appellant's] sentence simply because he&#8212;unlike the other defendants&#8212;chose to go to trial\"). Further, the fact that V&#225;zquez was gainfully employed and is now married, as he notes in his brief on appeal, simply makes his participation in this conspiracy all the more unfortunate; however, this fact does not make his sentence, already at the lower end of the Guidelines range, unreasonable. Thus, given the Sentencing Guidelines recommendation, to which we attach substantial weight, and the absence of any &#167; 3553(a) factors militating in favor of a lower sentence, we conclude that the sentence that the court imposed on V&#225;zquez was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> V&#225;zquez also states that he challenges the sentencing enhancement for his role as supervisor in the drug conspiracy.

I don't agree that the district judge \"misconstrued the role of the Sentencing Guidelines\" by stating that it would \"heed\" to the guidelines in all but \"unusual cases.\" Ante at 10. This formulation is not inconsistent with our recognition in <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre</i> that the Guidelines are an \"important\" factor in sentencing and provide the starting point for constructing a reasonable sentence. <i>See</i> 440 F.3d at 518-19; <i>see also</i> 440 F.3d at 522 (Howard J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (the guidelines \"in the unusual case\" express Congress's view on the purposes of federal sentencing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts will inevitably approach sentencing differently post-<i>Booker.</i> Indeed, the legitimacy of a range of approaches is implicit in <i>Booker's</i> grant of added discretion to sentencing judges. So long as the sentence is reasonable and the approach is not unlawful, the appellate task is complete. <i>See United States v.
