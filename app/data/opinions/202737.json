Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David A. Ruhnke and Joshua L. Dratel, with whom Ruhnke &\nBarrett, Joshua L. Dratel, P.C., Meredith S. Heller, Kristian K.\nLarsen, and Erik B. Levin were on brief, for appellant\n     Steven L. Lane, Attorney, Appellate Section, Criminal\nDivision, United States Department of Justice, with whom Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, George W. Vien and John A.\nWortmann, Jr., Assistant United States Attorneys, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                            May 7, 2007\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge.       This is a landmark case; for the\n\nfirst time in its history, this court must review a sentence of\n\ndeath imposed by a federal judge.          To that extent, we are writing\n\non a pristine page.       We are guided in this pathbreaking endeavor,\n\nhowever, by a variety of reliable sources, including Supreme Court\n\nprecedent, decisions of other courts of appeals in capital cases,\n\nand legal principles of general application.\n\n              With this brief preface, we turn to the particulars of\n\nthe case at hand.        Defendant-appellant Gary Lee Sampson entered a\n\nguilty plea to two counts of carjacking resulting in death.               See 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   2119(3).     On   January    29,   2004,   the   district   court\n\nsentenced Sampson to death on the recommendation of a jury of his\n\npeers.\n\n              Sampson's appeal from his sentence raises a host of\n\nclaims.       The first six include five claims that contest the\n\nconstitutionality of the Federal Death Penalty Act, 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n3591-3598 (FDPA), pursuant to which the district court pronounced\n\nsentence, and one that contests the constitutionality of the death\n\npenalty in general.        There follows a litany of claims concerning\n\nalleged errors specific to Sampson's penalty-phase trial.                   The\n\ndistrict court's rulings on many of these issues are embodied in a\n\nseries of published opinions. See United States v. Sampson, 335 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 166 (D. Mass. 2004) (Sampson IV); United States v.\n\nSampson, 332 F. Supp. 2d 325 (D. Mass. 2004) (Sampson III); United\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fStates v. Sampson, 275 F. Supp. 2d 49 (D. Mass. 2003) (Sampson II);\n\nUnited States v. Sampson, 245 F. Supp. 2d 327 (D. Mass. 2003)\n\n(Sampson I).\n\n           We begin this opinion by sketching the background of the\n\ncase.      We     then      discuss     Sampson's      arguments     about       the\n\nconstitutionality      of   the    FDPA   and   the   death    penalty    itself.\n\nFinally, we address the myriad claims of trial-related error.                    In\n\nthe end, we reject Sampson's asseverational array in its entirety\n\nand affirm his capital sentence.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We briefly recount the facts underlying Sampson's claims.\n\nMany of these facts are rehearsed in Sampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n174-75, and McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262, 264-65 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), and we assume the reader's familiarity with those opinions.\n\n           Sampson committed a series of bank robberies in North\n\nCarolina   in   May,     June,    and   July   of   2001.     He   then   fled    to\n\nMassachusetts.     On July 23, he called the FBI's Boston office and\n\noffered to self-surrender. The call was disconnected and, although\n\nhe waited for the police to arrive, Sampson was not apprehended.\n\n           The next day, Phillip McCloskey, a 69-year-old retiree,\n\nwas driving his car in Weymouth, Massachusetts.                    He picked up\n\nSampson, who was hitchhiking.           When McCloskey later tried to drop\n\nSampson off, Sampson pulled out a knife and told McCloskey to keep\n\ndriving.   Once they reached Marshfield, Sampson forced McCloskey\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fout of the car and attempted to restrain him with a belt.               When\n\nMcCloskey resisted, Sampson stabbed him multiple times and then\n\nslit his throat, nearly decapitating him.          Sampson proceeded to\n\nsteal McCloskey's money and tried to steal his car, which would not\n\nstart.\n\n           Three days later, Jonathan Rizzo, a 19-year-old college\n\nstudent, picked up Sampson (who was posing as a stranded traveler)\n\nalong a road in Plymouth.       Sampson forced Rizzo at knifepoint to\n\ndrive to Abington, where Sampson maintained a makeshift campsite.\n\nSampson tied Rizzo to a tree, gagged him with a sock and a bandana,\n\nstabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest, and slit his throat.\n\nAfter Rizzo was dead, Sampson stole his car and drove to New\n\nHampshire.\n\n           On    July   29,   Sampson    broke   into   a   home   on   Lake\n\nWinnipesaukee.      The next day, the caretaker (Robert Whitney)\n\narrived.   Sampson tied him to a chair, gagged him with a washcloth,\n\nand strangled him to death with a rope. Sampson then appropriated\n\nWhitney's car and drove to Vermont.\n\n           On July 31, William Gregory picked up Sampson, who was\n\nhitchhiking, near West Bridgewater, Vermont. Sampson attempted to\n\nforce Gregory at knifepoint onto a dirt road so that he could tie\n\nhim to a tree and steal his car. Gregory, however, pulled into a\n\nrest area and escaped on foot.          Sampson made off with Gregory's\n\ncar.   Later that day, he broke into a home near the Killington ski\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\farea.   He then called 911 and offered to turn himself in for\n\ncarjacking Gregory and for the earlier bank robberies.                        Vermont\n\nstate troopers arrested Sampson at that locus.                      Following his\n\ndetention, Sampson waived his Miranda rights, see Miranda v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966), and made several detailed\n\nconfessions to the authorities.\n\n            On October 24, 2001, a federal grand jury charged Sampson\n\nwith two counts of carjacking resulting in death (namely, the\n\nmurders of McCloskey and Rizzo).              Sampson offered to plead guilty\n\nin exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole but\n\nthat overture was rejected.\n\n            In   short    order,    the   government        filed   a   superseding\n\nindictment to comply with Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 609\n\n(2002), and then served a notice of intent to seek the death\n\npenalty, see 18 U.S.C. § 3593(a).             After filing numerous pretrial\n\nmotions that unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the\n\nFDPA, Sampson eventually entered a guilty plea to both counts of\n\nthe superseding indictment.\n\n            The district court empaneled a death-qualified jury to\n\ndetermine    what      punishment    should       be   imposed.         See   id.   §\n\n3593(b)(2)(A); see also United States v. Green, 407 F.3d 434, 436-\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2005) (discussing \"death-qualified\" jury requirement).\n\nOn   December    23,    2003,   after     a     six-week    penalty-phase      trial\n\nconducted   in   accordance     with      the    FDPA,     the   jury   unanimously\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\frecommended that Sampson be sentenced to death on both counts of\n\nthe superseding indictment.           The district court sentenced Sampson\n\nto death on both counts.         United States v. Sampson, 300 F. Supp. 2d\n\n275, 276 (D. Mass. 2004).             The district court denied Sampson's\n\nensuing motions for judgment as a matter of law, a new penalty-\n\nphase trial, and other relief.            Sampson III, 332 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n341.    This appeal followed.\n\nII.    THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n\n              Sampson raises six types of constitutional claims.                Most\n\nof them are attacks on the FDPA.              First, Sampson argues that the\n\nFDPA, which authorizes prosecutors to decide whether to seek the\n\ndeath penalty, is unconstitutional because it does not require the\n\naggravating factors needed for a sentence of death to be presented\n\nto a grand jury as mandated by Ring.            Relatedly, he argues that the\n\npresentation of aggravating factors to the grand jury in this case\n\nwas tantamount to executive and judicial redrafting of the statute\n\nin    derogation   of   the     principles    of    separation    of   powers   and\n\nlegislative authority.           Second, Sampson argues that because the\n\nfederal death penalty is so rarely sought or imposed, the FDPA\n\noperates in a fundamentally arbitrary and capricious manner (and,\n\nthus, is invalid as violative of the Eighth Amendment).                 Third, he\n\nargues that the absence of a principled basis for distinguishing\n\nbetween cases in which the federal death penalty is imposed and\n\nthose    in   which   it   is   not   renders      the   FDPA   unconstitutional.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fFourth, he argues that the federal death penalty is sought on the\n\ninvidious basis of race and the irrational basis of geography (and,\n\nthus, is unconstitutional).        Fifth, he argues that continued\n\nenforcement of the federal death penalty will lead to execution of\n\na significant number of innocent persons and that, therefore, the\n\nFDPA and the death penalty itself are unconstitutional.           Finally,\n\nhe argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional.\n\nSampson supports his arguments with Brandeis-brief type information\n\nfrom studies about the operation in fact of the FDPA.\n\n          The district court rejected each of these claims after\n\ncareful analysis.   See Sampson II, 275 F. Supp. 2d at 62-66, 71-94;\n\nSampson I, 245 F. Supp. 2d at 330-38.      Concluding, as we do, that\n\nnearly all of the claims are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent,\n\nwe echo this holding.\n\n          Before addressing the issues, we confirm some basic\n\nprinciples applicable to judicial review.          A district court's\n\nrulings on questions of law, including constitutional questions,\n\nengender de novo review.     See United States v. Bender, 221 F.3d\n\n265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000); see also United States v. Marenghi, 109\n\nF.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997).   Statutes duly enacted by Congress are\n\npresumed to be constitutional.      INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944\n\n(1983).    Thus,    the   burden   of    proving   that   the    FDPA   is\n\nunconstitutional is on the challenger (here, Sampson).          Lujan v. G\n\n& G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 532 U.S. 189, 198 (2001).            Last — but\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fsurely not least — when the Supreme Court has directly decided an\n\nissue, we must \"follow the case [that] directly controls, leaving\n\nto [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own\n\ndecisions.\" Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490\n\nU.S. 477, 484 (1989). With these principles in mind, we turn to\n\nSampson's constitutional claims.\n\n                     A.   Ring-Related Claims.\n\n           We begin with Sampson's multi-faceted claim that the FDPA\n\nis unconstitutional under Ring.       Sampson argues that the FDPA\n\n\"suffers from a fatal flaw,\" Appellant's Br. at 199, in that it\n\nprovides for the prosecutor, not a grand jury, to set out by\n\nallegation the aggravating factors necessary for a sentence of\n\ndeath whereas the Constitution, as interpreted by the Ring Court,\n\nrequires that these factors be presented to a grand jury and\n\ncharged in an indictment.     He further argues that allowing the\n\nprosecutor to select the aggravating factors and present them to\n\nthe grand jury in his case constituted \"improper executive and\n\njudicial redrafting of the statute.\"    Id.   We do not agree.\n\n           The FDPA defines the circumstances under which defendants\n\nwho commit certain federal crimes may be eligible for the death\n\npenalty.   A defendant who commits a qualifying offense is death-\n\npenalty eligible only if a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the defendant acted with the statutorily required intent, see\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(b), and that at least one statutorily\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fdefined aggravating factor exists, see id. §§ 3592, 3593(c)-(e).\n\nIt is only after these threshold findings are made that a jury,\n\nconsidering both mitigating and aggravating factors, may determine\n\nthat the death penalty is appropriate.    See id. § 3593(c)-(e).\n\n           Part of the statute, section 3593(a), authorizes the\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) to determine whether to seek the death\n\npenalty in a particular case.   If the government elects to seek the\n\ndeath penalty, the statute requires it to give the defendant notice\n\nof its election and of the aggravating factors that it plans to\n\nprove.   Id. § 3593(a).\n\n           The FDPA makes no mention of the grand jury.        This\n\nomission is understandable.     Congress enacted the FDPA in 1994\n\nagainst the backdrop of Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court held that \"the Sixth Amendment does not\n\nrequire that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of\n\nthe sentence of death be made by the jury.\"     Id. at 648 (quoting\n\nHildwin v. Florida, 490 U.S. 638, 640-41 (1989) (per curiam))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).    Essentially, the Walton Court\n\nheld that the facts necessary to render a defendant eligible for\n\nthe death penalty were not elements of the offense itself, making\n\ninapplicable the Fifth Amendment requirement that the elements of\n\nan offense be charged by a grand jury in an indictment.   See id. at\n\n649.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            The Supreme Court first cast doubt on Walton in Jones v.\n\nUnited States, 526 U.S. 227 (1999). There, the Court considered 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119, the carjacking statute involved in this case, and\n\nheld that the statute created three separate offenses.                See Jones,\n\n526 U.S. at 251-52.       It further held that the fact that a defendant\n\ncaused serious bodily injury to another during the commission of a\n\ncrime was an element of a greater offense that had to be both\n\ncharged in an indictment and found by a jury at trial beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.         See id. at 232-39, 252.          In reaching these\n\nconclusions, the Jones Court distinguished the sentencing factors\n\nupheld in Walton.        See id. at 251.\n\n            The   next    Term,   the    Court    held   that   any   fact    that\n\nincreases   the   maximum     authorized       statutory   sentence     \"is   the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\" which\n\nmust be charged in an indictment and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 494 n.19 (2000).\n\n            Finally, in 2002 the Court explicitly overruled Walton.\n\nSee Ring, 536 U.S. at 609.          In the wake of Ring, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent now firmly establishes that the mental culpability and\n\naggravating factors required by the FDPA must — in addition to\n\nbeing included in the government's notice to seek the death penalty\n\n— be presented to a grand jury, charged in the indictment, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.              But as we shall explain, even\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthough this eliminates a background assumption against which the\n\nFDPA was framed, it does not render the statute unconstitutional.\n\n          Sampson contends both that there is a conflict between\n\nthe FDPA and Ring, and that curing the problem would require the\n\nrewriting of the statute, which is a legislative function.             This\n\ncontention is unpersuasive.    The courts that have considered this\n\nthesis uniformly have rejected it. See United States v. Brown, 441\n\nF.3d 1330, 1367 (11th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1149\n\n(2007); United States v. Allen, 406 F.3d 940, 949 (8th Cir. 2005),\n\ncert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 826 (2006); United States v. Barnette, 390\n\nF.3d 775, 788-90 (4th Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 126 S.\n\nCt. 92 (2005); United States v. Robinson, 367 F.3d 278, 290 (5th\n\nCir. 2004); cf. United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d 320, 324-\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2002) (rejecting a facial challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\nbecause \"there is nothing in the statutory language that explicitly\n\ndefies Apprendi\").\n\n          We   agree   with   this   line   of   cases;   there   is     no\n\nirredeemable conflict between the FDPA and Ring.          The FDPA does\n\nnot, as Sampson suggests, grant to prosecutors exclusive authority\n\nfor determining the likely existence of aggravating factors.             No\n\nprovision of the FDPA prohibits a grand jury from considering those\n\nfactors necessary for imposition of a death sentence.       The statute\n\nsimply is silent with respect to the function of the grand jury.\n\nIt thus is not rendered facially unconstitutional by Ring.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          Sampson also presents a variation on this theme, arguing\n\nthat the application of Ring to the FDPA requires impermissible\n\njudicial or executive redrafting of the statute.     We think not.\n\n          What is involved in the application of Ring is a matter\n\nof procedure, not of substantive definition regarding death-penalty\n\neligibility.   After all, in the habeas context, Apprendi and Ring\n\nregularly have been held to announce a new rule of criminal\n\nprocedure, not a new rule of substantive law.   See United States v.\n\nBrown, 305 F.3d 304, 308-09 (5th Cir. 2002); Cannon v. Mullin, 297\n\nF.3d 989, 994 (10th Cir. 2002); United States v. Warden, 286 F.3d\n\n1059, 1063 (8th Cir. 2002); United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, 282\n\nF.3d 664, 668 (9th Cir. 2002); McCoy v. United States, 266 F.3d\n\n1245, 1257 n.16 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Sepulveda v. United\n\nStates, 330 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2003) (treating Apprendi as\n\nhaving announced a rule of criminal procedure); United States v.\n\nMcAllister, 272 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding, in the\n\ncontext of a constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. § 841, that\n\nApprendi announced a procedural rule). To cinch matters, the Jones\n\nCourt made pellucid that \"[t]he constitutional guarantees that\n\ng[a]ve rise to [its] concern in no way restrict the ability of\n\nlegislatures to identify the conduct they wish to characterize as\n\ncriminal or to define the facts whose proof is essential to the\n\nestablishment of criminal liability.\"   526 U.S. at 243 n.6.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f             It follows, then, that the rule against massive judicial\n\nrewriting of statutes simply is not implicated here.                    Adhering to\n\na court-crafted rule of criminal procedure when applying the FDPA\n\ndoes not constitute impermissible statutory redrafting.\n\n             In this respect, the instant case is unlike United States\n\nv. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968), on which Sampson relies.1                        In\n\nJackson, the Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty provision\n\nof the Federal Kidnaping Act, which permitted only a jury to impose\n\na death sentence.       Id. at 591.    The objection was that it infringed\n\non the right to a jury trial by encouraging a defendant to plead\n\nguilty or to waive that right in order to avoid the possibility of\n\na death sentence.         Id. at 572-73.         The government encouraged the\n\nSupreme Court to save the statute by reading it to allow a judge —\n\nin the event of a guilty plea or bench trial — to convene a\n\n\"special     jury\"   to    determine       whether    the   death       penalty   was\n\nwarranted.     Id.   The Court rejected this suggestion, stating that\n\nit could not \"create from whole cloth a complex and completely\n\nnovel procedure and . . . thrust it upon unwilling defendants for\n\nthe   sole    purpose     of    rescuing     a    statute   from    a    charge   of\n\nunconstitutionality.\"          Id. at 580.\n\n             This case, however, does not require us to \"create from\n\nwhole cloth a complex and completely novel procedure.\"                       As the\n\n\n\n      1\n      As best we can tell, no court of appeals considering the\nconstitutionality of the FDPA post-Ring has discussed Jackson.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fdistrict court perspicaciously noted, see Sampson I, 245 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 337, the role of the grand jury in charging the elements of\n\nan offense has long been established. See, e.g., Hamling v. United\n\nStates, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974) (ruling on a challenge to the\n\nsufficiency of an indictment); Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.\n\n749, 763-64 (1962) (same). Here, the government honored that role;\n\nit simply presented the grand jury with evidence of possible\n\naggravating factors.\n\n              This case also is unlike Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410\n\n(1971), and United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), on which\n\nSampson further relies.         In Blount, the Supreme Court invalidated\n\ntwo provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act because they did\n\nnot conform to the constitutional requirements of an administrative\n\ncensorship scheme.       400 U.S. at 421-22.            The Court rejected a\n\nproposed severing construction of the statute that itself failed to\n\ncomply with the Constitution and then noted that \"it [was] for\n\nCongress, not [the] Court, to rewrite the statute.\"                   Id. at 419.\n\nIn Booker, the Court refused to graft onto the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines a set of procedures for presenting to a jury facts\n\nnecessary for sentence enhancements.               543 U.S. at 246.      Instead,\n\nthe   Court    severed   from    the   guidelines      the   provision     making\n\nmandatory the effect of sentencing factors not found by a jury.\n\nId.   at   245.     To   do   otherwise,      it    held,    \"would    [have]   so\n\ntransform[ed] the scheme that Congress created that Congress likely\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fwould not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.\"               Id. at\n\n249.\n\n              The statutes in question in Blount and Booker, like the\n\nstatute       in    Jackson,   were    incompatible    with    constitutional\n\nrequirements.        See id. at 227-29; Blount, 400 U.S. at 417.        Saving\n\neither statute, as proposed by the government, while at the same\n\ntime complying with constitutional mandates, would have required\n\nthe Court to perform a complete statutory rewrite, which is a\n\nlegislative and not a judicial function.           In contrast, allowing a\n\ngrand jury to consider and charge aggravating factors under the\n\nFDPA does not have any effect either on the substantive aspects of\n\nthe statute or on the discrete roles that the statute assigns to\n\nthe judge, the prosecutor, and the jury, respectively.\n\n              To sum up, Ring does not render the FDPA unconstitutional\n\neither on its face or as applied in this case.2\n\n                          B.   Arbitrary Operation.\n\n              Sampson makes two arguments in support of his claim that\n\nthe    FDPA    is   unconstitutional    because   it   is   arbitrary   in   its\n\noperation. First, he argues that because the federal death penalty\n\nis infrequently sought and even more infrequently carried out, its\n\nimposition          is    arbitrary,      capricious,         and   therefore\n\n\n       2\n      Sampson's argument that the grand jury lacked authority to\nissue so-called special findings is entirely without merit. There\nis nothing in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that\nprohibits the grand jury from alleging all the elements of an\noffense that it proposes to charge.\n\n                                       -15-\n\funconstitutional.          Sampson centers this argument around Furman v.\n\nGeorgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), in which the Supreme Court struck\n\ndown as unconstitutional the Georgia capital punishment statute\n\nthen in effect.        In a concurring opinion, Justice Stewart stated\n\nthat the death sentences at issue were\n\n                cruel and unusual in the same way that being\n                struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.\n                For, of all the people convicted of rapes and\n                murders in 1967 and 1968, many just as\n                reprehensible   as    [those   committed    by\n                petitioners], the petitioners are among a\n                capriciously selected random handful upon whom\n                the sentence of death has in fact been\n                imposed.\n\nId.   at   309-10     (Stewart,    J.,    concurring)     (footnote     omitted).\n\nSampson argues that Justice Stewart's statement constitutes the\n\nessence of Furman.           See Appellant's Br. at 238 (characterizing\n\nFurman     as    viewing    \"arbitrariness      and   caprice   .   .   .   as   the\n\ninevitable side-effects of a rarely-imposed punishment of death\").\n\nGiven this reading, he argues that because the federal death\n\npenalty is rarely sought or imposed, the FDPA is no different from\n\nthe Georgia statute invalidated in Furman.\n\n                This argument mistakes the nature of the arbitrariness\n\nconcern in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.              In the thirty-four\n\nyears since Furman was decided, the Court has made clear that its\n\ndecision was not based on the frequency with which the death\n\npenalty was sought or imposed. Rather, the primary emphasis of the\n\nCourt's death penalty jurisprudence has been the requirement that\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fthe discretion exercised by juries be guided so as to limit the\n\npotential for arbitrariness.            Thus, in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.\n\n153 (1976), the Court, upholding the revised Georgia capital\n\nsentencing statute, described Furman as \"mandat[ing] that where\n\ndiscretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as\n\nthe determination of whether a human life should be taken or\n\nspared, that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as\n\nto minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\"\n\nId. at 189 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).\n\n              Together, Furman and Gregg require that a death penalty\n\nstatute      \"(1)    rationally    narrow       the    class       of   death-eligible\n\ndefendants[]        and   (2)   permit    a     jury    to     render     a   reasoned,\n\nindividualized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible\n\ndefendant's record, personal characteristics, and the circumstances\n\nof his crime.\"       Kansas v. Marsh, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 2524-25 (2006).\n\nAs the Supreme Court recognized in a different context, these\n\nrequirements \"further an essential need of the Anglo-American\n\ncriminal justice system — to balance the desirability of a high\n\ndegree of uniformity against the necessity for the exercise of\n\ndiscretion.\"        McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 312 n.35 (1987).\n\nLike   the    statute     upheld   in    Gregg,       the   FDPA    fully     meets   the\n\nrequirements of guided discretion, suitably directing and limiting\n\nthe leeway afforded to the decisionmakers.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f          Nor does the frequency with which the federal death\n\npenalty is sought render the FDPA unconstitutional.           To the extent\n\nthat there may be an independent constitutional concern as to the\n\ndecisional process by which the government decides if it will seek\n\nthe death penalty, that process contains numerous safeguards built\n\ninto an articulated death penalty protocol.            See United States\n\nA t t o r n e y s '      M a n u a l           §        9 - 1 0 . 0 0 0 ,\n\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/10m\n\ncrm.htm.3 The process, therefore, is not arbitrary.          See Gregg, 428\n\nU.S. at 195.\n\n          Sampson's   second   argument    is        that    the    FDPA   is\n\nunconstitutional   because   there   is   no       principled      basis   for\n\ndistinguishing between those cases in which the federal death\n\npenalty is imposed and those in which it is not.            His argument is\n\npremised on Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982), in which the\n\nSupreme Court stated that \"capital punishment [must] be imposed\n\nfairly, and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.\"               Id. at\n\n\n     3\n      For example, under the protocol, in determining whether to\nrecommend that the Attorney General authorize the prosecutor to\nseek the death penalty, the DOJ will consider \"evidence of racial\nbias against the defendant or evidence that the Department has\nengaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.\" United\nStates        Attorneys'          Manual        §     9-10.050,\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/10m\ncrm.htm#9-10.050. There is no colorable claim that the decision\nwhether to seek the death penalty against Sampson was motivated by\nan impermissible factor such as race. Sampson conceded, as well,\nthat he had no evidence of purposeful or intentional discrimination\nbased on the race of the victim.\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f112.     This argument ignores the remainder of the Eddings Court's\n\ndiscussion of consistency, in which the Court recognized that \"a\n\nconsistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false\n\nconsistency.\"    Id.    Indeed, the thrust of Eddings is that those who\n\nmake   sentencing     decisions   must      be   permitted    to     focus   on   the\n\nindividual characteristics of the defendant and the circumstances\n\nof the crime.       Id.      And, finally, the argument cannot survive\n\nMcCleskey, in which the Court stated that \"[t]he Constitution is\n\nnot offended by inconsistency in results based on the objective\n\ncircumstances of the crime.              Numerous legitimate factors may\n\ninfluence . . . a defendant's ultimate sentence, even though they\n\nmay be irrelevant to his actual guilt.\"                481 U.S. at 307 n.28.\n\n            In all events, the \"evidence\" that Sampson submits is\n\nwholly inadequate to prove that the death penalty has been imposed\n\nin an arbitrary manner.        The summaries on which Sampson relies to\n\ndemonstrate inconsistency are devoid of details and fail to account\n\nfor the objective circumstances of the underlying crimes. Even the\n\nmore detailed verdict sheets that he submitted to the district\n\ncourt fail to establish arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.\n\nOn this record and mindful of the teachings of McCleskey, we\n\ndecline    Sampson's    invitation     to     ignore    individual     differences\n\nacross    offenders    and    offenses.          Consequently,       there   is   no\n\nprincipled    basis    for   finding     that    similar     cases    are    treated\n\ndifferently.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f                       C.   Other Challenges to the FDPA.\n\n            Sampson's remaining challenges to the constitutionality\n\nof the FDPA are those related to race, geography, and innocence.\n\nSampson (who is white) raises no argument that he was sentenced to\n\ndeath because of his race, the race of his victims, or the\n\ngeographic location in which he was sentenced.                  Nor does he claim\n\nto be actually innocent.\n\n            What, then, is his claim?              In essence, Sampson attempts\n\nto assert the rights of other capital defendants.                      His claim is\n\nthat,   although       he   himself    was   not     disadvantaged     by   race   or\n\ngeography      and     although   he    is     not    innocent,       the   FDPA   is\n\nunconstitutional because it has these untoward effects elsewhere.\n\nAnd if the FDPA is unconstitutional, his thesis runs, he may not be\n\nsentenced under it.\n\n            It    is    questionable     whether      Sampson   has    standing    to\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the federal death penalty on\n\nthese grounds.       See County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 155 (1979)\n\n(\"As a general rule, if there is no constitutional defect in the\n\napplication of the statute to a litigant, he does not have standing\n\nto argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third\n\nparties   in     hypothetical     situations.\");        see   also    Broadrick    v.\n\nOklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973) (citing cases).\n\n            Because there is no Supreme Court precedent directly on\n\npoint and because \"death is . . . different,\" Gardner v. Florida,\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f430 U.S. 349, 357 (1977), we will assume arguendo that Sampson has\n\nstanding to pursue these arguments.    He nonetheless fails to prove\n\nthe unconstitutionality of the FDPA.\n\n          1.   Race-and-Geography-Related Claims.     We take first\n\nSampson's claims that the FDPA is unconstitutional because the death\n\npenalty is sought based on the race of the defendant and victim and\n\non the locale in which the defendant is charged.    Sampson's race-\n\nbased claims implicate the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.         His\n\ngeography-related claim implicates the Eighth Amendment.4\n\n          Sampson's challenges are based primarily on a 2000 DOJ\n\nstudy of the administration of the federal death penalty from 1988\n\nto 2000, and on a 2001 supplemental report.    He reads the studies\n\nas demonstrating a pattern of discrimination against minority\n\ndefendants and against defendants in the South.     For example, he\n\nnotes that over 70% of federal defendants for whom the death penalty\n\nwas sought were non-whites. Similarly, between 1995 and 2000, only\n\n\n     4\n      Sampson also argues that he has a statutory right under 18\nU.S.C. § 3593(f) to \"justice without discrimination\" that was\nviolated by the discrimination inherent in the federal capital\nsentencing scheme. The district court complied with 18 U.S.C. §\n3593(f), which requires a jury instruction that the race of the\ndefendant and victim not enter into the sentencing determination\nand a certification signed by the jurors that they were not\ninfluenced by these factors.\n     In addition, Sampson argues that this court should invoke its\nsupervisory powers \"to curb charging discrimination and regional\ncaprice.\" Appellant's Br. at 275-76. There is no basis for the\nexercise of supervisory power in this instance.       If Sampson's\narguments have any basis in fact — a point upon which we do not\nopine — he could only have benefitted by virtue of his race and the\ngeographic location in which his crimes were committed.\n\n                               -21-\n\fslightly more than half of the districts in the federal system\n\nsubmitted a case to the Attorney General with a recommendation for\n\ncapital prosecution.    Sampson also cites evidence of a white-victim\n\neffect,   including    one   study    showing   that   the   death   penalty\n\nauthorization rate is 37% in white-victim cases, but only 21% in\n\nminority-victim cases.\n\n             Bare statistical discrepancies are insufficient to prove\n\na Fifth Amendment violation with respect to the implementation of\n\na statute.    This principle is firmly established by McCleskey.        481\n\nU.S. at 292 (stating that \"to prevail under the Equal Protection\n\nClause, [a defendant] must prove that the decisionmakers in his case\n\nacted with discriminatory purpose\").5           It applies here: because\n\nSampson   has    presented    no     specific   evidence     of   purposeful\n\ndiscrimination either against himself or against those southern and\n\n\n     5\n      In McCleskey, the Supreme Court rejected a capital\ndefendant's    claim   that   systemic    statistics   demonstrated\ndiscriminatory intent in his particular case. See 481 U.S. at 297.\nSampson attempts to distinguish McCleskey by noting that the DOJ\nstudy on which he relies provides not only systemic statistics but\nalso individualized statistics. He points out that while the study\nat issue in McCleskey analyzed data from many different\ndecisionmakers, the DOJ study relies only on the decisions of the\nAttorney General and primarily on the decisions of one Attorney\nGeneral (Janet Reno).    This argument ignores the fact that the\nstatistics also reflect the decisions of countless prosecutors in\nthe field, who must exercise their considerable charging discretion\nbefore a case ever reaches the Attorney General's desk (as Sampson\npoints out, the Attorney General followed the local prosecutors'\nrecommendations in the overwhelming majority of cases submitted,\nAppellant's Br. at 255 n.90). See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 295 n.15\n(noting that \"decisions whether to prosecute and what to charge\nnecessarily are individualized and involve infinite factual\nvariations\").\n\n                                     -22-\n\fminority defendants upon whom he purports to base his claim, his\n\nFifth Amendment challenge fails.\n\n           By like token, Sampson's Eighth Amendment claims cannot\n\nsucceed.      The McCleskey Court, in rejecting an Eighth Amendment\n\nclaim   based     on     a   statistical    study    indicating       race-based\n\ndiscrepancies in capital sentencing, stated:\n\n           Apparent disparities in sentencing are an\n           inevitable part of our criminal justice\n           system. . . . [O]ur consistent rule has been\n           that constitutional guarantees are met when\n           \"the   mode   [for   determining  guilt   or\n           punishment] itself has been surrounded with\n           safeguards to make it as fair as possible.\"\n           Where the discretion that is fundamental to\n           our criminal process is involved, we decline\n           to assume that what is unexplained is\n           invidious.\n\n481 U.S. at 312-13 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 35 (1965)).                    The\n\nstatistics submitted by Sampson are no more probative than those\n\nrejected   in   McCleskey.     The   DOJ    study    provides    no   basis   for\n\nattributing the statistical discrepancies with respect to geography\n\nand race in FDPA prosecutions to discrimination rather than to other\n\nfactors, such as differences in the nature of the crimes involved.\n\nMcCleskey prohibits us from assuming that \"what is unexplained is\n\ninvidious.\"     Id.\n\n           2.         Innocence-Related    Claims.   Sampson's    final   claims\n\nregarding the FDPA's constitutionality concern the risk of executing\n\ninnocent defendants. Again, we assume arguendo that Sampson, who has\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fadmitted his guilt by pleading to the charges against him, has\n\nstanding to assert the interests of the innocent.\n\n            Sampson   appears     to    make   two    closely     related    Fifth\n\nAmendment arguments, both of which derive from his reliance on United\n\nStates v. Quinones, 205 F. Supp. 2d 256 (S.D.N.Y.), rev'd, 313 F.3d\n\n49 (2d Cir. 2002).6      Sampson's first argument is that because factual\n\nstudies establish that innocent defendants have been convicted and\n\nsentenced to death, the Fifth Amendment right to procedural due\n\nprocess demands that defendants be permitted to attempt to prove\n\ntheir innocence throughout their natural lives.             His second argument\n\nis that the risk of executing the innocent offends Fifth Amendment\n\nsubstantive due process protections.\n\n            As with Sampson's other constitutional challenges to the\n\nFDPA, these arguments are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. For\n\nyears, a perennial debate has raged over the propriety of capital\n\npunishment in view of the omnipresent risk of executing innocent\n\ndefendants.   See Quinones, 313 F.3d at 63-64.          Withal, the Court has\n\ndeclined,   for   over    two   centuries,     to    hold   the   death     penalty\n\nunconstitutional per se.         In Furman, for example, both Justices\n\n\n\n     6\n      To the extent that Sampson invokes the Eighth Amendment,\narguing that the risk of executing the innocent renders the federal\ndeath penalty per se cruel and unusual, his claim is foreclosed by\nGregg.   See 428 U.S. at 187 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nStevens, JJ.); id. at 226 (opinion of White, J., joined by Burger,\nC.J., and Rehnquist, J.); see also Marsh, 126 S. Ct. at 2529\n(rejecting the proposition that \"the death penalty can only be just\nin a system that does not permit error\").\n\n                                       -24-\n\fMarshall and Brennan explicitly recognized that the risk of executing\n\nthe innocent is inherent in capital punishment. See 408 U.S. at 364,\n\n366-68   (Marshall,   J.,   concurring);   id.    at   290   (Brennan,   J.,\n\nconcurring).   Despite this stark reality, no majority of Justices\n\never has held the death penalty unconstitutional on those grounds.\n\n           The Court squarely addressed the issue of the risk of\n\nexecuting the innocent in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993).\n\nIt affirmed the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nnotwithstanding a claim by the petitioner that new evidence could\n\nprove his actual innocence.       Id. at 393.       The Court noted that\n\n\"[c]laims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have\n\nnever been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent\n\nan independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying\n\nstate criminal proceeding.\"     Id. at 400.      The Court continued:\n\n           We may assume, for the sake of argument in\n           deciding this case, that in a capital case a\n           truly persuasive demonstration of \"actual\n           innocence\" made after trial would render the\n           execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and\n           warrant federal habeas relief if there were no\n           state avenue open to process such a claim. But\n           . . . the threshold showing for such an assumed\n           right would necessarily be extraordinarily\n           high.\n\nId. at 417.    We understand Herrera to leave open the possibility\n\nthat, in a particular instance of newly discovered, highly persuasive\n\nevidence of innocence, emerging at a time when no state remedy\n\nremains available, a federal court might be able to issue a writ of\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fhabeas corpus under the Constitution to prohibit execution.        That is\n\na far cry, however, from saying that the FDPA is unconstitutional.\n\n           Indeed, Herrera supports the constitutionality of the\n\nstatute.   Despite the \"unalterable fact that our judicial system,\n\nlike the human beings who administer it, is fallible,\" id. at 415,\n\nthe Herrera Court could not say that the \"refusal to entertain\n\npetitioner's   newly   discovered    evidence   eight   years   after   his\n\nconviction\" transgressed his due process rights.        Id. at 411.\n\n           This is entirely consistent with the Court's opinion in\n\nChapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453 (1991), which prevents\n\ninferior federal courts from holding capital punishment per se\n\nviolative of due process.    See id. at 465.     The Chapman Court held\n\nthat under the Due Process Clause,\n\n           [e]very person has a fundamental right to\n           liberty in the sense that the Government may\n           not punish him unless and until it proves his\n           guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a criminal\n           trial conducted in accordance with the relevant\n           constitutional guarantees.    But a person who\n           has been so convicted is eligible for, and the\n           court may impose, whatever punishment is\n           authorized by statute for his offense, so long\n           as that penalty is not cruel and unusual, and\n           so long as the penalty is not based on an\n           arbitrary distinction that would violate the\n           Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nId. (citations omitted); see United States v. Inglesi, 988 F.2d 500,\n\n503 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting Chapman for the proposition that \"the\n\nrelevant due process inquiry on [a constitutional challenge in the\n\nsentencing context] is only whether the sentence at issue is 'based\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fon an arbitrary distinction,' or, instead, on 'a rational sentencing\n\nscheme'\"). The Supreme Court has held that capital punishment is not\n\nper se cruel and unusual, see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 187 (opinion of\n\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); id. at 226 (opinion of White, J.,\n\njoined   by   Burger,    C.J.,   and    Rehnquist,     J.),    and     there   is   no\n\nallegation here that the execution of innocent individuals results\n\nfrom arbitrary distinctions or application of the FDPA.\n\n              We   are   bound    by        this   Supreme    Court      precedent.\n\nAccordingly, we join those courts of appeals that have rebuffed\n\nsimilar arguments, see Robinson, 367 F.3d at 290; Quinones, 313 F.3d\n\nat 61-69, and reject Sampson's claims that the federal death penalty\n\nis   unconstitutional     because      it    necessarily     entails    a   risk    of\n\nexecuting the innocent.\n\n                    D.   The Death Penalty Simpliciter.\n\n              In a final catchall argument, Sampson asks us to declare\n\nthe death penalty unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment\n\nand a per se denial of due process in all cases.                Sampson concedes\n\nthat under Supreme Court precedent the argument fails. Yet, he urges\n\nthis court to rule to the contrary because the death penalty is\n\n\"racist to its very core,\" Appellant's Br. at 291; leads to the\n\nexecution of innocent people; and vests an unacceptable level of\n\nunreviewable discretion in prosecutors.               He adds, moreover, his\n\nbelief that the American public eventually will determine that\n\ncapital punishment is wrong and immoral.\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\f            In Gregg, the Supreme Court held that \"the death penalty\n\nis not a form of punishment that may never be imposed, regardless of\n\nthe circumstances of the offense, regardless of the character of the\n\noffender, and regardless of the procedure followed in reaching the\n\ndecision to impose it.\" 428 U.S. at 187 (opinion of Stewart, Powell,\n\nand Stevens, JJ.); see id. at 226 (opinion of White, J., joined by\n\nBurger, C.J., and Rehnquist, J.); accord Roberts v. Louisiana, 428\n\nU.S. 325, 331 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.);\n\nid. at 350-56 (White, J., joined by Burger, C.J., Blackmun, J. and\n\nRehnquist, J., dissenting).         The Chapman Court laid out the test,\n\nunder   which   Sampson    cannot   prevail,   for   determining   whether   a\n\nparticular form of punishment violates due process.          Because Gregg,\n\nRoberts, and Chapman are binding upon us, we reject Sampson's bedrock\n\nclaim and hold that the death penalty itself is not unconstitutional.\n\nIII.    CLAIMS OF TRIAL ERROR\n\n            We turn next to Sampson's manifold claims of trial error.\n\nWe begin by evaluating alleged errors in the charge and the jury\n\nselection process.        We then proceed to Sampson's evidence-related\n\nclaims, including challenges to several of the district court's\n\nrulings and to evidentiary sufficiency.         We conclude by addressing\n\na potpourri of other claims, including Sampson's invocation of the\n\ncumulative error doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f                      A.   Jury Instructions.\n\n          We begin with the district court's charge to the jury.\n\nSampson alleges three strains of instructional error.      Because each\n\nof them presents a properly preserved question of law, we afford de\n\nnovo review, taking into account the charge as a whole and the body\n\nof evidence presented at trial.    See United States v. Woodward, 149\n\nF.3d 46, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d\n\n994, 1001 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          1.      Weighing.       Sampson's     primary   complaint   of\n\ninstructional error relates to the district court's charge on the\n\nweighing of aggravating and mitigating factors.      In Sampson's view,\n\nthese instructions violated the FDPA and, in the bargain, infringed\n\nupon constitutional protections.     Specifically, he argues that the\n\ninstructions (i) erroneously invited jurors to apply their own\n\nidiosyncratic standards to the weighing process and (ii) failed to\n\nrequire that they find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed mitigating factors before voting to impose the\n\ndeath penalty.\n\n            Because our assessment of Sampson's plaints must take\n\ninto account the weighing instructions as a whole, Woodward, 149 F.3d\n\nat 69, we reprint the pertinent portions here:\n\n          [Y]ou are called upon to decide if the proven\n          aggravating factors or factor sufficiently\n          outweigh the proven mitigating factors. This\n          is not a matter of arithmetic.      You’re not\n          being asked to simply count the total number of\n          aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a\n\n                                  -29-\n\fdecision based on which number is greater.\nInstead, you must consider the weight and value\nthat you feel should be given to each factor.\n\nDifferent factors may be given different\nweights or values by different jurors.     You\nmight find that a single aggravating factor is\nserious enough to outweigh several mitigating\nfactors. Similarly, a single mitigating factor\nmight outweigh several aggravating factors.\n\nIf you find that the government has not proven\nthat the aggravating factor or factors outweigh\nthe mitigating factors at all, you may not vote\nto impose the death penalty on the count that\nyou’re considering.    If, however, you decide\nthat the prosecution has proven that the\naggravating factor or factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors, you must decide if the\nprosecution has also proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt    that   those    aggravating    factors\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factors to\nmake death the appropriate penalty for Mr.\nSampson’s crime rather than life in prison\nwithout possibility of release.\n\nThe law does not define what is sufficient to\nmake death the appropriate penalty. Here, the\nlaw relies on each of you as a representative\nof our community to consult your conscience and\ndetermine what is sufficient to justify Mr.\nSampson’s execution. Thus, your decision as to\nwhat the appropriate sentence is will depend in\npart on what is sufficient for you.     If you\nfind that the government has proven that the\naggravating factors slightly outweigh the\nmitigating factors and that is sufficient for\nyou to find that death is the appropriate\npenalty, you may properly vote for death.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the government has\nproven to you that the aggravating factors\ngreatly outweigh the mitigating factors, you\nmay properly decide that this is not sufficient\nto justify a sentence of death because, for\nyou, even more is required for you to find that\na man should die.\n\n\n                     -30-\n\f           However you personally define sufficiency, the\n           prosecution   must   convince   you  beyond   a\n           reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor or\n           factors sufficiently outweigh the mitigating\n           factors to make death the appropriate penalty\n           in this case.\n\n           As I told you earlier, this is a heavy burden.\n           More than a strong probability is required.\n           You must be certain beyond any reasonable doubt\n           that a death sentence should be imposed before\n           voting for it.\n\n           Death is, of course, the ultimate irreversible\n           punishment. You must not sentence Gary Sampson\n           to die unless you are convinced beyond a\n           reasonable doubt that death is the appropriate\n           punishment.\n\n           As I’ve told you previously, the law never\n           requires that any or all of you find that the\n           death penalty is justified. Any one of you may\n           decline to impose a death sentence.     If you\n           decide that the prosecution has not proven\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that the death\n           penalty is justified, you do not have to give\n           a reason for that decision.     The law does\n           require that you follow the process that I’ve\n           explained and then make a reasoned moral\n           judgment.\n\n           Sampson argues initially that the sufficiency language\n\nembedded in this part of the charge violates both the FDPA and the\n\nEighth Amendment. He asserts that, by inviting each juror to use his\n\nor her own definition of sufficiency, the district court \"offered its\n\nown   idiosyncratic   definition   of   the   language   of   the   statute,\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 62-63, and failed to provide adequate sentencing\n\nguidance as required by the Eighth Amendment in capital cases.\n\n           To determine whether the sufficiency language comported\n\nwith the FDPA, we start by consulting the statute's text; we then\n\n                                   -31-\n\fproceed, if necessary, to examine its structure and surrounding\n\nprovisions.    See Green, 407 F.3d at 441-43.\n\n             The relevant section of the FDPA, 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e),\n\nwhich we set out in the margin,7 provides no definition of the phrase\n\n\"sufficiently outweigh.\" Thus, the court's definition of sufficiency\n\ndoes not explicitly contradict the statutory text.            At any rate, the\n\ncourt's definition is fully consistent with the immediately preceding\n\nparagraph, which provides that \"any member of the jury who finds the\n\nexistence     of   a   mitigating   factor    may    consider    such    factor\n\nestablished.\" Id. § 3593(d).          For jurors to consider different\n\nmitigating factors, they would necessarily need to engage in the type\n\nof individualized weighing described by the district court.               Given\n\nthe statutory phrase \"sufficiently outweigh,\" Sampson's attack under\n\nthe FDPA fails.\n\n             We hold, as well, that the sufficiency instruction does\n\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment. Sampson argues strenuously that the\n\nEighth Amendment, if not the statute, requires that the jury be\n\ninstructed    to   follow   a   uniform   method    of   weighing,   precluding\n\nindividual approaches.      We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      That section provides, in pertinent part, that if the jury\nfinds the existence of at least one of the relevant aggravating\nfactors enumerated in the statute, \"the jury . . . shall consider\nwhether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist\nsufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to\nexist to justify a sentence of death.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).\n\n                                     -32-\n\f           The Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that key to\n\nharmonizing a capital sentencing scheme with the proscription against\n\ncruel and unusual punishment is an individualized determination by\n\nthe jury of whether, taking into account all the relevant aggravating\n\nand   mitigating   factors,   a   death    sentence   is   appropriate   in   a\n\nparticular case.    See, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967,\n\n973 (1994); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 879 (1983).              Sampson\n\ncorrectly points out that the jury's discretion in sentencing must\n\nbe \"suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of\n\nwholly arbitrary and capricious action.\"          Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189\n\n(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). However, once a jury\n\nhas found a defendant death-eligible, it may be given unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the weighing process.         See Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 979\n\n(explaining that \"[a] capital sentencer need not be instructed how\n\nto weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision\");\n\nsee also Ayers v. Belmontes, 127 S. Ct. 469, 479 (2006).           Sampson's\n\nargument that the jury needed more guidance in order to weigh\n\naggravators against mitigators is foreclosed by these precedents.\n\n           Sampson also alleges that the weighing instructions failed\n\nto require jurors to find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed mitigating factors, and thus violated the FDPA and\n\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We can readily dismiss the statutory\n\nargument. The FDPA makes no mention of the reasonable doubt standard\n\nin the context of weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, see\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 3593(e), but it does reference the reasonable doubt\n\nstandard in two proximate sections, see id. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(c).\n\nBecause the inclusion      of a term in one part of a statute is\n\npersuasive evidence that its omission elsewhere is deliberate, see\n\nGreen, 407 F.3d at 443, we hold that Congress did not intend the\n\nreasonable doubt standard to apply to the weighing process.             That\n\nbeing so, Sampson cannot have been harmed by the instruction given.\n\n           Sampson's constitutional arguments on this front are no\n\nmore persuasive.    Relying on a procession of Supreme Court cases,\n\nsee, e.g., Booker, 543 U.S. at 244; Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S.\n\n296, 305 (2004); Ring, 536 U.S. at 609; Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490,\n\nhe contends that the balance between aggravating and mitigating\n\nfactors is a \"fact\" that should have been found by the jury beyond\n\na reasonable doubt. The district court's alleged failure to instruct\n\nthat the reasonable doubt standard applied to this \"fact\" was,\n\ntherefore, error.\n\n           Sampson's attempt to draw an analogy between this weighing\n\ndetermination      and     the   sentencing       determinations       found\n\nunconstitutional in the Apprendi line of cases lacks force.                 In\n\nBlakely, for example, the Court invalidated a sentence that had been\n\nelevated   above   the   statutory   maximum   based   upon   a   finding   of\n\n\"deliberate cruelty\" because the facts supporting that finding were\n\nfound by a judge, not by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.         See 542\n\nU.S. at 303.    The case at hand is different in kind because, under\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fthe FDPA, the jury already had found beyond a reasonable doubt the\n\nfacts needed to support a sentence of death — the presence of\n\naggravating factors and the requisite intent — before it reached the\n\nweighing stage.        See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(c)-(e).\n\n              Sampson tries to circumvent this logic by pointing out\n\nthat the weighing determination itself is essential to imposing a\n\ndeath sentence.        He repeatedly refers to Justice Scalia's statement\n\n\"that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment\n\nthat the defendant receives - whether the statute calls them elements\n\nof the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Jane - must be found by\n\nthe jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          Ring, 536 U.S. at 610 (Scalia\n\nJ., joined by Thomas, J., concurring).              This argument founders,\n\nhowever, because it assumes, without the slightest support, that the\n\nweighing of aggravating and mitigating factors is a fact.                     This\n\nassumption is incorrect.          As other courts have recognized, the\n\nrequisite weighing constitutes a process, not a fact to be found.\n\nSee United States v. Purkey, 428 F.3d 738, 750 (8th Cir. 2005)\n\n(characterizing the weighing process as \"the lens through which the\n\njury   must    focus    the   facts   that   it   has   found\"   to   reach   its\n\nindividualized determination), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 433 (2006);\n\nsee also Ford v. Strickland, 696 F.2d 804, 818 (11th Cir. 1983); Gray\n\nv. Lucas, 685 F.2d 139, 140 (5th Cir. 1982) (per curiam).                     The\n\noutcome of the weighing process is not an objective truth that is\n\nsusceptible to (further) proof by either party.           Hence, the weighing\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fof aggravators and mitigators does not need to be \"found.\"                  We hold,\n\ntherefore, that the district court's instructions were free from\n\nApprendi error.\n\n                 Sampson has a residual argument: that the district court's\n\nsimultaneous and alternating references to both a personal notion of\n\nsufficiency and a reasonable doubt standard were confusing and\n\ninconsistent. We evaluate this argument by determining whether there\n\nexists       a   reasonable     likelihood    that   the   jury   interpreted   the\n\ninstructions in a way that would violate the law.                    See Boyde v.\n\nCalifornia, 494 U.S. 370, 380 (1990); see also Jones v. United\n\nStates, 527 U.S. 373, 390 (1999).             Under this approach, a defendant\n\ncannot rely solely on how a single hypothetical juror might have\n\ninterpreted a challenged instruction.                See Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380\n\n(noting the \"strong policy against retrials . . . where the claimed\n\nerror       amounts   to   no   more   than   speculation\").8       After   careful\n\nassessment of the instructions as a whole, we reject Sampson's\n\n\n\n\n        8\n      Sampson urges us to apply, instead of Boyde, either the\nstandard formulated by the Supreme Court in Mills v. Maryland, 486\nU.S. 367, 377 (1988), or that announced in Stromberg v. California,\n283 U.S. 359, 367-68 (1931). Mills is obsolete; the Supreme Court\nreformulated that standard in Boyde, 494 U.S. at 378-90. Stromberg\nis inapposite.    There, the Court stated that when a jury is\ninstructed on alternative theories, one of which is plainly\nunconstitutional, a conviction based upon a general verdict must be\nset aside. 283 U.S. at 367-68. But this principle applies only\nwhere an instruction is \"concededly erroneous.\" Boyde, 494 U.S. at\n380. For this reason, and because the verdict sheets in this case\nprovide detailed evidence of the jury's decisional calculus,\nStromberg is not on point.\n\n                                         -36-\n\fcontention that the challenged instruction is likely to have caused\n\nharmful juror confusion.\n\n             Sampson places great emphasis on the language telling\n\njurors that they could impose the death penalty if the aggravating\n\nfactors \"slightly outweigh[ed]\" the mitigating factors.                This phrase\n\nwas followed immediately, however, by an assurance that jurors could\n\nrefuse to vote for a death sentence \"even if the government ha[d]\n\nproven to [them] that the aggravating factors greatly outweigh[ed]\n\nthe mitigating factors.\"         The court further instructed that however\n\njurors defined sufficiency, the prosecution had to convince them\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor or factors\n\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factors to make death the\n\nappropriate penalty in [the] case.\"             Viewed in its entirety, this\n\ninstruction     clearly     communicated        to     jurors    the      relatively\n\nstraightforward proposition that they, as individuals, had to be\n\ncertain that death was the appropriate punishment before imposing it.\n\n               Even   if   we   assume    (favorably     to    Sampson)    that   the\n\ninstruction might have been mildly confusing, any error was benign.\n\nIn a capital case, as in any other case, a confusing instruction may\n\nbe harmless.     See Boyde, 494 U.S. at 383-84.               Here, we discern no\n\nreasonable     likelihood       that   jurors    may    have     interpreted      the\n\ninstruction in a way that could have harmed Sampson.               There are only\n\ntwo possibilities: either the jurors eschewed the reasonable doubt\n\nstandard vis-à-vis the weighing process (which, as we have held,\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fwould       have   comported     fully    with   the    law)   or    they    applied   the\n\nreasonable doubt standard (which would have benefitted Sampson by\n\nimposing a more onerous burden on the government).                      Any error was,\n\ntherefore, patently harmless.9\n\n               2.     Vulnerable Victim.          The FDPA contemplates that the\n\ngovernment         must   show   the    presence   of    at    least   one    enumerated\n\naggravating factor in order to render a defendant death-eligible.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).               In this case, the jury unanimously found\n\nseveral statutory aggravating factors: that Sampson committed both\n\nthe McCloskey and Rizzo murders in an \"especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved manner,\" id. § 3592(c)(6); that McCloskey was \"particularly\n\nvulnerable due to . . . infirmity,\" id. § 3592(c)(11); and that Rizzo\n\nwas murdered \"after substantial planning and premeditation,\" id. §\n\n3592(c)(9).          With respect to certain of these factors, Sampson\n\nobjects to the lower court's jury instructions.                     We turn next to his\n\nchallenge anent the \"vulnerable victim\" instructions.\n\n\n\n        9\n      In contemplating its instructions to the jury, the district\ncourt appears to have distinguished between applying the reasonable\ndoubt standard to the decision about whether aggravators outweigh\nmitigators and applying the standard to the jury's ultimate\ndecision on the appropriateness of a capital sentence. See Sampson\nIV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 234-40.      We already have held that the\nreasonable doubt standard is not required in the weighing of\naggravators against mitigators.     See text supra.    There is no\nchallenge on appeal to the correctness of the district court's\napplication of the reasonable doubt standard to the jury's ultimate\nsentencing decision and, in all events, any error in this regard\nwould have favored Sampson and, thus, would have been harmless.\nConsequently, we take no view of the propriety of the distinction\ndrawn by the district court.\n\n                                           -38-\n\f           The FDPA permits the vulnerability of a victim to be used\n\nas an aggravating factor and defines that quality as a showing that\n\nthe victim was \"particularly vulnerable due to old age, youth, or\n\ninfirmity.\"   Id. § 3592(c)(11).       In this case, the government\n\ncontended that Phillip McCloskey was a vulnerable victim.     After\n\nfinding the evidence sufficient to support a vulnerable victim\n\ninstruction vis-à-vis McCloskey, the district court instructed as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Question 3B asks whether it's been proven to\n           each and every one of you beyond a reasonable\n           doubt that Philip McCloskey was particularly\n           vulnerable due to infirmity. In essence, the\n           Federal Death Penalty statute provides that a\n           defendant is especially blameworthy if he\n           murders someone who is particularly vulnerable\n           to being killed because he has an infirmity\n           which made him less able to escape or resist\n           attack than most people. In this context, to\n           be vulnerable means to be subject to being\n           attacked or injured because of some weakness.\n           To be particularly vulnerable means to be\n           especially or significantly vulnerable or to be\n           vulnerable to a particularly high degree.\n\n           An infirmity is a physical or mental weakness\n           or flaw. To prove this aggravating factor, it\n           must also be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n           to each and every one of you that there was a\n           connection between Mr. McCloskey's alleged\n           vulnerability and his death. This means that\n           any infirmity which you find made Mr. McCloskey\n           particularly vulnerable must somehow have\n           contributed to his death.         However, the\n           requirement of a connection between any proven\n           infirmity and a person's death does not mean\n           that the prosecution must prove that the\n           defendant knew of Mr. McCloskey's alleged\n           vulnerability and targeted him because of it.\n           Rather, it means that the prosecution must\n           prove that, once targeted, Mr. McCloskey was\n\n                                -39-\n\f            significantly more vulnerable to being killed\n            because he had an infirmity.\n\n            Sampson alleges that this instruction violated his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights because it did not require the jury to find that he\n\nknew McCloskey was particularly vulnerable due to infirmity and\n\ntargeted McCloskey on that account.          To support this contention, he\n\nargues that this aggravating factor, absent an element of scienter,\n\nwas based on the \"mere happenstance\" of the victim's infirmity,\n\nAppellant's Br. at 179, and did not adequately narrow the class of\n\npersons eligible for the death penalty.           See Arave v. Creech, 507\n\nU.S. 463, 474 (1993).\n\n            Sampson's remonstrance notwithstanding, it is clear that\n\nthe challenged instruction complies with the FDPA.           The statutory\n\nprovision describing this aggravating factor does not contain a\n\nscienter element.       See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(11).    By contrast, other\n\nstatutory        aggravating   factors       contain   explicit   scienter\n\nrequirements.      See, e.g., id. § 3592(c)(5) (requiring a showing that\n\n\"[t]he defendant . . . knowingly created a grave risk of death\"); id.\n\n§ 3592(d)(4) (requiring a showing that the defendant either used a\n\nfirearm or \"knowingly directed . . . another to use a firearm\"); id.\n\n§ 3592(d)(8) (requiring a showing that the defendant was aware of the\n\npresence    of    a   potentially   lethal   adulterant).    Because   \"the\n\nintentional inclusion of a[n] [element] in one part of the statute\n\npersuasively indicates that the exclusion of such a[n] [element] in\n\nanother part of the same statute was intentional,\" Green, 407 F.3d\n\n                                     -40-\n\fat 443, we conclude, without serious question, that Congress did not\n\nintend that application of the vulnerable victim aggravating factor\n\nwould depend upon proof of scienter.\n\n             Sampson's fallback position is that any version of the\n\nvulnerable victim aggravator that omits a scienter requirement is\n\nunconstitutional.    We think not.\n\n             The Supreme Court has stated that an aggravating factor\n\nmust satisfy two criteria in order to comport with the Eighth\n\nAmendment.    First, the statutory language must be clear and specific\n\nenough to furnish guidance to the factfinder.           Arave, 507 U.S. at\n\n470-74.   Second, the factor must provide a principled basis for\n\ndistinguishing between those who deserve capital punishment and those\n\nwho do not.    Id. at 474.   Viewing the FDPA's vulnerable victim factor\n\nthrough the prism of these requirements, we agree with the Fifth\n\nCircuit's conclusion that the aggravator, even without a scienter\n\nrequirement,    satisfies    both   criteria.10   See   United   States   v.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       One member of the panel joins this conclusion on a limited\nbasis. Although Judge Lipez concludes that no constitutional error\noccurred in this case with respect to use of the vulnerable victim\nfactor, he has reservations about the use of the factor, without\nscienter, as the sole aggravating factor making a defendant\neligible for the death penalty.     Given that Sampson was found\neligible in connection with the McCloskey murder based on an\nadditional factor (that the crime was committed in \"an especially\nheinous, cruel, or depraved manner\") and that the evidence showed\nthat Sampson must have been aware of McCloskey's infirmities, see\ninfra Part III(D)(2), the outcome here is consistent with his\nviews.\n\n                                     -41-\n\fBourgeois, 423 F.3d 501, 510-11 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126\n\nS. Ct. 2020 (2006).\n\n             Since vulnerability and infirmity are concepts that are\n\neasily understandable by the average juror, the plain language in\n\nwhich the factor is couched supplies adequate guidance to jurors and\n\njudges.    Cf. Arave, 507 U.S. at 471-72 (concluding that the words\n\n\"cold-blooded\" and \"pitiless\" contained adequate content to guide a\n\ncapital jury). By the same token, the factor effectively narrows the\n\nclass of persons eligible for the death penalty so that not all\n\nvictims can be considered particularly vulnerable due to age or\n\ninfirmity.    See id. at 474 (explaining the importance of such a lack\n\nof universality).     This narrowing effect is well-illustrated in the\n\ncase at hand by the fact that the government did not charge the\n\nvulnerable victim factor with respect to the Rizzo murder.           In the\n\nfinal analysis, then, the vulnerable victim factor provides adequate\n\nguidance to the jury and effectively circumscribes the class of\n\ndefendants to whom it applies.      Consequently, we hold that it passes\n\nEighth Amendment muster.\n\n             In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Sampson\n\nasks us to extrapolate from another line of death penalty cases the\n\nadditional requirement that an aggravating factor must directly\n\nrelate to a defendant's moral culpability (and, thus, his knowledge).\n\nSee Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 149 (1987) (explaining that a\n\ncriminal   sentence    must   be   \"directly   related   to   the   personal\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fculpability of the criminal offender\"); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S.\n\n782, 801 (1982) (stating that punishment must be must be \"tailored\n\nto . . . personal responsibility and moral guilt\").      On this basis,\n\nSampson strives to convince us that the absence of a mental state\n\nrequirement   in    the   vulnerable   victim   factor     renders   it\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n           We are not persuaded.   The Enmund Court invalidated, as\n\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment, the death sentence of a getaway-\n\ncar driver who, although participating in an armed robbery, did not\n\nintend that lethal force be used.      458 U.S. at 801.      The Court\n\nreasoned that the punishment was disproportionate to the conduct and,\n\nthus, violated the Eighth Amendment.   Id. at 797-98.\n\n           In Tison, however, the Court held that death is not a\n\ndisproportionate sentence for a defendant who, while not intending\n\nto kill his victims, is a major player in the underlying felony and\n\ndemonstrates a reckless indifference to human life. 481 U.S. at 157-\n\n58.   If the death penalty is not disproportionate for this type of\n\ndefendant, it follows inexorably that the death penalty is not\n\ndisproportionate for Sampson — a defendant who (the jury found)\n\nintentionally murdered his victims.\n\n           In all events, neither Tison nor Enmund was concerned with\n\nthe evaluation of a specific aggravating factor.   The implausibility\n\nof Sampson's attempted application of these cases to an aggravating\n\nfactor is underscored by the fact that the Supreme Court implicitly\n\n\n                                -43-\n\fhas approved the use of other aggravating factors not directly\n\nrelated to a capital defendant's mental state at the time of the\n\ncrime.   See, e.g., Zant, 462 U.S. at 879 (recognizing the validity\n\nof aggravating factors such as escape from confinement and prior\n\nfelony conviction).   We therefore reject Sampson's claim that the\n\nvulnerable victim factor, as limned by Congress and construed by the\n\ndistrict court, is unconstitutional.\n\n           3.   Especially Heinous, Cruel, or Depraved Conduct.    In\n\naddition to McCloskey's vulnerability, the jury found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that both the Rizzo and McCloskey murders were\n\ncommitted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.    See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(6).   With respect to this statutory aggravating\n\nfactor, the district court instructed as follows:\n\n           As I told you earlier, as a matter of law,\n           premeditated murder alone is not sufficient to\n           make the death penalty a sentencing option.\n           Something more is required. More specifically,\n           one of those \"something mores\" with regard to\n           murder is that a murder must be committed in an\n           especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.\n           However, a person of ordinary sensibility could\n           fairly characterize almost every murder as\n           heinous, cruel, or depraved, the Supreme Court\n           has said. Therefore, something additional must\n           be proven to make this a truly limiting factor\n           and to assure reasonable consistency between\n           cases. In this case, the law provides that the\n           killing can only be especially heinous, cruel,\n           or depraved if it involved serious physical\n           abuse . . . . In this case, \"especially\" has\n           its usual meaning of highly or unusually great.\n           Each of the other relevant terms has a defined\n           meaning for the purposes of the Federal Death\n           Penalty statute. I'll now explain those\n           meanings to you.\n\n                                -44-\n\f\"Heinous\" means shockingly atrocious. In this\ncase, a killing may be found to be especially\nheinous only as a result of any serious\nphysical abuse that's proven.\n\n\"Cruel\" means the defendant intended to inflict\na high degree of pain. In this case, a killing\nmay be found to be especially cruel only as a\nresult of any serious physical abuse that is\nproven.\n\n\"Depraved\" means that the defendant relished\nthe killing or showed indifference to the\nsuffering of the victim. Once again, in this\ncase, a killing may be found to be especially\ndepraved only as a result of any serious\nphysical abuse that is proven.\n\n\"Serious physical abuse\" has a particular legal\nmeaning for the purpose of this case. To prove\nthat the killing . . . involved serious\nphysical abuse, the government must prove that\nMr. Sampson intended to inflict significant\ndamage to [the deceased's] body beyond what Mr.\nSampson thought was necessary to kill him. In\nessence, the government must prove that Mr.\nSampson intended to do more than kill [the\ndeceased]. It must prove that he also intended\nto abuse his body above and beyond what was\nnecessary to kill him. Serious physical abuse\ncan be inflicted either before or after death.\nThe victim does not have to be alive at the\ntime the serious physical abuse is inflicted.\n\nQuestion 3A requires two steps.     First, you\nmust determine whether it has been proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the killing . .\n. involved serious physical abuse, as I just\ndefined it for you.      If you do not agree\nunanimously that this has been proven, you must\nanswer question 3A no and proceed to question\n3B. If you do agree unanimously that serious\nphysical abuse has been proven, you must\ncontinue to the next step. In the second step,\nyou must decide whether that serious physical\nabuse proves that the crime was committed in an\nespecially heinous, an especially cruel, or\n\n\n                     -45-\n\f             especially depraved manner, as I defined those\n             terms for you before.\n\n             You may not consider any aspect of the crime\n             other than proven serious physical abuse in\n             determining whether the killing was especially\n             heinous, especially cruel, or especially\n             depraved.   However, just because an offense\n             involves serious physical abuse does not\n             necessarily mean that it was committed in an\n             especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.\n             Rather, you must decide whether any proven\n             serious physical abuse rendered the killing\n             especially heinous, especially cruel, or\n             especially depraved.\n\n             Sampson   challenges     this     instruction   on   two    primary\n\ngrounds.     First, noting that a defendant generally is entitled to a\n\nrequested instruction on his theory of the case as long as that\n\ntheory is supported by the evidence and the proffered instruction\n\ncorrectly states the law, see United States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920\n\nF.2d 77, 86 (1st Cir. 1990), he argues that the court's words here\n\ndid not adequately communicate, as he requested, that \"if the jury\n\nfound that Mr. Sampson quickly inflicted a series of stab wounds\n\nintending . . . to kill his victims,\" that behavior would not meet\n\nthe \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" criterion.            Appellant's\n\nBr. at 116-17.    Second, Sampson posits that the \"especially heinous,\n\ncruel, or depraved\" factor is unconstitutionally vague.            We consider\n\nthese challenges one by one.\n\n             We need not linger long over the first challenge.            The old\n\nsaw that a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of\n\nthe   case   is   hedged   in   by   several    qualifications.         One   such\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\fqualification is that a court \"need not give instructions in the\n\nprecise form or language requested by the defendant.\"          United States\n\nv. Beltran, 761 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1985).          An instruction suffices\n\nas long as it substantially covers the essence of the defendant's\n\nrequest.    United States v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 30 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nUnited States v. Morris, 700 F.2d 427, 433 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n            Here, assuming Sampson was entitled to his request, see\n\ninfra note 11, the district court's instruction conveyed its essence.\n\nThe court repeatedly emphasized that the jury had to find serious\n\nphysical abuse, which the court defined as \"significant damage to\n\n[the deceased's] body beyond what Mr. Sampson thought was necessary\n\nto   kill   him\"   (emphasis   supplied),   as   a    condition   to   finding\n\nespecially heinous, cruel, or depraved behavior.          The court went on\n\nto clarify that the government had to prove that Sampson intended to\n\ndo more than kill; it also had to prove that he \"intended to abuse\n\n[the deceased's] body above and beyond what was necessary to kill\n\nhim.\" We believe that this instruction accommodates Sampson's theory\n\nthat if he inflicted a series of stab wounds \"intending . . . to\n\nkill,\" that alone would not establish especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved behavior.     Like the instruction in Noone, 913 F.2d at 31,\n\nthe instruction here provided an \"appropriate legal framework for\n\njury consideration of [the defendant's] contention.\"              Hence, the\n\ncourt did not err in refusing to parrot Sampson's preferred wording\n\nin its jury instructions.\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\f           Sampson's        claim     of    unconstitutional          vagueness   also\n\nfalters.   As discussed above, an aggravating factor must provide\n\nadequate guidance to the sentencer.               See Arave, 507 U.S. at 470-74.\n\nThis   requirement     is   satisfied        when    the   factor,     as    expressed,\n\nfurnishes a commonsense core of meaning that a factfinder can\n\nunderstand.      See   Jones,       527    U.S.     at   400    (plurality    opinion);\n\nTuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 973.           The delineation of an aggravator is a\n\nlegislative judgment, see Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 974, and judicial\n\nreview of such judgments is \"quite deferential.\"                    Id. at 973.\n\n           This does not mean, of course, that a reviewing court's\n\nrole is reduced to that of a rubber stamp.                     The Supreme Court has\n\nfound that factors similar to the \"especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved\" factor can present vagueness concerns.                   See, e.g., Maynard\n\nv. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 363-65 (1988) (analyzing Oklahoma's\n\n\"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\" aggravator); Godfrey v.\n\nGeorgia,   446    U.S.      420,     428-29       (1980)       (evaluating    Georgia's\n\n\"outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman\" aggravator).\n\nBut such concerns can be ameliorated by a narrowing construction.\n\nSee Maynard, 486 U.S. at 365; Godfrey, 446 U.S. at 429-32.                     Applying\n\nthis framework, we agree with other courts of appeals that have found\n\nthe FDPA's \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" factor not\n\nunconstitutionally vague when coupled with the type of limiting\n\ninstruction given by the court below. See, e.g., Bourgeois, 423 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                           -48-\n\fat 511; United States v. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d 1237, 1262 (10th Cir.\n\n2000); United States v. Paul, 217 F.3d 989, 1001 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\n             This factor avoids facial vagueness by requiring that the\n\noffense involve serious physical abuse or torture.               See Maynard, 486\n\nU.S. at 364-65 (approving this narrowing construction).                       Here,\n\nmoreover, the district court carefully defined each of the relevant\n\nterms — heinous, cruel, depraved, and serious physical abuse — in a\n\nmanner that was easily understood and that afforded the jurors a\n\ncommonsense core of meaning.       See Walton, 497 U.S. at 653 (deeming\n\nsuch   an   effort   \"constitutionally       significant\").        The    narrowing\n\naccomplished by the statutory inclusion of the serious physical abuse\n\ncomponent,    especially    when   combined     with      the   district    court's\n\nthorough    instructions,    leaves    no     room   to    doubt   the     factor's\n\nconstitutionality.11\n\n             Sampson cites a plethora of state court cases in which\n\nvariants of the \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" factor have\n\nbeen used.    See, e.g., State v. Culberth, 390 So. 2d 847, 851 (La.\n\n1980); Domingues v. State, 917 P.2d 1364, 1377-78 (Nev. 1996); State\n\nv. Hunt, 558 A.2d 1259, 1289-90 (N.J. 1989).              These decisions do not\n\ndictate a result favorable to Sampson in this case.                      While they\n\n\n\n       11\n      While the district court's instruction unquestionably\nprovided the constitutionally-mandated narrowing, we do not hold\nthat the limiting construction here is the only one that would be\nconstitutionally permissible.    We leave open the question of\nwhether a broader definition of serious physical abuse might still\npass constitutional muster.\n\n                                      -49-\n\fillustrate the application of the legal theory discussed above — that\n\nthe enhancement requires proof of more than the harm inherent in\n\nkilling — and demonstrate the individualized evaluation that is\n\ncritical to the constitutional imposition of the death penalty, they\n\ntell us little else.\n\n            Relatedly, Sampson argues for the first time on appeal\n\nthat, by defining each of the component terms — heinous, cruel, and\n\ndepraved — in relation to serious physical abuse, the district court\n\nconflated the factors in a way that might have caused jury confusion.\n\nIn an apparent effort to show that such an error would not be\n\nharmless, he offers a number of articles suggesting that capital\n\njurors often erroneously believe that death is mandatory once an\n\naggravating factor is found.     Because this claim was not preserved\n\nbelow, we review it for plain error.     See Jones, 527 U.S. at 388-89.\n\n            The FDPA requires that the adjectives \"heinous,\" \"cruel,\"\n\nand \"depraved\" all be defined in terms of serious physical abuse or\n\ntorture. See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(6).         The district court found\n\ntorture inapposite here and instructed the jury accordingly.         It\n\nproceeded   to   define   each   adjective    distinctly,   in   easily\n\nunderstandable terms, in relation to serious physical abuse.\n\n            We do not see how painstakingly defining each term as\n\ndictated by the applicable statute could conceivably serve to muddle\n\ncarefully crafted instructions.     To cinch matters, the lower court\n\nclearly outlined the process by which the jury was to determine the\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fappropriate sentence.      Jurors are normally presumed to follow the\n\ntrial court's instructions.       See Jones, 527 U.S. at 394.    We discern\n\nno basis for disregarding that presumption here.       Accordingly, there\n\nwas no harmful error in regard to this instruction.\n\n                            B.    Juror Issues.\n\n           Sampson complains about the dismissal for cause of six\n\njurors and about the district court's allegedly improvident refusal\n\nto dismiss a seventh juror mid-trial.         In each instance, he claims\n\na violation of his constitutional right to an impartial jury.           We\n\naddress these plaints separately.\n\n           1.   Dismissals for Cause.        Sampson assails the district\n\ncourt's   dismissal   of    six    prospective    jurors   who   expressed\n\nreservations about imposing the death penalty.       The baseline rule is\n\nthat a court appropriately may excuse a juror for his views on\n\ncapital punishment if those views \"would prevent or substantially\n\nimpair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with\n\nhis instructions and his oath.\"        Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 45\n\n(1980).   We normally review a trial court's for-cause dismissal of\n\na juror for abuse of discretion.           See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nSoberal, 109 F.3d 64, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1997). This standard of review\n\napplies equally in capital cases.       See Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S.\n\n412, 426 (1985) (noting that \"deference must be paid to the trial\n\njudge who sees and hears the juror\"); see also Purkey, 428 F.3d at\n\n750.\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\f             Here, the record amply supports the district court's\n\nconclusion    that     the    six    dismissed     jurors      would     have      been\n\nsubstantially impaired in the performance of their duties.                          In\n\nreaching   this   conclusion,        we    first   examine     the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding    three   of    the    six    dismissals   and    then    turn   to   the\n\nremaining three dismissals.\n\n             The court had prospective jurors complete questionnaires\n\nin which the jurors, among other things, self-assessed their views\n\nabout the death penalty on a scale of 1 to 10 (with \"1\" meaning\n\n\"strongly favor\" and \"10\" meaning \"strongly oppose\").                  Three of the\n\nsix jurors whom we are considering (Jurors 19, 77, and 205) ranked\n\nhimself/herself as a \"9.\" Another section of the questionnaire asked\n\nresponders to choose the statement that best represented their views;\n\nJurors 19 and 77 selected \"I am opposed to the death penalty, and I\n\nwould have a difficult time voting to impose it.\"                        Juror 205\n\nindicated even stronger opposition, stating that he \"struggle[d] to\n\nimagine a situation where [he] would vote to impose it.\"\n\n             To be sure, even \"those who firmly believe that the death\n\npenalty is unjust may nevertheless serve as jurors in capital cases.\"\n\nLockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 176 (1986).                 But that license is\n\nnot unqualified: the ability of such jurors to serve depends upon\n\nwhether they are able to subrogate their own beliefs to the need to\n\nfollow the court's instructions.             See id.    In this instance, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -52-\n\fdistrict court found that none of the three jurors could satisfy that\n\ncriterion.    We test the court's reasoning.\n\n             After the court inquired whether she automatically would\n\nvote against the death penalty, Juror 19 stated: \"I can't think of\n\nwhat the government would prove that would make me change my opinion\n\non the death penalty.\"      The court then reasonably concluded, upon\n\nobserving    the   prospective   juror's   demeanor   when   she   made   that\n\nassertion, that her views would substantially impair her ability to\n\nperform her duties.\n\n             Juror 77 stated during voir dire that he did not \"really\n\nbelieve that [the death penalty was] the appropriate sentence for\n\nanybody.\"     This declaration left the court with the \"definite\n\nimpression\" that although Juror 77 would \"earnestly try to follow the\n\nlaw,\" he would be substantially impaired in his ability to do so.\n\nThat determination was within the realm of the court's discretion.\n\n             So too the court's dismissal of Juror 205 for cause.         That\n\njuror stated during voir dire that he did not know whether he could\n\nperform the duties required of a juror in a capital case.           He added\n\nthat he would have trouble following the law if it differed from his\n\npersonal views.     Given his responses to the questionnaire, no more\n\nwas required to justify dismissal for cause.\n\n             The other three dismissed jurors all recounted personal\n\ncircumstances that led the court to decide against compelling them\n\nto serve as jurors in a capital case.          Juror 119's questionnaire\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\frevealed that he was a Catholic and a lay member of the Franciscan\n\norder, and that both organizations were opposed to the death penalty.\n\nAlthough he stated that he would not feel obliged to vote against the\n\ndeath penalty on the basis of his religion, he acknowledged that\n\nvoting for the death penalty would put him \"in extremely hot water\n\nwith the church\" and that he could \"get kicked out\" of the Franciscan\n\norder.\n\n             Jurors 14 and 28 revealed that they had close relatives\n\nwith     psychological   problems   and    uttered   repeated   statements\n\nindicating that they would be unable fairly to consider and weigh\n\nevidence of Sampson's mental condition. For example, Juror 14 stated\n\nthat she did not know whether she could balance evidence that Sampson\n\nhad a severe emotional disturbance with other facts in deciding\n\nwhether to impose a death sentence, and that she was \"very concerned\"\n\nabout her ability to put her personal concerns aside.           Juror 28's\n\nquestionnaire indicated that she could not find execution justified\n\nfor a mentally ill person regardless of the facts.      During voir dire,\n\nshe reaffirmed that she did not think that she could impose the death\n\npenalty were she to conclude that Sampson suffered from a serious\n\nmental disturbance.\n\n             There is no precise formula to guide judges in juror-\n\nqualification matters.     Particularly near the margins, on-the-spot\n\njudgment plays an important part in screening out those whose ability\n\nto serve may be compromised.    In each of the three instances we have\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fjust chronicled, the district court determined that the juror's\n\npersonal circumstances were such as to substantially impair his or\n\nher ability to serve impartially in a capital case.                     Each of these\n\ninstances     presented      a    judgment        call.      They     are,    therefore,\n\nparadigmatic      examples       of   a   trial    court's   exercise        of   informed\n\ndiscretion.       In   no    instance       do    we   discern   an    abuse      of   that\n\ndiscretion.\n\n             While Sampson points out that each of these jurors may\n\nhave indicated some degree of willingness to put aside personal\n\nbiases, this fragmentary evidence is insufficient to support a\n\nfinding that the trial court abused its discretion.                     See Witt, 469\n\nU.S. at 425-26 (\"Despite . . . lack of clarity in the printed record,\n\n. . . there will be situations where the trial judge is left with the\n\ndefinite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to\n\nfaithfully and impartially apply the law.\"). Given the relevant body\n\nof evidence, we decline to second-guess the district court's first-\n\nhand impressions.      Accordingly, Sampson's assignment of error fails.\n\n             2.   Juror Misconduct.         We come now to Sampson's claim that\n\nthe district court incorrectly allowed Juror 109 to remain on the\n\npanel despite an admitted interaction with a government witness\n\nduring the trial.      The pertinent facts are as follows.\n\n             On Friday, December 12, 2003, a government expert witness,\n\nDr. Michael Werner, departed the courthouse after completing his\n\ntestimony.     As he was leaving, Juror 109 complimented him on his\n\n\n                                           -55-\n\fmemory.        Dr. Werner did not respond but, rather, reported the\n\ninteraction to the prosecutor.               The prosecutor, in turn, informed\n\ndefense counsel and the district court.\n\n               When trial resumed on Monday, Sampson moved to disqualify\n\nthe juror.          The court held an individual voir dire, questioned the\n\njuror about the details of the interaction, and then queried the\n\nremaining jurors (individually) to determine any potential spillover\n\neffect.    Satisfied that the interaction had been both brief and non-\n\nsubstantive and that Juror 109 remained impartial, the court denied\n\nSampson's      motion.      Sampson    contests      this     ruling,      arguing   that\n\nallowing the juror to remain offended his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\nrights to due process and an impartial jury.\n\n                    Ex parte communications between a juror and a witness\n\nduring trial are presumptively prejudicial, and the trial court is\n\nrequired       to    undertake   an   adequate      inquiry    to    determine       their\n\npotential impact.         See United States v. Gastón-Brito, 64 F.3d 11, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).          Because the district court is \"likely to have a\n\nsuperior 'feel' for the nuances of the case,\" we grant it significant\n\nlatitude with respect to the scope and manner of its inquiry. United\n\nStates    v.    Paniagua-Ramos,       251    F.3d   242,    250     (1st    Cir.   2001).\n\nConsequently, we review both the district court's handling of such\n\nallegations and its ensuing determinations for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee id. at 249.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -56-\n\f           Here, we find no indication that the court misused its\n\ndiscretion. The communication in question was terse, fortuitous, and\n\ndevoid of substantive content.     We have attached significance before\n\nto the fact that a juror's casual ex parte communication did not\n\nconcern the substance of the case, see, e.g., United States v.\n\nAngiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1185 (1st Cir. 1990), and we think it is\n\nappropriate to continue to follow that praxis.\n\n           Here, moreover, the district court's inquiry was virtually\n\na textbook model.     The court's response was swift, its questioning\n\npointed, and its search for any inkling of prejudice thorough. After\n\nmaking a face-to-face assessment of the juror's sincerity and of the\n\npossibility that other jurors had been contaminated, the court\n\nconcluded that the interaction was harmless. That conclusion may not\n\nhave been inevitable, but it plainly was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n                        C.   Evidentiary Rulings.\n\n           Sampson disputes a number of evidentiary rulings.              We\n\nreview   adequately   preserved   objections   to   rulings   admitting   or\n\nexcluding evidence for abuse of discretion.         See United States v.\n\nGobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir. 2006).            If the admission or\n\nexclusion of a piece of evidence occurs as a result of an error of\n\nlaw, that is a per se abuse of discretion.          See Rosario-Urdaz v.\n\nRivera-Hernandez, 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir. 2003); United States\n\nv. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\f             Where evidence is challenged on the ground that the trial\n\ncourt has struck the wrong balance between probative value and\n\nprejudicial effect, we accord great deference to the trier's first-\n\nhand knowledge of the case and ordinarily will sustain the district\n\ncourt's   exercise     of   discretion    unless   its    judgment       is   plainly\n\nincorrect.        United States v. Adams, 375 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    Only unfair prejudice enters into this decisional calculus;\n\n\"[t]he fact that a piece of evidence hurts a party's chances does not\n\nmean it should automatically be excluded.\"                   Onujiogu v. United\n\nStates, 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1987).             In all instances, harmless\n\nerror principles apply.       And, finally, to the extent that a claim of\n\nevidentiary error has not been preserved — that is, when no timely\n\nand pointed objection was advanced below — our review is only for\n\nplain error.      See United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n             With    this   framework    in    place,   we   turn   to    Sampson's\n\nspecific claims of error.\n\n             1.    Crime Scene/Autopsy Evidence.         Sampson challenges the\n\nadmission of certain crime scene and autopsy photographs and related\n\nphysical evidence pertaining to the McCloskey and Rizzo murders. The\n\nfirst aspect of this challenge suggests that the district court\n\nmisapprehended the evidentiary standard prescribed by the FDPA for\n\nsentencing hearings and that, under a correct interpretation, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -58-\n\fevidence in question should have been excluded.                 This suggestion is\n\nunrewarding.\n\n            The FDPA provides that, during a penalty-phase trial,\n\n\"information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by\n\nthe danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or\n\nmisleading the jury.\"            18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).           This language is\n\nsimilar, but not identical, to the language of Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.12   A direct comparison reveals two salient differences.\n\nFirst, Rule 403 requires that probative value be substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice before evidence may be\n\nexcluded, whereas the FDPA omits this substantiality requirement and\n\ndirects that exclusion may result if the scales tip, even slightly,\n\nin favor of unfair prejudice.            Second, the FDPA makes no express\n\nmention    of   the    factors    of   undue      delay,   waste    of   time,   and\n\ncumulativeness as grounds for exclusion.\n\n            The district court enunciated these differences in passing\n\nupon the challenged evidence.            Seizing on this express reference,\n\nSampson    contends      that    the   court      failed   to    appreciate      that\n\ncumulativeness        nevertheless     can   be    prejudicial     or,   at   least,\n\nundervalued cumulativeness in its decisional calculus.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n      Rule 403 provides in pertinent part that \"evidence may be\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"\n\n                                        -59-\n\f             We begin with bedrock: the trial court, in a capital\n\nsentencing proceeding, remains free to consider cumulativeness in\n\nassessing evidentiary proffers.    Cf. United States v. Barnette, 211\n\nF.3d 803, 818-19 (4th Cir. 2000) (considering quantity of victim\n\nimpact evidence presented in determining whether defendant's due\n\nprocess   rights   were   violated).     But   Sampson's   contention   is\n\nincorrect.      The record makes manifest that the district court\n\nconsidered the possible prejudicial effects of cumulativeness when\n\nruling on Sampson's evidentiary objections. There is simply no other\n\nway to explain why the court excluded a number of photographs that\n\nit   thought     \"cumulative,\"   \"redundant,\"      \"duplicat[ive],\"     or\n\n\"repetitive.\"    We thus discern no error in the court's understanding\n\nof the FDPA's evidentiary standard.\n\n             A question remains as to whether the district court's\n\ndecisions that the exhibits possessed probative value outweighing any\n\nassociated bias were adequately supported by the record.       We answer\n\nthat question affirmatively.     The McCloskey and Rizzo crime scene\n\nphotographs and the sock used as a gag in the Rizzo murder were\n\nsignificantly probative of material issues; they corroborated and\n\nclarified testimony regarding the discovery of the bodies and the\n\ngathering of evidence. Similarly, the autopsy photographs shed light\n\non the manner in which each victim was killed (an important integer\n\nin the jury's determination of whether the murders were committed in\n\nan especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner).\n\n\n                                  -60-\n\f            Sampson stresses that the government had other means of\n\nmaking these points, such as by using medical examiner testimony or\n\ndiagrams.   It is, however, axiomatic that \"the evidentiary account\n\nof what a defendant has thought and done can accomplish what no set\n\nof abstract statements ever could, not just to prove a fact but to\n\nestablish its human significance.\"       Old Chief v. United States, 519\n\nU.S. 172, 187-88 (1997).       Thus, within reasonable limits, the\n\nprosecution — even in a capital case — is entitled to present its\n\ncase through the evidence it deems most appropriate.      See id.   Those\n\nlimits were not exceeded here.\n\n            Sampson also complains that decomposition is visible in\n\nsome of the photographs.   While this feature obviously must be taken\n\ninto account in calibrating the balance of probative value and\n\nunfairly prejudicial effect, the record makes clear that the district\n\ncourt gave due weight to it.   Indeed, the court admitted only those\n\nphotographs that \"most closely depicted the condition of the victims\n\nat the time [of the killings].\"    Sampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n            The upshot is that the district court's handling of\n\ngruesomeness concerns, like its handling of the crime scene and\n\nautopsy evidence generally, demonstrated a thoughtful consideration\n\nof potential prejudice.    The court excluded much evidence, redacted\n\nother evidence, gave appropriate limiting instructions, and saw to\n\nit that admitted photographs were displayed circumspectly to the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\fjury.    We are left without any principled basis for finding that the\n\ncourt abused its discretion in regard to this evidence.13\n\n                2.   The Whitney Murder.    Sampson argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in admitting evidence of the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe Whitney murder.           Although he concedes that evidence of the\n\nmurder itself was admissible as a non-statutory aggravating factor,14\n\nhe contends that evidence about the details of the crime (which\n\nincluded photographs, taped confessions, and testimony from crime\n\nscene        investigators   and   the   medical      examiner)   was   not   really\n\nrelevant and, in all events, had a high potential for unfair\n\nprejudice.\n\n                We find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the\n\nWhitney evidence.        The FDPA broadly provides that \"[t]he government\n\nmay present any information relevant to an aggravating factor for\n\nwhich notice has been provided.\"                Id.   Here, the government gave\n\nadequate notice that it would introduce evidence of the Whitney\n\nmurder as a non-statutory aggravator, and the district court found\n\n\n        13\n      Although several of the photographs to which Sampson now\nobjects were not challenged in the district court, we need not\nfilter them through the plain error screen. It suffices to say\nthat there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's\nadmission of these photographs.\n        14\n      The term \"non-statutory aggravating factor\" is used to \"refer\nto any aggravating factor that is not specifically described in 18\nU.S.C. § 3592.\"    Jones, 527 U.S. at 377 n.2.     While only the\nfinding of a statutory aggravating factor can render a defendant\ndeath-eligible, the jury may consider non-statutory aggravating\nfactors in deciding whether a sentence of death is appropriate.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c)-(e).\n\n                                         -62-\n\fthat the evidence actually admitted would help the jury to determine\n\nhow much weight it should give this factor in its sentencing\n\ncalculus.   The evidence made the murder more real, demonstrated the\n\nevolution of Sampson's methods, and served to rebut his claims of\n\nmental impairment and remorse.\n\n            Sampson's   counter     —     that   the   prosecution    could     have\n\nestablished the details of the Whitney murder through his confession\n\nalone — is unavailing.        After all, the prosecution is entitled to\n\nconsiderable latitude in deciding how to present its case.                 See Old\n\nChief, 519 U.S. at 187-88.         Here, moreover, the district court was\n\nassiduous in its efforts to prevent unfair prejudice; for example,\n\nit excluded all the Whitney victim impact evidence and many of the\n\nproffered photographs. It also instructed the jury about the proper\n\nrole of the evidence admitted.          Taking everything into account, we\n\nfind the district court's judgments with respect to the Whitney\n\nevidence to be well within the encincture of its discretion.\n\n            3.     Other     Prosecutions.         Among   the     compendium     of\n\nmitigating factors presented to the jury, Sampson proposed to prove\n\nthat numerous other federal defendants convicted of multiple murders\n\nhad not been sentenced to death.               In support of this mitigating\n\nfactor, he sought to introduce verdict sheets and descriptive\n\nmaterial relating to 71 other federal capital cases. The government\n\nopposed   the    admission    of   this    evidence,     arguing    that   it    was\n\nirrelevant as it did not bear either on Sampson's character or\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\frecord or on the circumstances of the offenses at issue.                    See 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   3592(a)(8).       Sampson   trimmed   the   number      of    proposed\n\ncomparators to 47, and the district court determined that the\n\nevidence was arguably relevant in mitigation. The court then ruled,\n\nhowever, that the evidence's probative value was outweighed by the\n\nlikelihood of juror confusion.           On appeal, Sampson contests the\n\nexclusion of this evidence.\n\n             Sampson maintains, albeit in very general terms, that this\n\nevidence was relevant and that, under Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S.\n\n274, 284-85 (2004), a trial court may not restrict the presentation\n\nof relevant evidence offered in mitigation of a possible death\n\nsentence.     This argument cannot be literally true; if it were, a\n\ncapital defendant would have an unrestricted license to introduce\n\nthe   most   confusing    or   misleading    evidence    as   long    as    it   was\n\nmarginally relevant.       We reject so absolutist a view.           See Purkey,\n\n428   F.3d   at   756   (explaining   that   the   FDPA's     low    barriers    to\n\nadmission of evidence in a capital sentencing hearing \"do[] not mean\n\nthat the defense has carte blanche to introduce any and all evidence\n\nthat it wishes\"); cf. Oregon v. Guzek, 126 S. Ct. 1226, 1232 (2006)\n\n(commenting that \"the Eighth Amendment does not deprive [states] of\n\n[their] authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a\n\ndefendant can submit\").\n\n             This does not end the matter, however, for it seems\n\nappropriate to construe Sampson's argument as an argument that the\n\n\n                                      -64-\n\fdistrict court erred in balancing probative value against likelihood\n\nof juror confusion.     Framing the issue in that manner brings the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning into sharp focus.          The court explained\n\nthat it had found numerous omissions and inaccuracies in the case\n\nsummaries that Sampson proffered and that these defects greatly\n\ndiminished their probative worth.          The court also found that the\n\nquantity of evidence involved would saturate the record with largely\n\nextraneous material and create a grave risk of juror confusion.            The\n\ncourt noted:\n\n          In order to determine which of the many other\n          cases are sufficiently similar to this case to\n          bear on the question of proportionality, the\n          jury would have had to hear a large amount of\n          evidence. In effect, the court would have had\n          to conduct many mini-trials of other FDPA cases,\n          since a jury would be unable to perform\n          meaningful proportionality review based on brief\n          summaries of other cases. Rather, in order to\n          fully appreciate the verdicts reached in those\n          cases, jurors in this case would have had to\n          hear substantial testimony regarding the crime\n          and the defendant in the other cases.        The\n          amount of time that would have had to be spent\n          educating jurors regarding all other FDPA cases\n          in a non-prejudicial manner, which could have\n          been measured in weeks or months, as compared to\n          the amount of time spent on the mitigation case\n          as a whole, likely would have diverted the\n          jury's focus from the facts relating to Sampson\n          and his crimes.\n\nSampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 196.\n\n          On   this   chiaroscuro    record,   we   are   not   disposed    to\n\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the district court.              Having\n\nsupportably found that the evidence was of limited probative value\n\n\n                                    -65-\n\fand   that   its     introduction    would       create   a   high    risk   of    juror\n\nconfusion, the district court had ample reason to exclude it.                        See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).15\n\n             4.      Bank Robberies.        Next, Sampson contends that the\n\ndistrict     court    erred   in    (i)    admitting      evidence     of    the    five\n\nantecedent bank robberies that he committed in North Carolina and\n\n(ii) submitting four of them to the jury as potential non-statutory\n\naggravating factors.16        He asserts that the bank robberies satisfy\n\nneither the requirement that an aggravating factor \"genuinely narrow\n\nthe class of persons eligible for the death penalty,\" Zant, 462 U.S.\n\nat 877, nor the requirement that an aggravating factor rationally\n\ndistinguish \"those who deserve capital punishment from those who do\n\nnot,\" Arave, 507 U.S. at 474.\n\n             These    assertions    are     meritless.        Under    the   district\n\ncourt's instructions, four of the bank robberies served as potential\n\nnon-statutory aggravating factors — that is, as aggravating factors\n\nto be considered by the jury only after it found at least one\n\nstatutory aggravating factor to be present in the case.                           See 18\n\n\n\n      15\n      This determination renders it unnecessary for us to address\nthe government's alternate argument that this evidence did not in\nany event qualify as mitigating evidence.\n      16\n      Based on testimony that Sampson did not have a weapon during\none of the robberies, the district court ultimately submitted only\nfour of the robberies to the jury as potential aggravators.\nSampson makes no specific complaint about the singular handling of\nthe fifth (unarmed) robbery, which the court instructed the jury to\ndisregard.\n\n                                          -66-\n\fU.S.C. § 3593(e).        A non-statutory aggravating factor need only\n\n\"direct the jury to the individual circumstances of the case.\"\n\nJones, 527 U.S. at 402 (plurality opinion); see also Tuilaepa, 512\n\nU.S. at 972 (noting \"a separate requirement for the selection\n\ndecision,   where     the   sentencer   determines    whether     a   defendant\n\neligible    for    the   death   penalty    should   in   fact   receive   that\n\nsentence\").       So long as it meets this requirement, a non-statutory\n\naggravating factor ordinarily will pass constitutional muster.              See\n\nJones, 527 U.S. at 401-02 (plurality opinion).\n\n            The four bank robberies pass muster under this standard.\n\nThe government introduced evidence of the heists to demonstrate\n\nSampson's escalating criminality immediately prior to the string of\n\nmurders that he committed.       Because not every capital defendant will\n\nhave exhibited such a pattern, this evidence necessarily directed\n\nthe jurors to the individualized circumstances of Sampson's case.\n\nCf. id. at 402 (finding victim impact and victim vulnerability\n\nacceptable as non-statutory factors because they were \"inherently\n\nindividualized\"). Consequently, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion either in admitting evidence anent the bank\n\nrobberies or in authorizing the jury to consider four of those\n\nrobberies as potential non-statutory aggravating factors.\n\n            5.     Spectator Reactions.       Sampson's final evidentiary\n\nchallenge is non-traditional in nature.          It does not relate to the\n\nadmission or exclusion of evidence per se but, rather, to the\n\n\n                                     -67-\n\fdistrict court's denial of his motion for a mistrial based on the\n\nreactions of individuals in the gallery (particularly the victims'\n\nfamilies) to certain items of evidence.\n\n           This argument is a difficult one to make.           For one thing,\n\nvictim-impact    evidence,     although      inflammatory    by   nature,   is\n\ngenerally admissible in the sentencing phase of a capital case.             See\n\nPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991).              For another thing,\n\nCongress has embedded the right of victims' families to attend an\n\naccused murderer's trial in federal law.          See 18 U.S.C. § 3510(b);\n\n42 U.S.C. § 10607(e)(2)(B).\n\n           Despite these obvious obstacles, Sampson asserts that, in\n\nthis case, the victims' families' ongoing reactions to the evidence\n\npresented were unfairly prejudicial.           He moved for a mistrial on\n\nthis ground, but the district court rebuffed his entreaty.                   He\n\nrenews the argument in this venue.\n\n           We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial under an\n\nabuse of discretion rubric.      United States v. Flecha-Maldonado, 373\n\nF.3d 170, 177 (1st Cir. 2004).        In administering that standard, we\n\nkeep in mind that \"[a] mistrial is a last resort that is only\n\nordered if the demonstrated harm cannot be cured by less drastic\n\nmeans.\"   United States v. De Jesus Mateo, 373 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           In   this   case,    the    district    court    exhibited   great\n\nsensitivity to the volatility of the issues and took a number of\n\n\n                                      -68-\n\fsteps to minimize the risk of unfair prejudice from the gallery's\n\nreactions.        The   court    carefully     instructed    the        jurors   at   the\n\nbeginning of the trial that they were to decide the case based on\n\nthe evidence; it cautioned that \"anything you see or hear or read,\n\neven, outside of the bar that divides the lawyers and you from the\n\npublic is not evidence.\"           The court repeated this warning when the\n\ndefense raised concerns about a particular juror who appeared to be\n\nwatching the gallery intently, and added that the jurors \"should\n\nstay focused on what's occurring inside the rail and not on the\n\noutside of the rail.\"\n\n            Jurors are presumed to follow instructions.                     See id. at\n\n73; see also United States v. Benedetti, 433 F.3d 111, 118 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)   (according         substantial       weight    to        such     prophylactic\n\ninstructions in evidentiary claims of                 unfair prejudice).              The\n\ndistrict court questioned each juror individually in response to the\n\ndefense's concerns, dismissing one juror based on his replies.                        The\n\ncourt expressed \"great confidence\" in the rest of the jurors after\n\nthorough questioning.\n\n            The    court    also    took   a    variety     of    other     prudential\n\nmeasures.    For example, it requested that the Rizzo family members\n\nrelocate within the courtroom when a suspicion arose that they were\n\nseated in too prominent a place and that their seating might\n\ninfluence the jury.             (Indeed, the Rizzos were relocated to an\n\noverflow room when particularly disturbing evidence was presented.)\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\f           We need not tarry.                Although this was an emotion-laden\n\ntrial, the district court appears to have gone the extra mile to\n\nensure that the jury remained focused on the evidence and free from\n\nextraneous influences.           Given the measures that the district court\n\nprudently took to prevent unfair prejudice, we discern no basis for\n\na claim that the court abused its discretion in denying Sampson's\n\nmotion for a mistrial.17\n\n                        D.    Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n           In    addition        to    his    specific     evidentiary   challenges,\n\nSampson makes an overall claim that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's            finding of certain aggravating factors. We\n\nevaluate sufficiency challenges de novo, determining whether a\n\nrational   juror    could       have    found       the   disputed   facts     beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.            See United States v. Soler, 275 F.3d 146, 153\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).             In making this determination, we consider the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, giving the\n\nprevailing      party    (here,       the     government)     the    benefit    of   all\n\n\n     17\n      Sampson's invocation, by way of Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j), of the concurrences in Carey v. Musladin, 127 S.\nCt. 649, 654-58 (2006) (Stevens, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.,\nconcurring), does not alter our analysis. He cites the statements\ncontained therein as indicia of the Supreme Court's concerns over\nthe potential for improper influence represented by the conduct of\nspectators. However, these concurrences focus on the impact that\naffirmative demonstrations by spectators (there, the wearing of\nbuttons by spectators that featured an image of the victim) may\nhave during the guilt phase of a trial. The claim here is of a\nmaterially different character: the families' reactions to\nSampson's crimes are a natural by-product of relevant evidence\nproperly introduced during the sentencing phase.\n\n                                             -70-\n\freasonable inferences and resolving credibility questions in its\n\nfavor.   See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 200 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n           Sampson suggests that we should review the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence of especially heinous, cruel, or depraved conduct\n\nthrough a less deferential glass.       This suggestion derives from the\n\nprinciple that review of this aggravator ordinarily calls for\n\nassaying the evidence in light of a narrowing construction.             See\n\nBell v. Cone, 543 U.S. 447, 453-57 (2005).\n\n           Sampson's suggestion dislodges the principle from its\n\ncontextual underpinnings.       In the case at bar, this aggravating\n\nfactor   was    adequately   narrowed   by   the   district   court's   jury\n\ninstructions, see supra Part III(A)(3), which incorporated the\n\nFDPA's \"serious physical abuse\" language.            We therefore reject\n\nSampson's attempted tweaking of the standard of review and turn to\n\nhis specific challenges.\n\n           1.     Especially Heinous, Cruel, or Depraved Conduct.\n\nSampson notes that some of his post-arrest statements demonstrate an\n\nintent to kill his victims rapidly and that portions of the medical\n\nexaminer testimony corroborate this intent.             Building   on   that\n\nfoundation, he contends that a rational juror could not have found\n\nthat he inflicted \"serious physical abuse\" on McCloskey and Rizzo\n\nbeyond what was necessary to end their lives.           On this basis, he\n\n\n\n\n                                   -71-\n\fposits that the especially heinous, cruel, or depraved aggravating\n\nfactor was not supported by the evidence.\n\n              This     view    of   the      record     completely     disregards    the\n\nsubstantiality of the evidence supporting the jury's finding.                       With\n\nrespect to McCloskey, Sampson inflicted no fewer than 24 separate\n\nstab wounds.         In describing the slaying, he stated in a confession\n\nthat he \"didn't want to stop.\"                   He also admitted that he slit\n\nMcCloskey's throat after McCloskey said that he was dying.                          This\n\nevidence      easily    supported       a    reasonable     inference    that   Sampson\n\nintended to — and did — inflict serious physical abuse, well beyond\n\nwhat was necessary to kill McCloskey.                   Although Sampson adverts to\n\nsome evidence from which the jury might have reached a different\n\nconclusion (for example, his insistence to the police that McCloskey\n\n\"didn't suffer\"), the jurors had both the right and the obligation\n\nto    weigh   all     the     evidence,      judge    the   sources'    veracity,    and\n\ndetermine its significance.                 See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d\n\n707, 713 (1st Cir. 1992).               As long as \"the jury's decipherment of\n\nthe    record    represented        a       plausible    choice    among   reasonable\n\nalternatives,\" it is deserving of respect.                   Id.\n\n              So, too, the jury's finding of especially heinous, cruel,\n\nor depraved conduct in relation to the Rizzo murder.                     Sampson first\n\nimmobilized Rizzo by tying him to a tree.                   Although he had learned\n\nthrough his experience with McCloskey that slitting a victim's\n\nthroat would kill swiftly, he nevertheless inflicted 15 stab wounds\n\n\n                                             -72-\n\fon Rizzo (several of which were themselves potentially fatal).                         At\n\nsome point during the repetitive stabbing, he cut his victim's\n\nthroat, severing the jugular vein and trachea.                    We think that this\n\nevidence,    viewed   in   the     light   most      favorable      to    the    verdict,\n\nunarguably sustains a conclusion that Sampson perpetrated serious\n\nphysical abuse (and thus, could be found guilty of especially\n\nheinous,    cruel,    or   depraved      conduct).          See   United     States    v.\n\nHernández, 218 F.3d 58, 66 n.5 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that it\n\nis not an appellate court's role \"to resolve conflicts in the\n\nevidence\").\n\n            2.    Vulnerability.        Sampson next argues that the evidence\n\ndoes not support the jury's characterization of McCloskey as a\n\nparticularly vulnerable victim because of the absence of any nexus\n\nbetween McCloskey's vulnerability and his death.                         This claim is\n\nunconvincing.\n\n            McCloskey's     son-in-law       testified        that       McCloskey    had\n\nundergone open-heart surgery (a quintuple bypass) approximately one\n\nyear prior to his encounter with Sampson; that he was overweight and\n\nbecame short of breath easily; and that he had difficulty walking\n\nfifteen feet shortly before his murder.              Sampson's admission that he\n\nhad   to   help   McCloskey   up    a    hill   to    the    site    of    the    slaying\n\ncorroborated this testimony.             This evidence sufficed to ground a\n\nconclusion that McCloskey was a particularly vulnerable victim, that\n\nis, that he would have had a more difficult time escaping from his\n\n\n                                         -73-\n\fassailant than the average person.            See United States v. Gill, 99\n\nF.3d 484, 486 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that the vulnerable victim\n\nfederal   sentencing     guideline     is   \"primarily    concerned     with   the\n\nimpaired capacity of the victim to . . . prevent the crime\").                  And\n\ngiven the circumstances of this case, McCloskey's vulnerability\n\neasily could have contributed to his death.              No more was exigible.\n\nCf. Paul, 217 F.3d at 1001-02 (holding vulnerable victim factor\n\nsufficiently supported by evidence that victim was 82 and physically\n\nunable to resist attackers).\n\n           The   cases    on   which    Sampson   relies    do   not    demand   a\n\ndifferent result.      In United States v. Johnson, 136 F. Supp. 2d 553\n\n(W.D. Va. 2001), the victim was killed instantly by an explosion,\n\nand the district court precluded any consideration of a vulnerable\n\nvictim    aggravating      factor      because    the    victim's      particular\n\nvulnerability — her pregnancy — was not in any way related to her\n\ndeath.    See id. at 560.      In Francis v. State, 808 So. 2d 110 (Fla.\n\n2001), the only evidence of vulnerability was that the otherwise\n\nhealthy victims were 66 years of age.            See id. at 139.       Neither of\n\nthese decisions is apposite here.\n\n           By like token, Sampson's reliance on McCloskey's attempts\n\nto fight back is misplaced.            There is arguably some evidence of\n\nself-defense (such as the fact that McCloskey suffered several\n\ndefensive wounds).       However, as presented to the jury, the finding\n\nthat McCloskey was a vulnerable victim could have rested on his\n\n\n                                       -74-\n\finability    to   resist      attack   or   his     inability    to    escape.     The\n\nevidence, taken in the aggregate, was sufficient to allow the jury\n\nto find that McCloskey was a particularly vulnerable victim within\n\nthe purview of the FDPA.           See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(11).\n\n                              E.   New Trial Issues.\n\n            During the penalty-phase trial, Sampson attempted to prove\n\nseveral mitigating factors involving alleged mental illness.                     These\n\nincluded that, at the time of the killings, his \"capacity to conform\n\nhis   conduct     to   the   requirements      of   the   law    was   significantly\n\nimpaired,\"   that      he    was   functioning      \"under   a   severe   mental    or\n\nemotional disturbance,\" and that he was \"mentally ill.\"                     No juror\n\nfound that Sampson had demonstrated the existence of any of these\n\nfactors by a preponderance of the evidence.                  Sampson now assigns\n\nerror to the district court's rejection of his claims that the\n\njurors (i) should have found in his favor on one or more of these\n\nproffered mitigating factors, and (ii) misapplied the relevant\n\ninstructions.18\n\n            Since these claims were raised by way of a motion for a\n\nnew trial, we review the district court's disposition of them under\n\nan abuse of discretion rubric.              See United States v. George, 448\n\n\n\n      18\n      Sampson's quest for a new trial also included a claim that\nthe jury exhibited unfair prejudice due to a so-called \"white\nvictim\" effect.    What we have written earlier, see supra Part\nII(C)(1), fully disposes of the claim that the district court erred\nin denying this aspect of Sampson's motion for a new trial.\n\n\n                                        -75-\n\fF.3d 96, 101 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Wilkerson, 251 F.3d\n\n273, 278 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            1.      The   Mental    Illness   Mitigators.       We    start    with\n\nSampson's claim that the jury's failure to find mitigating mental\n\nillness factors was against the weight of the credible evidence.\n\n            The record contains a plethora of mental health evidence.\n\nThe government called numerous witnesses who had interacted with\n\nSampson during his week-long killing spree to demonstrate that he\n\nappeared calm, polite, and capable of normal discourse with others.\n\nThe defense offered the testimony of a social worker and several\n\nprison officials to inform the jury about Sampson's behavioral\n\npatterns and mental health history.            Both sides presented expert\n\nwitnesses   who     testified      about   mental   illness    in    general    and\n\nSampson's mental health in particular.\n\n            Taken    as   a   whole,   the    evidence   was   freighted       with\n\ncontradictions.      These contradictions, however, were grist for the\n\njury's mill.      See, e.g., Blake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d 43, 47-48\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The dispositive consideration is that the record\n\ncontains more than enough evidence to warrant the conclusion that\n\nSampson's mental health need not be regarded as a mitigating factor.\n\n            There was, for example, expert testimony that Sampson\n\nsuffered from an antisocial personality disorder rather than from\n\nsome form of mental illness.           The record likewise contains expert\n\ntestimony that, during the killing spree, Sampson was not impaired\n\n\n                                       -76-\n\fin his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the\n\nlaw.   The same expert vouchsafed that Sampson's crimes were not the\n\nproduct of mental illness, emotional distress, or drug use.                The\n\ngovernment supplemented and supported this testimony through lay\n\ntestimony,    medical     and     psychiatric    records,    Sampson's     own\n\nstatements, and effective cross-examination of defense witnesses.\n\nIn the end, a jury reasonably could have concluded — as this jury\n\ndid — that Sampson did not suffer from any mental impairments\n\nsufficient to mitigate any need for the imposition of a death\n\nsentence.\n\n            Sampson accurately notes that the district court expressed\n\nsome disagreement with the jury on this point.              But the district\n\ncourt parted ways with the jury only on a relatively narrow issue:\n\nwhether Sampson suffered from bipolar disorder (the court indicated\n\nthat   it   found   the   defense's   expert    more   persuasive   than   the\n\ngovernment's expert on this point).          The jury was entitled to find\n\notherwise.    See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 713.\n\n            To cinch matters, the district court, after expressing its\n\nopinion, stated clearly that it \"d[id] not . . . find that the\n\nevidence on this issue predominate[d] heavily in favor of the\n\ndefendant being found to be bipolar\" and that, therefore, \"it\n\n[would] not [be] appropriate for the court to disregard the jury's\n\ndecision on the mitigating factor of mental illness.\"           Sampson III,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 331.         In light of that finding — which is borne\n\n\n                                      -77-\n\fout by the record — the district court had no choice but to honor\n\nthe jury's determination.    See United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d\n\n318, 322 (1st Cir. 1986) (emphasizing that a trial judge \"is not a\n\nthirteenth juror\" and may not \"set aside a verdict merely because he\n\nwould have reached a different result\").    Like the district court,\n\nwe too reject Sampson's challenge to the jury's mental illness\n\nfindings.\n\n            2.    Post-Trial Juror Statements.     We turn next to a\n\nrelated matter.    A week or so after the jury returned its verdict,\n\na local newspaper quoted a juror to the effect that Sampson's\n\nability to \"know[] the difference between right and wrong\" was the\n\n\"fulcrum on which everything else balanced.\"     In a separate account,\n\nthe same juror reportedly stated that Sampson \"knew right from\n\nwrong.\"\n\n            Sampson interpreted these statements as evidence that the\n\njury had misapplied the court's \"mental illness\" instructions, which\n\nexplained that no one had argued that Sampson \"was completely unable\n\nto conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\"       Based on\n\nthis suspected misapplication, Sampson moved for a new trial or, in\n\nthe alternative, an evidentiary hearing.   The district court turned\n\nhim down, reasoning in part that post-trial juror statements could\n\nnot be used to impeach a verdict.        See Fed. R. Evid. 606(b).\n\nSampson now assigns error.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -78-\n\f            Rule 606(b) provides in pertinent part that, after a jury\n\nhas returned its verdict, juror statements may not be considered \"as\n\nto any matter . . . occurring during the course of the jury's\n\ndeliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other\n\njuror's mind . . . or concerning the juror's mental processes in\n\nconnection therewith.\"        The statements upon which Sampson relies\n\nordinarily would fall squarely within this prohibition: they concern\n\nthe jurors' evaluation of the mental health evidence and the weight\n\nthat they chose to attach to that evidence.\n\n            Although   conceding    that      Rule     606(b)    would    bar    the\n\nstatements under most circumstances, Sampson asseverates that they\n\nnevertheless should be admitted because, in capital sentencing\n\nproceedings, the FDPA displaces the Federal Rules of Evidence.                   His\n\nfallback position is that the heightened interest in the reliability\n\nof capital sentencing determinations trumps Rule 606(b).\n\n            We need not decide the issue.            Even if we assume, purely\n\nfor argument's sake, that the juror's statements should have been\n\ntaken into consideration, any error would have been manifestly\n\nharmless.     In that regard, we concur with the district court's\n\nalternate holding that the statements do not indicate that the jury\n\nnecessarily    misunderstood     the    court's      instructions        on   mental\n\nillness.    Given the reference to a \"fulcrum on which everything else\n\nbalanced,\"    the   juror's   statements      easily    can     be   construed    as\n\nreferring to the weighing decision rather than the special findings\n\n\n                                       -79-\n\fregarding the mental illness mitigators.              Thus, there was no abuse\n\nof discretion in the district court's refusal to grant either a new\n\ntrial or an evidentiary hearing               based on Sampson's objections to\n\nthe jury's mental illness findings.\n\n                            F.    Cumulative Error.\n\n            Sampson's penultimate claim is that the errors of which he\n\ncomplains,    even    if    not        mandating   reversal     when   considered\n\nseparately, collectively require that his sentence be vacated. We do\n\nnot dispute the legal premise on which this argument rests: \"a\n\ncolumn of errors may sometimes have a logarithmic effect, producing\n\na total impact greater than the arithmetic sum of its constituent\n\nparts.\"    United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    Here, however, the district court handled the case patiently\n\nand   sensitively.     None       of    its    individual   rulings    worked   any\n\ncognizable harm to Sampson's rights.               It necessarily follows that\n\nthe cumulative error doctrine finds no foothold in this appeal.\n\nIV.   ARBITRARINESS\n\n            In the final chapter of this appeal, we must independently\n\nevaluate, as required by the FDPA, \"whether the sentence of death\n\nwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other\n\narbitrary factor.\"         18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(1).            Having assiduously\n\nperformed that examination, we find no sign that any such factors\n\ncontributed to Sampson's sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -80-\n\f            The results of the jury's deliberations fully support this\n\nconclusion.   In addition to finding the aggravating factors that we\n\nhave discussed, the jurors failed to find other aggravating factors\n\nsuggested by the government.      Moreover, the jurors found several\n\nmitigating factors.      Viewed collectively, these findings suggest\n\nthat the jury considered the evidence in a thorough, even-handed,\n\nand dispassionate manner.    Cf. Paul, 217 F.3d at 1004-05 (finding no\n\narbitrariness when the jury followed \"exactly the process [it] was\n\nto complete\").\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject Sampson's principal assignments of error.        To the extent\n\nthat he has raised other claims of error, none requires discussion,\n\nand we reject them out of hand.\n\n            We add only that Sampson has been ably represented by\n\nlearned counsel.      His positions have been vigorously asserted.\n\nWhile we are aware that death is the ultimate punishment, we are\n\npersuaded   that   the   sentencing   proceedings   in   this   case   were\n\nconducted fairly and with      scrupulous attention to the process\n\nrequired by law.    Accordingly, we affirm the sentence of death.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -81-\n\f",

This is a landmark case; for the\n\nfirst time in its history, this court must review a sentence of\n\ndeath imposed by a federal judge.          To that extent, we are writing\n\non a pristine page.       We are guided in this pathbreaking endeavor,\n\nhowever, by a variety of reliable sources, including Supreme Court\n\nprecedent, decisions of other courts of appeals in capital cases,\n\nand legal principles of general application.\n\n              With this brief preface, we turn to the particulars of\n\nthe case at hand.        Defendant-appellant Gary Lee Sampson entered a\n\nguilty plea to two counts of carjacking resulting in death.               See 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   2119(3).     On   January    29,   2004,   the   district   court\n\nsentenced Sampson to death on the recommendation of a jury of his\n\npeers.\n\n              Sampson's appeal from his sentence raises a host of\n\nclaims.       The first six include five claims that contest the\n\nconstitutionality of the Federal Death Penalty Act, 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n3591-3598 (FDPA), pursuant to which the district court pronounced\n\nsentence, and one that contests the constitutionality of the death\n\npenalty in general.        There follows a litany of claims concerning\n\nalleged errors specific to Sampson's penalty-phase trial.                   The\n\ndistrict court's rulings on many of these issues are embodied in a\n\nseries of published opinions. See United States v. Sampson, 335 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 166 (D.

In\n\nthe end, we reject Sampson's asseverational array in its entirety\n\nand affirm his capital sentence.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We briefly recount the facts underlying Sampson's claims.\n\nMany of these facts are rehearsed in Sampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n174-75, and McCloskey v. Mueller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202217\"><a href=\"/opinion/202217/mccloskey-v-mueller/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264-65 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), and we assume the reader's familiarity with those opinions.\n\n           Sampson committed a series of bank robberies in North\n\nCarolina   in   May,     June,    and   July   of   2001.     He   then   fled    to\n\nMassachusetts.     On July 23, he called the FBI's Boston office and\n\noffered to self-surrender. The call was disconnected and, although\n\nhe waited for the police to arrive, Sampson was not apprehended.\n\n           The next day, Phillip McCloskey, a 69-year-old retiree,\n\nwas driving his car in Weymouth, Massachusetts.                    He picked up\n\nSampson, who was hitchhiking.           When McCloskey later tried to drop\n\nSampson off, Sampson pulled out a knife and told McCloskey to keep\n\ndriving.   Once they reached Marshfield, Sampson forced McCloskey\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fout of the car and attempted to restrain him with a belt.               When\n\nMcCloskey resisted, Sampson stabbed him multiple times and then\n\nslit his throat, nearly decapitating him.          Sampson proceeded to\n\nsteal McCloskey's money and tried to steal his car, which would not\n\nstart.\n\n           Three days later, Jonathan Rizzo, a 19-year-old college\n\nstudent, picked up Sampson (who was posing as a stranded traveler)\n\nalong a road in Plymouth.       Sampson forced Rizzo at knifepoint to\n\ndrive to Abington, where Sampson maintained a makeshift campsite.\n\nSampson tied Rizzo to a tree, gagged him with a sock and a bandana,\n\nstabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest, and slit his throat.\n\nAfter Rizzo was dead, Sampson stole his car and drove to New\n\nHampshire.\n\n           On    July   29,   Sampson    broke   into   a   home   on   Lake\n\nWinnipesaukee.      The next day, the caretaker (Robert Whitney)\n\narrived.   Sampson tied him to a chair, gagged him with a washcloth,\n\nand strangled him to death with a rope. Sampson then appropriated\n\nWhitney's car and drove to Vermont.\n\n           On July 31, William Gregory picked up Sampson, who was\n\nhitchhiking, near West Bridgewater, Vermont. Sampson attempted to\n\nforce Gregory at knifepoint onto a dirt road so that he could tie\n\nhim to a tree and steal his car. Gregory, however, pulled into a\n\nrest area and escaped on foot.          Sampson made off with Gregory's\n\ncar.   Later that day, he broke into a home near the Killington ski\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\farea.   He then called 911 and offered to turn himself in for\n\ncarjacking Gregory and for the earlier bank robberies.                        Vermont\n\nstate troopers arrested Sampson at that locus.                      Following his\n\ndetention, Sampson waived his Miranda rights, see Miranda v.\n\nArizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444-45 (1966), and made several detailed\n\nconfessions to the authorities.\n\n            On October 24, 2001, a federal grand jury charged Sampson\n\nwith two counts of carjacking resulting in death (namely, the\n\nmurders of McCloskey and Rizzo).              Sampson offered to plead guilty\n\nin exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole but\n\nthat overture was rejected.\n\n            In   short    order,    the   government        filed   a   superseding\n\nindictment to comply with Ring v.

The district court denied Sampson's\n\nensuing motions for judgment as a matter of law, a new penalty-\n\nphase trial, and other relief.            Sampson III, 332 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n341.    This appeal followed.\n\nII.    THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n\n              Sampson raises six types of constitutional claims.                Most\n\nof them are attacks on the FDPA.              First, Sampson argues that the\n\nFDPA, which authorizes prosecutors to decide whether to seek the\n\ndeath penalty, is unconstitutional because it does not require the\n\naggravating factors needed for a sentence of death to be presented\n\nto a grand jury as mandated by Ring.            Relatedly, he argues that the\n\npresentation of aggravating factors to the grand jury in this case\n\nwas tantamount to executive and judicial redrafting of the statute\n\nin    derogation   of   the     principles    of    separation    of   powers   and\n\nlegislative authority.           Second, Sampson argues that because the\n\nfederal death penalty is so rarely sought or imposed, the FDPA\n\noperates in a fundamentally arbitrary and capricious manner (and,\n\nthus, is invalid as violative of the Eighth Amendment).                 Third, he\n\nargues that the absence of a principled basis for distinguishing\n\nbetween cases in which the federal death penalty is imposed and\n\nthose    in   which   it   is   not   renders      the   FDPA   unconstitutional.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fFourth, he argues that the federal death penalty is sought on the\n\ninvidious basis of race and the irrational basis of geography (and,\n\nthus, is unconstitutional).        Fifth, he argues that continued\n\nenforcement of the federal death penalty will lead to execution of\n\na significant number of innocent persons and that, therefore, the\n\nFDPA and the death penalty itself are unconstitutional.           Finally,\n\nhe argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional.\n\nSampson supports his arguments with Brandeis-brief type information\n\nfrom studies about the operation in fact of the FDPA.\n\n          The district court rejected each of these claims after\n\ncareful analysis.   See Sampson II, 275 F. Supp. 2d at 62-66, 71-94;\n\nSampson I, 245 F. Supp. 2d at 330-38.      Concluding, as we do, that\n\nnearly all of the claims are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent,\n\nwe echo this holding.\n\n          Before addressing the issues, we confirm some basic\n\nprinciples applicable to judicial review.

With these principles in mind, we turn to\n\nSampson's constitutional claims.\n\n                     A.   Ring-Related Claims.\n\n           We begin with Sampson's multi-faceted claim that the FDPA\n\nis unconstitutional under Ring.       Sampson argues that the FDPA\n\n\"suffers from a fatal flaw,\" Appellant's Br. at 199, in that it\n\nprovides for the prosecutor, not a grand jury, to set out by\n\nallegation the aggravating factors necessary for a sentence of\n\ndeath whereas the Constitution, as interpreted by the Ring Court,\n\nrequires that these factors be presented to a grand jury and\n\ncharged in an indictment.     He further argues that allowing the\n\nprosecutor to select the aggravating factors and present them to\n\nthe grand jury in his case constituted \"improper executive and\n\njudicial redrafting of the statute.\"    Id.   We do not agree.\n\n           The FDPA defines the circumstances under which defendants\n\nwho commit certain federal crimes may be eligible for the death\n\npenalty.   A defendant who commits a qualifying offense is death-\n\npenalty eligible only if a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the defendant acted with the statutorily required intent, see\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(b), and that at least one statutorily\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fdefined aggravating factor exists, see id. §§ 3592, 3593(c)-(e).\n\nIt is only after these threshold findings are made that a jury,\n\nconsidering both mitigating and aggravating factors, may determine\n\nthat the death penalty is appropriate.    See id. § 3593(c)-(e).\n\n           Part of the statute, section 3593(a), authorizes the\n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) to determine whether to seek the death\n\npenalty in a particular case.   If the government elects to seek the\n\ndeath penalty, the statute requires it to give the defendant notice\n\nof its election and of the aggravating factors that it plans to\n\nprove.   Id. § 3593(a).\n\n           The FDPA makes no mention of the grand jury.        This\n\nomission is understandable.     Congress enacted the FDPA in 1994\n\nagainst the backdrop of Walton v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112485\"><a href=\"/opinion/112485/walton-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court held that \"the Sixth Amendment does not\n\nrequire that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of\n\nthe sentence of death be made by the jury.\"     Id. at 648 (quoting\n\nHildwin v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112269\"><a href=\"/opinion/112269/hildwin-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640-41 (1989) (per curiam))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).    Essentially, the Walton Court\n\nheld that the facts necessary to render a defendant eligible for\n\nthe death penalty were not elements of the offense itself, making\n\ninapplicable the Fifth Amendment requirement that the elements of\n\nan offense be charged by a grand jury in an indictment.   See id. at\n\n649.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            The Supreme Court first cast doubt on Walton in Jones v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999). There, the Court considered 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119, the carjacking statute involved in this case, and\n\nheld that the statute created three separate offenses.                See Jones,\n\n526 U.S. at 251-52.       It further held that the fact that a defendant\n\ncaused serious bodily injury to another during the commission of a\n\ncrime was an element of a greater offense that had to be both\n\ncharged in an indictment and found by a jury at trial beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.         See id. at 232-39, 252.          In reaching these\n\nconclusions, the Jones Court distinguished the sentencing factors\n\nupheld in Walton.        See id. at 251.\n\n            The   next    Term,   the    Court    held   that   any   fact    that\n\nincreases   the   maximum     authorized       statutory   sentence     \"is   the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\" which\n\nmust be charged in an indictment and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.

New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490, 494 n.19 (2000).\n\n            Finally, in 2002 the Court explicitly overruled Walton.\n\nSee Ring, 536 U.S. at 609.          In the wake of Ring, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent now firmly establishes that the mental culpability and\n\naggravating factors required by the FDPA must — in addition to\n\nbeing included in the government's notice to seek the death penalty\n\n— be presented to a grand jury, charged in the indictment, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.              But as we shall explain, even\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthough this eliminates a background assumption against which the\n\nFDPA was framed, it does not render the statute unconstitutional.\n\n          Sampson contends both that there is a conflict between\n\nthe FDPA and Ring, and that curing the problem would require the\n\nrewriting of the statute, which is a legislative function.             This\n\ncontention is unpersuasive.    The courts that have considered this\n\nthesis uniformly have rejected it. See United States v.

The FDPA does\n\nnot, as Sampson suggests, grant to prosecutors exclusive authority\n\nfor determining the likely existence of aggravating factors.             No\n\nprovision of the FDPA prohibits a grand jury from considering those\n\nfactors necessary for imposition of a death sentence.       The statute\n\nsimply is silent with respect to the function of the grand jury.\n\nIt thus is not rendered facially unconstitutional by Ring.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          Sampson also presents a variation on this theme, arguing\n\nthat the application of Ring to the FDPA requires impermissible\n\njudicial or executive redrafting of the statute.     We think not.\n\n          What is involved in the application of Ring is a matter\n\nof procedure, not of substantive definition regarding death-penalty\n\neligibility.

Id. at 591.

Id. at 572-73.

In Blount, the Supreme Court invalidated\n\ntwo provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act because they did\n\nnot conform to the constitutional requirements of an administrative\n\ncensorship scheme.       400 U.S. at 421-22.            The Court rejected a\n\nproposed severing construction of the statute that itself failed to\n\ncomply with the Constitution and then noted that \"it [was] for\n\nCongress, not [the] Court, to rewrite the statute.\"                   Id. at 419.\n\nIn Booker, the Court refused to graft onto the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines a set of procedures for presenting to a jury facts\n\nnecessary for sentence enhancements.               543 U.S. at 246.      Instead,\n\nthe   Court    severed   from    the   guidelines      the   provision     making\n\nmandatory the effect of sentencing factors not found by a jury.\n\nId.   at   245.     To   do   otherwise,      it    held,    \"would    [have]   so\n\ntransform[ed] the scheme that Congress created that Congress likely\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fwould not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.\"               Id. at\n\n249.\n\n              The statutes in question in Blount and Booker, like the\n\nstatute       in    Jackson,   were    incompatible    with    constitutional\n\nrequirements.        See id. at 227-29; Blount, 400 U.S. at 417.        Saving\n\neither statute, as proposed by the government, while at the same\n\ntime complying with constitutional mandates, would have required\n\nthe Court to perform a complete statutory rewrite, which is a\n\nlegislative and not a judicial function.           In contrast, allowing a\n\ngrand jury to consider and charge aggravating factors under the\n\nFDPA does not have any effect either on the substantive aspects of\n\nthe statute or on the discrete roles that the statute assigns to\n\nthe judge, the prosecutor, and the jury, respectively.\n\n              To sum up, Ring does not render the FDPA unconstitutional\n\neither on its face or as applied in this case.2\n\n                          B.   Arbitrary Operation.\n\n              Sampson makes two arguments in support of his claim that\n\nthe    FDPA    is   unconstitutional    because   it   is   arbitrary   in   its\n\noperation. First, he argues that because the federal death penalty\n\nis infrequently sought and even more infrequently carried out, its\n\nimposition          is    arbitrary,      capricious,         and   therefore\n\n\n       2\n      Sampson's argument that the grand jury lacked authority to\nissue so-called special findings is entirely without merit. There\nis nothing in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that\nprohibits the grand jury from alleging all the elements of an\noffense that it proposes to charge.\n\n                                       -15-\n\funconstitutional.          Sampson centers this argument around Furman v.\n\nGeorgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), in which the Supreme Court struck\n\ndown as unconstitutional the Georgia capital punishment statute\n\nthen in effect.        In a concurring opinion, Justice Stewart stated\n\nthat the death sentences at issue were\n\n                cruel and unusual in the same way that being\n                struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.\n                For, of all the people convicted of rapes and\n                murders in 1967 and 1968, many just as\n                reprehensible   as    [those   committed    by\n                petitioners], the petitioners are among a\n                capriciously selected random handful upon whom\n                the sentence of death has in fact been\n                imposed.\n\nId.   at   309-10     (Stewart,    J.,    concurring)     (footnote     omitted).\n\nSampson argues that Justice Stewart's statement constitutes the\n\nessence of Furman.           See Appellant's Br. at 238 (characterizing\n\nFurman     as    viewing    \"arbitrariness      and   caprice   .   .   .   as   the\n\ninevitable side-effects of a rarely-imposed punishment of death\").\n\nGiven this reading, he argues that because the federal death\n\npenalty is rarely sought or imposed, the FDPA is no different from\n\nthe Georgia statute invalidated in Furman.\n\n                This argument mistakes the nature of the arbitrariness\n\nconcern in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.              In the thirty-four\n\nyears since Furman was decided, the Court has made clear that its\n\ndecision was not based on the frequency with which the death\n\npenalty was sought or imposed. Rather, the primary emphasis of the\n\nCourt's death penalty jurisprudence has been the requirement that\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fthe discretion exercised by juries be guided so as to limit the\n\npotential for arbitrariness.            Thus, in Gregg v.

To the extent\n\nthat there may be an independent constitutional concern as to the\n\ndecisional process by which the government decides if it will seek\n\nthe death penalty, that process contains numerous safeguards built\n\ninto an articulated death penalty protocol.            See United States\n\nA t t o r n e y s '      M a n u a l           §        9 - 1 0 . 0 0 0 ,\n\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/10m\n\ncrm.htm.3 The process, therefore, is not arbitrary.          See Gregg, 428\n\nU.S. at 195.\n\n          Sampson's   second   argument    is        that    the    FDPA   is\n\nunconstitutional   because   there   is   no       principled      basis   for\n\ndistinguishing between those cases in which the federal death\n\npenalty is imposed and those in which it is not.            His argument is\n\npremised on Eddings v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), in which the\n\nSupreme Court stated that \"capital punishment [must] be imposed\n\nfairly, and with reasonable consistency, or not at all.\"               Id. at\n\n\n     3\n      For example, under the protocol, in determining whether to\nrecommend that the Attorney General authorize the prosecutor to\nseek the death penalty, the DOJ will consider \"evidence of racial\nbias against the defendant or evidence that the Department has\nengaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.\" United\nStates        Attorneys'          Manual        §     9-10.050,\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/10m\ncrm.htm#9-10.050. There is no colorable claim that the decision\nwhether to seek the death penalty against Sampson was motivated by\nan impermissible factor such as race. Sampson conceded, as well,\nthat he had no evidence of purposeful or intentional discrimination\nbased on the race of the victim.\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f112.     This argument ignores the remainder of the Eddings Court's\n\ndiscussion of consistency, in which the Court recognized that \"a\n\nconsistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false\n\nconsistency.\"    Id.    Indeed, the thrust of Eddings is that those who\n\nmake   sentencing     decisions   must      be   permitted    to     focus   on   the\n\nindividual characteristics of the defendant and the circumstances\n\nof the crime.       Id.      And, finally, the argument cannot survive\n\nMcCleskey, in which the Court stated that \"[t]he Constitution is\n\nnot offended by inconsistency in results based on the objective\n\ncircumstances of the crime.              Numerous legitimate factors may\n\ninfluence . . . a defendant's ultimate sentence, even though they\n\nmay be irrelevant to his actual guilt.\"                481 U.S. at 307 n.28.\n\n            In all events, the \"evidence\" that Sampson submits is\n\nwholly inadequate to prove that the death penalty has been imposed\n\nin an arbitrary manner.        The summaries on which Sampson relies to\n\ndemonstrate inconsistency are devoid of details and fail to account\n\nfor the objective circumstances of the underlying crimes. Even the\n\nmore detailed verdict sheets that he submitted to the district\n\ncourt fail to establish arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.\n\nOn this record and mindful of the teachings of McCleskey, we\n\ndecline    Sampson's    invitation     to     ignore    individual     differences\n\nacross    offenders    and    offenses.          Consequently,       there   is   no\n\nprincipled    basis    for   finding     that    similar     cases    are    treated\n\ndifferently.\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f                       C.   Other Challenges to the FDPA.\n\n            Sampson's remaining challenges to the constitutionality\n\nof the FDPA are those related to race, geography, and innocence.\n\nSampson (who is white) raises no argument that he was sentenced to\n\ndeath because of his race, the race of his victims, or the\n\ngeographic location in which he was sentenced.                  Nor does he claim\n\nto be actually innocent.\n\n            What, then, is his claim?              In essence, Sampson attempts\n\nto assert the rights of other capital defendants.                      His claim is\n\nthat,   although       he   himself    was   not     disadvantaged     by   race   or\n\ngeography      and     although   he    is     not    innocent,       the   FDPA   is\n\nunconstitutional because it has these untoward effects elsewhere.\n\nAnd if the FDPA is unconstitutional, his thesis runs, he may not be\n\nsentenced under it.\n\n            It    is    questionable     whether      Sampson   has    standing    to\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the federal death penalty on\n\nthese grounds.

He nonetheless fails to prove\n\nthe unconstitutionality of the FDPA.\n\n          1.   Race-and-Geography-Related Claims.     We take first\n\nSampson's claims that the FDPA is unconstitutional because the death\n\npenalty is sought based on the race of the defendant and victim and\n\non the locale in which the defendant is charged.    Sampson's race-\n\nbased claims implicate the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.         His\n\ngeography-related claim implicates the Eighth Amendment.4\n\n          Sampson's challenges are based primarily on a 2000 DOJ\n\nstudy of the administration of the federal death penalty from 1988\n\nto 2000, and on a 2001 supplemental report.    He reads the studies\n\nas demonstrating a pattern of discrimination against minority\n\ndefendants and against defendants in the South.     For example, he\n\nnotes that over 70% of federal defendants for whom the death penalty\n\nwas sought were non-whites. Similarly, between 1995 and 2000, only\n\n\n     4\n      Sampson also argues that he has a statutory right under 18\nU.S.C. § 3593(f) to \"justice without discrimination\" that was\nviolated by the discrimination inherent in the federal capital\nsentencing scheme. The district court complied with 18 U.S.C. §\n3593(f), which requires a jury instruction that the race of the\ndefendant and victim not enter into the sentencing determination\nand a certification signed by the jurors that they were not\ninfluenced by these factors.\n     In addition, Sampson argues that this court should invoke its\nsupervisory powers \"to curb charging discrimination and regional\ncaprice.\" Appellant's Br. at 275-76. There is no basis for the\nexercise of supervisory power in this instance.       If Sampson's\narguments have any basis in fact — a point upon which we do not\nopine — he could only have benefitted by virtue of his race and the\ngeographic location in which his crimes were committed.\n\n                               -21-\n\fslightly more than half of the districts in the federal system\n\nsubmitted a case to the Attorney General with a recommendation for\n\ncapital prosecution.    Sampson also cites evidence of a white-victim\n\neffect,   including    one   study    showing   that   the   death   penalty\n\nauthorization rate is 37% in white-victim cases, but only 21% in\n\nminority-victim cases.\n\n             Bare statistical discrepancies are insufficient to prove\n\na Fifth Amendment violation with respect to the implementation of\n\na statute.    This principle is firmly established by McCleskey.        481\n\nU.S. at 292 (stating that \"to prevail under the Equal Protection\n\nClause, [a defendant] must prove that the decisionmakers in his case\n\nacted with discriminatory purpose\").5           It applies here: because\n\nSampson   has    presented    no     specific   evidence     of   purposeful\n\ndiscrimination either against himself or against those southern and\n\n\n     5\n      In McCleskey, the Supreme Court rejected a capital\ndefendant's    claim   that   systemic    statistics   demonstrated\ndiscriminatory intent in his particular case. See 481 U.S. at 297.\nSampson attempts to distinguish McCleskey by noting that the DOJ\nstudy on which he relies provides not only systemic statistics but\nalso individualized statistics. He points out that while the study\nat issue in McCleskey analyzed data from many different\ndecisionmakers, the DOJ study relies only on the decisions of the\nAttorney General and primarily on the decisions of one Attorney\nGeneral (Janet Reno).    This argument ignores the fact that the\nstatistics also reflect the decisions of countless prosecutors in\nthe field, who must exercise their considerable charging discretion\nbefore a case ever reaches the Attorney General's desk (as Sampson\npoints out, the Attorney General followed the local prosecutors'\nrecommendations in the overwhelming majority of cases submitted,\nAppellant's Br. at 255 n.90). See McCleskey, 481 U.S. at 295 n.15\n(noting that \"decisions whether to prosecute and what to charge\nnecessarily are individualized and involve infinite factual\nvariations\").\n\n                                     -22-\n\fminority defendants upon whom he purports to base his claim, his\n\nFifth Amendment challenge fails.\n\n           By like token, Sampson's Eighth Amendment claims cannot\n\nsucceed.      The McCleskey Court, in rejecting an Eighth Amendment\n\nclaim   based     on     a   statistical    study    indicating       race-based\n\ndiscrepancies in capital sentencing, stated:\n\n           Apparent disparities in sentencing are an\n           inevitable part of our criminal justice\n           system. . . . [O]ur consistent rule has been\n           that constitutional guarantees are met when\n           \"the   mode   [for   determining  guilt   or\n           punishment] itself has been surrounded with\n           safeguards to make it as fair as possible.\"\n           Where the discretion that is fundamental to\n           our criminal process is involved, we decline\n           to assume that what is unexplained is\n           invidious.\n\n481 U.S. at 312-13 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting Singer v.

The\n\nstatistics submitted by Sampson are no more probative than those\n\nrejected   in   McCleskey.     The   DOJ    study    provides    no   basis   for\n\nattributing the statistical discrepancies with respect to geography\n\nand race in FDPA prosecutions to discrimination rather than to other\n\nfactors, such as differences in the nature of the crimes involved.\n\nMcCleskey prohibits us from assuming that \"what is unexplained is\n\ninvidious.\"     Id.\n\n           2.         Innocence-Related    Claims.   Sampson's    final   claims\n\nregarding the FDPA's constitutionality concern the risk of executing\n\ninnocent defendants. Again, we assume arguendo that Sampson, who has\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fadmitted his guilt by pleading to the charges against him, has\n\nstanding to assert the interests of the innocent.\n\n            Sampson   appears     to    make   two    closely     related    Fifth\n\nAmendment arguments, both of which derive from his reliance on United\n\nStates v. Quinones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2332134\"><a href=\"/opinion/2332134/united-states-v-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

His second argument\n\nis that the risk of executing the innocent offends Fifth Amendment\n\nsubstantive due process protections.\n\n            As with Sampson's other constitutional challenges to the\n\nFDPA, these arguments are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. For\n\nyears, a perennial debate has raged over the propriety of capital\n\npunishment in view of the omnipresent risk of executing innocent\n\ndefendants.   See Quinones, 313 F.3d at 63-64.          Withal, the Court has\n\ndeclined,   for   over    two   centuries,     to    hold   the   death     penalty\n\nunconstitutional per se.         In Furman, for example, both Justices\n\n\n\n     6\n      To the extent that Sampson invokes the Eighth Amendment,\narguing that the risk of executing the innocent renders the federal\ndeath penalty per se cruel and unusual, his claim is foreclosed by\nGregg.

Despite this stark reality, no majority of Justices\n\never has held the death penalty unconstitutional on those grounds.\n\n           The Court squarely addressed the issue of the risk of\n\nexecuting the innocent in Herrera v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112808\"><a href=\"/opinion/112808/herrera-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).\n\nIt affirmed the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nnotwithstanding a claim by the petitioner that new evidence could\n\nprove his actual innocence.       Id. at 393.       The Court noted that\n\n\"[c]laims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have\n\nnever been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent\n\nan independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying\n\nstate criminal proceeding.\"     Id. at 400.      The Court continued:\n\n           We may assume, for the sake of argument in\n           deciding this case, that in a capital case a\n           truly persuasive demonstration of \"actual\n           innocence\" made after trial would render the\n           execution of a defendant unconstitutional, and\n           warrant federal habeas relief if there were no\n           state avenue open to process such a claim. But\n           . . . the threshold showing for such an assumed\n           right would necessarily be extraordinarily\n           high.\n\nId. at 417.    We understand Herrera to leave open the possibility\n\nthat, in a particular instance of newly discovered, highly persuasive\n\nevidence of innocence, emerging at a time when no state remedy\n\nremains available, a federal court might be able to issue a writ of\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fhabeas corpus under the Constitution to prohibit execution.        That is\n\na far cry, however, from saying that the FDPA is unconstitutional.\n\n           Indeed, Herrera supports the constitutionality of the\n\nstatute.   Despite the \"unalterable fact that our judicial system,\n\nlike the human beings who administer it, is fallible,\" id. at 415,\n\nthe Herrera Court could not say that the \"refusal to entertain\n\npetitioner's   newly   discovered    evidence   eight   years   after   his\n\nconviction\" transgressed his due process rights.

Sampson concedes\n\nthat under Supreme Court precedent the argument fails.

Weighing.       Sampson's     primary   complaint   of\n\ninstructional error relates to the district court's charge on the\n\nweighing of aggravating and mitigating factors.      In Sampson's view,\n\nthese instructions violated the FDPA and, in the bargain, infringed\n\nupon constitutional protections.     Specifically, he argues that the\n\ninstructions (i) erroneously invited jurors to apply their own\n\nidiosyncratic standards to the weighing process and (ii) failed to\n\nrequire that they find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed mitigating factors before voting to impose the\n\ndeath penalty.\n\n            Because our assessment of Sampson's plaints must take\n\ninto account the weighing instructions as a whole, Woodward, 149 F.3d\n\nat 69, we reprint the pertinent portions here:\n\n          [Y]ou are called upon to decide if the proven\n          aggravating factors or factor sufficiently\n          outweigh the proven mitigating factors. This\n          is not a matter of arithmetic.      You’re not\n          being asked to simply count the total number of\n          aggravating and mitigating factors and reach a\n\n                                  -29-\n\fdecision based on which number is greater.\nInstead, you must consider the weight and value\nthat you feel should be given to each factor.\n\nDifferent factors may be given different\nweights or values by different jurors.     You\nmight find that a single aggravating factor is\nserious enough to outweigh several mitigating\nfactors. Similarly, a single mitigating factor\nmight outweigh several aggravating factors.\n\nIf you find that the government has not proven\nthat the aggravating factor or factors outweigh\nthe mitigating factors at all, you may not vote\nto impose the death penalty on the count that\nyou’re considering.    If, however, you decide\nthat the prosecution has proven that the\naggravating factor or factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors, you must decide if the\nprosecution has also proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt    that   those    aggravating    factors\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factors to\nmake death the appropriate penalty for Mr.\nSampson’s crime rather than life in prison\nwithout possibility of release.\n\nThe law does not define what is sufficient to\nmake death the appropriate penalty. Here, the\nlaw relies on each of you as a representative\nof our community to consult your conscience and\ndetermine what is sufficient to justify Mr.\nSampson’s execution. Thus, your decision as to\nwhat the appropriate sentence is will depend in\npart on what is sufficient for you.     If you\nfind that the government has proven that the\naggravating factors slightly outweigh the\nmitigating factors and that is sufficient for\nyou to find that death is the appropriate\npenalty, you may properly vote for death.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the government has\nproven to you that the aggravating factors\ngreatly outweigh the mitigating factors, you\nmay properly decide that this is not sufficient\nto justify a sentence of death because, for\nyou, even more is required for you to find that\na man should die.\n\n\n                     -30-\n\f           However you personally define sufficiency, the\n           prosecution   must   convince   you  beyond   a\n           reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor or\n           factors sufficiently outweigh the mitigating\n           factors to make death the appropriate penalty\n           in this case.\n\n           As I told you earlier, this is a heavy burden.\n           More than a strong probability is required.\n           You must be certain beyond any reasonable doubt\n           that a death sentence should be imposed before\n           voting for it.\n\n           Death is, of course, the ultimate irreversible\n           punishment. You must not sentence Gary Sampson\n           to die unless you are convinced beyond a\n           reasonable doubt that death is the appropriate\n           punishment.\n\n           As I’ve told you previously, the law never\n           requires that any or all of you find that the\n           death penalty is justified. Any one of you may\n           decline to impose a death sentence.     If you\n           decide that the prosecution has not proven\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that the death\n           penalty is justified, you do not have to give\n           a reason for that decision.     The law does\n           require that you follow the process that I’ve\n           explained and then make a reasoned moral\n           judgment.\n\n           Sampson argues initially that the sufficiency language\n\nembedded in this part of the charge violates both the FDPA and the\n\nEighth Amendment. He asserts that, by inviting each juror to use his\n\nor her own definition of sufficiency, the district court \"offered its\n\nown   idiosyncratic   definition   of   the   language   of   the   statute,\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 62-63, and failed to provide adequate sentencing\n\nguidance as required by the Eighth Amendment in capital cases.\n\n           To determine whether the sufficiency language comported\n\nwith the FDPA, we start by consulting the statute's text; we then\n\n                                   -31-\n\fproceed, if necessary, to examine its structure and surrounding\n\nprovisions.    See Green, 407 F.3d at 441-43.\n\n             The relevant section of the FDPA, 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e),\n\nwhich we set out in the margin,7 provides no definition of the phrase\n\n\"sufficiently outweigh.\" Thus, the court's definition of sufficiency\n\ndoes not explicitly contradict the statutory text.            At any rate, the\n\ncourt's definition is fully consistent with the immediately preceding\n\nparagraph, which provides that \"any member of the jury who finds the\n\nexistence     of   a   mitigating   factor    may    consider    such    factor\n\nestablished.\" Id. § 3593(d).          For jurors to consider different\n\nmitigating factors, they would necessarily need to engage in the type\n\nof individualized weighing described by the district court.               Given\n\nthe statutory phrase \"sufficiently outweigh,\" Sampson's attack under\n\nthe FDPA fails.\n\n             We hold, as well, that the sufficiency instruction does\n\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment. Sampson argues strenuously that the\n\nEighth Amendment, if not the statute, requires that the jury be\n\ninstructed    to   follow   a   uniform   method    of   weighing,   precluding\n\nindividual approaches.      We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      That section provides, in pertinent part, that if the jury\nfinds the existence of at least one of the relevant aggravating\nfactors enumerated in the statute, \"the jury . . . shall consider\nwhether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist\nsufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to\nexist to justify a sentence of death.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).\n\n                                     -32-\n\f           The Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that key to\n\nharmonizing a capital sentencing scheme with the proscription against\n\ncruel and unusual punishment is an individualized determination by\n\nthe jury of whether, taking into account all the relevant aggravating\n\nand   mitigating   factors,   a   death    sentence   is   appropriate   in   a\n\nparticular case.    See, e.g., Tuilaepa v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117875\"><a href=\"/opinion/117875/tuilaepa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n973 (1994); Zant v.

Sampson\n\ncorrectly points out that the jury's discretion in sentencing must\n\nbe \"suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of\n\nwholly arbitrary and capricious action.\"          Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189\n\n(opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). However, once a jury\n\nhas found a defendant death-eligible, it may be given unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the weighing process.         See Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 979\n\n(explaining that \"[a] capital sentencer need not be instructed how\n\nto weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision\");\n\nsee also Ayers v. Belmontes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145773\"><a href=\"/opinion/145773/ayers-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479 (2006).           Sampson's\n\nargument that the jury needed more guidance in order to weigh\n\naggravators against mitigators is foreclosed by these precedents.\n\n           Sampson also alleges that the weighing instructions failed\n\nto require jurors to find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating\n\nfactors outweighed mitigating factors, and thus violated the FDPA and\n\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We can readily dismiss the statutory\n\nargument. The FDPA makes no mention of the reasonable doubt standard\n\nin the context of weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, see\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 3593(e), but it does reference the reasonable doubt\n\nstandard in two proximate sections, see id. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(c).\n\nBecause the inclusion      of a term in one part of a statute is\n\npersuasive evidence that its omission elsewhere is deliberate, see\n\nGreen, 407 F.3d at 443, we hold that Congress did not intend the\n\nreasonable doubt standard to apply to the weighing process.             That\n\nbeing so, Sampson cannot have been harmed by the instruction given.\n\n           Sampson's constitutional arguments on this front are no\n\nmore persuasive.    Relying on a procession of Supreme Court cases,\n\nsee, e.g., Booker, 543 U.S. at 244; Blakely v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (2004); Ring, 536 U.S. at 609; Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490,\n\nhe contends that the balance between aggravating and mitigating\n\nfactors is a \"fact\" that should have been found by the jury beyond\n\na reasonable doubt. The district court's alleged failure to instruct\n\nthat the reasonable doubt standard applied to this \"fact\" was,\n\ntherefore, error.\n\n           Sampson's attempt to draw an analogy between this weighing\n\ndetermination      and     the   sentencing       determinations       found\n\nunconstitutional in the Apprendi line of cases lacks force.                 In\n\nBlakely, for example, the Court invalidated a sentence that had been\n\nelevated   above   the   statutory   maximum   based   upon   a   finding   of\n\n\"deliberate cruelty\" because the facts supporting that finding were\n\nfound by a judge, not by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.         See 542\n\nU.S. at 303.    The case at hand is different in kind because, under\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fthe FDPA, the jury already had found beyond a reasonable doubt the\n\nfacts needed to support a sentence of death — the presence of\n\naggravating factors and the requisite intent — before it reached the\n\nweighing stage.        See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591(a)(2), 3593(c)-(e).\n\n              Sampson tries to circumvent this logic by pointing out\n\nthat the weighing determination itself is essential to imposing a\n\ndeath sentence.        He repeatedly refers to Justice Scalia's statement\n\n\"that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment\n\nthat the defendant receives - whether the statute calls them elements\n\nof the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Jane - must be found by\n\nthe jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          Ring, 536 U.S. at 610 (Scalia\n\nJ., joined by Thomas, J., concurring).              This argument founders,\n\nhowever, because it assumes, without the slightest support, that the\n\nweighing of aggravating and mitigating factors is a fact.                     This\n\nassumption is incorrect.          As other courts have recognized, the\n\nrequisite weighing constitutes a process, not a fact to be found.\n\nSee United States v.

Hence, the weighing\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fof aggravators and mitigators does not need to be \"found.\"                  We hold,\n\ntherefore, that the district court's instructions were free from\n\nApprendi error.\n\n                 Sampson has a residual argument: that the district court's\n\nsimultaneous and alternating references to both a personal notion of\n\nsufficiency and a reasonable doubt standard were confusing and\n\ninconsistent.

Mills is obsolete; the Supreme Court\nreformulated that standard in Boyde, 494 U.S. at 378-90. Stromberg\nis inapposite.    There, the Court stated that when a jury is\ninstructed on alternative theories, one of which is plainly\nunconstitutional, a conviction based upon a general verdict must be\nset aside. 283 U.S. at 367-68. But this principle applies only\nwhere an instruction is \"concededly erroneous.\" Boyde, 494 U.S. at\n380. For this reason, and because the verdict sheets in this case\nprovide detailed evidence of the jury's decisional calculus,\nStromberg is not on point.\n\n                                         -36-\n\fcontention that the challenged instruction is likely to have caused\n\nharmful juror confusion.\n\n             Sampson places great emphasis on the language telling\n\njurors that they could impose the death penalty if the aggravating\n\nfactors \"slightly outweigh[ed]\" the mitigating factors.                This phrase\n\nwas followed immediately, however, by an assurance that jurors could\n\nrefuse to vote for a death sentence \"even if the government ha[d]\n\nproven to [them] that the aggravating factors greatly outweigh[ed]\n\nthe mitigating factors.\"         The court further instructed that however\n\njurors defined sufficiency, the prosecution had to convince them\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor or factors\n\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factors to make death the\n\nappropriate penalty in [the] case.\"             Viewed in its entirety, this\n\ninstruction     clearly     communicated        to     jurors    the      relatively\n\nstraightforward proposition that they, as individuals, had to be\n\ncertain that death was the appropriate punishment before imposing it.\n\n               Even   if   we   assume    (favorably     to    Sampson)    that   the\n\ninstruction might have been mildly confusing, any error was benign.\n\nIn a capital case, as in any other case, a confusing instruction may\n\nbe harmless.     See Boyde, 494 U.S. at 383-84.               Here, we discern no\n\nreasonable     likelihood       that   jurors    may    have     interpreted      the\n\ninstruction in a way that could have harmed Sampson.               There are only\n\ntwo possibilities: either the jurors eschewed the reasonable doubt\n\nstandard vis-à-vis the weighing process (which, as we have held,\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fwould       have   comported     fully    with   the    law)   or    they    applied   the\n\nreasonable doubt standard (which would have benefitted Sampson by\n\nimposing a more onerous burden on the government).                      Any error was,\n\ntherefore, patently harmless.9\n\n               2.     Vulnerable Victim.          The FDPA contemplates that the\n\ngovernment         must   show   the    presence   of    at    least   one    enumerated\n\naggravating factor in order to render a defendant death-eligible.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).               In this case, the jury unanimously found\n\nseveral statutory aggravating factors: that Sampson committed both\n\nthe McCloskey and Rizzo murders in an \"especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved manner,\" id. § 3592(c)(6); that McCloskey was \"particularly\n\nvulnerable due to . . . infirmity,\" id. § 3592(c)(11); and that Rizzo\n\nwas murdered \"after substantial planning and premeditation,\" id. §\n\n3592(c)(9).          With respect to certain of these factors, Sampson\n\nobjects to the lower court's jury instructions.                     We turn next to his\n\nchallenge anent the \"vulnerable victim\" instructions.\n\n\n\n        9\n      In contemplating its instructions to the jury, the district\ncourt appears to have distinguished between applying the reasonable\ndoubt standard to the decision about whether aggravators outweigh\nmitigators and applying the standard to the jury's ultimate\ndecision on the appropriateness of a capital sentence. See Sampson\nIV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 234-40.      We already have held that the\nreasonable doubt standard is not required in the weighing of\naggravators against mitigators.     See text supra.    There is no\nchallenge on appeal to the correctness of the district court's\napplication of the reasonable doubt standard to the jury's ultimate\nsentencing decision and, in all events, any error in this regard\nwould have favored Sampson and, thus, would have been harmless.\nConsequently, we take no view of the propriety of the distinction\ndrawn by the district court.\n\n                                           -38-\n\f           The FDPA permits the vulnerability of a victim to be used\n\nas an aggravating factor and defines that quality as a showing that\n\nthe victim was \"particularly vulnerable due to old age, youth, or\n\ninfirmity.\"   Id. § 3592(c)(11).       In this case, the government\n\ncontended that Phillip McCloskey was a vulnerable victim.     After\n\nfinding the evidence sufficient to support a vulnerable victim\n\ninstruction vis-à-vis McCloskey, the district court instructed as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Question 3B asks whether it's been proven to\n           each and every one of you beyond a reasonable\n           doubt that Philip McCloskey was particularly\n           vulnerable due to infirmity. In essence, the\n           Federal Death Penalty statute provides that a\n           defendant is especially blameworthy if he\n           murders someone who is particularly vulnerable\n           to being killed because he has an infirmity\n           which made him less able to escape or resist\n           attack than most people. In this context, to\n           be vulnerable means to be subject to being\n           attacked or injured because of some weakness.\n           To be particularly vulnerable means to be\n           especially or significantly vulnerable or to be\n           vulnerable to a particularly high degree.\n\n           An infirmity is a physical or mental weakness\n           or flaw. To prove this aggravating factor, it\n           must also be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n           to each and every one of you that there was a\n           connection between Mr. McCloskey's alleged\n           vulnerability and his death. This means that\n           any infirmity which you find made Mr. McCloskey\n           particularly vulnerable must somehow have\n           contributed to his death.         However, the\n           requirement of a connection between any proven\n           infirmity and a person's death does not mean\n           that the prosecution must prove that the\n           defendant knew of Mr. McCloskey's alleged\n           vulnerability and targeted him because of it.\n           Rather, it means that the prosecution must\n           prove that, once targeted, Mr. McCloskey was\n\n                                -39-\n\f            significantly more vulnerable to being killed\n            because he had an infirmity.\n\n            Sampson alleges that this instruction violated his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights because it did not require the jury to find that he\n\nknew McCloskey was particularly vulnerable due to infirmity and\n\ntargeted McCloskey on that account.          To support this contention, he\n\nargues that this aggravating factor, absent an element of scienter,\n\nwas based on the \"mere happenstance\" of the victim's infirmity,\n\nAppellant's Br. at 179, and did not adequately narrow the class of\n\npersons eligible for the death penalty.           See Arave v. Creech, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112838\"><a href=\"/opinion/112838/arave-v-creech/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474 (1993).\n\n            Sampson's remonstrance notwithstanding, it is clear that\n\nthe challenged instruction complies with the FDPA.           The statutory\n\nprovision describing this aggravating factor does not contain a\n\nscienter element.       See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(11).    By contrast, other\n\nstatutory        aggravating   factors       contain   explicit   scienter\n\nrequirements.      See, e.g., id. § 3592(c)(5) (requiring a showing that\n\n\"[t]he defendant . . . knowingly created a grave risk of death\"); id.\n\n§ 3592(d)(4) (requiring a showing that the defendant either used a\n\nfirearm or \"knowingly directed . . . another to use a firearm\"); id.\n\n§ 3592(d)(8) (requiring a showing that the defendant was aware of the\n\npresence    of    a   potentially   lethal   adulterant).    Because   \"the\n\nintentional inclusion of a[n] [element] in one part of the statute\n\npersuasively indicates that the exclusion of such a[n] [element] in\n\nanother part of the same statute was intentional,\" Green, 407 F.3d\n\n                                     -40-\n\fat 443, we conclude, without serious question, that Congress did not\n\nintend that application of the vulnerable victim aggravating factor\n\nwould depend upon proof of scienter.\n\n             Sampson's fallback position is that any version of the\n\nvulnerable victim aggravator that omits a scienter requirement is\n\nunconstitutional.    We think not.\n\n             The Supreme Court has stated that an aggravating factor\n\nmust satisfy two criteria in order to comport with the Eighth\n\nAmendment.    First, the statutory language must be clear and specific\n\nenough to furnish guidance to the factfinder.           Arave, 507 U.S. at\n\n470-74.   Second, the factor must provide a principled basis for\n\ndistinguishing between those who deserve capital punishment and those\n\nwho do not.    Id. at 474.   Viewing the FDPA's vulnerable victim factor\n\nthrough the prism of these requirements, we agree with the Fifth\n\nCircuit's conclusion that the aggravator, even without a scienter\n\nrequirement,    satisfies    both   criteria.10   See   United   States   v.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       One member of the panel joins this conclusion on a limited\nbasis. Although Judge Lipez concludes that no constitutional error\noccurred in this case with respect to use of the vulnerable victim\nfactor, he has reservations about the use of the factor, without\nscienter, as the sole aggravating factor making a defendant\neligible for the death penalty.     Given that Sampson was found\neligible in connection with the McCloskey murder based on an\nadditional factor (that the crime was committed in \"an especially\nheinous, cruel, or depraved manner\") and that the evidence showed\nthat Sampson must have been aware of McCloskey's infirmities, see\ninfra Part III(D)(2), the outcome here is consistent with his\nviews.\n\n                                     -41-\n\fBourgeois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791895\"><a href=\"/opinion/791895/united-states-v-alfred-bourgeois/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510-11 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006).\n\n             Since vulnerability and infirmity are concepts that are\n\neasily understandable by the average juror, the plain language in\n\nwhich the factor is couched supplies adequate guidance to jurors and\n\njudges.    Cf. Arave, 507 U.S. at 471-72 (concluding that the words\n\n\"cold-blooded\" and \"pitiless\" contained adequate content to guide a\n\ncapital jury). By the same token, the factor effectively narrows the\n\nclass of persons eligible for the death penalty so that not all\n\nvictims can be considered particularly vulnerable due to age or\n\ninfirmity.    See id. at 474 (explaining the importance of such a lack\n\nof universality).     This narrowing effect is well-illustrated in the\n\ncase at hand by the fact that the government did not charge the\n\nvulnerable victim factor with respect to the Rizzo murder.           In the\n\nfinal analysis, then, the vulnerable victim factor provides adequate\n\nguidance to the jury and effectively circumscribes the class of\n\ndefendants to whom it applies.      Consequently, we hold that it passes\n\nEighth Amendment muster.\n\n             In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Sampson\n\nasks us to extrapolate from another line of death penalty cases the\n\nadditional requirement that an aggravating factor must directly\n\nrelate to a defendant's moral culpability (and, thus, his knowledge).\n\nSee Tison v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111863\"><a href=\"/opinion/111863/tison-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149 (1987) (explaining that a\n\ncriminal   sentence    must   be   \"directly   related   to   the   personal\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fculpability of the criminal offender\"); Enmund v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110795\"><a href=\"/opinion/110795/enmund-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801 (1982) (stating that punishment must be must be \"tailored\n\nto . . . personal responsibility and moral guilt\").      On this basis,\n\nSampson strives to convince us that the absence of a mental state\n\nrequirement   in    the   vulnerable   victim   factor     renders   it\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n           We are not persuaded.   The Enmund Court invalidated, as\n\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment, the death sentence of a getaway-\n\ncar driver who, although participating in an armed robbery, did not\n\nintend that lethal force be used.      458 U.S. at 801.      The Court\n\nreasoned that the punishment was disproportionate to the conduct and,\n\nthus, violated the Eighth Amendment.   Id. at 797-98.\n\n           In Tison, however, the Court held that death is not a\n\ndisproportionate sentence for a defendant who, while not intending\n\nto kill his victims, is a major player in the underlying felony and\n\ndemonstrates a reckless indifference to human life. 481 U.S. at 157-\n\n58.   If the death penalty is not disproportionate for this type of\n\ndefendant, it follows inexorably that the death penalty is not\n\ndisproportionate for Sampson — a defendant who (the jury found)\n\nintentionally murdered his victims.\n\n           In all events, neither Tison nor Enmund was concerned with\n\nthe evaluation of a specific aggravating factor.   The implausibility\n\nof Sampson's attempted application of these cases to an aggravating\n\nfactor is underscored by the fact that the Supreme Court implicitly\n\n\n                                -43-\n\fhas approved the use of other aggravating factors not directly\n\nrelated to a capital defendant's mental state at the time of the\n\ncrime.   See, e.g., Zant, 462 U.S. at 879 (recognizing the validity\n\nof aggravating factors such as escape from confinement and prior\n\nfelony conviction).   We therefore reject Sampson's claim that the\n\nvulnerable victim factor, as limned by Congress and construed by the\n\ndistrict court, is unconstitutional.\n\n           3.   Especially Heinous, Cruel, or Depraved Conduct.    In\n\naddition to McCloskey's vulnerability, the jury found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that both the Rizzo and McCloskey murders were\n\ncommitted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.    See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(6).   With respect to this statutory aggravating\n\nfactor, the district court instructed as follows:\n\n           As I told you earlier, as a matter of law,\n           premeditated murder alone is not sufficient to\n           make the death penalty a sentencing option.\n           Something more is required. More specifically,\n           one of those \"something mores\" with regard to\n           murder is that a murder must be committed in an\n           especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.\n           However, a person of ordinary sensibility could\n           fairly characterize almost every murder as\n           heinous, cruel, or depraved, the Supreme Court\n           has said. Therefore, something additional must\n           be proven to make this a truly limiting factor\n           and to assure reasonable consistency between\n           cases. In this case, the law provides that the\n           killing can only be especially heinous, cruel,\n           or depraved if it involved serious physical\n           abuse . . . . In this case, \"especially\" has\n           its usual meaning of highly or unusually great.\n           Each of the other relevant terms has a defined\n           meaning for the purposes of the Federal Death\n           Penalty statute. I'll now explain those\n           meanings to you.\n\n                                -44-\n\f\"Heinous\" means shockingly atrocious. In this\ncase, a killing may be found to be especially\nheinous only as a result of any serious\nphysical abuse that's proven.\n\n\"Cruel\" means the defendant intended to inflict\na high degree of pain. In this case, a killing\nmay be found to be especially cruel only as a\nresult of any serious physical abuse that is\nproven.\n\n\"Depraved\" means that the defendant relished\nthe killing or showed indifference to the\nsuffering of the victim. Once again, in this\ncase, a killing may be found to be especially\ndepraved only as a result of any serious\nphysical abuse that is proven.\n\n\"Serious physical abuse\" has a particular legal\nmeaning for the purpose of this case. To prove\nthat the killing . . . involved serious\nphysical abuse, the government must prove that\nMr. Sampson intended to inflict significant\ndamage to [the deceased's] body beyond what Mr.\nSampson thought was necessary to kill him. In\nessence, the government must prove that Mr.\nSampson intended to do more than kill [the\ndeceased]. It must prove that he also intended\nto abuse his body above and beyond what was\nnecessary to kill him. Serious physical abuse\ncan be inflicted either before or after death.\nThe victim does not have to be alive at the\ntime the serious physical abuse is inflicted.\n\nQuestion 3A requires two steps.     First, you\nmust determine whether it has been proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the killing . .\n. involved serious physical abuse, as I just\ndefined it for you.      If you do not agree\nunanimously that this has been proven, you must\nanswer question 3A no and proceed to question\n3B. If you do agree unanimously that serious\nphysical abuse has been proven, you must\ncontinue to the next step. In the second step,\nyou must decide whether that serious physical\nabuse proves that the crime was committed in an\nespecially heinous, an especially cruel, or\n\n\n                     -45-\n\f             especially depraved manner, as I defined those\n             terms for you before.\n\n             You may not consider any aspect of the crime\n             other than proven serious physical abuse in\n             determining whether the killing was especially\n             heinous, especially cruel, or especially\n             depraved.   However, just because an offense\n             involves serious physical abuse does not\n             necessarily mean that it was committed in an\n             especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.\n             Rather, you must decide whether any proven\n             serious physical abuse rendered the killing\n             especially heinous, especially cruel, or\n             especially depraved.\n\n             Sampson   challenges     this     instruction   on   two    primary\n\ngrounds.     First, noting that a defendant generally is entitled to a\n\nrequested instruction on his theory of the case as long as that\n\ntheory is supported by the evidence and the proffered instruction\n\ncorrectly states the law, see United States v.

The court went on\n\nto clarify that the government had to prove that Sampson intended to\n\ndo more than kill; it also had to prove that he \"intended to abuse\n\n[the deceased's] body above and beyond what was necessary to kill\n\nhim.\" We believe that this instruction accommodates Sampson's theory\n\nthat if he inflicted a series of stab wounds \"intending . . . to\n\nkill,\" that alone would not establish especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved behavior.     Like the instruction in Noone, 913 F.2d at 31,\n\nthe instruction here provided an \"appropriate legal framework for\n\njury consideration of [the defendant's] contention.\"              Hence, the\n\ncourt did not err in refusing to parrot Sampson's preferred wording\n\nin its jury instructions.\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\f           Sampson's        claim     of    unconstitutional          vagueness   also\n\nfalters.   As discussed above, an aggravating factor must provide\n\nadequate guidance to the sentencer.               See Arave, 507 U.S. at 470-74.\n\nThis   requirement     is   satisfied        when    the   factor,     as    expressed,\n\nfurnishes a commonsense core of meaning that a factfinder can\n\nunderstand.      See   Jones,       527    U.S.     at   400    (plurality    opinion);\n\nTuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 973.           The delineation of an aggravator is a\n\nlegislative judgment, see Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 974, and judicial\n\nreview of such judgments is \"quite deferential.\"                    Id. at 973.\n\n           This does not mean, of course, that a reviewing court's\n\nrole is reduced to that of a rubber stamp.                     The Supreme Court has\n\nfound that factors similar to the \"especially heinous, cruel, or\n\ndepraved\" factor can present vagueness concerns.                   See, e.g., Maynard\n\nv.

Applying\n\nthis framework, we agree with other courts of appeals that have found\n\nthe FDPA's \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" factor not\n\nunconstitutionally vague when coupled with the type of limiting\n\ninstruction given by the court below. See, e.g., Bourgeois, 423 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                           -48-\n\fat 511; United States v.

See Maynard, 486\n\nU.S. at 364-65 (approving this narrowing construction).                       Here,\n\nmoreover, the district court carefully defined each of the relevant\n\nterms — heinous, cruel, depraved, and serious physical abuse — in a\n\nmanner that was easily understood and that afforded the jurors a\n\ncommonsense core of meaning.       See Walton, 497 U.S. at 653 (deeming\n\nsuch   an   effort   \"constitutionally       significant\").        The    narrowing\n\naccomplished by the statutory inclusion of the serious physical abuse\n\ncomponent,    especially    when   combined     with      the   district    court's\n\nthorough    instructions,    leaves    no     room   to    doubt   the     factor's\n\nconstitutionality.11\n\n             Sampson cites a plethora of state court cases in which\n\nvariants of the \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" factor have\n\nbeen used.    See, e.g., State v. Culberth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1901941\"><a href=\"/opinion/1901941/state-v-culberth/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851 (La.\n\n1980); Domingues v.

These decisions do not\n\ndictate a result favorable to Sampson in this case.                      While they\n\n\n\n       11\n      While the district court's instruction unquestionably\nprovided the constitutionally-mandated narrowing, we do not hold\nthat the limiting construction here is the only one that would be\nconstitutionally permissible.    We leave open the question of\nwhether a broader definition of serious physical abuse might still\npass constitutional muster.\n\n                                      -49-\n\fillustrate the application of the legal theory discussed above — that\n\nthe enhancement requires proof of more than the harm inherent in\n\nkilling — and demonstrate the individualized evaluation that is\n\ncritical to the constitutional imposition of the death penalty, they\n\ntell us little else.\n\n            Relatedly, Sampson argues for the first time on appeal\n\nthat, by defining each of the component terms — heinous, cruel, and\n\ndepraved — in relation to serious physical abuse, the district court\n\nconflated the factors in a way that might have caused jury confusion.\n\nIn an apparent effort to show that such an error would not be\n\nharmless, he offers a number of articles suggesting that capital\n\njurors often erroneously believe that death is mandatory once an\n\naggravating factor is found.     Because this claim was not preserved\n\nbelow, we review it for plain error.     See Jones, 527 U.S. at 388-89.\n\n            The FDPA requires that the adjectives \"heinous,\" \"cruel,\"\n\nand \"depraved\" all be defined in terms of serious physical abuse or\n\ntorture. See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(6).         The district court found\n\ntorture inapposite here and instructed the jury accordingly.         It\n\nproceeded   to   define   each   adjective    distinctly,   in   easily\n\nunderstandable terms, in relation to serious physical abuse.\n\n            We do not see how painstakingly defining each term as\n\ndictated by the applicable statute could conceivably serve to muddle\n\ncarefully crafted instructions.     To cinch matters, the lower court\n\nclearly outlined the process by which the jury was to determine the\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fappropriate sentence.      Jurors are normally presumed to follow the\n\ntrial court's instructions.       See Jones, 527 U.S. at 394.    We discern\n\nno basis for disregarding that presumption here.       Accordingly, there\n\nwas no harmful error in regard to this instruction.\n\n                            B.    Juror Issues.\n\n           Sampson complains about the dismissal for cause of six\n\njurors and about the district court's allegedly improvident refusal\n\nto dismiss a seventh juror mid-trial.         In each instance, he claims\n\na violation of his constitutional right to an impartial jury.           We\n\naddress these plaints separately.\n\n           1.   Dismissals for Cause.        Sampson assails the district\n\ncourt's   dismissal   of    six    prospective    jurors   who   expressed\n\nreservations about imposing the death penalty.       The baseline rule is\n\nthat a court appropriately may excuse a juror for his views on\n\ncapital punishment if those views \"would prevent or substantially\n\nimpair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with\n\nhis instructions and his oath.\"        Adams v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110323\"><a href=\"/opinion/110323/adams-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45\n\n(1980).   We normally review a trial court's for-cause dismissal of\n\na juror for abuse of discretion.           See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nSoberal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1997). This standard of review\n\napplies equally in capital cases.       See Wainwright v. Witt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111303\"><a href=\"/opinion/111303/wainwright-v-witt/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426 (1985) (noting that \"deference must be paid to the trial\n\njudge who sees and hears the juror\"); see also Purkey, 428 F.3d at\n\n750.\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\f             Here, the record amply supports the district court's\n\nconclusion    that     the    six    dismissed     jurors      would     have      been\n\nsubstantially impaired in the performance of their duties.                          In\n\nreaching   this   conclusion,        we    first   examine     the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding    three   of    the    six    dismissals   and    then    turn   to   the\n\nremaining three dismissals.\n\n             The court had prospective jurors complete questionnaires\n\nin which the jurors, among other things, self-assessed their views\n\nabout the death penalty on a scale of 1 to 10 (with \"1\" meaning\n\n\"strongly favor\" and \"10\" meaning \"strongly oppose\").                  Three of the\n\nsix jurors whom we are considering (Jurors 19, 77, and 205) ranked\n\nhimself/herself as a \"9.\" Another section of the questionnaire asked\n\nresponders to choose the statement that best represented their views;\n\nJurors 19 and 77 selected \"I am opposed to the death penalty, and I\n\nwould have a difficult time voting to impose it.\"                        Juror 205\n\nindicated even stronger opposition, stating that he \"struggle[d] to\n\nimagine a situation where [he] would vote to impose it.\"\n\n             To be sure, even \"those who firmly believe that the death\n\npenalty is unjust may nevertheless serve as jurors in capital cases.\"\n\nLockhart v. McCree, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111665\"><a href=\"/opinion/111665/lockhart-v-mccree/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 176 (1986).                 But that license is\n\nnot unqualified: the ability of such jurors to serve depends upon\n\nwhether they are able to subrogate their own beliefs to the need to\n\nfollow the court's instructions.             See id.    In this instance, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -52-\n\fdistrict court found that none of the three jurors could satisfy that\n\ncriterion.    We test the court's reasoning.\n\n             After the court inquired whether she automatically would\n\nvote against the death penalty, Juror 19 stated: \"I can't think of\n\nwhat the government would prove that would make me change my opinion\n\non the death penalty.\"      The court then reasonably concluded, upon\n\nobserving    the   prospective   juror's   demeanor   when   she   made   that\n\nassertion, that her views would substantially impair her ability to\n\nperform her duties.\n\n             Juror 77 stated during voir dire that he did not \"really\n\nbelieve that [the death penalty was] the appropriate sentence for\n\nanybody.\"     This declaration left the court with the \"definite\n\nimpression\" that although Juror 77 would \"earnestly try to follow the\n\nlaw,\" he would be substantially impaired in his ability to do so.\n\nThat determination was within the realm of the court's discretion.\n\n             So too the court's dismissal of Juror 205 for cause.         That\n\njuror stated during voir dire that he did not know whether he could\n\nperform the duties required of a juror in a capital case.           He added\n\nthat he would have trouble following the law if it differed from his\n\npersonal views.     Given his responses to the questionnaire, no more\n\nwas required to justify dismissal for cause.\n\n             The other three dismissed jurors all recounted personal\n\ncircumstances that led the court to decide against compelling them\n\nto serve as jurors in a capital case.          Juror 119's questionnaire\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\frevealed that he was a Catholic and a lay member of the Franciscan\n\norder, and that both organizations were opposed to the death penalty.\n\nAlthough he stated that he would not feel obliged to vote against the\n\ndeath penalty on the basis of his religion, he acknowledged that\n\nvoting for the death penalty would put him \"in extremely hot water\n\nwith the church\" and that he could \"get kicked out\" of the Franciscan\n\norder.\n\n             Jurors 14 and 28 revealed that they had close relatives\n\nwith     psychological   problems   and    uttered   repeated   statements\n\nindicating that they would be unable fairly to consider and weigh\n\nevidence of Sampson's mental condition. For example, Juror 14 stated\n\nthat she did not know whether she could balance evidence that Sampson\n\nhad a severe emotional disturbance with other facts in deciding\n\nwhether to impose a death sentence, and that she was \"very concerned\"\n\nabout her ability to put her personal concerns aside.           Juror 28's\n\nquestionnaire indicated that she could not find execution justified\n\nfor a mentally ill person regardless of the facts.      During voir dire,\n\nshe reaffirmed that she did not think that she could impose the death\n\npenalty were she to conclude that Sampson suffered from a serious\n\nmental disturbance.\n\n             There is no precise formula to guide judges in juror-\n\nqualification matters.     Particularly near the margins, on-the-spot\n\njudgment plays an important part in screening out those whose ability\n\nto serve may be compromised.    In each of the three instances we have\n\n\n                                    -54-\n\fjust chronicled, the district court determined that the juror's\n\npersonal circumstances were such as to substantially impair his or\n\nher ability to serve impartially in a capital case.                     Each of these\n\ninstances     presented      a    judgment        call.      They     are,    therefore,\n\nparadigmatic      examples       of   a   trial    court's   exercise        of   informed\n\ndiscretion.       In   no    instance       do    we   discern   an    abuse      of   that\n\ndiscretion.\n\n             While Sampson points out that each of these jurors may\n\nhave indicated some degree of willingness to put aside personal\n\nbiases, this fragmentary evidence is insufficient to support a\n\nfinding that the trial court abused its discretion.                     See Witt, 469\n\nU.S. at 425-26 (\"Despite . . . lack of clarity in the printed record,\n\n. . . there will be situations where the trial judge is left with the\n\ndefinite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to\n\nfaithfully and impartially apply the law.\"). Given the relevant body\n\nof evidence, we decline to second-guess the district court's first-\n\nhand impressions.      Accordingly, Sampson's assignment of error fails.\n\n             2.   Juror Misconduct.         We come now to Sampson's claim that\n\nthe district court incorrectly allowed Juror 109 to remain on the\n\npanel despite an admitted interaction with a government witness\n\nduring the trial.      The pertinent facts are as follows.\n\n             On Friday, December 12, 2003, a government expert witness,\n\nDr. Michael Werner, departed the courthouse after completing his\n\ntestimony.     As he was leaving, Juror 109 complimented him on his\n\n\n                                           -55-\n\fmemory.        Dr. Werner did not respond but, rather, reported the\n\ninteraction to the prosecutor.               The prosecutor, in turn, informed\n\ndefense counsel and the district court.\n\n               When trial resumed on Monday, Sampson moved to disqualify\n\nthe juror.          The court held an individual voir dire, questioned the\n\njuror about the details of the interaction, and then queried the\n\nremaining jurors (individually) to determine any potential spillover\n\neffect.    Satisfied that the interaction had been both brief and non-\n\nsubstantive and that Juror 109 remained impartial, the court denied\n\nSampson's      motion.      Sampson    contests      this     ruling,      arguing   that\n\nallowing the juror to remain offended his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\nrights to due process and an impartial jury.\n\n                    Ex parte communications between a juror and a witness\n\nduring trial are presumptively prejudicial, and the trial court is\n\nrequired       to    undertake   an   adequate      inquiry    to    determine       their\n\npotential impact.

Crime Scene/Autopsy Evidence.         Sampson challenges the\n\nadmission of certain crime scene and autopsy photographs and related\n\nphysical evidence pertaining to the McCloskey and Rizzo murders. The\n\nfirst aspect of this challenge suggests that the district court\n\nmisapprehended the evidentiary standard prescribed by the FDPA for\n\nsentencing hearings and that, under a correct interpretation, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -58-\n\fevidence in question should have been excluded.                 This suggestion is\n\nunrewarding.\n\n            The FDPA provides that, during a penalty-phase trial,\n\n\"information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by\n\nthe danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or\n\nmisleading the jury.\"            18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).           This language is\n\nsimilar, but not identical, to the language of Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.12   A direct comparison reveals two salient differences.\n\nFirst, Rule 403 requires that probative value be substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice before evidence may be\n\nexcluded, whereas the FDPA omits this substantiality requirement and\n\ndirects that exclusion may result if the scales tip, even slightly,\n\nin favor of unfair prejudice.            Second, the FDPA makes no express\n\nmention    of   the    factors    of   undue      delay,   waste    of   time,   and\n\ncumulativeness as grounds for exclusion.\n\n            The district court enunciated these differences in passing\n\nupon the challenged evidence.            Seizing on this express reference,\n\nSampson    contends      that    the   court      failed   to    appreciate      that\n\ncumulativeness        nevertheless     can   be    prejudicial     or,   at   least,\n\nundervalued cumulativeness in its decisional calculus.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n      Rule 403 provides in pertinent part that \"evidence may be\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"\n\n                                        -59-\n\f             We begin with bedrock: the trial court, in a capital\n\nsentencing proceeding, remains free to consider cumulativeness in\n\nassessing evidentiary proffers.    Cf. United States v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768617\"><a href=\"/opinion/768617/united-states-v-aquilia-marcivicci-barnette-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818-19 (4th Cir. 2000) (considering quantity of victim\n\nimpact evidence presented in determining whether defendant's due\n\nprocess   rights   were   violated).     But   Sampson's   contention   is\n\nincorrect.      The record makes manifest that the district court\n\nconsidered the possible prejudicial effects of cumulativeness when\n\nruling on Sampson's evidentiary objections. There is simply no other\n\nway to explain why the court excluded a number of photographs that\n\nit   thought     \"cumulative,\"   \"redundant,\"      \"duplicat[ive],\"     or\n\n\"repetitive.\"    We thus discern no error in the court's understanding\n\nof the FDPA's evidentiary standard.\n\n             A question remains as to whether the district court's\n\ndecisions that the exhibits possessed probative value outweighing any\n\nassociated bias were adequately supported by the record.       We answer\n\nthat question affirmatively.     The McCloskey and Rizzo crime scene\n\nphotographs and the sock used as a gag in the Rizzo murder were\n\nsignificantly probative of material issues; they corroborated and\n\nclarified testimony regarding the discovery of the bodies and the\n\ngathering of evidence. Similarly, the autopsy photographs shed light\n\non the manner in which each victim was killed (an important integer\n\nin the jury's determination of whether the murders were committed in\n\nan especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner).\n\n\n                                  -60-\n\f            Sampson stresses that the government had other means of\n\nmaking these points, such as by using medical examiner testimony or\n\ndiagrams.   It is, however, axiomatic that \"the evidentiary account\n\nof what a defendant has thought and done can accomplish what no set\n\nof abstract statements ever could, not just to prove a fact but to\n\nestablish its human significance.\"       Old Chief v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187-88 (1997).       Thus, within reasonable limits, the\n\nprosecution — even in a capital case — is entitled to present its\n\ncase through the evidence it deems most appropriate.      See id.   Those\n\nlimits were not exceeded here.\n\n            Sampson also complains that decomposition is visible in\n\nsome of the photographs.   While this feature obviously must be taken\n\ninto account in calibrating the balance of probative value and\n\nunfairly prejudicial effect, the record makes clear that the district\n\ncourt gave due weight to it.   Indeed, the court admitted only those\n\nphotographs that \"most closely depicted the condition of the victims\n\nat the time [of the killings].\"    Sampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 183.\n\n            The upshot is that the district court's handling of\n\ngruesomeness concerns, like its handling of the crime scene and\n\nautopsy evidence generally, demonstrated a thoughtful consideration\n\nof potential prejudice.    The court excluded much evidence, redacted\n\nother evidence, gave appropriate limiting instructions, and saw to\n\nit that admitted photographs were displayed circumspectly to the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\fjury.    We are left without any principled basis for finding that the\n\ncourt abused its discretion in regard to this evidence.13\n\n                2.   The Whitney Murder.    Sampson argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in admitting evidence of the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe Whitney murder.           Although he concedes that evidence of the\n\nmurder itself was admissible as a non-statutory aggravating factor,14\n\nhe contends that evidence about the details of the crime (which\n\nincluded photographs, taped confessions, and testimony from crime\n\nscene        investigators   and   the   medical      examiner)   was   not   really\n\nrelevant and, in all events, had a high potential for unfair\n\nprejudice.\n\n                We find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the\n\nWhitney evidence.        The FDPA broadly provides that \"[t]he government\n\nmay present any information relevant to an aggravating factor for\n\nwhich notice has been provided.\"                Id.   Here, the government gave\n\nadequate notice that it would introduce evidence of the Whitney\n\nmurder as a non-statutory aggravator, and the district court found\n\n\n        13\n      Although several of the photographs to which Sampson now\nobjects were not challenged in the district court, we need not\nfilter them through the plain error screen. It suffices to say\nthat there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's\nadmission of these photographs.\n        14\n      The term \"non-statutory aggravating factor\" is used to \"refer\nto any aggravating factor that is not specifically described in 18\nU.S.C. § 3592.\"    Jones, 527 U.S. at 377 n.2.     While only the\nfinding of a statutory aggravating factor can render a defendant\ndeath-eligible, the jury may consider non-statutory aggravating\nfactors in deciding whether a sentence of death is appropriate.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c)-(e).\n\n                                         -62-\n\fthat the evidence actually admitted would help the jury to determine\n\nhow much weight it should give this factor in its sentencing\n\ncalculus.   The evidence made the murder more real, demonstrated the\n\nevolution of Sampson's methods, and served to rebut his claims of\n\nmental impairment and remorse.\n\n            Sampson's   counter     —     that   the   prosecution    could     have\n\nestablished the details of the Whitney murder through his confession\n\nalone — is unavailing.        After all, the prosecution is entitled to\n\nconsiderable latitude in deciding how to present its case.                 See Old\n\nChief, 519 U.S. at 187-88.         Here, moreover, the district court was\n\nassiduous in its efforts to prevent unfair prejudice; for example,\n\nit excluded all the Whitney victim impact evidence and many of the\n\nproffered photographs. It also instructed the jury about the proper\n\nrole of the evidence admitted.          Taking everything into account, we\n\nfind the district court's judgments with respect to the Whitney\n\nevidence to be well within the encincture of its discretion.\n\n            3.     Other     Prosecutions.         Among   the     compendium     of\n\nmitigating factors presented to the jury, Sampson proposed to prove\n\nthat numerous other federal defendants convicted of multiple murders\n\nhad not been sentenced to death.               In support of this mitigating\n\nfactor, he sought to introduce verdict sheets and descriptive\n\nmaterial relating to 71 other federal capital cases. The government\n\nopposed   the    admission    of   this    evidence,     arguing    that   it    was\n\nirrelevant as it did not bear either on Sampson's character or\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\frecord or on the circumstances of the offenses at issue.                    See 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   3592(a)(8).       Sampson   trimmed   the   number      of    proposed\n\ncomparators to 47, and the district court determined that the\n\nevidence was arguably relevant in mitigation. The court then ruled,\n\nhowever, that the evidence's probative value was outweighed by the\n\nlikelihood of juror confusion.           On appeal, Sampson contests the\n\nexclusion of this evidence.\n\n             Sampson maintains, albeit in very general terms, that this\n\nevidence was relevant and that, under Tennard v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136994\"><a href=\"/opinion/136994/tennard-v-dretke-director-texas-department-of-criminal-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284-85 (2004), a trial court may not restrict the presentation\n\nof relevant evidence offered in mitigation of a possible death\n\nsentence.     This argument cannot be literally true; if it were, a\n\ncapital defendant would have an unrestricted license to introduce\n\nthe   most   confusing    or   misleading    evidence    as   long    as    it   was\n\nmarginally relevant.       We reject so absolutist a view.           See Purkey,\n\n428   F.3d   at   756   (explaining   that   the   FDPA's     low    barriers    to\n\nadmission of evidence in a capital sentencing hearing \"do[] not mean\n\nthat the defense has carte blanche to introduce any and all evidence\n\nthat it wishes\"); cf. Oregon v. Guzek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145676\"><a href=\"/opinion/145676/oregon-v-guzek/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1232 (2006)\n\n(commenting that \"the Eighth Amendment does not deprive [states] of\n\n[their] authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a\n\ndefendant can submit\").\n\n             This does not end the matter, however, for it seems\n\nappropriate to construe Sampson's argument as an argument that the\n\n\n                                      -64-\n\fdistrict court erred in balancing probative value against likelihood\n\nof juror confusion.     Framing the issue in that manner brings the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning into sharp focus.          The court explained\n\nthat it had found numerous omissions and inaccuracies in the case\n\nsummaries that Sampson proffered and that these defects greatly\n\ndiminished their probative worth.          The court also found that the\n\nquantity of evidence involved would saturate the record with largely\n\nextraneous material and create a grave risk of juror confusion.            The\n\ncourt noted:\n\n          In order to determine which of the many other\n          cases are sufficiently similar to this case to\n          bear on the question of proportionality, the\n          jury would have had to hear a large amount of\n          evidence. In effect, the court would have had\n          to conduct many mini-trials of other FDPA cases,\n          since a jury would be unable to perform\n          meaningful proportionality review based on brief\n          summaries of other cases. Rather, in order to\n          fully appreciate the verdicts reached in those\n          cases, jurors in this case would have had to\n          hear substantial testimony regarding the crime\n          and the defendant in the other cases.        The\n          amount of time that would have had to be spent\n          educating jurors regarding all other FDPA cases\n          in a non-prejudicial manner, which could have\n          been measured in weeks or months, as compared to\n          the amount of time spent on the mitigation case\n          as a whole, likely would have diverted the\n          jury's focus from the facts relating to Sampson\n          and his crimes.\n\nSampson IV, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 196.\n\n          On   this   chiaroscuro    record,   we   are   not   disposed    to\n\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the district court.              Having\n\nsupportably found that the evidence was of limited probative value\n\n\n                                    -65-\n\fand   that   its     introduction    would       create   a   high    risk   of    juror\n\nconfusion, the district court had ample reason to exclude it.                        See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).15\n\n             4.      Bank Robberies.        Next, Sampson contends that the\n\ndistrict     court    erred   in    (i)    admitting      evidence     of    the    five\n\nantecedent bank robberies that he committed in North Carolina and\n\n(ii) submitting four of them to the jury as potential non-statutory\n\naggravating factors.16        He asserts that the bank robberies satisfy\n\nneither the requirement that an aggravating factor \"genuinely narrow\n\nthe class of persons eligible for the death penalty,\" Zant, 462 U.S.\n\nat 877, nor the requirement that an aggravating factor rationally\n\ndistinguish \"those who deserve capital punishment from those who do\n\nnot,\" Arave, 507 U.S. at 474.\n\n             These    assertions    are     meritless.        Under    the   district\n\ncourt's instructions, four of the bank robberies served as potential\n\nnon-statutory aggravating factors — that is, as aggravating factors\n\nto be considered by the jury only after it found at least one\n\nstatutory aggravating factor to be present in the case.                           See 18\n\n\n\n      15\n      This determination renders it unnecessary for us to address\nthe government's alternate argument that this evidence did not in\nany event qualify as mitigating evidence.\n      16\n      Based on testimony that Sampson did not have a weapon during\none of the robberies, the district court ultimately submitted only\nfour of the robberies to the jury as potential aggravators.\nSampson makes no specific complaint about the singular handling of\nthe fifth (unarmed) robbery, which the court instructed the jury to\ndisregard.\n\n                                          -66-\n\fU.S.C. § 3593(e).        A non-statutory aggravating factor need only\n\n\"direct the jury to the individual circumstances of the case.\"\n\nJones, 527 U.S. at 402 (plurality opinion); see also Tuilaepa, 512\n\nU.S. at 972 (noting \"a separate requirement for the selection\n\ndecision,   where     the   sentencer   determines    whether     a   defendant\n\neligible    for    the   death   penalty    should   in   fact   receive   that\n\nsentence\").       So long as it meets this requirement, a non-statutory\n\naggravating factor ordinarily will pass constitutional muster.              See\n\nJones, 527 U.S. at 401-02 (plurality opinion).\n\n            The four bank robberies pass muster under this standard.\n\nThe government introduced evidence of the heists to demonstrate\n\nSampson's escalating criminality immediately prior to the string of\n\nmurders that he committed.       Because not every capital defendant will\n\nhave exhibited such a pattern, this evidence necessarily directed\n\nthe jurors to the individualized circumstances of Sampson's case.\n\nCf. id. at 402 (finding victim impact and victim vulnerability\n\nacceptable as non-statutory factors because they were \"inherently\n\nindividualized\"). Consequently, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion either in admitting evidence anent the bank\n\nrobberies or in authorizing the jury to consider four of those\n\nrobberies as potential non-statutory aggravating factors.\n\n            5.     Spectator Reactions.       Sampson's final evidentiary\n\nchallenge is non-traditional in nature.          It does not relate to the\n\nadmission or exclusion of evidence per se but, rather, to the\n\n\n                                     -67-\n\fdistrict court's denial of his motion for a mistrial based on the\n\nreactions of individuals in the gallery (particularly the victims'\n\nfamilies) to certain items of evidence.\n\n           This argument is a difficult one to make.           For one thing,\n\nvictim-impact    evidence,     although      inflammatory    by   nature,   is\n\ngenerally admissible in the sentencing phase of a capital case.             See\n\nPayne v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (1991).              For another thing,\n\nCongress has embedded the right of victims' families to attend an\n\naccused murderer's trial in federal law.          See 18 U.S.C. § 3510(b);\n\n42 U.S.C. § 10607(e)(2)(B).\n\n           Despite these obvious obstacles, Sampson asserts that, in\n\nthis case, the victims' families' ongoing reactions to the evidence\n\npresented were unfairly prejudicial.           He moved for a mistrial on\n\nthis ground, but the district court rebuffed his entreaty.                   He\n\nrenews the argument in this venue.\n\n           We review the denial of a motion for a mistrial under an\n\nabuse of discretion rubric.      United States v.

The   court    carefully     instructed    the        jurors   at   the\n\nbeginning of the trial that they were to decide the case based on\n\nthe evidence; it cautioned that \"anything you see or hear or read,\n\neven, outside of the bar that divides the lawyers and you from the\n\npublic is not evidence.\"           The court repeated this warning when the\n\ndefense raised concerns about a particular juror who appeared to be\n\nwatching the gallery intently, and added that the jurors \"should\n\nstay focused on what's occurring inside the rail and not on the\n\noutside of the rail.\"\n\n            Jurors are presumed to follow instructions.

For example, it requested that the Rizzo family members\n\nrelocate within the courtroom when a suspicion arose that they were\n\nseated in too prominent a place and that their seating might\n\ninfluence the jury.             (Indeed, the Rizzos were relocated to an\n\noverflow room when particularly disturbing evidence was presented.)\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\f           We need not tarry.                Although this was an emotion-laden\n\ntrial, the district court appears to have gone the extra mile to\n\nensure that the jury remained focused on the evidence and free from\n\nextraneous influences.           Given the measures that the district court\n\nprudently took to prevent unfair prejudice, we discern no basis for\n\na claim that the court abused its discretion in denying Sampson's\n\nmotion for a mistrial.17\n\n                        D.

We\n\nevaluate sufficiency challenges de novo, determining whether a\n\nrational   juror    could       have    found       the   disputed   facts     beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.

This suggestion derives from the\n\nprinciple that review of this aggravator ordinarily calls for\n\nassaying the evidence in light of a narrowing construction.             See\n\nBell v. Cone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137745\"><a href=\"/opinion/137745/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453-57 (2005).\n\n           Sampson's suggestion dislodges the principle from its\n\ncontextual underpinnings.       In the case at bar, this aggravating\n\nfactor   was    adequately   narrowed   by   the   district   court's   jury\n\ninstructions, see supra Part III(A)(3), which incorporated the\n\nFDPA's \"serious physical abuse\" language.            We therefore reject\n\nSampson's attempted tweaking of the standard of review and turn to\n\nhis specific challenges.\n\n           1.     Especially Heinous, Cruel, or Depraved Conduct.\n\nSampson notes that some of his post-arrest statements demonstrate an\n\nintent to kill his victims rapidly and that portions of the medical\n\nexaminer testimony corroborate this intent.             Building   on   that\n\nfoundation, he contends that a rational juror could not have found\n\nthat he inflicted \"serious physical abuse\" on McCloskey and Rizzo\n\nbeyond what was necessary to end their lives.           On this basis, he\n\n\n\n\n                                   -71-\n\fposits that the especially heinous, cruel, or depraved aggravating\n\nfactor was not supported by the evidence.\n\n              This     view    of   the      record     completely     disregards    the\n\nsubstantiality of the evidence supporting the jury's finding.                       With\n\nrespect to McCloskey, Sampson inflicted no fewer than 24 separate\n\nstab wounds.         In describing the slaying, he stated in a confession\n\nthat he \"didn't want to stop.\"                   He also admitted that he slit\n\nMcCloskey's throat after McCloskey said that he was dying.                          This\n\nevidence      easily    supported       a    reasonable     inference    that   Sampson\n\nintended to — and did — inflict serious physical abuse, well beyond\n\nwhat was necessary to kill McCloskey.                   Although Sampson adverts to\n\nsome evidence from which the jury might have reached a different\n\nconclusion (for example, his insistence to the police that McCloskey\n\n\"didn't suffer\"), the jurors had both the right and the obligation\n\nto    weigh   all     the     evidence,      judge    the   sources'    veracity,    and\n\ndetermine its significance.                 See United States v. Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (1st Cir. 1992).               As long as \"the jury's decipherment of\n\nthe    record    represented        a       plausible    choice    among   reasonable\n\nalternatives,\" it is deserving of respect.                   Id.\n\n              So, too, the jury's finding of especially heinous, cruel,\n\nor depraved conduct in relation to the Rizzo murder.                     Sampson first\n\nimmobilized Rizzo by tying him to a tree.                   Although he had learned\n\nthrough his experience with McCloskey that slitting a victim's\n\nthroat would kill swiftly, he nevertheless inflicted 15 stab wounds\n\n\n                                             -72-\n\fon Rizzo (several of which were themselves potentially fatal).                         At\n\nsome point during the repetitive stabbing, he cut his victim's\n\nthroat, severing the jugular vein and trachea.                    We think that this\n\nevidence,    viewed   in   the     light   most      favorable      to    the    verdict,\n\nunarguably sustains a conclusion that Sampson perpetrated serious\n\nphysical abuse (and thus, could be found guilty of especially\n\nheinous,    cruel,    or   depraved      conduct).          See   United     States    v.\n\nHernández, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769364\"><a href=\"/opinion/769364/united-states-v-jose-ramon-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 n.5 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that it\n\nis not an appellate court's role \"to resolve conflicts in the\n\nevidence\").\n\n            2.    Vulnerability.        Sampson next argues that the evidence\n\ndoes not support the jury's characterization of McCloskey as a\n\nparticularly vulnerable victim because of the absence of any nexus\n\nbetween McCloskey's vulnerability and his death.                         This claim is\n\nunconvincing.\n\n            McCloskey's     son-in-law       testified        that       McCloskey    had\n\nundergone open-heart surgery (a quintuple bypass) approximately one\n\nyear prior to his encounter with Sampson; that he was overweight and\n\nbecame short of breath easily; and that he had difficulty walking\n\nfifteen feet shortly before his murder.              Sampson's admission that he\n\nhad   to   help   McCloskey   up    a    hill   to    the    site    of    the    slaying\n\ncorroborated this testimony.             This evidence sufficed to ground a\n\nconclusion that McCloskey was a particularly vulnerable victim, that\n\nis, that he would have had a more difficult time escaping from his\n\n\n                                         -73-\n\fassailant than the average person.

And\n\ngiven the circumstances of this case, McCloskey's vulnerability\n\neasily could have contributed to his death.              No more was exigible.\n\nCf. Paul, 217 F.3d at 1001-02 (holding vulnerable victim factor\n\nsufficiently supported by evidence that victim was 82 and physically\n\nunable to resist attackers).\n\n           The   cases    on   which    Sampson   relies    do   not    demand   a\n\ndifferent result.      In United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2579849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2579849/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Va. 2001), the victim was killed instantly by an explosion,\n\nand the district court precluded any consideration of a vulnerable\n\nvictim    aggravating      factor      because    the    victim's      particular\n\nvulnerability — her pregnancy — was not in any way related to her\n\ndeath.    See id. at 560.      In Francis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1861135\"><a href=\"/opinion/1861135/francis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n2001), the only evidence of vulnerability was that the otherwise\n\nhealthy victims were 66 years of age.            See id. at 139.       Neither of\n\nthese decisions is apposite here.\n\n           By like token, Sampson's reliance on McCloskey's attempts\n\nto fight back is misplaced.            There is arguably some evidence of\n\nself-defense (such as the fact that McCloskey suffered several\n\ndefensive wounds).       However, as presented to the jury, the finding\n\nthat McCloskey was a vulnerable victim could have rested on his\n\n\n                                       -74-\n\finability    to   resist      attack   or   his     inability    to    escape.     The\n\nevidence, taken in the aggregate, was sufficient to allow the jury\n\nto find that McCloskey was a particularly vulnerable victim within\n\nthe purview of the FDPA.           See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(11).\n\n                              E.   New Trial Issues.\n\n            During the penalty-phase trial, Sampson attempted to prove\n\nseveral mitigating factors involving alleged mental illness.                     These\n\nincluded that, at the time of the killings, his \"capacity to conform\n\nhis   conduct     to   the   requirements      of   the   law    was   significantly\n\nimpaired,\"   that      he    was   functioning      \"under   a   severe   mental    or\n\nemotional disturbance,\" and that he was \"mentally ill.\"                     No juror\n\nfound that Sampson had demonstrated the existence of any of these\n\nfactors by a preponderance of the evidence.                  Sampson now assigns\n\nerror to the district court's rejection of his claims that the\n\njurors (i) should have found in his favor on one or more of these\n\nproffered mitigating factors, and (ii) misapplied the relevant\n\ninstructions.18\n\n            Since these claims were raised by way of a motion for a\n\nnew trial, we review the district court's disposition of them under\n\nan abuse of discretion rubric.              See United States v. George, 448\n\n\n\n      18\n      Sampson's quest for a new trial also included a claim that\nthe jury exhibited unfair prejudice due to a so-called \"white\nvictim\" effect.    What we have written earlier, see supra Part\nII(C)(1), fully disposes of the claim that the district court erred\nin denying this aspect of Sampson's motion for a new trial.\n\n\n                                        -75-\n\fF.3d 96, 101 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.

The   Mental    Illness   Mitigators.       We    start    with\n\nSampson's claim that the jury's failure to find mitigating mental\n\nillness factors was against the weight of the credible evidence.\n\n            The record contains a plethora of mental health evidence.\n\nThe government called numerous witnesses who had interacted with\n\nSampson during his week-long killing spree to demonstrate that he\n\nappeared calm, polite, and capable of normal discourse with others.\n\nThe defense offered the testimony of a social worker and several\n\nprison officials to inform the jury about Sampson's behavioral\n\npatterns and mental health history.            Both sides presented expert\n\nwitnesses   who     testified      about   mental   illness    in    general    and\n\nSampson's mental health in particular.\n\n            Taken    as   a   whole,   the    evidence   was   freighted       with\n\ncontradictions.      These contradictions, however, were grist for the\n\njury's mill.      See, e.g., Blake v. Pellegrino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200465\"><a href=\"/opinion/200465/blake-v-first-physicians-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47-48\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The dispositive consideration is that the record\n\ncontains more than enough evidence to warrant the conclusion that\n\nSampson's mental health need not be regarded as a mitigating factor.\n\n            There was, for example, expert testimony that Sampson\n\nsuffered from an antisocial personality disorder rather than from\n\nsome form of mental illness.           The record likewise contains expert\n\ntestimony that, during the killing spree, Sampson was not impaired\n\n\n                                       -76-\n\fin his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the\n\nlaw.   The same expert vouchsafed that Sampson's crimes were not the\n\nproduct of mental illness, emotional distress, or drug use.                The\n\ngovernment supplemented and supported this testimony through lay\n\ntestimony,    medical     and     psychiatric    records,    Sampson's     own\n\nstatements, and effective cross-examination of defense witnesses.\n\nIn the end, a jury reasonably could have concluded — as this jury\n\ndid — that Sampson did not suffer from any mental impairments\n\nsufficient to mitigate any need for the imposition of a death\n\nsentence.\n\n            Sampson accurately notes that the district court expressed\n\nsome disagreement with the jury on this point.              But the district\n\ncourt parted ways with the jury only on a relatively narrow issue:\n\nwhether Sampson suffered from bipolar disorder (the court indicated\n\nthat   it   found   the   defense's   expert    more   persuasive   than   the\n\ngovernment's expert on this point).          The jury was entitled to find\n\notherwise.    See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 713.\n\n            To cinch matters, the district court, after expressing its\n\nopinion, stated clearly that it \"d[id] not . . . find that the\n\nevidence on this issue predominate[d] heavily in favor of the\n\ndefendant being found to be bipolar\" and that, therefore, \"it\n\n[would] not [be] appropriate for the court to disregard the jury's\n\ndecision on the mitigating factor of mental illness.\"           Sampson III,\n\n332 F. Supp. 2d at 331.         In light of that finding — which is borne\n\n\n                                      -77-\n\fout by the record — the district court had no choice but to honor\n\nthe jury's determination.    See United States v. Rothrock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480164\"><a href=\"/opinion/480164/united-states-v-albert-h-rothrock-and-vivian-s-rothrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (1st Cir. 1986) (emphasizing that a trial judge \"is not a\n\nthirteenth juror\" and may not \"set aside a verdict merely because he\n\nwould have reached a different result\").    Like the district court,\n\nwe too reject Sampson's challenge to the jury's mental illness\n\nfindings.\n\n            2.    Post-Trial Juror Statements.     We turn next to a\n\nrelated matter.    A week or so after the jury returned its verdict,\n\na local newspaper quoted a juror to the effect that Sampson's\n\nability to \"know[] the difference between right and wrong\" was the\n\n\"fulcrum on which everything else balanced.\"     In a separate account,\n\nthe same juror reportedly stated that Sampson \"knew right from\n\nwrong.\"\n\n            Sampson interpreted these statements as evidence that the\n\njury had misapplied the court's \"mental illness\" instructions, which\n\nexplained that no one had argued that Sampson \"was completely unable\n\nto conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\"       Based on\n\nthis suspected misapplication, Sampson moved for a new trial or, in\n\nthe alternative, an evidentiary hearing.   The district court turned\n\nhim down, reasoning in part that post-trial juror statements could\n\nnot be used to impeach a verdict.        See Fed. R. Evid. 606(b).\n\nSampson now assigns error.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -78-\n\f            Rule 606(b) provides in pertinent part that, after a jury\n\nhas returned its verdict, juror statements may not be considered \"as\n\nto any matter . . . occurring during the course of the jury's\n\ndeliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other\n\njuror's mind . . . or concerning the juror's mental processes in\n\nconnection therewith.\"        The statements upon which Sampson relies\n\nordinarily would fall squarely within this prohibition: they concern\n\nthe jurors' evaluation of the mental health evidence and the weight\n\nthat they chose to attach to that evidence.\n\n            Although   conceding    that      Rule     606(b)    would    bar    the\n\nstatements under most circumstances, Sampson asseverates that they\n\nnevertheless should be admitted because, in capital sentencing\n\nproceedings, the FDPA displaces the Federal Rules of Evidence.                   His\n\nfallback position is that the heightened interest in the reliability\n\nof capital sentencing determinations trumps Rule 606(b).\n\n            We need not decide the issue.            Even if we assume, purely\n\nfor argument's sake, that the juror's statements should have been\n\ntaken into consideration, any error would have been manifestly\n\nharmless.     In that regard, we concur with the district court's\n\nalternate holding that the statements do not indicate that the jury\n\nnecessarily    misunderstood     the    court's      instructions        on   mental\n\nillness.    Given the reference to a \"fulcrum on which everything else\n\nbalanced,\"    the   juror's   statements      easily    can     be   construed    as\n\nreferring to the weighing decision rather than the special findings\n\n\n                                       -79-\n\fregarding the mental illness mitigators.              Thus, there was no abuse\n\nof discretion in the district court's refusal to grant either a new\n\ntrial or an evidentiary hearing               based on Sampson's objections to\n\nthe jury's mental illness findings.\n\n                            F.    Cumulative Error.\n\n            Sampson's penultimate claim is that the errors of which he\n\ncomplains,    even    if    not        mandating   reversal     when   considered\n\nseparately, collectively require that his sentence be vacated. We do\n\nnot dispute the legal premise on which this argument rests: \"a\n\ncolumn of errors may sometimes have a logarithmic effect, producing\n\na total impact greater than the arithmetic sum of its constituent\n\nparts.\"    United States v. Sepulveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    Here, however, the district court handled the case patiently\n\nand   sensitively.     None       of    its    individual   rulings    worked   any\n\ncognizable harm to Sampson's rights.               It necessarily follows that\n\nthe cumulative error doctrine finds no foothold in this appeal.\n\nIV.   ARBITRARINESS\n\n            In the final chapter of this appeal, we must independently\n\nevaluate, as required by the FDPA, \"whether the sentence of death\n\nwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other\n\narbitrary factor.\"         18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(1).            Having assiduously\n\nperformed that examination, we find no sign that any such factors\n\ncontributed to Sampson's sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -80-\n\f            The results of the jury's deliberations fully support this\n\nconclusion.   In addition to finding the aggravating factors that we\n\nhave discussed, the jurors failed to find other aggravating factors\n\nsuggested by the government.      Moreover, the jurors found several\n\nmitigating factors.      Viewed collectively, these findings suggest\n\nthat the jury considered the evidence in a thorough, even-handed,\n\nand dispassionate manner.    Cf. Paul, 217 F.3d at 1004-05 (finding no\n\narbitrariness when the jury followed \"exactly the process [it] was\n\nto complete\").\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject Sampson's principal assignments of error.        To the extent\n\nthat he has raised other claims of error, none requires discussion,\n\nand we reject them out of hand.\n\n            We add only that Sampson has been ably represented by\n\nlearned counsel.      His positions have been vigorously asserted.\n\nWhile we are aware that death is the ultimate punishment, we are\n\npersuaded   that   the   sentencing   proceedings   in   this   case   were\n\nconducted fairly and with      scrupulous attention to the process\n\nrequired by law.    Accordingly, we affirm the sentence of death.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -81-\n\f</pre>",
