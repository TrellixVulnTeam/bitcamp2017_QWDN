Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Edward D. Rapacki with whom Ellis & Rapacki LLP and Stuart T.\nRossman, National Consumer Law Center, were on brief for\nappellants.\n     Michael Arthur Walsh with whom Jennifer J. Aresco, Sandy Se\nYoung Shen and Choate, Hall & Stewart were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                          January 21, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam.       In this case, two plaintiffs brought an\n\naction under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. ยง 1001 et seq. (2000), on behalf of\n\nthemselves and class members, against the sponsors of several\n\nemployee health benefit plans and, in one case, against a related\n\nnon-profit     entity     that   provides    prescription      medication      to\n\nemployees covered by one of the plans.                The plans have fixed\n\n\"copayment\" requirements (e.g., $5.00 per prescription), and, in\n\nsome instances, the required copayment exceeds the actual cost of\n\nthe medication to the plan (although in many others the drugs are\n\nfar more expensive than the copayment).\n\n           The gist of the plaintiffs' claim is that whenever the\n\ncopayment exceeds the actual cost of the prescribed medicine to the\n\nplan,   the    excess     represents    money     wrongly    taken   from    the\n\nbeneficiary, comprising a violation of the terms of the plan, a\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and/or affirmative misrepresentation.                 In\n\na thorough and well-reasoned opinion, Judge Saris found that the\n\nplans clearly described what beneficiaries had to pay and that\n\nthere was neither a breach of fiduciary duty nor any affirmative\n\nmisrepresentation. Alves v. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc., 204\n\nF. Supp. 2d 198 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n           We agree with the district court's admirable discussion\n\nof the merits and see no reason to add anything more than our\n\nendorsement.     Standing objections were raised by the defendants in\n\nthe   district    court    and   rejected    by   Judge     Saris,   but    these\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fobjections   have   not   been   reasserted   on   appeal   and   raise   no\n\njurisdictional bar, so we do not comment upon them.               Like the\n\ndistrict court, we agree that there is no reason to address the\n\ncomplicated question of what remedies might be appropriate for\n\nvarious alleged violations because in this instance there was no\n\nviolation at all.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
