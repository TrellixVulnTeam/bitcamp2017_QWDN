App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as respondent.\n     **\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       Maya Cendrawasih, a native and\n\ncitizen of Indonesia, seeks review of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\")'s denial of her asylum application.           Cendrawasih\n\nleft Indonesia on September 26, 2001, entering the United States on\n\na non-immigrant visitor's visa that expired on March 24, 2002. She\n\nsought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief pursuant to the\n\nConvention    Against   Torture   (\"CAT\")   in   November   2002.      After\n\ndeportation proceedings were initiated, a hearing was scheduled to\n\nconsider her applications for all three forms of relief.\n\n            Cendrawasih testified that she is both Christian and\n\nethnic Chinese.    She recounted an incident where her brother was\n\nattacked and robbed by a group of Muslims, as well as incidents\n\nwhere a friend's relatives were raped and stabbed.          She personally\n\nfelt threatened when, in 1998, a group of Muslims--one carrying a\n\nknife--approached her on a bus, although she escaped by leaping off\n\nthe bus.     In June 2001, a Muslim taxi driver sexually assaulted\n\nCendrawasih, but she managed to escape without physical injury;\n\nthe driver called out after her: \"Chinese girl, where are you\n\nrunning to?\"\n\n            Cendrawasih also testified that toward the end of her\n\ntime in Indonesia, she became afraid to attend church due to\n\nbombings.     Since coming to the United States, she has been an\n\nactive member of her church. Cendrawasih married an Indonesian man\n\nin December 2003; the two have a young, U.S. citizen son.           Although\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fher father remained in Indonesia at the time of her initial\n\nhearing, both of Cendrawasih's parents are now lawful permanent\n\nresidents of the United States.\n\n            After the hearing, the IJ denied her relief save for\n\ngranting her voluntary departure; the IJ did not consider her\n\nasylum    application,   finding   it   time-barred,   but   resolved   the\n\nwithholding and CAT claims on the merits.       Cendrawasih appealed to\n\nthe BIA; the BIA initially dismissed her appeal but on motion to\n\nreconsider, remanded the asylum claim for resolution on the merits.\n\nThe IJ--relying on the testimony from the first hearing--denied\n\nrelief; the BIA then dismissed Cendrawasih's second appeal.             She\n\nnow seeks review in this court, challenging only the denial of\n\nasylum.\n\n            To obtain asylum, Cendrawasih had to establish a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b) (2009).           A\n\nshowing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption\n\nof future persecution.     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).     In addition, the\n\napplicant must establish that the persecution is a result of\n\ngovernment or government-supported action, or the government's\n\ninability or unwillingness to control private actors.          Budiono v.\n\nMukasey, 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f              The IJ found Cendrawasih to be credible, but denied\n\nrelief because she had failed to establish that her fear of future\n\npersecution was well-founded. The IJ determined that Cendrawasih's\n\ntestimony seeking to show past persecution established only a few\n\nisolated incidents, and her fear of future persecution--while\n\ngenuine--was not objectively reasonable, particularly in light of\n\nimproved country conditions.            On review, the BIA agreed that\n\nCendrawasih failed to meet her burden of proof to qualify for\n\nasylum; it also denied her request to consolidate her proceedings\n\nwith her husband's application.\n\n              Where a challenge is to factual determinations, we must\n\nuphold   IJ    and   BIA   decisions    when   \"supported   by   reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole,\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (citation\n\nomitted), reversing only if a reasonable fact-finder would be\n\ncompelled to conclude relief was warranted, id. at 483-84 (codified\n\nat Immigration and Nationality Act § 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B)). There may, of course, be other flaws in a decision\n\nbeside raw infirmities in fact-finding.\n\n              Cendrawasih's main argument in this court is that her\n\ncase should be remanded because the IJ and the BIA did not consider\n\nthe impact of her brother's successful application for asylum on\n\nher claims. She argues that a well-founded fear of persecution can\n\nbe based on the experiences of others who are similarly situated,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fand her brother is similarly situated to her. Her husband obtained\n\na remand from an adverse ruling, Ticoalu v. Gonzales, 472 F.3d 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), based in part on his brother's successful asylum\n\napplication, and on remand, her husband was granted withholding of\n\nremoval.1\n\n            We said in Ticoalu that the BIA should explicitly have\n\nconsidered whether the order granting Ticoalu's brother asylum was\n\nmaterial to Ticoalu's own claim; the court said that it was \"likely\n\nthat either the IJ in the instant case or the IJ who issued\n\nTicoalu's brother's order has erred in assessing the extent of\n\ninter-religious   violence   in   Indonesia   and,   in   particular,   in\n\nSulawesi.\"   Id. at 12.   However, there is no such tension in this\n\ncase and Ticoalu's reasoning does not apply: after Cendrawasih\n\nfiled her petition, the BIA reversed the IJ's grant of asylum to\n\nher brother.\n\n            The IJ and BIA here appropriately relied on country\n\ncondition reports, Budiono, 548 F.3d at 49, and found that, while\n\nthere is still religious tension in Indonesia, \"conditions . . .\n\nappear to be improving.\"      The problems faced by Christian and\n\nethnic Chinese individuals in Indonesia have been addressed by this\n\ncourt on numerous occasions, and we have upheld this determination,\n\n\n     1\n      Ordinarily, a spouse's successful asylum application would\nallow him to obtain derivative status for the other spouse.      8\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.21. But because her husband's\nasylum claim was time-barred and he obtained only withholding of\nremoval, the derivative route is not available to Cendrawasih.\n\n                                  -5-\n\ffinding   that   there    is   \"no    ongoing      pattern      or   practice    of\n\npersecution against ethnic Chinese or              Christians in Indonesia,\"\n\nKho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2007), and that thus\n\ncountry   conditions     without     more   do     not   qualify     a    Christian\n\nIndonesian for asylum, Sombah v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n            The individual difficulties Cendrawasih has faced, while\n\nthoroughly unpleasant, are a series of isolated incidents, Budiono,\n\n548 F.3d at 49, no greater than those faced by other Indonesian\n\nChristians that this court has found insufficient to warrant\n\nasylum. Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2006); Budiono,\n\n548 F.3d at 46, 49-50.             An individual singled out and more\n\nseriously   threatened     than    normal     on    account     of   a    protected\n\ncharacteristic    may     still    satisfy       the     statutory       test;   but\n\nCendrawasih does not meet this standard--or at least the IJ and BIA\n\nsupportably so found.\n\n            Cendrawasih    also      claims      that     the    BIA     erred    in\n\ndistinguishing her case from her husband's based on her ability to\n\nrelocate to Jakarta, which has experienced less religious tension\n\nthan her husband's native Sulawesi.              Federal regulations provide\n\nthat an asylum application may be denied if it is demonstrated by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that \"[t]he applicant could avoid\n\nfuture persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's\n\ncountry . . . and under all the circumstances, it would                           be\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\freasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\" Tendean v. Gonzales,\n\n503   F.3d     8,   11   (1st     Cir.   2007)   (quoting     8   C.F.R.   §\n\n1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B)).\n\n             It is not easy to sustain an order expelling Cendrawasih-\n\n-the parent of a young son--while her husband is entitled to remain\n\nin this country.     But the problem is not that there exists proof of\n\na well-founded threat to Cendrawasih's safety: it is that Congress\n\ndoes not allow derivative status to the spouse of one who himself\n\nqualifies     for   withholding    of    removal,   compare   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.21, even though this could result in\n\nthe break-up of a family.          Congress can alter this policy; we\n\ncannot.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",

An individual singled out and more\n\nseriously   threatened     than    normal     on    account     of   a    protected\n\ncharacteristic    may     still    satisfy       the     statutory       test;   but\n\nCendrawasih does not meet this standard--or at least the IJ and BIA\n\nsupportably so found.\n\n            Cendrawasih    also      claims      that     the    BIA     erred    in\n\ndistinguishing her case from her husband's based on her ability to\n\nrelocate to Jakarta, which has experienced less religious tension\n\nthan her husband's native Sulawesi.              Federal regulations provide\n\nthat an asylum application may be denied if it is demonstrated by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that \"[t]he applicant could avoid\n\nfuture persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's\n\ncountry . . . and under all the circumstances, it would                           be\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\freasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\" Tendean v.

But the problem is not that there exists proof of\n\na well-founded threat to Cendrawasih's safety: it is that Congress\n\ndoes not allow derivative status to the spouse of one who himself\n\nqualifies     for   withholding    of    removal,   compare   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.21, even though this could result in\n\nthe break-up of a family.
