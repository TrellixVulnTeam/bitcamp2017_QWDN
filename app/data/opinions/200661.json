Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bert J. Allen, III on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Schmidt and Wheeler & Arey, P.A. on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                            September 22, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.        Bert Allen III appeals pro se from the\n\ndistrict     court's     dismissal        of    his     complaint,        upon     the\n\nrecommendation of a magistrate judge, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(c).      Allen      filed    his   complaint       against    the    York    County\n\nSheriff's    Department,       Sheriff    Philip   Cote    and    \"other       unknown\n\nofficers\" under various provisions of the civil rights statutes, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1981 et seq., seeking damages for alleged violations of\n\nhis   constitutional      rights      that     occurred    between       during    his\n\nconfinement as a pretrial detainee at the York County Jail in\n\nSanford, Maine.\n\n            The central allegations in the complaint involve an\n\nincident in which Allen was allegedly attacked, knocked unconscious\n\nand sexually assaulted by an inmate at the behest of corrections\n\nofficers. Allen asserts that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to\n\ncover up this incident and impeded his efforts to seek redress\n\nthrough the administrative grievance process.                   Allen also claims\n\nthat, on another occasion, defendants incited inmates to attack him\n\nand a group of other pretrial detainees.                Thus instigated, Allen\n\nasserts that the inmates began to throw rocks and pieces of\n\npavement, one of which struck Allen in the eye.                        Allen further\n\ncontends that the investigation of both incidents was inadequate.\n\nFinally, Allen asserts that his medication was routinely stolen,\n\nthat his reports of the theft went unheeded, and that defendants\n\nengaged in a conspiracy to cover up this conduct.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f              After the magistrate judge issued a recommended decision\n\nconcluding that the complaint should be dismissed, Allen filed\n\nobjections which unequivocally stated that he wished to \"drop\" his\n\nclaims against the York County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff\n\nCote, \"leaving . . . correctional officers unknown[.]\" In light of\n\nthis concession, we conclude that Allen has waived review of his\n\nclaims against the Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Cote.             We add\n\nonly that, to the extent the district court failed to expressly\n\naddress Allen's claim for relief under provisions other than § 1983\n\n(e.g.,   42    U.S.C.   §§   1981,   1985   and   1988),   Allen's   factual\n\nallegations were insufficient to state a claim for such relief.\n\nAny remaining claims against \"correctional officers unknown\" were\n\nalso properly dismissed.\n\n              We note that Allen has raised a host of additional issues\n\non appeal, many of which (e.g., challenges to various aspects of\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997(e), and the\n\ndistrict court's denial of a request to amend the complaint in a\n\ncompanion case to add a claim for expungement of Allen's criminal\n\nrecord) are far beyond the scope of the current appeal.              To the\n\nextent Allen challenges the district court's discovery rulings, the\n\ndenial of his request for appointed counsel and contends that the\n\ndistrict court improperly decided disputed issues of fact, his\n\nclaims are meritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f         The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed.\n\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
