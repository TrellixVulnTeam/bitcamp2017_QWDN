George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Ali Hussein Addo on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Timothy Q.\nFeeley, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               August 26, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam.      Ali Hussein Addo pled guilty to one\n\ncount of defrauding Eastern Bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1344.   Addo opened an Eastern Bank bank account using a false\n\nname and identification document, deposited into the account\n\napproximately   $30,000    of   worthless   checks   and   thereafter\n\nwithdrew $9,503.75 before the account was closed by the bank.\n\nAddo has appealed.   We affirm.\n\n          We first note that Addo erroneously claims that he\n\nentered a conditional plea.     That contention is plainly wrong.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).      And, to the extent that there\n\nwas any \"condition\" to his plea agreement -- and the evidence\n\non this point is sparse at best -- Addo's description of the\n\nalleged condition is so implausible as to be incredible.\n\nAccording to Addo, the government agreed not to prosecute him\n\nin any way at any time for fraudulent activity with respect to\n\nFleet Bank accounts.      The government concedes that it agreed\n\nthat, in computing \"intended loss\" for purposes of sentencing\n\nAddo for his scheme to defraud Eastern Bank, it would not\n\ninclude any loss to Fleet Bank with respect to accounts held in\n\nthe name of Farah Kalif Adan and Yusuf Ali.          Fleet Bank ATM\n\ncards issued in those names were found in Addo's possession\n\nwhen he was arrested.\n\n           Even were we to accept Addo's contention that any\n\nside agreement covered prosecution and not simply sentencing\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fcalculation, at best, the agreement could conceivably have\n\nconcerned only past fraudulent activity with respect to the\n\nFarah Kalif Adan and Yusuf Ali Fleet Bank accounts and not\n\nfuture fraudulent activity.    And, Addo proffers no evidence\n\nthat he has been charged with any fraudulent activity with\n\nrespect to these accounts.     Therefore, contrary to Addo's\n\ncontention, the government has not violated any \"condition\" to\n\nhis plea agreement. Addo's claim that the government agreed to\n\nimmunize him from prosecution for any fraudulent activity with\n\nrespect to any Fleet Bank account at any time is simply\n\npreposterous.\n\n          We have considered the remaining issues raised by\n\nAddo in his appellate brief and conclude they are without\n\nmerit.\n\n          Addo's motion for an expedited appeal is moot.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
