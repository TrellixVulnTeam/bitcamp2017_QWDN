R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                          For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 04-1019\n\n                            J. ROGER ST.

We have read the briefs in this case,\n\nlistened attentively to oral arguments, and reviewed the record\n\nwith care.     We   conclude,     without    serious    question,   that    the\n\ndistrict court appropriately granted the defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment. The material facts are not genuinely in dispute.\n\nThe legal principles that govern this case are well-settled and the\n\ndistrict court applied those principles faultlessly. Consequently,\n\nwe summarily affirm the judgment below, substantially for the\n\nreasons set    forth   in   the   district    court's    bench   decision    of\n\nNovember 5, 2003, and its subsequent memorandum and order dated\n\nNovember 6, 2003.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f",
