Debtors Luis Vázquez Laboy and\n\nCarmen García Calderón claim they were unconstitutionally deprived\n\nof a hearing on damages due to them as a result of the Appellees'\n\nwillful violation of the automatic stay in their bankruptcy case.\n\nAppellees Doral Mortgage Corporation – who set in motion the stay\n\nviolation    –    and   its   former    attorney-notaries           at   Canales      Law\n\nOffices,     Edgardo        Canales    Idrach        and     Ángel       Rolán    Prado\n\n(collectively, Canales) – who actually carried out the acts that\n\nviolated the stay – have mounted a broad counter-attack, fighting\n\neverything       from   our   jurisdiction      to    the    willfulness         of   the\n\nviolation.       All this avails them nothing, however.                  Avoiding the\n\nconstitutional issue, we nevertheless find that the Debtors are\n\nentitled to present evidence, and we remand so they can do so.\n\n     Shenanigans at the Registry\n\n     This case's decade-plus of court proceedings all stem from the\n\nDebtors' purchase of a property in Corozal, Puerto Rico on December\n\n17, 1996.1       Not long after the purchase – on December 30, 1996 –\n\nthe Debtors presented their conveyance deed to the Registry of\n\nProperty.        Under Puerto Rico law, the Registry has sixty days\n\neither to record a deed that has been presented or to notify the\n\npresenters of any defects.            See 30 L.P.R.A. § 2255.             If a deed's\n\npresenters       do   not   correct    any    defect       within    sixty   days      of\n\n\n     1\n      The Debtors purchased the property from Manuel Angel Vázquez\nand Margarita Ortiz Bonilla; the notary who effected the\ntransaction was Luis F. Maldonado Rivera.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fnotification, then the presentation expires and the Registry will\n\nreject the deed.   See id.\n\n     On February 15, 1997 – before the initial sixty-day period was\n\nup, and with the conveyance deed still unrecorded – the Debtors\n\nborrowed $25,000 from Doral, secured by a mortgage on the property.\n\nCanales, acting as a notary retained by Doral, promptly presented\n\nthe mortgage deed to the Registry.2\n\n     This is where things went awry.   First, the Registry informed\n\nthe Debtors that their conveyance deed was defective.    So on May 5,\n\n1997, the Debtors withdrew the deed, as was their right under 30\n\nL.P.R.A. § 2254.    But the mortgage deed remained in limbo; its\n\npresentation expired and it was never recorded. The Registry ought\n\nto have informed Doral or Canales that the mortgage deed was\n\ndefective due to the withdrawal of the conveyance deed, see id. §§\n\n2255, 2272; Doral disputes that the Registry did so.     But there is\n\nno question that by July 29, 1999, Doral had learned that the\n\nconveyance and mortgage deeds remained unrecorded.      Nevertheless,\n\nit sat on its hands.   And in the meantime, on January 31, 2000, the\n\nDebtors filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.      Doral learned of the\n\nbankruptcy petition in February and entered the case in early\n\n\n\n     2\n       Under Puerto Rico law, a notary is an attorney specially\nauthorized to execute and give legal effect to certain documents –\nincluding deeds – so the documents will reflect the agreement of\nthe parties.    See 4 L.P.R.A. §§ 2002 (defining notary), 2031\n(defining \"public documents\" as including deeds), 2032 (notaries\nresponsible for conforming public documents to parties' agreement).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fMarch.\n\n     Now Doral was in a fix. The bankruptcy petition had triggered\n\nan automatic stay, forbidding any action to perfect a lien against\n\nestate property.   See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4).   But this restriction\n\nhurt Doral: Doral's interest in the Debtors' property remained un-\n\nperfected, and its position in the bankruptcy proceedings suffered\n\nas a result.3   If the mortgage had been recorded then Doral's claim\n\nagainst the bankruptcy estate would have been secured by a lien on\n\nthe property; the unrecorded mortgage, though, left Doral's claim\n\neffectively unsecured.    So, heedless of the stay, on December 1,\n\n2000, Canales – again acting as a notary retained by Doral –\n\npresented the mortgage deed to the Registry anew, this time with a\n\ncorrected conveyance deed.4    See 30 L.P.R.A. § 2275 (allowing for\n\na new presentation after the correction of defects).   The Debtors,\n\nhowever, did not take this lying down.\n\n     Adversary Action\n\n     On August 22, 2001, the Debtors filed an adversary action\n\n\n     3\n       See, e.g., In re SPM Mfg. Corp., 984 F.2d 1305, 1312 (1st\nCir. 1993) (\"If a lien is perfected and not otherwise invalidated\nby law, it must be satisfied out of the assets it encumbers before\nany proceeds of the assets are available to unsecured claimants,\nincluding those having priority.\").\n     4\n       Apparently the conveyance deed had already been corrected\nand re-presented by notary Julio E. Córa Lopez; Canales obtained a\ncopy of the corrected deed from the Registry and filed this copy\nwith the mortgage deed.     The correction and re-filing of the\nconveyance deed rendered the mortgage deed valid, and the copy of\nthe corrected conveyance deed evidenced this remediation to the\nRegistry.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fagainst    Doral   in   bankruptcy     court,   claiming   that   Doral's\n\npresentation of the mortgage deed willfully violated the automatic\n\nstay and seeking various relief, including damages, costs, and\n\nfees.5    Doral moved to dismiss the complaint.     For their part, the\n\nDebtors filed a motion for partial summary judgment on liability.\n\nThere followed a flurry of filings, including an amended complaint\n\nthat brought Canales into the case. Canales responded with its own\n\nsummary judgment motion.      Finally, on August 29, 2003 the court\n\ndismissed the action, holding that Doral's post-petition attempt to\n\nperfect its mortgage fell under an exception to the automatic stay.\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3).6\n\n\n     5\n       The filing of the corrected conveyance deed did not\nconstitute an act against the bankruptcy estate and therefore has\nnever been directly at issue.\n     6\n       Specifically, § 362(b)(3) provides           that   a   bankruptcy\npetition does not act as a stay against:\n\n     any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the\n     perfection of, an interest in property to the extent that\n     the trustee's rights and powers are subject to such\n     perfection under [11 U.S.C. § 546(b)] or to the extent\n     that such act is accomplished within the period provided\n     under [11 U.S.C. § 547(e)(2)(A)].\n\nSection 546(b) provides that a trustee's rights and powers are\nsubject to generally applicable laws (A) allowing the perfection of\na property interest \"to be effective against an entity that\nacquires rights in such property before the date of perfection\" or\n(B) \"provid[ing] for the maintenance or continuation of perfection\n. . . to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in\nsuch property before the date on which action is taken to effect\nsuch maintenance or continuation.\" Section 547(e)(2)(A) defines a\ntime period: \"at the time [a] transfer takes effect between the\ntransferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or\nwithin 30 days after, such time, except as provided in subsection\n\n                                     -5-\n\f       The Debtors moved for reconsideration, and after kicking the\n\nissue about for three years the court obliged by reversing itself,\n\ngranting the Debtors' motion for partial summary judgment, and\n\neffectively denying Doral and Canales's dispositive motions.                 The\n\ncourt recognized that Doral had been aware well in advance of the\n\nbankruptcy petition that its mortgage was unrecorded, and concluded\n\nthat       the   attempt   to   perfect    the    mortgage   had   constituted   a\n\nviolation of the automatic stay.                As a result, the court ordered\n\nDoral to withdraw the mortgage deed and turn it over to the Debtors\n\nfor cancellation.          An untimely appeal by Canales to the Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel (also \"BAP\" or \"Panel\") was swiftly dismissed for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.           See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a) (establishing\n\ntime to file); In re Abdallah, 778 F.2d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(Rule 8002 time limit is jurisdictional).\n\n       Buoyed by their string of successes, the Debtors petitioned\n\nthe    court      for   damages,   which    then-section     362(h)   authorized\n\nfollowing a willful violation of the automatic stay.7                 The former\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(h) read: \"An individual injured by any willful\n\nviolation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual\n\ndamages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate\n\n\n(c)(3)(B).\"   Subsection (c)(3)(B) refers to perfection \"on or\nbefore 30 days after the debtor receives possession of . . .\nproperty.\" As the body of this opinion notes, the bankruptcy court\noriginally found that the exception applies here but then reversed\nitself. Neither conclusion is now at issue.\n       7\n           Damages now fall under 11 U.S.C. § 362(k).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fcircumstances,           may   recover    punitive    damages.\"          The   Debtors\n\nexplicitly sought both a preliminary conference and a full hearing\n\non damages.         The court acceded to the request for a conference,\n\nwhich occurred on June 22, 2007,8 but the hearing on damages never\n\nhappened: on October 8, 2008, the court denied both the hearing and\n\ndamages, and attorneys' fees to boot, finding that the cancellation\n\nof the mortgage was remedy enough.               On December 17, 2008, the court\n\nentered a final judgment denying damages.               The Debtors appealed to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which summarily affirmed due to a\n\nmissing transcript; now they seek our review.\n\n       Jurisdiction\n\n       Before reaching the parties' substantive arguments, we must\n\ndetermine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the matter at\n\nall.       Doral and Canales say we do not, for two reasons.                    First,\n\nthey       say,    the    bankruptcy     court's    order     on   the    motion   for\n\nreconsideration constituted a final judgment, so the Debtors'\n\nrequest      for    damages     and   subsequent     appeal    months     later    were\n\nuntimely.         And second, they say, even if there were some question\n\nas to whether the court's order was a final judgment, the law of\n\nthe case requires us to hold that it was because the Bankruptcy\n\n\n       8\n       At the conference, the parties outlined their arguments on\nthe effect and validity of the court's self-reversal, and the court\nset a briefing schedule so the parties could lay out their\narguments in more detail. The court did not indicate that it would\nbe ruling on the Debtors' damages request; instead, the discussion\nsuggested that the court would sort out the procedural morass that\nfollowed its self-reversal.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fAppellate    Panel      so    held     and    no   one       challenged      the   Panel's\n\ndetermination.         Both of these arguments fail.                 We plainly \"have\n\njurisdiction      of    [timely]       appeals       from      all   final    decisions,\n\njudgments,     orders,        and     decrees\"     of        intermediate     bankruptcy\n\ntribunals.     28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(1).              Here, the BAP issued a final\n\ndecision    and   judgment       in    the    form      of    a   summary    affirmance.\n\nTherefore, we have jurisdiction.\n\n     We will, however, address Doral and Canales's jurisdictional\n\narguments as applied to the bankruptcy court, because if the\n\nbankruptcy court had no authority to entertain the Debtors' request\n\nfor damages then no hearing on damages was necessary and our review\n\ncan end there.\n\n     The first jurisdictional argument, again, goes to timeliness.\n\nSpecifically, Doral and Canales say that the Debtors' request for\n\ndamages was functionally equivalent to a motion to alter or amend\n\na judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) because it sought additional\n\nrelief after the court had already granted summary judgment.                          As a\n\nbasis for this argument Doral and Canales say the order granting\n\nsummary judgment was a \"final judgment\"; if it was then the motion\n\nmay be properly characterized as one under Rule 59.                       And if this is\n\nthe case then the motion had to be filed within ten days of the\n\noriginal judgment.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (amended in 2009 to\n\nextend filing period to twenty-eight days).                       Rule 59's time limit\n\nis jurisdictional.           Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1187\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f(1st Cir. 1992).      So, Doral and Canales conclude, because the\n\ndamages request was not filed within ten days of the summary\n\njudgment   grant,   the   bankruptcy   court   had   no   jurisdiction   to\n\nentertain it.       But if, as the Debtors argue, the motion was\n\nsomething other than one to set aside judgment, then the Rule 59\n\nten-day window would not apply.\n\n     The term \"final judgment\" is no misnomer – the Supreme Court\n\nhas held consistently for generations that it applies only to a\n\ndetermination that leaves nothing more for the court to do than to\n\nexecute judgment.     See Riley v. Kennedy, 128 S. Ct. 1970, 1981\n\n(2008) (\"A final judgment is 'one which ends the litigation on the\n\nmerits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the\n\njudgment.'\") (quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233\n\n(1945)).   It follows that if the issue of damages was still open\n\nwhen the court resolved the Debtors' motion for partial summary\n\njudgment then the court's determination was not final. See Garzaro\n\nv. Univ. of P.R., 575 F.2d 335, 337 (1st Cir. 1978) (holding that\n\nan order that \"leaves open the monetary liability of defendants, is\n\nnot a 'final' order\" and collecting sources).        Indeed, the Debtors\n\nrequested damages in their complaint and the court failed to act on\n\nthis request – the issue remained unresolved when the court granted\n\nsummary judgment.    The bankruptcy court referred to its conclusion\n\nonly as an order.      No judgment entered after the court's order.\n\nAnd later on, the court itself explicitly held that it had not\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fissued a final judgment.          The only thing that might lead us to\n\naccept Doral and Canales's contention that the order was a final\n\njudgment is a single line in the order: \"judgment must enter in\n\nfavor   of   the    debtors.\"      But   this    line    is    not   particularly\n\nconvincing – judgment did not actually enter at all.                      Given all\n\nthis, it is abundantly clear that the court did not issue a final\n\njudgment before the Debtors filed their motion for damages.                     There\n\nwas no motion to alter or amend judgment because there was no final\n\njudgment to alter or amend.\n\n     Doral    and    Canales    next   argue    that    the   law    of   the    case\n\neffectively    precluded        the    bankruptcy       court's      exercise     of\n\njurisdiction over the motion for damages.               This is so, Doral and\n\nCanales say, because the BAP dismissed Canales's appeal of the\n\norder granting summary judgment on the ground that it lacked\n\njurisdiction due to Canales's untimely filing.                According to Doral\n\nand Canales, the BAP's dismissal constituted an implicit holding\n\nthat the order was a final judgment.              However, that is not the\n\ncase.\n\n     \"The law of the case doctrine 'posits that when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern\n\nthe same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.'\"                   Remexcel\n\nManagerial Consultants, Inc. v. Arlequin, 583 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (quoting Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983)).\n\nWe need not expound on this doctrine in great detail, as it plainly\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fdoes not apply here.            Not only was the bankruptcy court's order\n\ngranting summary judgment not a final judgment, but the BAP did not\n\nhold that it was one either.            Intermediate bankruptcy tribunals\n\nhave jurisdiction over appeals not only from \"final judgments,\n\norders, and decrees,\" but also from \"interlocutory orders and\n\ndecrees.\"        28 U.S.C. § 158.           Any appeal to an intermediate\n\nbankruptcy       tribunal   –    whether    from   a   final    judgment   or   an\n\ninterlocutory order – is subject to the time limit imposed by Rule\n\n8002(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.9                  Thus, the\n\nBAP's       generic   determination    of    untimeliness      says   nothing   and\n\nimplies nothing about whether the unsuccessful appeal was from a\n\nfinal or interlocutory order.          For this reason, the law of the case\n\nhas no place here.\n\n     Doral and Canales propose the last-ditch policy argument that\n\nit would be unfair to allow the Debtors an opportunity to appeal\n\nwhen Canales was barred from the same opportunity; this argument is\n\nperhaps their least compelling.             Let us put it this way:      If Doral\n\nand Canales were correct that the order granting summary judgment\n\nconstituted a final judgment, then Canales dug its own appeal's\n\ngrave by filing fifty-eight days after the court's ruling – not\n\njust untimely, but very untimely.            But they are not correct on the\n\nfinal judgment issue, which means that when final judgment actually\n\n\n\n        9\n       Rule 8002(a) imposed a ten-day time limit for appeals until\n2009, when the limit was increased to fourteen days.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdid enter, there was no reason they could not have cross-appealed,\n\nfighting summary judgment before the BAP and then before us.    See,\n\ne.g., In re Bos. Reg'l Med. Ctr., Inc., 291 F.3d 111, 116 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (noting that appellees aggrieved by a lower court\n\njudgment may cross-appeal); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a) (establishing\n\ntime limit for cross-appeals).    They have not done so.   Doral and\n\nCanales have failed to avail themselves of procedures that were\n\nreadily available to them; this failure decidedly does not imply\n\nthat they were unfairly deprived of an opportunity to appeal the\n\norder granting summary judgment.\n\n     In the end, then, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over\n\nthe Debtors' damages motion, and we certainly have jurisdiction\n\nover the Debtors' appeal of its denial.    We turn now to the merits\n\nof the case.\n\n     Standard of Review\n\n     Before a bankruptcy case reaches us, appellants have two\n\noptions for intermediate review: they may be heard by a district\n\ncourt or a bankruptcy appellate panel.    In re Hill, 562 F.3d 29, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2009); see also 28 U.S.C. § 158.      Whichever option the\n\nappellants choose, in conducting our own review we \"cede no special\n\ndeference to the intermediate decision,\" focusing instead on the\n\nbankruptcy court's decision.   Hill, 562 F.3d at 32.   Our review of\n\nthe bankruptcy court's decision is de novo, though we will only\n\nupset the court's factual determinations in the case of clear\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\ferror.     Id.\n\n      Willful Violation\n\n      An important premise of the Debtors' appeal is that the\n\nbankruptcy court found Doral and Canales to have willfully violated\n\nthe automatic stay.          Without a willful violation, the damages\n\nprovision of 11 U.S.C. § 362 by its terms would become irrelevant.\n\nDoral and Canales claim that the bankruptcy court never found a\n\nwillful violation. They focus on the absence of the word \"willful\"\n\nanywhere in the court's analyses.             They further argue that there\n\nwas no willful violation as a matter of fact, precluding partial\n\nsummary judgment in the Debtors' favor and therefore precluding\n\ndamages.     We disagree: as the bankruptcy court effectively held,\n\nthere was a willful violation as a matter of undisputed fact.10\n\n      A    violation    is   \"willful\"   if    a   \"creditor's    conduct   was\n\nintentional (as distinguished from inadvertent), and committed with\n\nknowledge of the pendency of the bankruptcy case.\" In re McMullen,\n\n386 F.3d 320, 330 (1st Cir. 2004).         Doral and Canales cannot and do\n\nnot   contest    that   Canales,   at    Doral's    request,     intentionally\n\npresented the mortgage deed to the Registry after the Debtors had\n\n\n\n      10\n        We also pause to note that, because neither Doral nor\nCanales cross-appealed, there is no direct challenge before us as\nto the bankruptcy court's summary judgment grant, including its\ndetermination that a willful violation occurred.      The willful-\nviolation question remains alive only to the extent that it affects\nthe Debtors' right to damages. This limitation affects not only\nour analysis but also the effect of our decision: specifically, the\nmortgage remains cancelled because no one challenged that result.\n\n                                    -13-\n\ffiled their bankruptcy case.          Nor is there any dispute that Doral\n\nhad knowledge of the case while it retained Canales, given that\n\nDoral filed a notice of appearance in the underlying bankruptcy\n\ncase    months   before   Canales     filed   the   mortgage   deed   with   the\n\nRegistry. Doral and Canales each attempt to cast themselves as the\n\nguiltless party in the filing of the deed: Doral claims that\n\nCanales     filed   the   deed   on   the   basis   of   Doral's   pre-petition\n\nurgings, and Canales claims that it did so without notice from\n\nDoral as to the pending bankruptcy action.               In other words, Doral\n\ntook no actions once it had knowledge, and Canales did take actions\n\nbut had no knowledge.       Diffusion of responsibility, however, gets\n\nthem nowhere.       See McMullen, 386 F.3d at 331 (cataloguing cases of\n\njoint willful violations); see also In re Timbs, 178 B.R. 989, 995\n\n(Bkrtcy. E.D. Tenn. 1994) (cataloguing cases of joint willful\n\nviolations by attorney and client).             It seems to us that Doral\n\nought to have informed Canales when it learned of the bankruptcy\n\npetition, and that Canales – given the notary's role of giving\n\nlegal effect to \"the will of the parties,\" 4 L.P.R.A. § 2002\n\n(emphasis added) – ought to have done more than follow Doral's word\n\nalone.11    Despite their protestations, Doral and Canales's acts are\n\n\n       11\n       Indeed, Canales's argument that it acted not in concert with\nDoral, but rather in its independent role as a notary – effectively\na public officer – is neither carefully advanced nor well-taken.\nDoral told Canales it wished to foreclose against the Debtors and\nneeded the mortgage deed to be registered properly.         By all\naccounts, Canales asked no questions, did not contact the Debtors,\nand simply did Doral's bidding. On the plain-as-day record and the\n\n                                       -14-\n\fnot wholly separable from one another, and in the end there is no\n\nquestion that each is responsible for a willful violation as a\n\nmatter of law.     See McMullen, 386 F.3d at 331.\n\n     Doral   and    Canales   argue   that   the   bankruptcy   court's\n\ndetermination that \"[t]he present case is more like an avoidance\n\naction . . . than a common violation of the automatic stay\"\n\nforecloses a finding of willfulness as a matter of law.         They do\n\nnot, however, explain how this avoidance analogy (which the court\n\nused only to support its decision not to award damages) might\n\naffect our willfulness analysis.         Instead, the analogy seems\n\ndesigned to fit the proverbial round peg (here, a willful violation\n\nof the stay) into a square hole (here, an avoidance action),\n\ncasting this case as something it is not.     We have already spelled\n\nout what constitutes a willful violation, applied that standard\n\nhere, and concluded that there was such a violation.      In contrast,\n\nan avoidance action allows a bankruptcy trustee to cancel an\n\nimproper conveyance or recover for the estate the value of the\n\nimproperly conveyed property.     See 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 545, 547(b),\n\n548(a), 549(a).     Here, the adversary action may indeed have been\n\nlike an avoidance action in that cancelling an improper conveyance\n\n\nsparse law cited by Canales, the firm acted not independently but\nrather on Doral's behalf.      Our own research bears out this\nconclusion. See, e.g., Chévere v. Cátala, 115 D.P.R. 432, 438, 15\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 572 (P.R. 1984) (discussing the notary's\ninherent duty to \"investigate the facts and data on which the\nefficacy or validity of [a] transaction rests\") (emphasis and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwas a portion of the remedy, but it simply was not one.12              Doral and\n\nCanales's analogy to avoidance actions cannot trump the language of\n\nthe statute that actually applies here and the well-established\n\ncase    law    construing    that   language;   as   a   matter   of    plainly\n\napplicable law, Doral and Canales willfully violated the stay.\n\n       Hearing on Damages\n\n       Now we reach the meat of the appeal: the Debtors' contention\n\nthat the court erred by denying them a hearing on damages.                  The\n\nparties frame this as an issue implicating the Fifth Amendment's\n\nDue Process Clause.         But \"courts should not decide constitutional\n\nissues when this can be avoided,\" see United States v. Vilches-\n\nNavarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 9 n.6 (1st Cir. 2008), and we can address\n\nthe Debtors' concerns without recourse to the Fifth Amendment.\n\n       The opportunity for a plaintiff to present evidence on damages\n\nafter winning partial summary judgment on liability is a right so\n\nfundamental in civil proceedings that it normally goes without\n\nsaying.       See, e.g., Donahue v. United States, 634 F.3d 615, 622\n\n(1st Cir. 2011) (district court \"granted partial summary judgment\n\n. . . with respect to liability\" and then \"held a bench trial on\n\nthe issue of damages\"); In re Rivera Torres, 432 F.3d 20, 22 (1st\n\n\n\n       12\n        The fact of the separate statutory bases for willful\nviolation actions (11 U.S.C. § 362) and avoidance actions (11\nU.S.C. § 544) also renders inapposite the bankruptcy court's, and\nDoral and Canales's, reliance on In re Burns, 322 F.3d 421 (6th\nCir. 2003).    Burns dealt only with avoidance actions and had\nnothing whatsoever to say about willful violations.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fCir. 2005) (\"The bankruptcy court entered partial summary judgment\n\nin favor of the Debtors, subject to a later hearing on damages.\");\n\nVélez v. Awning Windows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(district court \"granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary\n\njudgment . . . resolv[ing] the issue of liability\" and then\n\n\"convened a damages hearing before a jury\"); accord 10B Wright,\n\nMiller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2736 (3d ed. 1998)\n\n(noting that \"if the court establishes the existence of liability\"\n\nvia partial summary judgment, \"the case then will proceed for a\n\ndetermination of the damage issue\").               Such an opportunity is\n\nnecessary here given the bankruptcy code's unequivocal mandate of\n\nactual damages following a willful violation of an automatic stay.\n\nAs a reminder, the statute at issue provides: \"An individual\n\ninjured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section\n\nshall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(h) (prior to amendment).       There can be no question\n\nthat, as a general matter, the statute mandates actual damages.\n\nAnd it would be impossible for a court to set the amount of actual\n\ndamages, costs, and attorneys' fees without taking evidence. Thus,\n\nthe bankruptcy court frustrated both the statute's language and its\n\nmandated result by denying the Debtors a chance to prove damages.\n\nIn order \"to enforce [the statute] according to its terms,\" as both\n\nwe   and   the   bankruptcy   court   must   do,    remand   is   necessary.\n\nCaminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917); see also\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fMass. Museum of Contemporary Art Found., Inc. v. Buchel, 593 F.3d\n\n38, 50 (1st Cir. 2010) (same).\n\n      Anticipating our decision's grounding in statutory language,\n\nDoral and Canales claim that the court's determination of a willful\n\nviolation is not enough to trigger a damages inquiry: they say that\n\nin order to be statutorily entitled to damages a party must first\n\nprove injury, too.     See 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) (prior to amendment,\n\nestablishing right to recovery for \"[a]n individual injured by any\n\nwillful violation,\" emphasis added).         The Debtors claim injury:\n\nthey have expended court costs and attorneys' fees in order to\n\nvindicate the automatic stay, and the statute mandates that they\n\nmay recover both as actual damages.13       Moreover, in the context of\n\na procedural argument founded on the absence of any opportunity to\n\noffer proof of damages, Doral and Canales's contention puts the\n\ntrailer before the tractor.        The Debtors would no doubt welcome an\n\nopportunity to prove injury, which is closely intertwined with\n\ndamages; as it is, they have not had the opportunity to prove\n\nanything beyond the willful violation.        The Debtors also point out\n\nthat in each of a plethora of non-binding lower-court cases Doral\n\nand   Canales   cite   on   this   point,   the   court   made   its   final\n\ndetermination on damages only after reviewing evidence specific to\n\n\n      13\n       The Debtors have made it plain enough that these are exactly\nthe damages they seek: on appeal, they have waived their right to\npursue actual damages other than costs and attorneys' fees except\nto the extent such damages might be necessary for an award of\ncosts.\n\n                                    -18-\n\finjury and damages.14    Thus, contrary to Doral and Canales's\n\ncontentions, these cases support the Debtors' argument that the\n\nstatute affords them an opportunity to present evidence.       The\n\nDebtors have a statutory right to prove damages after a willful\n\nviolation of the automatic stay, and such a violation is precisely\n\nwhat occurred here.\n\n     The parties spend more energy on the question of whether the\n\nbankruptcy court already provided adequate opportunity for the\n\nDebtors to prove damages.    As a starting point, Doral says we\n\ncannot review the question at all and must summarily affirm because\n\nthe Debtors have not produced a transcript of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's conference that was nominally on damages. This might be an\n\nissue, except for the undisputed fact that the court never held an\n\nevidentiary hearing but, instead, explicitly denied the Debtors'\n\nrequest for one.   Cf. Rodríguez v. Señor Frog's de la Isla, Inc.,\n\nNo. 09-2548, 2011 WL 1364934, at *7 (1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2011)\n\n(argument could not succeed absent transcript because there was not\n\n\"enough raw material so that we [could] do our job\").    Moreover,\n\nthe transcript is readily available through the bankruptcy court\n\n\n\n     14\n       In re Heghmann, 316 B.R. 395, 399 (1st Cir. B.A.P. 2004)\n(hearing involving testimony of two witnesses); In re Dayley, 349\nB.R. 825, 829 (Bkrtcy. D. Idaho 2006) (outlining testimony on\ndamages); In re Skeen, 248 B.R. 312, 319 (Bkrtcy. E.D. Tenn. 2000)\n(hearing involving testimony on, e.g., lost wages); In re Clayton,\n235 B.R. 801, 805 (Bkrtcy. M.D.N.C. 1998) (full trial on all\nissues); In re Sucre, 226 B.R. 340, 344 (Bkrtcy. S.D.N.Y. 1998)\n(damages award based in part on review of pay stubs).\n\n                               -19-\n\fdocket: it shows that the court discussed damages barely if at all\n\nand took no evidence.           Instead, at the June 22, 2007 status\n\nconference, the parties laid out a skeletal version of their legal\n\narguments, and the court ordered further briefing.           Between the\n\nbankruptcy court's rejection of a damages hearing and the easily\n\nobtained transcript's showing that the status conference did not\n\nallow for the presentation of evidence, there is more than enough\n\nfor us to conclude, as we do, that the court improperly denied the\n\nDebtors an opportunity to prove damages.\n\n       Wrapping up, we note that the bankruptcy court's decision\n\nitself shows why such an opportunity is necessary.            The record\n\nreveals no clear foundation for the bankruptcy court's conclusion\n\nthat damages were unwarranted.       The court only suggested that the\n\nadversary proceeding was \"like an avoidance action,\" but did not\n\notherwise support its conclusion that cancellation of the mortgage\n\nwas a sufficient remedy for the willful violation.         And the court\n\ngave   no   explanation   for    disregarding   the   statute's   language\n\nmandating the recovery of costs and attorneys' fees.         The court's\n\nconclusion is rooted in neither record nor statute, and an analogy\n\nunsupported by any evidence is not enough to justify its decision\n\nto disregard the statute's mandatory language and deny damages.\n\n       Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's denial of a hearing on damages, vacate its rejection of\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fdamages, and remand for the parties to present evidence on damages.\n\nCosts are taxed in favor of the appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

Debtors Luis Vázquez Laboy and\n\nCarmen García Calderón claim they were unconstitutionally deprived\n\nof a hearing on damages due to them as a result of the Appellees'\n\nwillful violation of the automatic stay in their bankruptcy case.\n\nAppellees Doral Mortgage Corporation – who set in motion the stay\n\nviolation    –    and   its   former    attorney-notaries           at   Canales      Law\n\nOffices,     Edgardo        Canales    Idrach        and     Ángel       Rolán    Prado\n\n(collectively, Canales) – who actually carried out the acts that\n\nviolated the stay – have mounted a broad counter-attack, fighting\n\neverything       from   our   jurisdiction      to    the    willfulness         of   the\n\nviolation.       All this avails them nothing, however.                  Avoiding the\n\nconstitutional issue, we nevertheless find that the Debtors are\n\nentitled to present evidence, and we remand so they can do so.\n\n     Shenanigans at the Registry\n\n     This case's decade-plus of court proceedings all stem from the\n\nDebtors' purchase of a property in Corozal, Puerto Rico on December\n\n17, 1996.1       Not long after the purchase – on December 30, 1996 –\n\nthe Debtors presented their conveyance deed to the Registry of\n\nProperty.        Under Puerto Rico law, the Registry has sixty days\n\neither to record a deed that has been presented or to notify the\n\npresenters of any defects.            See 30 L.P.R.A. § 2255.             If a deed's\n\npresenters       do   not   correct    any    defect       within    sixty   days      of\n\n\n     1\n      The Debtors purchased the property from Manuel Angel Vázquez\nand Margarita Ortiz Bonilla; the notary who effected the\ntransaction was Luis F. Maldonado Rivera.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fnotification, then the presentation expires and the Registry will\n\nreject the deed.   See id.\n\n     On February 15, 1997 – before the initial sixty-day period was\n\nup, and with the conveyance deed still unrecorded – the Debtors\n\nborrowed $25,000 from Doral, secured by a mortgage on the property.\n\nCanales, acting as a notary retained by Doral, promptly presented\n\nthe mortgage deed to the Registry.2\n\n     This is where things went awry.   First, the Registry informed\n\nthe Debtors that their conveyance deed was defective.    So on May 5,\n\n1997, the Debtors withdrew the deed, as was their right under 30\n\nL.P.R.A. § 2254.    But the mortgage deed remained in limbo; its\n\npresentation expired and it was never recorded. The Registry ought\n\nto have informed Doral or Canales that the mortgage deed was\n\ndefective due to the withdrawal of the conveyance deed, see id. §§\n\n2255, 2272; Doral disputes that the Registry did so.     But there is\n\nno question that by July 29, 1999, Doral had learned that the\n\nconveyance and mortgage deeds remained unrecorded.      Nevertheless,\n\nit sat on its hands.   And in the meantime, on January 31, 2000, the\n\nDebtors filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.      Doral learned of the\n\nbankruptcy petition in February and entered the case in early\n\n\n\n     2\n       Under Puerto Rico law, a notary is an attorney specially\nauthorized to execute and give legal effect to certain documents –\nincluding deeds – so the documents will reflect the agreement of\nthe parties.    See 4 L.P.R.A. §§ 2002 (defining notary), 2031\n(defining \"public documents\" as including deeds), 2032 (notaries\nresponsible for conforming public documents to parties' agreement).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fMarch.\n\n     Now Doral was in a fix. The bankruptcy petition had triggered\n\nan automatic stay, forbidding any action to perfect a lien against\n\nestate property.   See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4).   But this restriction\n\nhurt Doral: Doral's interest in the Debtors' property remained un-\n\nperfected, and its position in the bankruptcy proceedings suffered\n\nas a result.3   If the mortgage had been recorded then Doral's claim\n\nagainst the bankruptcy estate would have been secured by a lien on\n\nthe property; the unrecorded mortgage, though, left Doral's claim\n\neffectively unsecured.    So, heedless of the stay, on December 1,\n\n2000, Canales – again acting as a notary retained by Doral –\n\npresented the mortgage deed to the Registry anew, this time with a\n\ncorrected conveyance deed.4    See 30 L.P.R.A. § 2275 (allowing for\n\na new presentation after the correction of defects).   The Debtors,\n\nhowever, did not take this lying down.\n\n     Adversary Action\n\n     On August 22, 2001, the Debtors filed an adversary action\n\n\n     3\n       See, e.g., In re SPM Mfg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599258\"><a href=\"/opinion/599258/in-re-spm-manufacturing-corporation-debtor-official-unsecured-creditors/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1312 (1st\nCir. 1993) (\"If a lien is perfected and not otherwise invalidated\nby law, it must be satisfied out of the assets it encumbers before\nany proceeds of the assets are available to unsecured claimants,\nincluding those having priority.\").\n     4\n       Apparently the conveyance deed had already been corrected\nand re-presented by notary Julio E. Córa Lopez; Canales obtained a\ncopy of the corrected deed from the Registry and filed this copy\nwith the mortgage deed.     The correction and re-filing of the\nconveyance deed rendered the mortgage deed valid, and the copy of\nthe corrected conveyance deed evidenced this remediation to the\nRegistry.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fagainst    Doral   in   bankruptcy     court,   claiming   that   Doral's\n\npresentation of the mortgage deed willfully violated the automatic\n\nstay and seeking various relief, including damages, costs, and\n\nfees.5    Doral moved to dismiss the complaint.     For their part, the\n\nDebtors filed a motion for partial summary judgment on liability.\n\nThere followed a flurry of filings, including an amended complaint\n\nthat brought Canales into the case. Canales responded with its own\n\nsummary judgment motion.      Finally, on August 29, 2003 the court\n\ndismissed the action, holding that Doral's post-petition attempt to\n\nperfect its mortgage fell under an exception to the automatic stay.\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3).6\n\n\n     5\n       The filing of the corrected conveyance deed did not\nconstitute an act against the bankruptcy estate and therefore has\nnever been directly at issue.\n     6\n       Specifically, § 362(b)(3) provides           that   a   bankruptcy\npetition does not act as a stay against:\n\n     any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the\n     perfection of, an interest in property to the extent that\n     the trustee's rights and powers are subject to such\n     perfection under [11 U.S.C. § 546(b)] or to the extent\n     that such act is accomplished within the period provided\n     under [11 U.S.C. § 547(e)(2)(A)].\n\nSection 546(b) provides that a trustee's rights and powers are\nsubject to generally applicable laws (A) allowing the perfection of\na property interest \"to be effective against an entity that\nacquires rights in such property before the date of perfection\" or\n(B) \"provid[ing] for the maintenance or continuation of perfection\n. . . to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in\nsuch property before the date on which action is taken to effect\nsuch maintenance or continuation.\" Section 547(e)(2)(A) defines a\ntime period: \"at the time [a] transfer takes effect between the\ntransferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or\nwithin 30 days after, such time, except as provided in subsection\n\n                                     -5-\n\f       The Debtors moved for reconsideration, and after kicking the\n\nissue about for three years the court obliged by reversing itself,\n\ngranting the Debtors' motion for partial summary judgment, and\n\neffectively denying Doral and Canales's dispositive motions.                 The\n\ncourt recognized that Doral had been aware well in advance of the\n\nbankruptcy petition that its mortgage was unrecorded, and concluded\n\nthat       the   attempt   to   perfect    the    mortgage   had   constituted   a\n\nviolation of the automatic stay.                As a result, the court ordered\n\nDoral to withdraw the mortgage deed and turn it over to the Debtors\n\nfor cancellation.          An untimely appeal by Canales to the Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel (also \"BAP\" or \"Panel\") was swiftly dismissed for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.           See Fed. R. Bankr.

The court acceded to the request for a conference,\n\nwhich occurred on June 22, 2007,8 but the hearing on damages never\n\nhappened: on October 8, 2008, the court denied both the hearing and\n\ndamages, and attorneys' fees to boot, finding that the cancellation\n\nof the mortgage was remedy enough.               On December 17, 2008, the court\n\nentered a final judgment denying damages.               The Debtors appealed to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which summarily affirmed due to a\n\nmissing transcript; now they seek our review.\n\n       Jurisdiction\n\n       Before reaching the parties' substantive arguments, we must\n\ndetermine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the matter at\n\nall.       Doral and Canales say we do not, for two reasons.                    First,\n\nthey       say,    the    bankruptcy     court's    order     on   the    motion   for\n\nreconsideration constituted a final judgment, so the Debtors'\n\nrequest      for    damages     and   subsequent     appeal    months     later    were\n\nuntimely.         And second, they say, even if there were some question\n\nas to whether the court's order was a final judgment, the law of\n\nthe case requires us to hold that it was because the Bankruptcy\n\n\n       8\n       At the conference, the parties outlined their arguments on\nthe effect and validity of the court's self-reversal, and the court\nset a briefing schedule so the parties could lay out their\narguments in more detail. The court did not indicate that it would\nbe ruling on the Debtors' damages request; instead, the discussion\nsuggested that the court would sort out the procedural morass that\nfollowed its self-reversal.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fAppellate    Panel      so    held     and    no   one       challenged      the   Panel's\n\ndetermination.         Both of these arguments fail.                 We plainly \"have\n\njurisdiction      of    [timely]       appeals       from      all   final    decisions,\n\njudgments,     orders,        and     decrees\"     of        intermediate     bankruptcy\n\ntribunals.     28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(1).              Here, the BAP issued a final\n\ndecision    and   judgment       in    the    form      of    a   summary    affirmance.\n\nTherefore, we have jurisdiction.\n\n     We will, however, address Doral and Canales's jurisdictional\n\narguments as applied to the bankruptcy court, because if the\n\nbankruptcy court had no authority to entertain the Debtors' request\n\nfor damages then no hearing on damages was necessary and our review\n\ncan end there.\n\n     The first jurisdictional argument, again, goes to timeliness.\n\nSpecifically, Doral and Canales say that the Debtors' request for\n\ndamages was functionally equivalent to a motion to alter or amend\n\na judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) because it sought additional\n\nrelief after the court had already granted summary judgment.                          As a\n\nbasis for this argument Doral and Canales say the order granting\n\nsummary judgment was a \"final judgment\"; if it was then the motion\n\nmay be properly characterized as one under Rule 59.                       And if this is\n\nthe case then the motion had to be filed within ten days of the\n\noriginal judgment.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (amended in 2009 to\n\nextend filing period to twenty-eight days).                       Rule 59's time limit\n\nis jurisdictional.           Barrett v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584145\"><a href=\"/opinion/584145/james-barrett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\f(1st Cir. 1992).      So, Doral and Canales conclude, because the\n\ndamages request was not filed within ten days of the summary\n\njudgment   grant,   the   bankruptcy   court   had   no   jurisdiction   to\n\nentertain it.       But if, as the Debtors argue, the motion was\n\nsomething other than one to set aside judgment, then the Rule 59\n\nten-day window would not apply.\n\n     The term \"final judgment\" is no misnomer – the Supreme Court\n\nhas held consistently for generations that it applies only to a\n\ndetermination that leaves nothing more for the court to do than to\n\nexecute judgment.     See Riley v. Kennedy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145807\"><a href=\"/opinion/145807/riley-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It follows that if the issue of damages was still open\n\nwhen the court resolved the Debtors' motion for partial summary\n\njudgment then the court's determination was not final. See Garzaro\n\nv. Univ. of P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355496\"><a href=\"/opinion/355496/rafael-garzaro-v-the-university-of-puerto-rico-wilfredo-miranda-irlanda/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337 (1st Cir. 1978) (holding that\n\nan order that \"leaves open the monetary liability of defendants, is\n\nnot a 'final' order\" and collecting sources).        Indeed, the Debtors\n\nrequested damages in their complaint and the court failed to act on\n\nthis request – the issue remained unresolved when the court granted\n\nsummary judgment.    The bankruptcy court referred to its conclusion\n\nonly as an order.      No judgment entered after the court's order.\n\nAnd later on, the court itself explicitly held that it had not\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fissued a final judgment.          The only thing that might lead us to\n\naccept Doral and Canales's contention that the order was a final\n\njudgment is a single line in the order: \"judgment must enter in\n\nfavor   of   the    debtors.\"      But   this    line    is    not   particularly\n\nconvincing – judgment did not actually enter at all.                      Given all\n\nthis, it is abundantly clear that the court did not issue a final\n\njudgment before the Debtors filed their motion for damages.                     There\n\nwas no motion to alter or amend judgment because there was no final\n\njudgment to alter or amend.\n\n     Doral    and    Canales    next   argue    that    the   law    of   the    case\n\neffectively    precluded        the    bankruptcy       court's      exercise     of\n\njurisdiction over the motion for damages.               This is so, Doral and\n\nCanales say, because the BAP dismissed Canales's appeal of the\n\norder granting summary judgment on the ground that it lacked\n\njurisdiction due to Canales's untimely filing.                According to Doral\n\nand Canales, the BAP's dismissal constituted an implicit holding\n\nthat the order was a final judgment.              However, that is not the\n\ncase.\n\n     \"The law of the case doctrine 'posits that when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern\n\nthe same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.'\"                   Remexcel\n\nManagerial Consultants, Inc. v.

Not only was the bankruptcy court's order\n\ngranting summary judgment not a final judgment, but the BAP did not\n\nhold that it was one either.            Intermediate bankruptcy tribunals\n\nhave jurisdiction over appeals not only from \"final judgments,\n\norders, and decrees,\" but also from \"interlocutory orders and\n\ndecrees.\"        28 U.S.C. § 158.           Any appeal to an intermediate\n\nbankruptcy       tribunal   –    whether    from   a   final    judgment   or   an\n\ninterlocutory order – is subject to the time limit imposed by Rule\n\n8002(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.9                  Thus, the\n\nBAP's       generic   determination    of    untimeliness      says   nothing   and\n\nimplies nothing about whether the unsuccessful appeal was from a\n\nfinal or interlocutory order.          For this reason, the law of the case\n\nhas no place here.\n\n     Doral and Canales propose the last-ditch policy argument that\n\nit would be unfair to allow the Debtors an opportunity to appeal\n\nwhen Canales was barred from the same opportunity; this argument is\n\nperhaps their least compelling.             Let us put it this way:      If Doral\n\nand Canales were correct that the order granting summary judgment\n\nconstituted a final judgment, then Canales dug its own appeal's\n\ngrave by filing fifty-eight days after the court's ruling – not\n\njust untimely, but very untimely.            But they are not correct on the\n\nfinal judgment issue, which means that when final judgment actually\n\n\n\n        9\n       Rule 8002(a) imposed a ten-day time limit for appeals until\n2009, when the limit was increased to fourteen days.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdid enter, there was no reason they could not have cross-appealed,\n\nfighting summary judgment before the BAP and then before us.

Doral and\n\nCanales have failed to avail themselves of procedures that were\n\nreadily available to them; this failure decidedly does not imply\n\nthat they were unfairly deprived of an opportunity to appeal the\n\norder granting summary judgment.\n\n     In the end, then, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over\n\nthe Debtors' damages motion, and we certainly have jurisdiction\n\nover the Debtors' appeal of its denial.    We turn now to the merits\n\nof the case.\n\n     Standard of Review\n\n     Before a bankruptcy case reaches us, appellants have two\n\noptions for intermediate review: they may be heard by a district\n\ncourt or a bankruptcy appellate panel.

Id.\n\n      Willful Violation\n\n      An important premise of the Debtors' appeal is that the\n\nbankruptcy court found Doral and Canales to have willfully violated\n\nthe automatic stay.          Without a willful violation, the damages\n\nprovision of 11 U.S.C. § 362 by its terms would become irrelevant.\n\nDoral and Canales claim that the bankruptcy court never found a\n\nwillful violation. They focus on the absence of the word \"willful\"\n\nanywhere in the court's analyses.             They further argue that there\n\nwas no willful violation as a matter of fact, precluding partial\n\nsummary judgment in the Debtors' favor and therefore precluding\n\ndamages.     We disagree: as the bankruptcy court effectively held,\n\nthere was a willful violation as a matter of undisputed fact.10\n\n      A    violation    is   \"willful\"   if    a   \"creditor's    conduct   was\n\nintentional (as distinguished from inadvertent), and committed with\n\nknowledge of the pendency of the bankruptcy case.\" In re McMullen,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201293\"><a href=\"/opinion/201293/mcmullen-v-sevigny/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (1st Cir. 2004).

The willful-\nviolation question remains alive only to the extent that it affects\nthe Debtors' right to damages. This limitation affects not only\nour analysis but also the effect of our decision: specifically, the\nmortgage remains cancelled because no one challenged that result.\n\n                                    -13-\n\ffiled their bankruptcy case.          Nor is there any dispute that Doral\n\nhad knowledge of the case while it retained Canales, given that\n\nDoral filed a notice of appearance in the underlying bankruptcy\n\ncase    months   before   Canales     filed   the   mortgage   deed   with   the\n\nRegistry. Doral and Canales each attempt to cast themselves as the\n\nguiltless party in the filing of the deed: Doral claims that\n\nCanales     filed   the   deed   on   the   basis   of   Doral's   pre-petition\n\nurgings, and Canales claims that it did so without notice from\n\nDoral as to the pending bankruptcy action.               In other words, Doral\n\ntook no actions once it had knowledge, and Canales did take actions\n\nbut had no knowledge.       Diffusion of responsibility, however, gets\n\nthem nowhere.       See McMullen, 386 F.3d at 331 (cataloguing cases of\n\njoint willful violations); see also In re Timbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1917531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1917531/in-re-timbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 995\n\n(Bkrtcy. E.D. Tenn. 1994) (cataloguing cases of joint willful\n\nviolations by attorney and client).             It seems to us that Doral\n\nought to have informed Canales when it learned of the bankruptcy\n\npetition, and that Canales – given the notary's role of giving\n\nlegal effect to \"the will of the parties,\" 4 L.P.R.A. § 2002\n\n(emphasis added) – ought to have done more than follow Doral's word\n\nalone.11    Despite their protestations, Doral and Canales's acts are\n\n\n       11\n       Indeed, Canales's argument that it acted not in concert with\nDoral, but rather in its independent role as a notary – effectively\na public officer – is neither carefully advanced nor well-taken.\nDoral told Canales it wished to foreclose against the Debtors and\nneeded the mortgage deed to be registered properly.         By all\naccounts, Canales asked no questions, did not contact the Debtors,\nand simply did Doral's bidding.

See McMullen, 386 F.3d at 331.\n\n     Doral   and    Canales   argue   that   the   bankruptcy   court's\n\ndetermination that \"[t]he present case is more like an avoidance\n\naction . . . than a common violation of the automatic stay\"\n\nforecloses a finding of willfulness as a matter of law.         They do\n\nnot, however, explain how this avoidance analogy (which the court\n\nused only to support its decision not to award damages) might\n\naffect our willfulness analysis.         Instead, the analogy seems\n\ndesigned to fit the proverbial round peg (here, a willful violation\n\nof the stay) into a square hole (here, an avoidance action),\n\ncasting this case as something it is not.     We have already spelled\n\nout what constitutes a willful violation, applied that standard\n\nhere, and concluded that there was such a violation.      In contrast,\n\nan avoidance action allows a bankruptcy trustee to cancel an\n\nimproper conveyance or recover for the estate the value of the\n\nimproperly conveyed property.     See 11 U.S.C. §§ 544, 545, 547(b),\n\n548(a), 549(a).     Here, the adversary action may indeed have been\n\nlike an avoidance action in that cancelling an improper conveyance\n\n\nsparse law cited by Canales, the firm acted not independently but\nrather on Doral's behalf.

Such an opportunity is\n\nnecessary here given the bankruptcy code's unequivocal mandate of\n\nactual damages following a willful violation of an automatic stay.\n\nAs a reminder, the statute at issue provides: \"An individual\n\ninjured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section\n\nshall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(h) (prior to amendment).       There can be no question\n\nthat, as a general matter, the statute mandates actual damages.\n\nAnd it would be impossible for a court to set the amount of actual\n\ndamages, costs, and attorneys' fees without taking evidence. Thus,\n\nthe bankruptcy court frustrated both the statute's language and its\n\nmandated result by denying the Debtors a chance to prove damages.\n\nIn order \"to enforce [the statute] according to its terms,\" as both\n\nwe   and   the   bankruptcy   court   must   do,    remand   is   necessary.\n\nCaminetti v.

See 11 U.S.C. § 362(h) (prior to amendment,\n\nestablishing right to recovery for \"[a]n individual injured by any\n\nwillful violation,\" emphasis added).         The Debtors claim injury:\n\nthey have expended court costs and attorneys' fees in order to\n\nvindicate the automatic stay, and the statute mandates that they\n\nmay recover both as actual damages.13       Moreover, in the context of\n\na procedural argument founded on the absence of any opportunity to\n\noffer proof of damages, Doral and Canales's contention puts the\n\ntrailer before the tractor.        The Debtors would no doubt welcome an\n\nopportunity to prove injury, which is closely intertwined with\n\ndamages; as it is, they have not had the opportunity to prove\n\nanything beyond the willful violation.        The Debtors also point out\n\nthat in each of a plethora of non-binding lower-court cases Doral\n\nand   Canales   cite   on   this   point,   the   court   made   its   final\n\ndetermination on damages only after reviewing evidence specific to\n\n\n      13\n       The Debtors have made it plain enough that these are exactly\nthe damages they seek: on appeal, they have waived their right to\npursue actual damages other than costs and attorneys' fees except\nto the extent such damages might be necessary for an award of\ncosts.\n\n                                    -18-\n\finjury and damages.14    Thus, contrary to Doral and Canales's\n\ncontentions, these cases support the Debtors' argument that the\n\nstatute affords them an opportunity to present evidence.       The\n\nDebtors have a statutory right to prove damages after a willful\n\nviolation of the automatic stay, and such a violation is precisely\n\nwhat occurred here.\n\n     The parties spend more energy on the question of whether the\n\nbankruptcy court already provided adequate opportunity for the\n\nDebtors to prove damages.    As a starting point, Doral says we\n\ncannot review the question at all and must summarily affirm because\n\nthe Debtors have not produced a transcript of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's conference that was nominally on damages. This might be an\n\nissue, except for the undisputed fact that the court never held an\n\nevidentiary hearing but, instead, explicitly denied the Debtors'\n\nrequest for one.   Cf. Rodríguez v.

Instead, at the June 22, 2007 status\n\nconference, the parties laid out a skeletal version of their legal\n\narguments, and the court ordered further briefing.           Between the\n\nbankruptcy court's rejection of a damages hearing and the easily\n\nobtained transcript's showing that the status conference did not\n\nallow for the presentation of evidence, there is more than enough\n\nfor us to conclude, as we do, that the court improperly denied the\n\nDebtors an opportunity to prove damages.\n\n       Wrapping up, we note that the bankruptcy court's decision\n\nitself shows why such an opportunity is necessary.            The record\n\nreveals no clear foundation for the bankruptcy court's conclusion\n\nthat damages were unwarranted.       The court only suggested that the\n\nadversary proceeding was \"like an avoidance action,\" but did not\n\notherwise support its conclusion that cancellation of the mortgage\n\nwas a sufficient remedy for the willful violation.         And the court\n\ngave   no   explanation   for    disregarding   the   statute's   language\n\nmandating the recovery of costs and attorneys' fees.         The court's\n\nconclusion is rooted in neither record nor statute, and an analogy\n\nunsupported by any evidence is not enough to justify its decision\n\nto disregard the statute's mandatory language and deny damages.\n\n       Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's denial of a hearing on damages, vacate its rejection of\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fdamages, and remand for the parties to present evidence on damages.\n\nCosts are taxed in favor of the appellants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f</pre>",
