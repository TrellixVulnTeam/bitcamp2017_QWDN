Plaintiff,      Daniel    Carpenter\n\n(“Carpenter”), filed a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552 (2006), request with the United States Attorney’s\n\nOffice     (“USAO”)   for    the   District     of   Massachusetts      requesting\n\ndocuments that a third party provided to the USAO in connection\n\nwith       the   government’s        investigation      and      prosecution   of\n\nPlaintiff’s business activities.                This appeal is taken from a\n\ndistrict court order granting summary judgment for Defendants,\n\nthe United States Department of Justice and the USAO for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts (“the Government”), and thereby denying\n\nCarpenter’s FOIA request.             On appeal, Carpenter maintains that\n\nthe requested materials are subject to disclosure because the\n\npublic     interest   in    disclosure    outweighs      any   privacy   interest\n\nmaintained in the materials.              We affirm the district court’s\n\norder.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       By letter dated August 18, 2004, Carpenter filed a FOIA\n\nrequest     with   the   USAO   in    Boston.        Carpenter    petitioned   for\n\nmaterials that a third party, John Koresko, Esq. (“Koresko”),\n\nallegedly provided to the USAO in support of the Government’s\n\nprosecution of Carpenter’s business activities.1                    According to\n\n       1\n       Prior to the FOIA request, Carpenter was indicted and\nsubsequently tried on fourteen counts of wire fraud in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 1343 and five counts of mail fraud in violation of 18\n\n                                         -2-\n\fCarpenter, he and Koresko are direct competitors in the field of\n\nwelfare    benefit   plan    design   and    administration.       Carpenter\n\nalleges that Koresko provided information and materials to the\n\nUSAO, on which his indictment was based, and that he needs the\n\nmaterials    to   ensure    that   Koresko   did   not   provide   false   or\n\nmisleading materials.        The FOIA request, therefore, sought to\n\ncompel disclosure of “[a]ll documents, correspondence, records or\n\nfiles provided by or obtained from [Koresko]” that related to\n\nCarpenter’s businesses, welfare plans or criminal prosecution, or\n\n“reflect any conversation with [Koresko].”2\n\n\nU.S.C. § 1341. On July 27, 2005, a jury found Carpenter guilty on\nall counts.   The conviction was overturned, however, and a new\ntrial ordered. In the motion for acquittal, Carpenter argued that\nthere was insufficient evidence to convict. The district court\nfound sufficient evidence but granted a new trial on the ground of\nprosecutorial misconduct in the closing argument. United States v.\nCarpenter, 405 F. Supp. 2d 85, 103 (D. Mass. 2005).\n     2\n         Carpenter requested the following materials:\n\n            a. All documents, correspondence, records, or files\n            provided by or obtained from John Koresko, V, Esq.\n            that refer to, relate to, or reflect (a) Daniel E.\n            Carpenter; (b) Benistar Property Exchange Trust\n            Co., Inc.; (c) Benistar, Ltd.; (d) Benistar 419\n            Plan Services, Inc.; (e) Benistar 419 Plan; (f)\n            Benistar    Admin   Services,    Inc.;   (g)    the\n            investigation   leading   to   United   States   v.\n            Carpenter, Criminal No. 04-10029-GAO; or (h) the\n            case itself after the indictment issued.\n\n            b. All documents that refer to, relate to, or\n            reflect any conversation with John J. Koresko, V,\n            Esq.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f     After   several    rounds      of    correspondence           and    because   the\n\nGovernment   failed    to    respond     to    the      FOIA    request    within   the\n\ntwenty-day    statutory      time   limit,          5    U.S.C.    §     552(a)(6)(A),\n\nCarpenter    filed    this   FOIA    suit      on       January    28,    2005.     The\n\nGovernment responded to both the FOIA request and the lawsuit by\n\ndeclining    to   either     confirm     or    deny       the     existence   of    the\n\nrequested materials (a “Glomar response”3) and asserting that any\n\nsuch records would be exempt from disclosure.4                      Carpenter moved\n\n     3\n       The “Glomar response” derives its name from a ship, the\nHughes Glomar Explorer, “built (we now know) to recover a sunken\nSoviet submarine, but disguised as a private vessel for mining\nmanganese nodules from the ocean floor.” Bassiouni v. CIA, 392\nF.3d 244, 246 (1st Cir. 2004). See generally Phillippi v. CIA, 546\nF.2d 1009 (D.C. Cir. 1976).\n     4\n       The Executive Office for the United States                           Attorneys\n(“EOUSA”) responded to the FOIA request by stating:\n\n     EOUSA can neither confirm nor deny that such records\n     exist. If in fact, they did exist, all such records as\n     you have requested cannot be released absent express\n     authorization and consent of the third party, Mr.\n     Koresko, proof that he is deceased, or a clear\n     demonstration that the public interest in disclosure\n     outweighs the personal privacy interest and that\n     significant public benefit would result from the\n     disclosure of the requested records . . . . These records\n     are also categorically exempt from disclosure pursuant to\n     sections (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) of the Freedom of\n     Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.\n\n     Although the Government officially continues to refuse to\nconfirm or deny the existence of any materials or documents\nresponsive to the FOIA request, both the district court and this\nCourt have conducted an in camera review of the materials.    In\naddition, the government referred to “e-mails” in its brief.\n(Appellee’s Br. 27.) In short, the arguments presented on appeal\n\n                                         -4-\n\ffor summary judgment on June 17, 2005 and the Government cross-\n\nmoved for summary judgment on July 1, 2005.5\n\n     After conducting an in camera review, the district court\n\ndenied Carpenter’s motion for summary judgment and granted the\n\nGovernment’s cross-motion for summary judgment via an Endorsement\n\nOrder.6   The district court held that the materials at issue were\n\nexempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, which\n\nexempts from disclosure “records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement   purposes     but   only       to   the    extent     that”       such\n\ninformation   “could     reasonably    be    expected    to    constitute       an\n\nunwarranted   invasion    of   personal     privacy.”      5     U.S.C.    §   552\n\n(b)(7)(C).\n\n     Carpenter filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing\n\nthat the court had erred in relying upon Quinon v. FBI, 86 F.3d\n\n\n\nproceed on the assumption that responsive documents exist. Thus,\nthis Court’s analysis similarly proceeds based on the premise that\nthe Government has at least some documents responsive to\nPlaintiff’s FOIA request.\n     5\n      On June 17, 2005, Carpenter also filed an “emergency” motion\nfor discovery in his criminal proceeding, seeking the same\ndocuments as those in the FOIA request. United States v. Carpenter,\nCrim. No. 04-10029-GAO (Docket # 80).       On June 30, 2005, the\ndistrict court ordered that the USAO submit the disputed documents\nfor an in camera review. On February 17, 2006, the court denied\nnunc pro tunc the motion for discovery.\n     6\n       The district court, however, held the government’s Glomar\nreply insufficient where neither national security nor foreign\nintelligence was at issue.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f1222 (D.C. Cir. 1996), in reaching its decision.             On December 12,\n\n2006, the district court denied Plaintiff’s motion.              This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n      Our review of the district court’s determination that the\n\nmaterials are exempt from disclosure is de novo.                   Church of\n\nScientology Int’l v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 30 F.3d 224, 228 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).      Our discussion begins with a general review of the\n\nFOIA standards and its exemptions.\n\nII.   Discussion\n\n      The FOIA was intended to expose the operations of federal\n\nagencies “to the light of public scrutiny.” U.S. Dep’t of the Air\n\nForce v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 372 (1976); Providence Journal Co.\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of the Army, 981 F.2d 552, 556 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(noting   that   the   FOIA   seeks   to    prevent   “the   development   and\n\napplication of a body of ‘secret law’”).               The basic policy of\n\nfull agency disclosure within the FOIA furthers the right of\n\ncitizens to know “what their government is up to,” U.S. Dep’t of\n\nJustice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S.\n\n749, 773 (1989) (quoting EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 105 (1973)\n\n(Douglas, J., dissenting)), and promotes an informed citizenry,\n\nwhich is vital to democracy.          NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co.,\n\n437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978).       Thus, in response to a FOIA request, a\n\ngovernmental agency must make promptly available to any person\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthose    materials    in    the    possession      of    the     agency,      unless    the\n\nagency can establish that the materials fall within one of nine\n\nexemptions.       5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3).\n\n       To effectuate the goals of the FOIA while safeguarding the\n\nefficient administration of the government, the FOIA provides\n\nthat    certain    categories        of   materials      are     exempted      from     the\n\ngeneral requirements of disclosure.                     Id. § 552(b); Providence\n\nJournal Co., 981 F.2d at 556.              The nine FOIA exemptions are to be\n\nconstrued     narrowly,       with     any      doubts    resolved       in    favor     of\n\ndisclosure.        U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 8\n\n(1988); Providence Journal Co., 981 F.2d at 557.                        The government\n\nbears the burden of proving that withheld materials fall within\n\none of the statutory exemptions, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); Orion\n\nResearch, Inc., v. EPA, 615 F.2d 551, 553 (1st Cir. 1980), and\n\ndistrict courts are required to make de novo determinations as to\n\nthe     validity     of     the    asserted       exemptions.            5     U.S.C.     §\n\n552(a)(4)(B);       see     also     Reporters     Comm.,        489    U.S.    at     755;\n\nProvidence Journal Co., 981 F.2d at 556-57.\n\n       Exemption     7(C)    formed       the    sole    basis    for    the    district\n\ncourt’s determination that the requested materials need not be\n\ndisclosed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f     This exemption permits an agency to withhold records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes,7 “but only to\n\nthe extent that the production of such [materials] . . . could\n\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\npersonal privacy.”      § 552(b)(7)(C).      The application of Exemption\n\n7(C) requires the court to balance the privacy interest at stake\n\nin revealing the materials with the public interest in their\n\nrelease.    Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 762; Maynard v. CIA, 986\n\nF.2d 547, 566 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     A.     The Privacy Interest\n\n     The privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) is not a\n\n“cramped” or limited notion of personal privacy.               See Reporters\n\nComm., 489 U.S. at 762-63.         Instead, Exemption 7(C) protects a\n\nbroad    notion   of   personal   privacy,    including   an    individual’s\n\ninterest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.             Id. at 762.\n\nThis notion of privacy “encompass[es] the individual’s control of\n\ninformation concerning his or her person,” and “when, how, and to\n\nwhat extent information about them is communicated to others.”\n\n\n\n     7\n       The materials subject to the FOIA request were provided by\nKoresko to aid in the investigation and prosecution of Carpenter’s\nbusiness activities by the USAO.     The USAO, a law enforcement\nagency, has established a “rational nexus” between the “activities\nbeing investigated and violations of federal law” and the relevant\ndocuments. See Irons v. Bell, 596 F.2d 468, 472 (1st Cir. 1979).\nThe record clearly supports, and the parties do not contest, that\nthe documents were gathered for law enforcement purposes.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fId. at 789, 764 n.16.                The individual, and not the agency in\n\npossession of the records, controls the privacy interest.                          See\n\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 763-65; Sherman v. U.S. Dep’t of the\n\nArmy, 244 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2001) (providing that the\n\nindividual       controls      the    privacy     interest    at   stake     in   FOIA\n\nexemptions).\n\n       Furthermore,         where    the   provider    of    the   information     or\n\nrecords is a private individual, “the privacy interest . . . is\n\nat its apex.”         Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 780; Nat’l Archives &\n\nRecords Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 166 (2004).                     In Reporters\n\nCommittee, the Supreme Court pointed to the provisions of the\n\nFOIA       allowing    the    redaction     of    an   individual’s      identifying\n\ninformation and the segregation of exempt portions of the record\n\nin concluding that the “disclosure of records regarding private\n\ncitizens, identifiable by name, is not what the framers of the\n\nFOIA had in mind.”8           489 U.S. at 765-66.         The central purpose of\n\nthe    FOIA    is     to   reveal    government    action,   not   to    expose    the\n\nactions of private third parties and their participation in law\n\nenforcement to the public.             See id. at 774 (“[T]he FOIA’s central\n\npurpose is to ensure that the Government’s activities be opened\n\nto the sharp eye of public scrutiny, not that information about\n\n\n\n       8\n        Specifically,          the     Supreme    Court     pointed     to   Sections\n552(a)(2) and 552(b).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fprivate citizens that happens to be in the warehouse of the\n\nGovernment be so disclosed.”).             With this general understanding\n\nof the privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C), we turn to\n\nthe facts at hand.\n\n     Carpenter brought this FOIA action to compel disclosure of\n\ninformation    or    records    provided      by   or   concerning      Koresko      in\n\nconnection with the Government’s investigation and prosecution of\n\nCarpenter’s business activities.               We agree with the district\n\ncourt that a person need not be the subject of the investigation\n\nto have a substantial privacy interest in maintaining the secrecy\n\nof his involvement with the investigation. See Maynard, 986 F.2d\n\nat 566; Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 767 (D.C. Cir. 1990).\n\nRather, precedents suggest that individuals maintain a privacy\n\ninterest     under     the   FOIA     in   their    identity       as    government\n\ninformants and in not being positively associated with a criminal\n\nmatter.    See, e.g., Maynard, 986 F.2d at 566; Fitzgibbon, 911\n\nF.2d at 767.\n\n     Although Koresko is not, strictly speaking, a government\n\ninformant,    his    privacy    interest      is   analogous      to    that    of   an\n\ninformant.      This    Court   has    long   protected     the    identities        of\n\nwitnesses and informants in law enforcement records.                       Maynard,\n\n986 F.2d at 566 (stating that “FBI agents, support personnel,\n\nconfidential     sources,       and    investigatory       targets        all    have\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fsignificant    privacy       interests     in     not    having         their    names\n\nrevealed”); New England Apple Council v. Donovan, 725 F.2d 139,\n\n142   (1st   Cir.   1984);    see   also     Fitzgibbon,     911    F.2d        at   767\n\n(“[P]ersons involved in FBI investigations - even if they are not\n\nthe subject of the investigation - ‘have a substantial interest\n\nin seeing that their participation remains secret.’”).\n\n      While Koresko’s identity is known and Carpenter alleges that\n\nhe assisted the Government in its prosecution, it is a further\n\ninvasion of Koresko’s protected privacy interest to positively\n\nidentify him with a given criminal matter and reveal the records\n\nor information that he provided.           See Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 767\n\n(“[E]xemption 7(C) takes particular note of the ‘strong interest’\n\nof    individuals,     whether      they     be   suspects,       witnesses,           or\n\ninvestigators,      ‘in   not    being     associated      unwarrantedly             with\n\nalleged criminal activity.’”).           Koresko, as a private individual,\n\nmaintains control over information concerning his person and his\n\ninvolvement    with    the   criminal      justice      system,    and     he    alone\n\ncontrols “when, how, and to what extent [that] information” will\n\nbe revealed.    Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 764 n.16.\n\n      Carpenter,     however,    asserts     that    Koresko      has    waived       any\n\nprivacy interest via his alleged involvement in the Government’s\n\nprosecution.     Plaintiff bases this contention on a letter from a\n\nCongressman attached to Koresko’s motion to quash a subpoena in\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fan unrelated administrative proceeding.                 The letter stated: “I\n\nunderstand   that       Mr.   Koresko   has    been    of    assistance    to   your\n\noffice, the Boston office of the DOL/EBSA and Assistant U.S.\n\nAttorney Michael Pineault in the Boston office of the United\n\nStates Attorney.”9        (Appellant App. 60.)          This, at best, tenuous\n\nconnection   to   the     Carpenter     investigation        is   insufficient    to\n\nwaive Koresko’s privacy interest.10            The assertion that Koresko’s\n\nidentity as an informant in the Carpenter investigation arguably\n\ncan be determined from another source does not terminate his\n\nprivacy interest.         See L & C Marine Transp., Ltd. v. United\n\nStates, 740 F.2d 919, 922 (11th Cir. 1984).                  That information has\n\nbeen released to the public domain, especially where the release\n\nis   limited,     has     little   bearing      on     the    privacy     interest.\n\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 763-64.                 Indeed, in modern society\n\n\n\n\n     9\n        In addition, Carpenter points to statements made by\nAssistant U.S. Attorney (“AUSA”) Pineault during the final pretrial\nconference for Carpenter’s prosecution. AUSA Pineault referenced\nthat Koresko filed a number of pleadings related to civil disputes\nbetween various individuals and companies and Benistar LTD. These\nstatements, however, are not properly before the Court on appeal\nbecause Carpenter waived this argument by failing to raise it in\nhis opening brief. See Levin v. Dalva Bros., Inc., 459 F.3d 68, 76\nn.4 (1st Cir. 2006).\n     10\n       AUSA Pineault was the prosecutor in charge of Carpenter’s\ninvestigation and prosecution.   AUSAs, however, handle numerous\ncases simultaneously, and the affidavit makes no mention of the\nspecific case with which Koresko assisted AUSA Pineault.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthere   is    little    information        that   has    not      been   released   to\n\nanother.      Id. at 763.\n\n       Thus, an intention by Koresko to waive his privacy interest\n\ncannot be distilled from an affidavit of a Congressman attached\n\nto   his     motion    to   quash   a   subpoena        in   an    unrelated    case.\n\nSimilarly, the Sixth Circuit has found that FBI agents did not\n\nwaive the protections provided by Exemption 7(C) by testifying at\n\nthe FOIA requester’s habeas proceeding.                  Jones v. FBI, 41 F.3d\n\n238, 247 (6th Cir. 1994) (“The fact that an agent decided or was\n\nrequired to testify or otherwise come forward in other settings\n\ndoes not give plaintiff a right under FOIA to documents . . .\n\n.”).    Exemption 7(C) leaves the decision about whether and how to\n\nreveal personal information to the individual.                     Reporters Comm.,\n\n489 U.S. at 763.        Because there is a valid privacy interest, the\n\nrequested     documents     will    only    be    revealed     where     “the   public\n\ninterest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest\n\nmore specific than having the information for its own sake.”\n\nFavish, 541 U.S. at 172.\n\n       B.     The Public Interest\n\n       Whether an invasion of privacy is unwarranted will “turn on\n\nthe nature of the requested document and its relationship to ‘the\n\nbasic purpose of the [FOIA] to open agency action to the light of\n\npublic scrutiny.’”          Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 772 (quoting\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fDep’t of the Air Force v.

Reporters Comm.,\n\n489 U.S. at 773; Maynard, 986 F.2d at 566.                               Indeed, the “core\n\npurpose” of the FOIA, to which the public interest must relate,\n\nis    to    ensure       that    government         activities         are    open   to   public\n\nscrutiny,      not       that    information          about     private      citizens,     which\n\nhappens      to     be    in    the    government’s           possession,      be    disclosed.\n\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 774; Maynard, 986 F.2d at 566.\n\nCarpenter         asserts       that    there       is   a    valid    public    interest       in\n\n“determin[ing]            whether       a     business         rival    has     provided       the\n\nGovernment with false information about him” so that Carpenter\n\ncan        correct        any      misleading            or     incorrect        information.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. 8.)\n\n       To the extent Carpenter is seeking to obtain the documents\n\nthat Koresko provided to the government, no public interest is\n\nserved because reviewing such documents tells the public nothing\n\nabout the actions of the government.                          Furthermore, Carpenter does\n\nnot    seek       to     determine      how     the      government      responded        to   the\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\finformation, but instead whether Koresko revealed any information\n\nor documents.       In Reporters Committee, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the rap sheet of a Mafia boss was not the subject of public\n\nconcern despite the allegation that the Mafia boss had obtained\n\nDepartment of Defense contracts through a corrupt Congressman.\n\n489 U.S. at 774-75.          The Court stated that the rap sheet would\n\nreveal nothing about the Congressman’s behavior or about the\n\nconduct of the Department of Defense.             Id.; accord Maynard, 986\n\nF.2d at 566 (providing that the disclosure of the names of low-\n\nlevel FBI agents and support personnel would not reveal what the\n\ngovernment    is    up    to).      Similarly,   revealing      any   records   or\n\ninformation supplied by Koresko, a private third party, would\n\ntell the public nothing about the actions of an AUSA or the\n\nDepartment of Justice.           Further, were the Court to find a valid\n\npublic   interest        here,   virtually    every   criminal    defendant     or\n\ntarget   of    an   FBI     investigation     would   be    entitled     to   FOIA\n\ndisclosure by insinuating that the government had acted on false\n\ninformation.\n\n     Rather,    the      asserted    public   interest     in   those   documents\n\ncenters on Carpenter’s criminal trial and his own innocence.\n\nHere, it is telling that Carpenter requested materials similar to\n\nthose that are the subject of the FOIA request through discovery\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fin     his    criminal      trial.11      There     is   no    public    interest     in\n\nsupplementing an individual’s request for discovery.                             NLRB v.\n\nRobbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978) (providing\n\nthat    the     “FOIA      was    not   intended    to   function       as   a   private\n\ndiscovery tool”); New England Apple Council, 725 F.2d at 139.\n\nFurther, the innocence or guilt of a particular defendant tells\n\nthe Court “nothing about matters of substantive law enforcement\n\npolicy that are properly the subject of public concern.”                           Neely\n\nv. FBI, 208 F.3d 461, 464 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that there is\n\nno cognizable FOIA interest in a defendant’s need for information\n\nto establish his own innocence).\n\n       To the extent, however, that any of the requested material\n\nwould       reveal   how    the    government      responded    to   informants      and\n\nothers who offer information, a public interest might be served.\n\nCarpenter’s request for “[a]ll documents that refer to, relate\n\nto, or reflect any conversation with . . . Koresko” could shed\n\nlight on possible government misconduct.                  Nonetheless, Carpenter\n\n\n\n\n       11\n       See supra note 5. Further, in Carpenter’s Emergency Motion\nfor Summary Judgment, he requested oral argument “as soon as\npossible because he need[ed] the requested documents to help him\nprepare his defense in United States v. Carpenter . . . .”\n\n                                           -16-\n\fhas failed to adequately support disclosure on that basis.12                As\n\nthe Supreme Court held in Favish,\n\n      where there is a privacy interest protected by\n      Exemption 7(C) and the public interest being asserted\n      is to show that responsible officials acted negligently\n      or otherwise improperly in the performance of their\n      duties, the requester must establish more than a bare\n      suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.    Rather, the\n      requester must produce evidence that would warrant a\n      belief by a reasonable person that the alleged\n      Government impropriety might have occurred.\n\n541 U.S. at 174.        Carpenter’s bare suspicion does not amount to\n\nevidence sufficient to allow a reasonable person to believe that\n\ngovernment impropriety occurred.\n\n      Because Carpenter has failed to establish a valid public\n\ninterest   in    the    disclosure   of     the   requested   documents    and\n\nExemption 7(C) protects the privacy interest of Koresko, we hold\n\nthat Exemption 7(C) warrants that the requested documents be\n\nwithheld in their entirety.\n\n      Because the lack of a public interest is determinative, we\n\nturn only briefly to Carpenter’s additional arguments regarding\n\nthe   Vaughn    index   and   segregation    of   exempt   portions   of   the\n\nrecord.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n       At various points in the litigation, Carpenter insinuated\nthat the USAO engaged in selective prosecution. Because Carpenter\nfailed to raise this point in his opening brief, it is waived on\nappeal. See Levin, 459 F.3d at 76.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f       C. The Vaughn Index and Segregation\n\n       To provide for the broadest possible disclosure and further\n\nthe    adversary    process,     courts     often     require    the    withholding\n\nagency to provide a “Vaughn” index.13                   Church    of    Scientology\n\nInt’l, 30 F.3d at 228; Providence Journal Co., 981 F.2d at 556.\n\nGenerally, a Vaughn index provides a broad description of the\n\nrequested material or information, and the agency’s reason for\n\nwithholding each document or portion of a document.                      See Church\n\nof    Scientology    Int’l,    30   F.3d    at   228.       Nonetheless,     a     more\n\ndetailed      statement   of     the      requested     materials      may   not     be\n\nnecessary where the statement would reveal the very information\n\nsought to be protected. See Maynard, 986 F.2d at 557.\n\n       The Vaughn index provided to the plaintiff and the court in\n\nthis case consisted of a declaration by John F. Boseker (“Boseker\n\ndeclaration”), an Attorney Adviser in the Executive Office for\n\nthe United States Attorneys, United States Department of Justice.\n\nThe    Boseker     declaration      set     forth     the   Government’s      Glomar\n\nresponse, asserted that the requested documents were not required\n\nto be disclosed under Exemption 7(C) and provided that there were\n\nno reasonably segregable portions of the materials.                          Because\n\nCarpenter failed to assert a cognizable public interest, the\n\ngovernment was not obligated to provide additional detail.                         See\n\n\n       13\n            See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 824 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n\n                                          -18-\n\fid.     Even if Carpenter had asserted a valid public interest, the\n\nappropriate method for a detailed evaluation of the competing\n\ninterests would have been through an in camera review because a\n\nstandard Vaughn index might result in disclosure of the very\n\ninformation    that   the   government     attempted    to    protect.      Id.\n\n(“When, as here, the agency, for good reason, does not furnish\n\npublicly the kind of detail required for a satisfactory Vaughn\n\nindex, a district court may review documents in camera.”).\n\n      The FOIA further mandates that “any reasonably segregable\n\nportion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting\n\nsuch records after deletion of the portions which are exempt\n\nunder     [section    552(b)].”     5    U.S.C.   §    552(b).      Non-exempt\n\ninformation or materials may be withheld only where it “is so\n\ninterspersed with exempt material that separation by the agency,\n\nand policing of this by the courts would impose an inordinate\n\nburden.”     Church of Scientology Int’l, 30 F.3d at 228 (quoting\n\nWightman v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 755 F.2d 979,\n\n983 (1st Cir. 1985)).       The district court, in deciding that the\n\nmaterials were exempt from disclosure, failed to make an express\n\nfinding that no part of the requested documents were non-exempt\n\nand segregable from exempt portions.\n\n      Nonetheless,    the   Court   is   satisfied     that   the   in   camera\n\nafforded the district court the opportunity to perform a review\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fof the documents in light of the asserted exemptions and make the\n\nrequired determinations regarding segregation.                   See Church of\n\nScientology Int’l, 30 F.3d at 233.              Further, having reviewed the\n\ndocuments,    we    find   that    there   are    no    reasonably      segregable\n\nportions.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n     For    these   reasons,      the   order    of    the   district    court   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f",

This appeal is taken from a district court order granting summary judgment for Defendants, the United States Department of Justice and the USAO for the District of Massachusetts (\"the Government\"), and thereby denying Carpenter's FOIA request. On appeal, Carpenter maintains that the requested materials are subject to disclosure because the public interest in disclosure outweighs any privacy interest maintained in the materials. We affirm the district court's order.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated August 18, 2004, Carpenter filed a FOIA request with the USAO in Boston. Carpenter petitioned for materials that a third party, John Koresko, Esq. (\"Koresko\"), allegedly provided to the USAO in support of the Government's prosecution of Carpenter's business activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> According to Carpenter, he and Koresko are direct competitors in the field of welfare benefit plan design and administration. Carpenter alleges that Koresko provided information and materials to the USAO, on which his indictment was based, and that he needs the materials to ensure that Koresko did not provide false or misleading materials. The FOIA request, therefore, sought to compel disclosure of \"[a]ll documents, correspondence, records or files provided by or obtained from [Koresko]\" that related to Carpenter's businesses, welfare plans or criminal prosecution, or \"reflect any conversation with [Koresko].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several rounds of correspondence and because the Government failed to respond to the FOIA request within the twenty-day statutory time limit, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(6)(A), Carpenter filed this FOIA suit on January 28, 2005. The Government responded to both the FOIA request and the lawsuit by declining to either confirm or deny the existence of the requested materials (a \"Glomar response\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>) and asserting that any such records would be exempt from disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Carpenter moved for summary judgment on June 17, 2005 and the Government cross-moved for summary judgment on July 1, 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting an <i>in camera</i> review, the district court denied Carpenter's motion for summary judgment and granted the Government's cross-motion for summary judgment via an Endorsement Order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court held that the materials at issue were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that\" such information \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(7)(C).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court had erred in relying upon <i>Quinon v. FBI,</i> 86 F.3d 1222 (D.C.Cir.1996), in reaching its decision. On December 12, 2006, the district court denied Plaintiff's motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's determination that the materials are exempt from disclosure is de novo. <i>Church of Scientology Int'l v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 30 F.3d 224, 228 (1st Cir.1994). Our discussion begins with a general review of the FOIA standards and its exemptions.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOIA was intended to expose the operations of federal agencies \"to the light of public scrutiny.\" <i>Dep't of the Air Force v.

The basic policy of full agency disclosure within the FOIA furthers the right of citizens to know \"what their government is up to,\" <i>U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press,</i> 489 U.S. 749, 773, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989) (quoting <i>EPA v.

Thus, in response to a FOIA request, a governmental agency must make promptly available to any person those materials in the possession of the agency, unless the agency can establish that the materials fall within one of nine exemptions. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(3).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To effectuate the goals of the FOIA while safeguarding the efficient administration of the government, the FOIA provides that certain categories of materials are exempted from the general requirements of disclosure. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 552(b); <i>Providence Journal Co.,</i> 981 F.2d at 556. The nine FOIA exemptions are to be construed narrowly, with any doubts resolved in favor of disclosure. <i>U.S. Dep't of Justice v.

The application of Exemption 7(C) requires the court to balance the privacy interest at stake in revealing the materials with the public interest in their release. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 762, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Maynard v. CIA,</i> 986 F.2d 547, 566 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Privacy Interest</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) is not a \"cramped\" or limited notion of personal privacy. <i>See Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 762-63, 109 S.Ct. 1468. Instead, Exemption 7(C) protects a broad notion of personal privacy, including an individual's interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters. <i>Id.</i> at 762, 109 S.Ct. 1468. This notion of privacy \"encompass[es] the individual's control of information concerning his or her person,\" and \"when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 789, 764, 109 S.Ct. 1468 n. 16. The individual, and not the agency in possession of the records, controls the privacy interest. <i>See Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 763-65, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Sherman v. U.S. Dep't of the Army,</i> 244 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir.2001) (providing that the individual controls the privacy interest at stake in FOIA exemptions).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, where the provider of the information or records is a private individual, \"the privacy interest ... is at its apex.\" <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 780, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Nat'l Archives &amp; Records Admin. v. Favish,</i> 541 U.S. 157, 166, 124 S.Ct. 1570, 158 L.Ed.2d 319 (2004). In <i>Reporters Committee,</i> the Supreme Court pointed to the provisions of the FOIA allowing the redaction of an individual's identifying information and the segregation of exempt portions of the record in concluding that the \"disclosure of records regarding private citizens, identifiable by name, is not what the framers of the FOIA had in mind.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 489 U.S. at 765-66, 109 S.Ct. 1468. The central purpose of the FOIA is to reveal government action, not to expose the actions of private third parties and their participation in law enforcement to the public. <i>See id.</i> at 774, 109 S.Ct. 1468 (\"[T]he FOIA's central purpose is to ensure that the <i>Government's</i> activities be opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny, not that information about <i>private citizens</i> that happens to be in the warehouse of the Government be so disclosed.\"). With this general understanding of the privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C), we turn to the facts at hand.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter brought this FOIA action to compel disclosure of information or records <i>provided by or concerning</i> Koresko in connection with the Government's investigation and prosecution of Carpenter's business activities. We agree with the district court that a person need not be the subject of the investigation to have a substantial privacy interest in maintaining the secrecy of his involvement with the investigation. <i>See Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566; <i>Fitzgibbon v. CIA,</i> 911 F.2d 755, 767 (D.C.Cir.1990). Rather, precedents suggest that individuals maintain a privacy interest under the FOIA in their identity as government informants and in not being positively associated with a criminal matter. <i>See, e.g., Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566; <i>Fitzgibbon,</i> 911 F.2d at 767.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Koresko is not, strictly speaking, a government informant, his privacy interest is analogous to that of an informant. This Court has long protected the identities of witnesses and informants in law enforcement records. <i>Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566 (stating that \"FBI agents, support personnel, confidential sources, and investigatory targets all have significant privacy interests in not having their names revealed\"); <i>New England Apple Council v. Donovan,</i> 725 F.2d 139, 142 (1st Cir.1984); <i>see also Fitzgibbon,</i> 911 F.2d at 767 (\"[P]ersons involved in FBI investigations&#8212;even if they are not the subject of the investigation&#8212;`have a substantial interest in seeing that their participation remains secret.'\").</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Koresko's identity is known and Carpenter alleges that he assisted the Government in its prosecution, it is a further invasion of Koresko's protected privacy interest to positively identify him with a given criminal matter and reveal the records or information that he provided. <i>See Fitzgibbon,</i> 911 F.2d at 767 (\"[E]xemption 7(C) takes particular note of the 'strong interest' of individuals, whether they be suspects, witnesses, or investigators, 'in not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity.'\"). Koresko, as a private individual, maintains control over information concerning his person and his involvement with the criminal justice system, and he alone controls \"when, how, and to what extent [that] information\" will be revealed. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 764 n. 16, 109 S.Ct. 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter, however, asserts that Koresko has waived any privacy interest via his alleged involvement in the Government's prosecution. Plaintiff bases this contention on a letter from a Congressman attached to Koresko's motion to quash a subpoena in an unrelated administrative proceeding. The letter stated: \"I understand that Mr. Koresko has been of assistance to your office, the Boston office of the DOL/EBSA and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Pineault in the Boston office of the United States Attorney.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> (Appellant App. 60.) This, at best, tenuous connection to the Carpenter investigation is insufficient to waive Koresko's privacy interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The assertion that Koresko's identity as an informant in the Carpenter investigation arguably can be determined from another source does not terminate his privacy interest. <i>See L &amp; C Marine Transp., Ltd. v. United States,</i> 740 F.2d 919, 922 (11th Cir.1984). That information has been released to the public domain, especially where the release is limited, has little bearing on the privacy interest. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 763-64, 109 S.Ct. 1468. Indeed, in modern society there is little information that has not been released to another. <i>Id.</i> at 763, 109 S.Ct. 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, an intention by Koresko to waive his privacy interest cannot be distilled from an affidavit of a Congressman attached to his motion to quash a subpoena in an unrelated case. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has found that FBI agents did not waive the protections provided by Exemption 7(C) by testifying at the FOIA requester's habeas proceeding. <i>Jones v. FBI,</i> 41 F.3d 238, 247 (6th Cir.1994) (\"The fact that an agent decided or was required to testify or otherwise come forward in other settings does not give plaintiff a right under FOIA to documents....\"). Exemption 7(C) leaves the decision about whether and how to reveal personal information to the individual. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 763, 109 S.Ct. 1468. Because there is a valid privacy interest, the requested documents will only be revealed where \"the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake.\" <i>Favish,</i> 541 U.S. at 172, 124 S.Ct. 1570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Public Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether an invasion of privacy is unwarranted will \"turn on the nature of the requested document and its relationship to `the basic purpose of the [FOIA] to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.'\" <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 772, 109 S.Ct. 1468 (quoting <i>Dep't of the Air Force v. Rose,</i> 425 U.S. 352, 372, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976)). Neither the specific purpose for which the information is requested nor the identity of the requesting party has any bearing on the evaluation. <i>Id.</i> at 771, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Fed. Labor Relations Auth. v. U.S. Dep't of Navy,</i> 941 F.2d 49, 56 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The asserted public interest must shed light on a federal agency's performance of its statutory duties. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 773, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566. Indeed, the \"core purpose\" of the FOIA, to which the public interest must relate, is to ensure that government activities are open to public scrutiny, not that information about private citizens, which happens to be in the government's possession, be disclosed. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 774, 109 S.Ct. 1468; <i>Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566. Carpenter asserts that there is a valid public interest in \"determin[ing] whether a business rival has provided the Government with false information about him\" so that Carpenter can correct any misleading or incorrect information. (Appellant's Br. 8.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent Carpenter is seeking to obtain the documents that Koresko provided to the government, no public interest is served because reviewing such documents tells the public nothing about the actions of the government. Furthermore, Carpenter does not seek to determine how the government responded to the information, but instead whether Koresko revealed any information or documents. In <i>Reporters Committee,</i> the Supreme Court held that the rap sheet of a Mafia boss was not the subject of public concern despite the allegation that the Mafia boss had obtained Department of Defense contracts through a corrupt Congressman. 489 U.S. at 774-75, 109 S.Ct. 1468. The Court stated that the rap sheet would reveal nothing about the Congressman's behavior or about the conduct of the Department of Defense. <i>Id.; accord Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566 (providing that the disclosure of the names of low-level FBI agents and support personnel would not reveal what the government is up to). Similarly, revealing any records or information supplied by Koresko, a private third party, would tell the public nothing about the actions of an AUSA or the Department of Justice. Further, were the Court to find a valid public interest here, virtually every criminal defendant or target of an FBI investigation would be entitled to FOIA disclosure by insinuating that the government had acted on false information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the asserted public interest in those documents centers on Carpenter's criminal trial and his own innocence. Here, it is telling that Carpenter requested materials similar to those that are the subject of the FOIA request through discovery in his criminal trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> There is no public interest in supplementing an individual's request for discovery. <i>NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 437 U.S. 214, 242, 98 S.Ct. 2311, 57 L.Ed.2d 159 (1978) (providing that the \"FOIA was <i>not</i> intended to function as a private discovery tool\"); <i>New England Apple Council,</i> 725 F.2d at 139. Further, the innocence or guilt of a particular defendant tells the Court \"nothing about matters of substantive law enforcement policy that are properly the subject of public concern.\" <i>Neely v. FBI,</i> 208 F.3d 461, 464 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that there is no cognizable FOIA interest in a defendant's need for information to establish his own innocence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent, however, that any of the requested material would reveal how the government responded to informants and others who offer information, a public interest might be served. Carpenter's request for \"[a]ll documents that refer to, relate to, or reflect any conversation with . . . Koresko\" could shed light on possible government misconduct. Nonetheless, Carpenter has failed to adequately support disclosure on that basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> As the Supreme Court held in <i>Favish,</i> where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure. Rather, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">541 U.S. at 174, 124 S.Ct. 1570.

Generally, a Vaughn index provides a broad description of the requested material or information, and the agency's reason for withholding each document or portion of a document. <i>See Church of Scientology Int'l,</i> 30 F.3d at 228. Nonetheless, a more detailed statement of the requested materials may not be necessary where the statement would reveal the very information sought to be protected. <i>See Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 557.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Vaughn index provided to the plaintiff and the court in this case consisted of a declaration by John F. Boseker (\"Boseker declaration\"), an Attorney Adviser in the Executive Office for the United States Attorneys, United States Department of Justice. The Boseker declaration set forth the Government's Glomar response, asserted that the requested documents were not required to be disclosed under Exemption 7(C) and provided that there were no reasonably segregable portions of the materials. Because Carpenter failed to assert a cognizable public interest, the government was not obligated to provide additional detail. <i>See id.</i> Even if Carpenter had asserted a valid public interest, the appropriate method for a detailed evaluation of the competing interests would have been through an <i>in camera</i> review because a standard Vaughn index might result in disclosure of the very information that the government attempted to protect. <i>Id.</i> (\"When, as here, the agency, for good reason, does not furnish publicly the kind of detail required for a satisfactory Vaughn index, a district court may review documents <i>in camera.</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOIA further mandates that \"any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such records after deletion of the portions which are exempt under [section 552(b)].\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b). Non-exempt information or materials may be withheld only where it \"is so interspersed with exempt material that separation by the agency, and policing of this by the courts would impose an inordinate burden.\" <i>Church of</i> <i>Scientology Int'l,</i> 30 F.3d at 228 (quoting <i>Wightman v.

This appeal is taken from a district court order granting summary judgment for Defendants, the United States Department of Justice and the USAO for the District of Massachusetts (\"the Government\"), and thereby denying Carpenter's FOIA request. On appeal, Carpenter maintains that the requested materials are subject to disclosure because the public interest in disclosure outweighs any privacy interest maintained in the materials. We affirm the district court's order.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated August 18, 2004, Carpenter filed a FOIA request with the USAO in Boston. Carpenter petitioned for materials that a third party, John Koresko, Esq. (\"Koresko\"), allegedly provided to the USAO in support of the Government's prosecution of Carpenter's business activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> According to Carpenter, he and Koresko are direct competitors in the field of welfare benefit plan design and administration. Carpenter alleges that Koresko provided information and materials to the USAO, on which his indictment was based, and that he needs the materials to ensure that Koresko did not provide false or misleading materials. The FOIA request, therefore, sought to compel disclosure of \"[a]ll documents, correspondence, records or files provided by or obtained from [Koresko]\" that related to Carpenter's businesses, welfare plans or criminal prosecution, or \"reflect any conversation with [Koresko].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several rounds of correspondence and because the Government failed to respond to the FOIA request within the twenty-day statutory time limit, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(6)(A), Carpenter filed this FOIA suit on January 28, 2005. The Government responded to both the FOIA request and the lawsuit by declining to either confirm or deny the existence of the requested materials (a \"Glomar response\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>) and asserting that any such records would be exempt from disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Carpenter moved for summary judgment on June 17, 2005 and the Government cross-moved for summary judgment on July 1, 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting an <i>in camera</i> review, the district court denied Carpenter's motion for summary judgment and granted the Government's cross-motion for summary judgment via an Endorsement Order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court held that the materials at issue were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that\" such information \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(7)(C).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court had erred in relying upon <i>Quinon v.

In <i>Reporters Committee,</i> the Supreme Court pointed to the provisions of the FOIA allowing the redaction of an individual's identifying information and the segregation of exempt portions of the record in concluding that the \"disclosure of records regarding private citizens, identifiable by name, is not what the framers of the FOIA had in mind.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 489 U.S. at 765-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The central purpose of the FOIA is to reveal government action, not to expose the actions of private third parties and their participation in law enforcement to the public. <i>See id.</i> at 774, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

With this general understanding of the privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C), we turn to the facts at hand.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter brought this FOIA action to compel disclosure of information or records <i>provided by or concerning</i> Koresko in connection with the Government's investigation and prosecution of Carpenter's business activities. We agree with the district court that a person need not be the subject of the investigation to have a substantial privacy interest in maintaining the secrecy of his involvement with the investigation. <i>See Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566; <i>Fitzgibbon v.

Rather, precedents suggest that individuals maintain a privacy interest under the FOIA in their identity as government informants and in not being positively associated with a criminal matter. <i>See, e.g., Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566; <i>Fitzgibbon,</i> 911 F.2d at 767.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Koresko is not, strictly speaking, a government informant, his privacy interest is analogous to that of an informant. This Court has long protected the identities of witnesses and informants in law enforcement records. <i>Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 566 (stating that \"FBI agents, support personnel, confidential sources, and investigatory targets all have significant privacy interests in not having their names revealed\"); <i>New England Apple Council v.

Koresko, as a private individual, maintains control over information concerning his person and his involvement with the criminal justice system, and he alone controls \"when, how, and to what extent [that] information\" will be revealed. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 764 n. 16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Plaintiff bases this contention on a letter from a Congressman attached to Koresko's motion to quash a subpoena in an unrelated administrative proceeding. The letter stated: \"I understand that Mr. Koresko has been of assistance to your office, the Boston office of the DOL/EBSA and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Pineault in the Boston office of the United States Attorney.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> (Appellant App. 60.) This, at best, tenuous connection to the Carpenter investigation is insufficient to waive Koresko's privacy interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The assertion that Koresko's identity as an informant in the Carpenter investigation arguably can be determined from another source does not terminate his privacy interest. <i>See L &amp; C Marine Transp., Ltd. v.

That information has been released to the public domain, especially where the release is limited, has little bearing on the privacy interest. <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 763-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, Carpenter does not seek to determine how the government responded to the information, but instead whether Koresko revealed any information or documents. In <i>Reporters Committee,</i> the Supreme Court held that the rap sheet of a Mafia boss was not the subject of public concern despite the allegation that the Mafia boss had obtained Department of Defense contracts through a corrupt Congressman. 489 U.S. at 774-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112224\"><a href=\"/opinion/112224/us-dept-of-justice-v-reporters-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Similarly, revealing any records or information supplied by Koresko, a private third party, would tell the public nothing about the actions of an AUSA or the Department of Justice.

Generally, a Vaughn index provides a broad description of the requested material or information, and the agency's reason for withholding each document or portion of a document. <i>See Church of Scientology Int'l,</i> 30 F.3d at 228. Nonetheless, a more detailed statement of the requested materials may not be necessary where the statement would reveal the very information sought to be protected. <i>See Maynard,</i> 986 F.2d at 557.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Vaughn index provided to the plaintiff and the court in this case consisted of a declaration by John F.

The Boseker declaration set forth the Government's Glomar response, asserted that the requested documents were not required to be disclosed under Exemption 7(C) and provided that there were no reasonably segregable portions of the materials. Because Carpenter failed to assert a cognizable public interest, the government was not obligated to provide additional detail. <i>See id.</i> Even if Carpenter had asserted a valid public interest, the appropriate method for a detailed evaluation of the competing interests would have been through an <i>in camera</i> review because a standard Vaughn index might result in disclosure of the very information that the government attempted to protect. <i>Id.</i> (\"When, as here, the agency, for good reason, does not furnish publicly the kind of detail required for a satisfactory Vaughn index, a district court may review documents <i>in camera.</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOIA further mandates that \"any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such records after deletion of the portions which are exempt under [section 552(b)].\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b).
