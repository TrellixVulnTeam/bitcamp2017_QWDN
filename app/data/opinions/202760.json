Appellant Alirio Segarra-\n\nJimenez brought claims of slander, malicious prosecution, false\n\nimprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\nagainst a variety of defendants.   Finding no factual basis in the\n\nrecord upon which these allegations could be proven, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment as to all claims in favor of the\n\ndefendants.   Finding no error in the district court's decision, we\n\naffirm the grant of summary judgment, for substantially the reasons\n\noutlined by the court below.\n\n          Because we write primarily for the parties, we do not\n\nprovide a detailed recitation of the facts.1   This case arose out\n\nof the defendants' suspicion that Segarra-Jimenez used a stolen ATM\n\ncard to fraudulently withdraw money from defendant Doris Román-\n\nMilán's bank account at Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (\"Banco\n\nPopular\").    When Banco Popular, also a defendant, was alerted to\n\nthe fraudulent withdrawals, it assigned fraud investigator Javier\n\nOtero-Colón, also a defendant, to investigate the matter.   As part\n\nof his investigation, Otero-Colón invited Segarra-Jimenez to a\n\nmeeting at the bank, which was held in an open cubicle and lasted\n\na little over an hour.      During the meeting, the investigator\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because Segarra-Jimenez failed to comply with Local Rule\n56(c), which requires the non-moving party to file a detailed\nstatement admitting, denying, or qualifying the moving party's\nstatement of material facts, the district court deemed admitted the\ndefendants' version of the facts. We draw from that version here\nas well.\n\n                                -2-\n\faccused Segarra-Jimenez of withdrawing the money, and allegedly\n\nthreatened to press criminal charges against him if he left the\n\nmeeting.     Segarra-Jimenez summoned his attorney to the bank, and\n\nsubsequently    left   the   bank   accompanied    by   his   attorney.    As\n\nSegarra-Jimenez was leaving, the investigator allegedly yelled that\n\nhe was going to put Segarra-Jimenez in jail and that he should\n\nignore his attorney's advice.2           Based on the events at the bank\n\nmeeting, Segarra-Jimenez alleges that the investigator and the bank\n\ncommitted slander and false imprisonment.\n\n           The owner of the stolen ATM card, Román-Milán, filed a\n\ncriminal complaint against Segarra-Jimenez, believing he was the\n\nperson who had taken her card and used it to withdraw money from\n\nher account.    Both she and the investigator provided affidavits to\n\nthe police outlining the reasons they suspected Segarra-Jimenez of\n\nthe fraud.     Finding probable cause, the police arrested Segarra-\n\nJimenez and bail was set at $400.          Subsequently, at a preliminary\n\nhearing, a judge determined there was not probable cause for\n\nprosecution, and all charges against Segarra-Jimenez were dropped.\n\nBecause of the court action, Segarra-Jimenez claims that the\n\ndefendants'     acts   resulted     in     a   malicious    prosecution   and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.              He alleges that as\n\n\n     2\n      As to Otero-Colón's alleged threat during the meeting and\nalleged statements as Segarra-Jimenez was leaving the bank, the\ndefendants denied that they had actually occurred, but deemed them\nuncontested facts for purposes of their motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fa result of the defendants' actions he was forced to quit his job,\n\nmove to Florida, and seek medical care for psychological problems.\n\nAlleging $3 million in damages, Segarra-Jimenez filed suit in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\nclaiming diversity jurisdiction.              Following the district court's\n\ngrant   of   summary    judgment   to    defendants,    this   timely   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n             We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.     See Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 54\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       \"[M]otions for summary judgment must be decided\n\non the record as it stands, not on litigants' visions of what the\n\nfacts might some day reveal. As we have warned, 'brash conjecture,\n\ncoupled with earnest hope that something concrete will eventually\n\nmaterialize,     is    insufficient      to     block   summary   judgment.'\"\n\nMaldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (quoting Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters, 1 F.3d 56, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 1993)).\n\n             We agree with the district court's cogent reasons for\n\ngranting summary judgment to the defendants as to all of Segarra-\n\nJimenez's claims.      Based on the uncontested material facts in the\n\nrecord, Segarra-Jimenez plainly cannot meet the required elements\n\nof any of the claims he has brought against defendants.             As to the\n\nslander claim, as the district court concluded, the statements that\n\nOtero-Colón allegedly yelled at Segarra-Jimenez as he was leaving\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe bank are simply not defamatory; the statements did not speak to\n\nSegarra-Jimenez's character, nor were they injurious.                   See Pardo\n\nHernandez v. Citibank, N.A., 141 F. Supp. 2d 241, 244 (D.P.R.\n\n2001).     In addition, according to the record before us, Otero-\n\nColón's statement during the meeting that he suspected Segarra-\n\nJimenez of fraud was not published by communication to a third\n\nparty.     See Porto v. Bentley P.R., Inc., 132 P.R. Dec. 331, 346-47\n\n(1992).\n\n                As to the malicious prosecution claim, Segarra-Jimenez\n\noffers     no    record   evidence,      but   only   pure   speculation,    that\n\ndefendants initiated a criminal complaint with malice and without\n\nprobable cause.        See Raldiris v. Levitt, 103 P.R. Dec. 778, 782\n\n(1975).     As to the false imprisonment claim, Segarra-Jimenez does\n\nnot point to any record evidence to suggest that he was restricted\n\nin   his   movements      during   the   meeting.      The   meeting,    attended\n\nvoluntarily by Segarra-Jimenez, was held in an open cubicle, and\n\nSegarra-Jimenez was free to leave at any time, which he eventually\n\ndid.     Otero-Colón's alleged threat did not rise to the level of\n\ndeprivation of freedom of movement required to support a false\n\nimprisonment claim.         See Ayala v. San Juan Racing Corp., 112 P.R.\n\nDec. 804, 813 (1982).          Finally, Segarra-Jimenez has waived his\n\nclaim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, as he fails\n\non appeal to support this claim in any detail.               See United States\n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n            We also briefly note that Segarra-Jimenez's argument on\n\nappeal   that    summary   judgment   was   granted    prematurely,    before\n\ndiscovery was complete, is without merit.             The appellant did not\n\nfile a Rule 56(f) motion with the district court for an extension\n\nof the summary judgment deadline in order to conduct further\n\ndiscovery.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) (\"Should it appear from the\n\naffidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for\n\nreasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the\n\nparty's opposition, the court may refuse the application for\n\njudgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be\n\nobtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may\n\nmake such other order as is just.\").            Therefore, he cannot now\n\nargue that the district court granted summary judgment before he\n\nhad   the   opportunity    to   conduct     sufficient    discovery.     See\n\nRodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (\"Ordinarily, a party may not attempt to meet a summary\n\njudgment challenge head-on but fall back on Rule 56(f) if its first\n\neffort is unsuccessful.\") (internal quotation omitted); see also\n\nKiman v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corrections, 451 F.3d 274, 282 n.7\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The grant of summary judgment by the district court is\n\ntherefore affirmed.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",
