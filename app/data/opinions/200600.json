Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                and Ponsor, U.S. District Judge.*\n\n\n\n     Bruce Green for appellant.\n\n     Kevin P. McGrath, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nHeidi E. Breiger, Assistant United States Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         August 18, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States District Court for the District of\nMassachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.        In securing a plea agreement, the\n\ngovernment will frequently promise to forego advocacy of an upward\n\ndeparture at a defendant's sentencing.           The government made such a\n\npromise in this case.         To resolve this appeal, we must determine\n\nwhether the government, consistent with that promise, could then\n\ninform a panel of this court during a prior appeal that the\n\ndistrict court \"should be free\" on resentencing to upwardly depart\n\nsua sponte if the district court determined that the defendant's\n\ncriminal        history    category    under   the   applicable     sentencing\n\nguideline, see U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, under-represented the seriousness\n\nof his criminal history.              The line between \"information\" and\n\n\"advocacy\" can be a fine one.          Although the government's clumsily-\n\ncomposed brief in the prior appeal was regrettable, we conclude\n\nthat the government did not cross the line.             We therefore affirm\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            In September 1997, defendant-appellant Thomas Frazier was\n\nindicted on two counts of distributing cocaine base, see 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a)(1) (2002), and one count of conspiracy to distribute\n\ncocaine base, see id. § 846.          Pursuant to a written plea agreement\n\nexecuted in May 1999, Frazier agreed to plead guilty to one\n\nsubstantive count specifying a transaction that took place on July\n\n17, 1997.       In exchange for Frazier's guilty plea, the government\n\nagreed     to    dismiss    the   conspiracy   charge   and   the    remaining\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fsubstantive count.   As for sentencing, the plea agreement provided\n\nas follows:\n\n          The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that\n          there is no basis for a departure from the\n          sentencing range established by the United\n          States Sentencing Guidelines [except that\n          Defendant reserves the right to argue for a\n          downward departure based upon his family\n          circumstances].1 Accordingly, neither the U.S.\n          Attorney nor Defendant will seek a departure\n          on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines.\n          The U.S. Attorney expressly reserves the right\n          to seek an upward departure pursuant to\n          U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3 should any of Defendant's\n          prior state convictions be vacated subsequent\n          to the execution of this Agreement.\n\nThe agreement also reserved the U.S. Attorney's right to \"argue the\n\ncorrectness of the Defendant's sentence and the manner in which the\n\nDistrict Court determines it,\" should Frazier pursue any appeal.\n\n          A subsequent Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the\n\nU.S. Probation Office revealed that Frazier was a leader in a\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts, drug gang called the Vice Lords, and that\n\nhe had a prior August 1995 drug trafficking conviction and an\n\nAugust 1997 assault and battery conviction.       As a result, at\n\nFrazier's November 1997 sentencing hearing, and over his objection,\n\nthe district court determined that Frazier was a \"career offender,\"\n\nsee U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, and, accordingly, assigned to him a criminal\n\nhistory category (\"CHC\") of VI.    Since the court determined that\n\nFrazier was a career offender with the highest possible criminal\n\n\n     1\n       The bracketed material was inserted by hand         into   the\ntypewritten agreement and initialed by all parties.\n\n                                -3-\n\fhistory category, it did not need to determine whether Frazier's\n\nCHC under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history.\n\nAlso as a result of the career offender designation, the district\n\ncourt did not need to consider Frazier's objection to the PSR's\n\nrole-in-the-offense calculation, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, since it\n\nwould not have affected the sentence in any event.\n\n          Frazier appealed his sentence, arguing that the district\n\ncourt erred in its career offender determination, and asking us to\n\nreverse that determination and remand the case \"for resentencing by\n\nthe District Court after consideration of the Defendant's Role in\n\nthe Offense objection.\" In response, the government filed a motion\n\nfor remand, conceding that the district court had erred in its\n\ncareer offender calculation.   Frazier's August 1997 assault and\n\nbattery conviction — upon which the career offender calculation was\n\npartially based — occurred after the July 1997 offense for which\n\nFrazier was being sentenced, and therefore should not have been\n\nconsidered.   The government's brief in support of its motion for\n\nremand contained the following text at the end:\n\n          Given that the erroneous determination of the\n          defendant as a career offender impacted the\n          defendant's GSR [guideline sentencing range],\n          the case should be remanded for resentencing.\n          As the defendant points out in his brief, at\n          resentencing, the district court would need to\n          resolve the defendant's objection to the PSR's\n          role adjustment. On resentencing, moreover,\n          the district court should be free to consider\n          the applicability of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, which\n          provides   for   upward  departures   when   a\n          sentencing    court   determines   that    the\n\n                               -4-\n\f          defendant's      CHC     under-represents    the\n          seriousness     of   the   defendant's  criminal\n          history.\n\nThe boldface and italicization in the above-quoted excerpt is as it\n\nappeared in the original.      Frazier did not object at that time to\n\nthe form or substance of the government's remand motion.               Upon\n\nconsideration of the parties' submissions, a prior panel of this\n\ncourt agreed that the district court had erred and issued an order\n\non November 9, 2001, which stated:\n\n          We therefore allow the government's motion,\n          vacate the judgment [of the district court]\n          and remand the case for resentencing.     Upon\n          remand, the district court should resolve the\n          defendant's   objection   to   the   two-level\n          adjustment for his role in the offense.     We\n          take no view whether the circumstances of this\n          case might warrant an upward departure under\n          [U.S.S.G.] § 4A1.3.\n\nFrazier did not seek modification of this order.\n\n          On   May   3,   2002,   the   district    court    convened    a\n\nresentencing   hearing    in    accordance   with   our     mandate.    In\n\nrecalculating Frazier's CHC, the court concluded that Frazier had\n\neight criminal history points, placing him in CHC IV.          The court\n\nadded:\n\n          It is also appropriate for me to note, for the\n          record, that the Mandate from the First\n          Circuit   Court  of   Appeals   did  call   my\n          attention, although it took no stand, on the\n          possibility that this case might warrant an\n          upward adjustment under Guideline 4A1.3.\n\nThe court then stated, prior to soliciting any comments from\n\ncounsel, that it was \"inclined\" to depart upward and assign a CHC\n\n                                  -5-\n\fof V because, in the court's view, there was reliable information\n\nin the PSR indicating that a CHC of IV inadequately reflected the\n\nseriousness of Frazier's criminal history.\n\n           The court then solicited comments from counsel.            The\n\nAssistant United States Attorney's (\"AUSA\") immediate response was,\n\n\"Your honor, I did not make that motion,\" but added that \"I\n\ncertainly would be happy to provide the Court with additional\n\nbriefing in support of such a finding.\"        Counsel for Frazier then\n\naddressed the court, stating that it would be a breach of the plea\n\nagreement for the government to advocate for an upward departure:\n\n           I would be concerned if my sister actively\n           provides information or a briefing in support\n           of the Court's inclination mainly because the\n           plea   agreement  that   we  have   with  the\n           government says that it will not seek — and I\n           assume that that means will not support — an\n           upward departure in this case.    So I would\n           suggest that if that were to occur, that that\n           would constitute a breach of the plea\n           agreement.\n\nDefense counsel also stated that he had not anticipated having to\n\nargue against an upward departure, and therefore requested a\n\ncontinuance to brief the issue.        The court granted the request and\n\nset a briefing schedule.    The AUSA then indicated that she would go\n\nback and check the plea agreement:       \"I will review it and certainly\n\nwill take no action to breach an agreement we've already reached.\"\n\n           Three weeks after the hearing, Frazier filed in the\n\ndistrict   court   a   \"Motion   for    Specific   Performance   of   Plea\n\nAgreement's Terms and Memorandum in Opposition to Upward Departure\n\n                                  -6-\n\fPursuant to Section 4A1.3.\"          In this filing, Frazier contended for\n\nthe first time that the government had breached its plea agreement\n\nwhile   the    original      sentence     was   under    appeal:     \"While   the\n\ngovernment has not explicitly violated the plea agreement, it did\n\nperform an end run around it by arguing superfluously in its motion\n\nfor remand that the district court could consider a 4A1.3 upward\n\ndeparture upon resentencing.\" In its response to Frazier's motion,\n\nthe government stated that it would not advocate for a departure at\n\nresentencing.        It also stated that its motion for remand \"set out\n\nan accurate legal principle indicating for the Court of Appeals the\n\nlimits of its mandate,\" and that this did not constitute a breach\n\nof the plea agreement.\n\n              At the continued resentencing hearing on May 28, 2002,\n\nthe district court rejected Frazier's claim that the government had\n\nbreached      the    plea    agreement:     \"Simply      the   mention   in   [the\n\ngovernment's] papers filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nthat 4A1.3 was applicable doesn't indicate to me that there has\n\nbeen any breach or any request by the government that I upwardly\n\n[depart].\"          The   court   therefore     denied   Frazier's   motion    for\n\nspecific performance.\n\n              The district court then acted on its inclination to\n\nupwardly depart.          For reasons detailed below, see Part IV.B, the\n\ndistrict court determined that Frazier's criminal history category\n\nwas under-represented by his otherwise applicable CHC of IV.                  The\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcourt concluded that a CHC of V was appropriate, placing Frazier in\n\na sentencing range of 120 to 150 months, rather than category IV's\n\nrange of 100 to 125 months.      The government made no recommendation\n\nas to sentence within that range, and the district court sentenced\n\nFrazier to a 138-month term of incarceration.           This appeal ensued,\n\nwith   Frazier     requesting   that      this   case    \"be   remanded    for\n\nresentencing either by a different judge or for a sentence within\n\nthe guideline range.\"\n\n                                    II.\n\n              Frazier presses two arguments on appeal.              First, he\n\nclaims that the district court erred in rejecting his argument that\n\nthe government breached the terms of the plea agreement. According\n\nto Frazier, the bold and italicized language contained in the\n\ngovernment's motion for remand, if not an outright breach, was an\n\nimpermissible \"end run\" around the substance of the plea agreement.\n\nIn evaluating whether the government has breached a plea agreement,\n\nwe   employ    differing   standards   of    review     depending   upon   the\n\ncircumstances.     In this case, the facts giving rise to the alleged\n\nbreach are not in dispute.      \"Thus, we must determine only the legal\n\nquestion of whether the government's undisputed conduct breached\n\nthe plea agreement, which we review de novo.\"              United States v.\n\nClark, 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1995); see United States v. Doe, 233\n\nF.3d 642, 644 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[W]hether [the government's]\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fconduct constituted a breach of the plea agreement is a question of\n\nlaw subject to plenary review.\").\n\n           Next, assuming there was no breach, Frazier argues that\n\nthe district    court   erred    in   its    decision   to   upwardly   depart\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.         As explained in Part III.B, infra,\n\nthe applicable standard of review has been changed in part through\n\na recent legislative enactment.              In the past, we would have\n\ndeferred   to   the   district   court's     determination    regarding    the\n\nadequacy of a defendant's CHC unless we could find no support for\n\nthat conclusion in the record.        United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71\n\nF.3d 946, 952 (1st Cir. 1995); see United States v. Campbell, 61\n\nF.3d 976, 985 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"We review the court's factual\n\nfindings for clear error, and we give considerable deference to its\n\n'judgment call' as to whether those facts warrant the departure.\").\n\nHowever, with the passage of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools\n\nAgainst the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT\n\nAct\"), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), we must now\n\nundertake de novo review of that determination.\n\n                                      III.\n\nA.   The Alleged Breach of the Plea Agreement\n\n           Over thirty years ago, the Supreme Court attested to the\n\nimportant role that plea agreements play in our criminal justice\n\nsystem:\n\n           Disposition of charges after plea discussions\n           is not only an essential part of the process\n\n                                      -9-\n\f             but a highly desirable part for many reasons.\n             It   leads  to   prompt   and  largely   final\n             disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids\n             much of the corrosive impact of enforced\n             idleness during pretrial confinement for those\n             who are denied release pending trial; it\n             protects the public from those accused persons\n             who are prone to continue criminal conduct\n             even while on pretrial release; and, by\n             shortening the time between charge and\n             disposition, it enhances whatever may be the\n             rehabilitative prospects of the guilty when\n             they are ultimately imprisoned.\n\nSantobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261 (1971).           While these (and\n\nother) important considerations provide incentives for all sides to\n\nengage in plea discussions, a defendant must ultimately waive\n\nfundamental constitutional rights as a result of entering into any\n\nplea agreement.        Hence, \"we hold prosecutors engaging in plea\n\nbargaining to 'the most meticulous standards of both promise and\n\nperformance,'\" United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (quoting United States v. Velez Carrero, 77 F.3d 11, 11 (1st\n\nCir.   1996)),   and   we   are    wary   of   government   claims   that   the\n\nprosecution \"technically\" complied with the terms of the agreement\n\nwhen the net effect of the government's behavior undermines the\n\n\"benefit of the bargain\" upon which a defendant has relied.                 Our\n\ncase   law    prohibits     \"not   only     explicit   repudiation    of    the\n\ngovernment's assurances, but must in the interests of fairness be\n\nread to forbid end-runs around them.\" United States v. Saxena, 229\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263,\n\n269 (1st Cir. 1992).2\n\n            In determining whether the government has breached a plea\n\nagreement, \"[w]e are guided . . . by general principles of contract\n\nlaw.\" Clark, 55 F.3d at 12; see United States v. Gonzales-Sanchez,\n\n825 F.2d 572, 578 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Contractual principles apply\n\ninsofar as they are relevant in determining what the government\n\n'owes' the defendant.\").          As explained above, however, \"[a] plea\n\nagreement is not an appropriate context for the Government to\n\nresort to     a    rigidly    literal   approach   in   the    construction    of\n\nlanguage.\"        United States v. Garcia, 698 F.2d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n1983) (quoting United States v. Bowler, 585 F.2d 851, 854 (7th Cir.\n\n1978)).      \"Likewise, as in all contracts, plea agreements are\n\naccompanied       by   an   implied   obligation   of   good   faith   and   fair\n\ndealing.\"     United States v. Ahn, 231 F.3d 26, 35–36 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).               Moreover, pursuant to\n\ncontract law, even an unintended breach is, nevertheless, still a\n\nbreach.   See United States v. Mercedes-Amparo, 980 F.2d 17, 19 n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (stating that the fact that \"breach was inadvertent\n\n\n\n     2\n        We have previously indicated, however, that \"minor\ndeviations from the plea agreement will not mandate resentencing.\"\nClark, 55 F.3d at 14 n.3. Only a deviation that \"affect[s] the\nconsideration due the defendant under the plea agreement\" can be\nconsidered a breach that entitles a defendant to a remedy. Id.;\nsee Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, 879 F.2d 975, 986 (1st Cir.\n1989) (\"The government may not breach any term of a plea agreement\nwhich induced the defendant to plea guilty.\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                        -11-\n\f. . . does not lessen its impact\") (quoting Santobello, 404 U.S. at\n\n262).\n\n          Frazier claims that the government breached the terms of\n\nhis plea agreement when, during the course of his prior appeal, the\n\ngovernment inserted the following boldfaced and italicized language\n\nat the end of its remand motion:\n\n          On resentencing, moreover, the district court\n          should be free to consider the applicability\n          of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, which provides for upward\n          departures when a sentencing court determines\n          that the defendant's CHC under-represents the\n          seriousness   of  the   defendant's   criminal\n          history.\n\n\n(original emphasis).   As Frazier notes, the government chose to\n\nplace only the foregoing in boldface and italics:          \"No other\n\npassage in the document received this treatment, just this one.\"\n\nFrazier argues that this excerpt, presented in that format, was an\n\n\"end-run\" around the following provision of his plea agreement:\n\n          The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that\n          there is no basis for a departure from the\n          sentencing range established by the United\n          States   Sentencing   Guidelines.   .   .   .\n          Accordingly, neither the U.S. Attorney nor\n          Defendant will seek a departure on any ground\n          from the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nAccording to Frazier, the language in the government's brief was\n\n\"not just a mere statement of a truism, it is advocacy for a\n\ndeparture which the government explicitly agreed not to do.\"     The\n\ngovernment responds by calling its choice of words and formatting\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f\"regrettable\" in retrospect, but insists that there was no breach\n\nof the plea agreement.\n\n               Frazier relies on two cases in support of his claim —\n\nUnited States v. Clark, and United States v. Canada.                       In Clark, the\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty in return for the government's promise\n\nthat it would not oppose a three-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.            See Clark, 55 F.3d at 12.                Nonetheless, the\n\ngovernment effectively opposed such a reduction when, in its\n\nsentencing memorandum to the district court, it explicitly argued\n\nthat the defendant did not appear to qualify for it.                            Id.   In\n\nUnited States v. Canada, the government, as part of the plea\n\nagreement, agreed to recommend a 36-month sentence and to notify\n\nthe    court    of    the    full    nature   and    extent    of    the    defendant's\n\ncooperation.          Canada, 960 F.3d at 268.            The government simply\n\nfailed to do either.                See id. at 269–70.         In Frazier's case,\n\nhowever, the government did not fail to argue something that it\n\nexplicitly promised to, nor did the government explicitly argue\n\nanything prohibited by the plea agreement.\n\n               The language at issue in the plea agreement was in a\n\nsection entitled \"Sentence Recommendation,\" and, by its own terms,\n\nonly    refers       to     sentencing.       Neither     at     Frazier's      initial\n\nsentencing, nor at his resentencing subsequent to his previous\n\nappeal,    did       the    government    ever      recommend,      move,    argue,   or\n\notherwise support an upward departure.                   Indeed, the government\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\frepeatedly stated in the district court that it was bound not to\n\nseek an upward departure. While the government did indicate at one\n\npoint during Frazier's initial hearing after remand that it \"would\n\nbe happy\" to provide briefing in support of an upward departure,\n\nthe government ultimately retreated from that position once it\n\nactually took the time to re-examine the original plea agreement.\n\nHence we conclude that the government did not technically violate\n\nthe terms of the plea agreement.\n\n            However, as noted, the government cannot rely on mere\n\ntechnical   compliance,        and   adherence    to   the    terms   of   a   plea\n\nagreement \"requires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.\"\n\nSaxena, 229 F.3d at 6. Instead, the prosecution's \"overall conduct\n\nmust be reasonably consistent\" with the promises contained in a\n\nplea agreement.      Canada, 960 F.2d at 269.             At first blush, the\n\ngovernment's behavior in this case seems dubious.                 Why would the\n\ngovernment aver in the plea agreement that \"there is no basis for\n\na departure from the sentencing range established by the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines,\" but then include the language at\n\nissue in its appellate brief, unless the government concluded that\n\nthere was a basis for — indeed, that it sought — an upward\n\ndeparture from the district court?                 Moreover, the government\n\ncomplicated   matters     by    putting    that    very   language,    and     that\n\nlanguage    alone,   in   boldfaced       and    italicized    typeface.        The\n\ngovernment concedes the clumsiness of its conduct:\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f          The government acknowledges that, had it been\n          mindful of the provision barring it from\n          seeking an upward departure, it would have\n          taken pains to ensure that the this [sic]\n          Court's remand order did not affirmatively\n          call the district court's attention to its\n          option of upwardly departing. The government\n          contends, however, that it was not barred by\n          the plea agreement from seeking an accurate\n          remand order in this case.    Thus, while the\n          government regrets that [sic] did not handle\n          this situation with more care, it respectfully\n          submits that its action did not rise to either\n          an intentional or unintentional breach of the\n          plea agreement warranting yet another remand.\n\n          In evaluating the government's explanation, we must be\n\ncognizant of the unusual procedural history of this case.    After\n\nlaying out a challenge to his career offender designation in his\n\ninitial appellate brief, Frazier asked us to remand the case \"for\n\nresentencing by the District Court after consideration of the\n\nDefendant's Role in the Offense objection.\"   Seeing this language,\n\nthe government was concerned that merely conceding the erroneous\n\ncareer offender designation without saying more might have led us\n\nto vacate the sentence and remand with unduly limiting directions,\n\ni.e., we might have issued a judgment saying that \"the case is\n\nremanded for resentencing and consideration of the defendant's\n\nobjection to the two-level adjustment for his role in the offense,\"\n\nand no more.   Such a remand could have misled the district court\n\ninto believing that it could not sua sponte consider an upward\n\ndeparture at resentencing.    If this had happened, Frazier, in\n\neffect, would have gotten more than he had bargained for in his\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fplea agreement.3     Hence, according to the government, it was simply\n\nseeking \"an accurate remand order\" by including the contested\n\nlanguage in its brief.\n\n              We conclude that the government's concern about the\n\nphrasing of Frazier's remand request was warranted, and that its\n\ngoal of seeking \"an accurate remand order\" was therefore within its\n\nrights under the plea agreement, as well as its obligation under\n\nthe law.      The government is under a constant obligation to ensure\n\nthe integrity of the proceedings at all levels, notwithstanding the\n\nterms of any plea agreement.            See Saxena, 229 F.3d at 6 (\"The\n\ngovernment's obligation to furnish relevant information . . . does\n\nnot vanish merely because the government has a corollary obligation\n\nto   honor    commitments   under   a   plea   agreement.\").    Seeing     the\n\npotential for an unduly and unwittingly restrictive remand order\n\nfrom the court of appeals because of the unusual posture of this\n\ncase, the government acted reasonably in alerting us to this\n\npossibility.     Although an alert with different phrasing and format\n\nmight have produced a remand order from us that preserved the\n\nflexibility of the district court without a specific reference to\n\nan   upward    departure,   we   cannot   equate   the   clumsiness   of   the\n\ngovernment's alert with a breach of the plea agreement.               We were\n\n\n      3\n        Frazier acknowledged in the plea agreement that the\nsentencing court was not bound by the agreement's terms, and that\nthe sentencing judge was free to disregard the recommendations of\nthe parties as well as to upwardly depart from the Sentencing\nGuidelines.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fnot the sentencing court.             The government never advocated for an\n\nupward departure before the district court.                   It furnished \"the\n\nconsideration due the defendant under the plea agreement.\"                  Clark,\n\n55 F.3d at 14 n.3.          The government did nothing more than urge us to\n\nfashion    a       remand   order     that   did   not   impose   an   unwarranted\n\nrestriction on the sentencing court.               Therefore, we conclude that\n\nthe contested language contained in the government's appellate\n\nbrief did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.\n\nB.   The Upward Departure\n\n               Frazier      asserts   that   the   sentencing     court   erred   in\n\nupwardly departing under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, which provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n               If reliable information indicates that the\n               criminal history category does not adequately\n               reflect the seriousness of the defendant's\n               past criminal conduct or the likelihood that\n               the defendant will commit other crimes, the\n               court may consider imposing a sentence\n               departing   from  the   otherwise  applicable\n               guideline range.\n\nId. Frazier argues that his criminal history does not support such\n\na departure.        He does not challenge, however, the factual findings\n\nupon which the district court premised the departure:\n\n               C    that when Frazier was arrested in 1995 on drug\n                    charges, he was found in possession of three firearms\n                    and fifteen rounds of ammunition for which he was not\n                    charged;\n\n               C    that he had committed two \"very serious\" separate\n                    assaults and batteries on a female friend for which\n                    he received only one sentence;\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f               C       while in custody for one of his assaults, he\n                       threatened to kill the victim if the charges were not\n                       dropped;\n\n               C       when he was served with a restraining order, he told\n                       the police officer that he was going to \"fuck[] up\"\n                       the complainant and that the serving officer had\n                       \"better be careful\" when he was out on the street.\n\n               In assessing the significance of these findings, we must\n\nfirst    take          into   account     Congress's     recent   enactment   of   the\n\nProsecutorial           Remedies    and    Tools    Against   the   Exploitation    of\n\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\"), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117\n\nStat. 650 (2003).             Section 401 of the PROTECT Act amends 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3742 which governs our review of sentencing appeals.                     In United\n\nStates v. Thurston, No. 02-1966 (1st Cir. Aug. 4, 2003), we held\n\nthat the PROTECT Act applies to appeals pending as of its effective\n\ndate, April 30, 2003.              See id. slip op. at 45–47.        While Thurston\n\nconcerned an appeal by the government of an unacceptably low\n\nsentence, we see nothing in the language of the PROTECT Act which\n\nlimits its applicability to downward departures. Section 401(d)(1)\n\nof the PROTECT Act refers to \"review of departures,\" without\n\ndistinguishing between the upward or downward varieties.                      We also\n\nnote    that       §    401(d)(3)    of    the     Act   specifically   contemplates\n\nsituations in which \"the sentence is too high\" and \"the sentence is\n\ntoo low.\"      See id. (amending 18 U.S.C. § 3742(f)(2)).               We therefore\n\nconclude that § 401(d) of the PROTECT Act applies to our review of\n\nupward as well as downward departures in cases pending on direct\n\nreview as of April 30, 2003.\n\n                                            -18-\n\f           In light of the new law, we must now review de novo the\n\nquestion whether the underlying facts of this case warranted the\n\ndistrict court's consideration of an upward departure.4    See id. at\n\n48.   In enacting the PROTECT Act,\n\n           Congress requires the courts of appeals to\n           consider whether a sentence that departs from\n           the applicable guideline range is based on a\n           factor that:\n\n                  (i)   does   not  advance   the\n                        objectives set forth in\n                        section 3553(a)(2); or\n                  (ii) is not authorized under\n                        section 3553(b); or\n                  (iii) is not justified by the\n                        facts of the case[.]\n\nThurston, slip op. at 44 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e)(3)(B)). Upon\n\ndue consideration of these three criteria, we conclude that the\n\nupward departure was permissible and warranted under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4A1.3, largely for the reasons articulated by the district court\n\nat sentencing and memorialized in the court's Statement of Reasons\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Under the PROTECT Act we continue to give due deference to\nthe district court's determination on the degree of departure\nwarranted by the facts. See id. § 401(d)(2) (amending 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3742(e)).\n\n                               -19-\n\fappended to its Amended Judgment.5     We also conclude that the\n\ndegree of departure was amply justified by the facts.\n\n          We write further to highlight only one other point.\n\nFrazier cites only two cases in support of his claim that the\n\ndeparture was unwarranted — United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), and United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).   In both of these cases we affirmed upward departures\n\nfor defendants whose factual histories, Frazier insists, were more\n\negregious than his.   That may or may not be the case.   However, it\n\nwas only a two-month quirk of timing that kept Frazier's prior\n\ncriminal conduct from garnering him a career offender designation\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       At the sentencing hearing, the district court noted Frazier\nwas never charged in connection with weapons he possessed at the\ntime of his arrest in 1995 on drug charges:\n\n     That indicates to me a particular seriousness of this\n     man's conduct and the likelihood of recidivism. This is\n     a very serious matter where we have not only involved a\n     possession of a controlled substance with intent to\n     distribute[,] but firearms, lots of ammunition, and\n     fingerprints of the defendant on the firearm[s].\n\nIn its written findings, the court stated that the otherwise\napplicable CHC significantly under-represented the seriousness of\nFrazier's conduct and the likelihood that he would commit further\ncrimes, because, \"among other things,\"\n\n     1) he committed two separate assaults and batteries in\n     July 1997 for which he was sentenced together . . . 2) in\n     connection with his 1995 drug conviction, he was involved\n     with firearms . . . and 3) after his arrest in July,\n     1997[,] for two assaults, he threatened to kill the\n     victim, tried to persuade her to drop the charges and\n     even threatened the arresting officer.\n\n                               -20-\n\fand a CHC of VI.   Therefore, the district court's sentence was more\n\nthan warranted.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

The government made such a promise in this case. To resolve this appeal, we must determine whether the government, consistent with that promise, could then inform a panel of this court during a prior appeal that the district court \"should be free\" on resentencing to upwardly depart <i>sua sponte</i> if the district court determined that the defendant's criminal history category under the applicable sentencing guideline, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. The line between \"information\" and \"advocacy\" can be a fine one. Although the government's clumsily-composed brief in the prior appeal was regrettable, we conclude that the government did not cross the line. We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, defendant-appellant Thomas Frazier was indicted on two counts of distributing cocaine base, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (2002), and one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 846. Pursuant to a written plea agreement executed in May 1999, Frazier agreed to plead guilty to one substantive count specifying a transaction that took place on July 17, 1997. In exchange for Frazier's guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge and the remaining substantive count. As for sentencing, the plea agreement provided as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines [except that Defendant reserves the right to argue for a downward departure based upon his family circumstances].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Accordingly, neither the U.S. Attorney nor Defendant will seek a departure on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines. The U.S. Attorney expressly reserves the right to seek an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 should any of Defendant's prior state convictions be vacated subsequent to the execution of this Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also reserved the U.S. Attorney's right to \"argue the correctness of the Defendant's sentence and the manner in which the District Court determines it,\" should Frazier pursue any appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the U.S. Probation Office revealed that Frazier was a leader in a Worcester, Massachusetts, drug gang called the Vice Lords, and that he had a prior August 1995 drug trafficking conviction and an August 1997 assault and battery conviction. As a result, at Frazier's November 1997 sentencing hearing, and over his objection, the district court determined that Frazier was a \"career offender,\" <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, and, accordingly, assigned to him a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of VI. Since the court determined that Frazier was a career offender with the highest possible criminal history category, it did not need to determine whether Frazier's CHC under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Also as a result of the career offender designation, the district court did not need to consider Frazier's objection to the PSR's role-in-the-offense calculation, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, since it would not have affected the sentence in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in its career offender determination, and asking us to reverse that determination and remand the case \"for resentencing by the District Court after consideration of the Defendant's Role in the Offense objection.\" In response, the government filed a motion for remand, conceding that the district court had erred in its career offender calculation. Frazier's August 1997 assault and battery conviction &#8212; upon which the career offender calculation was partially based &#8212; occurred <i>after</i> the July 1997 offense for which Frazier was being sentenced, and therefore should not have been considered. The government's brief in support of its motion for remand contained the following text at the end:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the erroneous determination of the defendant as a career offender impacted the defendant's GSR [guideline sentencing range], the case should be remanded for resentencing. As the defendant points out in his brief, at resentencing, the district court would need to resolve the defendant's objection to the PSR's role adjustment. <i>On resentencing, moreover, the district court should be free to consider the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, which provides for upward departures when a sentencing court determines that the defendant's CHC under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boldface and italicization in the above-quoted excerpt is as it appeared in the original. Frazier did not object at that time to the form or substance of the government's remand motion. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, a prior panel of this court agreed that the district court had erred and issued an order on November 9, 2001, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore <i>allow</i> the government's motion, <i>vacate</i> the judgment [of the district court] and <i>remand</i> the case for resentencing. Upon remand, the district court should resolve the defendant's objection to the two-level adjustment for his role in the offense. We take no view whether the circumstances of this case might warrant an upward departure under [U.S.S.G.] &#167; 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier did not seek modification of this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2002, the district court convened a resentencing hearing in accordance with our mandate. In recalculating Frazier's CHC, the court concluded that Frazier had eight criminal history points, placing him in CHC IV. The court added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also appropriate for me to note, for the record, that the Mandate from the First Circuit Court of Appeals did call my attention, although it took no stand, on the possibility that this case might warrant an upward adjustment under Guideline 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then stated, prior to soliciting any comments from counsel, that it was \"inclined\" to depart upward and assign a CHC of V because, in the court's view, there was reliable information in the PSR indicating that a CHC of IV inadequately reflected the seriousness of Frazier's criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then solicited comments from counsel. The Assistant United States Attorney's (\"AUSA\") immediate response was, \"Your honor, I did not make that motion,\" but added that \"I certainly would be happy to provide the Court with additional briefing in support of such a finding.\" Counsel for Frazier then addressed the court, stating that it would be a breach of the plea agreement for the government to advocate for an upward departure: I would be concerned if my sister actively provides information or a briefing in support of the Court's inclination mainly because the plea agreement that we have with the government says that it will not seek &#8212; and I assume that that means will not support &#8212; an upward departure in this case. So I would suggest that if that were to occur, that that would constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also stated that he had not anticipated having to argue against an upward departure, and therefore requested a continuance to brief the issue. The court granted the request and set a briefing schedule. The AUSA then indicated that she would go back and check the plea agreement: \"I will review it and certainly will take no action to breach an agreement we've already reached.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks after the hearing, Frazier filed in the district court a \"Motion for Specific Performance of Plea Agreement's Terms and Memorandum in Opposition to Upward Departure Pursuant to Section 4A1.3.\" In this filing, Frazier contended for the first time that the government had breached its plea agreement while the original sentence was under appeal: \"While the government has not explicitly violated the plea agreement, it did perform an end run around it by arguing superfluously in its motion for remand that the district court could consider a 4A1.3 upward departure upon resentencing.\" In its response to Frazier's motion, the government stated that it would not advocate for a departure at resentencing. It also stated that its motion for remand \"set out an accurate legal principle indicating for the Court of Appeals the limits of its mandate,\" and that this did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the continued resentencing hearing on May 28, 2002, the district court rejected Frazier's claim that the government had breached the plea agreement: \"Simply the mention in [the government's] papers filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals that 4A1.3 was applicable doesn't indicate to me that there has been any breach or any request by the government that I upwardly [depart].\" The court therefore denied Frazier's motion for specific performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then acted on its inclination to upwardly depart. For reasons detailed below, <i>see</i> Part IV.B, the district court determined that Frazier's criminal history category was under-represented by his otherwise applicable CHC of IV. The court concluded that a CHC of V was appropriate, placing Frazier in a sentencing range of 120 to 150 months, rather than category IV's range of 100 to 125 months. The government made no recommendation as to sentence within that range, and the district court sentenced Frazier to a 138-month term of incarceration. This appeal ensued, with Frazier requesting that this case \"be remanded for resentencing either by a different judge or for a sentence within the guideline range.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier presses two arguments on appeal. First, he claims that the district court erred in rejecting his argument that the government breached the terms of the plea agreement. According to Frazier, the bold and italicized language contained in the government's motion for remand, if not an outright breach, was an impermissible \"end run\" around the substance of the plea agreement. In evaluating whether the government has breached a plea agreement, we employ differing standards of review depending upon the circumstances. In this case, the facts giving rise to the alleged breach are not in dispute. \"Thus, we must determine only the legal question of whether the government's undisputed conduct breached the plea agreement, which we review de novo.\" <i>United States v. Clark,</i> 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see United States v. Doe,</i> 233 F.3d 642, 644 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[W]hether [the government's] conduct constituted a breach of the plea agreement is a question of law subject to plenary review.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, assuming there was no breach, Frazier argues that the district court erred in its decision to upwardly depart pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. As explained in Part III.B, <i>infra,</i> the applicable standard of review has been changed in part through a recent legislative enactment. In the past, we would have deferred to the district court's determination regarding the adequacy of a defendant's CHC unless we could find no support for that conclusion in the record. <i>United States v. Diaz-Martinez,</i> 71 F.3d 946, 952 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see United States v. Campbell,</i> 61 F.3d 976, 985 (1st Cir.1995) (\"We review the court's factual findings for clear error, and we give considerable deference to its `judgment call' as to whether those facts warrant the departure.\"). However, with the passage of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\"), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), we must now undertake de novo review of that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Alleged Breach of the Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over thirty years ago, the Supreme Court attested to the important role that plea agreements play in our criminal justice system:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disposition of charges after plea discussions is not only an essential part of the process but a highly desirable part for many reasons. It leads to prompt and largely final disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids much of the corrosive impact of enforced idleness during pretrial confinement for those who are denied release pending trial; it protects the public from those accused persons who are prone to continue criminal conduct even while on pretrial release; and, by shortening the time between charge and disposition, it enhances whatever may be the rehabilitative prospects of the guilty when they are ultimately imprisoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Santobello v. New York,</i> 404 U.S. 257, 261, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). While these (and other) important considerations provide incentives for all sides to engage in plea discussions, a defendant must ultimately waive fundamental constitutional rights as a result of entering into any plea agreement. Hence, \"we hold prosecutors engaging in plea bargaining to `the most meticulous standards of both promise and performance,'\" <i>United States v. Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>United States v. Velez Carrero,</i> 77 F.3d 11, 11 (1st Cir.1996)), and we are wary of government claims that the prosecution \"technically\" complied with the terms of the agreement when the net effect of the government's behavior undermines the \"benefit of the bargain\" upon which a defendant has relied. Our case law prohibits \"not only explicit repudiation of the government's assurances, but must in the interests of fairness be read to forbid endruns around them.\" <i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Canada,</i> 960 F.2d 263, 269 (1st Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether the government has breached a plea agreement, \"[w]e are guided ... by general principles of contract law.\" <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 12; <i>see United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez,</i> 825 F.2d 572, 578 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Contractual principles apply insofar as they are relevant in determining what the government `owes' the defendant.\"). As explained above, however, \"[a] plea agreement is not an appropriate context for the Government to resort to a rigidly literal approach in the construction of language.\" <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 698 F.2d 31, 37 (1st Cir.1983) (quoting <i>United States v. Bowler,</i> 585 F.2d 851, 854 (7th Cir.1978)). \"Likewise, as in all contracts, plea agreements are accompanied by an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\" <i>United States v. Ahn,</i> 231 F.3d 26, 35-36 (D.C.Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, pursuant to contract law, even an unintended breach is, nevertheless, still a breach. <i>See United States v. Mercedes-Amparo,</i> 980 F.2d 17, 19 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992) (stating that the fact that \"breach was inadvertent ... does not lessen its impact\") (quoting <i>Santobello,</i> 404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. 495).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier claims that the government breached the terms of his plea agreement when, during the course of his prior appeal, the government inserted the following boldfaced and italicized language at the end of its remand motion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>On resentencing, moreover, the district court should be free to consider the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, which provides for upward departures when a sentencing court determines that the defendant's CHC under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(original emphasis). As Frazier notes, the government chose to place only the foregoing in boldface and italics: \"No other passage in the document received this treatment, just this one.\" Frazier argues that this excerpt, presented in that format, was an \"end-run\" around the following provision of his plea agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines.... Accordingly, neither the U.S. Attorney nor Defendant will seek a departure on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Frazier, the language in the government's brief was \"not just a mere statement of a truism, it is advocacy for a departure which the government explicitly agreed not to do.\" The government responds by calling its choice of words and formatting \"regrettable\" in retrospect, but insists that there was no breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier relies on two cases in support of his claim &#8212; <i>United States v. Clark,</i> and <i>United States v. Canada.</i> In <i>Clark,</i> the defendant pleaded guilty in return for the government's promise that it would not oppose a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 12. Nonetheless, the government effectively opposed such a reduction when, in its sentencing memorandum to the district court, it explicitly argued that the defendant did not appear to qualify for it. <i>Id.</i> In <i>United States v. Canada,</i> the government, as part of the plea agreement, agreed to recommend a 36-month sentence and to notify the court of the full nature and extent of the defendant's cooperation. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 268. The government simply failed to do either. <i>See id.</i> at 269-70. In Frazier's case, however, the government did not fail to argue something that it explicitly promised to, nor did the government explicitly argue anything prohibited by the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language at issue in the plea agreement was in a section entitled \"Sentence Recommendation,\" and, by its own terms, only refers to <i>sentencing.</i> Neither at Frazier's initial sentencing, nor at his resentencing subsequent to his previous appeal, did the government ever recommend, move, argue, or otherwise support an upward departure. Indeed, the government repeatedly stated in the district court that it was bound <i>not</i> to seek an upward departure. While the government did indicate at one point during Frazier's initial hearing after remand that it \"would be happy\" to provide briefing in support of an upward departure, the government ultimately retreated from that position once it actually took the time to re-examine the original plea agreement. Hence we conclude that the government did not technically violate the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as noted, the government cannot rely on mere technical compliance, and adherence to the terms of a plea agreement \"requires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.\" <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6. Instead, the prosecution's \"overall conduct must be reasonably consistent\" with the promises contained in a plea agreement. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 269. At first blush, the government's behavior in this case seems dubious. Why would the government aver in the plea agreement that \"there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\" but then include the language at issue in its appellate brief, unless the government concluded that there was a basis for &#8212; indeed, that it <i>sought</i> &#8212; an upward departure from the district court? Moreover, the government complicated matters by putting that very language, and that language alone, in boldfaced and italicized typeface. The government concedes the clumsiness of its conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that, had it been mindful of the provision barring it from seeking an upward departure, it would have taken pains to ensure that the this [sic] Court's remand order did not affirmatively call the district court's attention to its option of upwardly departing. The government contends, however, that it was not barred by the plea agreement from seeking an accurate remand order in this case. Thus, while the government regrets that [sic] did not handle this situation with more care, it respectfully submits that its action did not rise to either an intentional or unintentional breach of the plea agreement warranting yet another remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the government's explanation, we must be cognizant of the unusual procedural history of this case. After laying out a challenge to his career offender designation in his initial appellate brief, Frazier asked us to remand the case \"for resentencing by the District Court after consideration of the Defendant's Role in the Offense objection.\" Seeing this language, the government was concerned that merely conceding the erroneous career offender designation without saying more might have led us to vacate the sentence and remand with unduly limiting directions, i.e., we might have issued a judgment saying that \"the case is remanded for resentencing and consideration of the defendant's objection to the two-level adjustment for his role in the offense,\" and no more. Such a remand could have misled the district court into believing that it could not <i>sua sponte</i> consider an upward departure at resentencing. If this had happened, Frazier, in effect, would have gotten <i>more</i> than he had bargained for in his plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Hence, according to the government, it was simply seeking \"an accurate remand order\" by including the contested language in its brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the government's concern about the phrasing of Frazier's remand request was warranted, and that its goal of seeking \"an accurate remand order\" was therefore within its rights under the plea agreement, as well as its obligation under the law. The government is under a constant obligation to ensure the integrity of the proceedings at all levels, notwithstanding the terms of any plea agreement. <i>See Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6 (\"The government's obligation to furnish relevant information ... does not vanish merely because the government has a corollary obligation to honor commitments under a plea agreement.\"). Seeing the potential for an unduly and unwittingly restrictive remand order from the court of appeals because of the unusual posture of this case, the government acted reasonably in alerting us to this possibility. Although an alert with different phrasing and format might have produced a remand order from us that preserved the flexibility of the district court without a specific reference to an upward departure, we cannot equate the clumsiness of the government's alert with a breach of the plea agreement. We were not the sentencing court. The government never advocated for an upward departure before the district court. It furnished \"the consideration due the defendant under the plea agreement.\" <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 14 n. 3. The government did nothing more than urge us to fashion a remand order that did not impose an unwarranted restriction on the sentencing court. Therefore, we conclude that the contested language contained in the government's appellate brief did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier asserts that the sentencing court erred in upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Frazier argues that his criminal history does not support such a departure. He does not challenge, however, the factual findings upon which the district court premised the departure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; that when Frazier was arrested in 1995 on drug charges, he was found in possession of three firearms and fifteen rounds of ammunition for which he was not charged;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; that he had committed two \"very serious\" separate assaults and batteries on a female friend for which he received only one sentence;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; while in custody for one of his assaults, he threatened to kill the victim if the charges were not dropped;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; when he was served with a restraining order, he told the police officer that he was going to \"fuck[ ] up\" the complainant and that the serving officer had \"better be careful\" when he was out on the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing the significance of these findings, we must first take into account Congress's recent enactment of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\"), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003). Section 401 of the PROTECT Act amends 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742 which governs our review of sentencing appeals. In <i>United States v. Thurston,</i> 338 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2003), we held that the PROTECT Act applies to appeals pending as of its effective date, April 30, 2003. <i>See id.</i> 338 F.3d at 71-72. While <i>Thurston</i> concerned an appeal by the government of an unacceptably low sentence, we see nothing in the language of the PROTECT Act which limits its applicability to downward departures. Section 401(d)(1) of the PROTECT Act refers to \"review of departures,\" without distinguishing between the upward or downward varieties. We also note that &#167; 401(d)(3) of the Act specifically contemplates situations in which \"the sentence is too high\" and \"the sentence is too low.\" <i>See id.</i> (amending 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(f)(2)). We therefore conclude that &#167; 401(d) of the PROTECT Act applies to our review of upward as well as downward departures in cases pending on direct review as of April 30, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the new law, we must now review de novo the question whether the underlying facts of this case warranted the district court's consideration of an upward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See id.</i> 338 F.3d at 72-73. In enacting the PROTECT Act,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress requires the courts of appeals to consider whether a sentence that departs from the applicable guideline range is based on a factor that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) is not justified by the facts of the case[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Thurston,</i> 338 F.3d at 44 (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)). Upon due consideration of these three criteria, we conclude that the upward departure was permissible and warranted under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, largely for the reasons articulated by the district court at sentencing and memorialized in the court's Statement of Reasons appended to its Amended Judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We also conclude that the degree of departure was amply justified by the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We write further to highlight only one other point. Frazier cites only two cases in support of his claim that the departure was unwarranted &#8212; <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d 22 (1st Cir.1997), and <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d 330 (1st Cir.1990). In both of these cases we affirmed upward departures for defendants whose factual histories, Frazier insists, were more egregious than his. That may or may not be the case. However, it was only a two-month quirk of timing that kept Frazier's prior criminal conduct from garnering him a career offender designation and a CHC of VI.

The government made such a promise in this case. To resolve this appeal, we must determine whether the government, consistent with that promise, could then inform a panel of this court during a prior appeal that the district court \"should be free\" on resentencing to upwardly depart <i>sua sponte</i> if the district court determined that the defendant's criminal history category under the applicable sentencing guideline, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. The line between \"information\" and \"advocacy\" can be a fine one. Although the government's clumsily-composed brief in the prior appeal was regrettable, we conclude that the government did not cross the line. We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, defendant-appellant Thomas Frazier was indicted on two counts of distributing cocaine base, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (2002), and one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 846. Pursuant to a written plea agreement executed in May 1999, Frazier agreed to plead guilty to one substantive count specifying a transaction that took place on July 17, 1997. In exchange for Frazier's guilty plea, the government agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge and the remaining substantive count. As for sentencing, the plea agreement provided as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines [except that Defendant reserves the right to argue for a downward departure based upon his family circumstances].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Accordingly, neither the U.S. Attorney nor Defendant will seek a departure on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines. The U.S. Attorney expressly reserves the right to seek an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 should any of Defendant's prior state convictions be vacated subsequent to the execution of this Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement also reserved the U.S. Attorney's right to \"argue the correctness of the Defendant's sentence and the manner in which the District Court determines it,\" should Frazier pursue any appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") prepared by the U.S. Probation Office revealed that Frazier was a leader in a Worcester, Massachusetts, drug gang called the Vice Lords, and that he had a prior August 1995 drug trafficking conviction and an August 1997 assault and battery conviction. As a result, at Frazier's November 1997 sentencing hearing, and over his objection, the district court determined that Frazier was a \"career offender,\" <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, and, accordingly, assigned to him a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of VI. Since the court determined that Frazier was a career offender with the highest possible criminal history category, it did not need to determine whether Frazier's CHC under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Also as a result of the career offender designation, the district court did not need to consider Frazier's objection to the PSR's role-in-the-offense calculation, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, since it would not have affected the sentence in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in its career offender determination, and asking us to reverse that determination and remand the case \"for resentencing by the District Court after consideration of the Defendant's Role in the Offense objection.\" In response, the government filed a motion for remand, conceding that the district court had erred in its career offender calculation. Frazier's August 1997 assault and battery conviction &#8212; upon which the career offender calculation was partially based &#8212; occurred <i>after</i> the July 1997 offense for which Frazier was being sentenced, and therefore should not have been considered. The government's brief in support of its motion for remand contained the following text at the end:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the erroneous determination of the defendant as a career offender impacted the defendant's GSR [guideline sentencing range], the case should be remanded for resentencing. As the defendant points out in his brief, at resentencing, the district court would need to resolve the defendant's objection to the PSR's role adjustment. <i>On resentencing, moreover, the district court should be free to consider the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, which provides for upward departures when a sentencing court determines that the defendant's CHC under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The boldface and italicization in the above-quoted excerpt is as it appeared in the original. Frazier did not object at that time to the form or substance of the government's remand motion. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions, a prior panel of this court agreed that the district court had erred and issued an order on November 9, 2001, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore <i>allow</i> the government's motion, <i>vacate</i> the judgment [of the district court] and <i>remand</i> the case for resentencing. Upon remand, the district court should resolve the defendant's objection to the two-level adjustment for his role in the offense. We take no view whether the circumstances of this case might warrant an upward departure under [U.S.S.G.] &#167; 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier did not seek modification of this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2002, the district court convened a resentencing hearing in accordance with our mandate. In recalculating Frazier's CHC, the court concluded that Frazier had eight criminal history points, placing him in CHC IV. The court added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also appropriate for me to note, for the record, that the Mandate from the First Circuit Court of Appeals did call my attention, although it took no stand, on the possibility that this case might warrant an upward adjustment under Guideline 4A1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then stated, prior to soliciting any comments from counsel, that it was \"inclined\" to depart upward and assign a CHC of V because, in the court's view, there was reliable information in the PSR indicating that a CHC of IV inadequately reflected the seriousness of Frazier's criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then solicited comments from counsel. The Assistant United States Attorney's (\"AUSA\") immediate response was, \"Your honor, I did not make that motion,\" but added that \"I certainly would be happy to provide the Court with additional briefing in support of such a finding.\" Counsel for Frazier then addressed the court, stating that it would be a breach of the plea agreement for the government to advocate for an upward departure: I would be concerned if my sister actively provides information or a briefing in support of the Court's inclination mainly because the plea agreement that we have with the government says that it will not seek &#8212; and I assume that that means will not support &#8212; an upward departure in this case. So I would suggest that if that were to occur, that that would constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also stated that he had not anticipated having to argue against an upward departure, and therefore requested a continuance to brief the issue. The court granted the request and set a briefing schedule. The AUSA then indicated that she would go back and check the plea agreement: \"I will review it and certainly will take no action to breach an agreement we've already reached.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks after the hearing, Frazier filed in the district court a \"Motion for Specific Performance of Plea Agreement's Terms and Memorandum in Opposition to Upward Departure Pursuant to Section 4A1.3.\" In this filing, Frazier contended for the first time that the government had breached its plea agreement while the original sentence was under appeal: \"While the government has not explicitly violated the plea agreement, it did perform an end run around it by arguing superfluously in its motion for remand that the district court could consider a 4A1.3 upward departure upon resentencing.\" In its response to Frazier's motion, the government stated that it would not advocate for a departure at resentencing. It also stated that its motion for remand \"set out an accurate legal principle indicating for the Court of Appeals the limits of its mandate,\" and that this did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the continued resentencing hearing on May 28, 2002, the district court rejected Frazier's claim that the government had breached the plea agreement: \"Simply the mention in [the government's] papers filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals that 4A1.3 was applicable doesn't indicate to me that there has been any breach or any request by the government that I upwardly [depart].\" The court therefore denied Frazier's motion for specific performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then acted on its inclination to upwardly depart. For reasons detailed below, <i>see</i> Part IV.B, the district court determined that Frazier's criminal history category was under-represented by his otherwise applicable CHC of IV. The court concluded that a CHC of V was appropriate, placing Frazier in a sentencing range of 120 to 150 months, rather than category IV's range of 100 to 125 months. The government made no recommendation as to sentence within that range, and the district court sentenced Frazier to a 138-month term of incarceration. This appeal ensued, with Frazier requesting that this case \"be remanded for resentencing either by a different judge or for a sentence within the guideline range.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier presses two arguments on appeal. First, he claims that the district court erred in rejecting his argument that the government breached the terms of the plea agreement. According to Frazier, the bold and italicized language contained in the government's motion for remand, if not an outright breach, was an impermissible \"end run\" around the substance of the plea agreement. In evaluating whether the government has breached a plea agreement, we employ differing standards of review depending upon the circumstances. In this case, the facts giving rise to the alleged breach are not in dispute. \"Thus, we must determine only the legal question of whether the government's undisputed conduct breached the plea agreement, which we review de novo.\" <i>United States v.

As explained in Part III.B, <i>infra,</i> the applicable standard of review has been changed in part through a recent legislative enactment. In the past, we would have deferred to the district court's determination regarding the adequacy of a defendant's CHC unless we could find no support for that conclusion in the record. <i>United States v.

As Frazier notes, the government chose to place only the foregoing in boldface and italics: \"No other passage in the document received this treatment, just this one.\" Frazier argues that this excerpt, presented in that format, was an \"end-run\" around the following provision of his plea agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The U.S. Attorney and Defendant agree that there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines.... Accordingly, neither the U.S. Attorney nor Defendant will seek a departure on any ground from the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Frazier, the language in the government's brief was \"not just a mere statement of a truism, it is advocacy for a departure which the government explicitly agreed not to do.\" The government responds by calling its choice of words and formatting \"regrettable\" in retrospect, but insists that there was no breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier relies on two cases in support of his claim &#8212; <i>United States v. Clark,</i> and <i>United States v. Canada.</i> In <i>Clark,</i> the defendant pleaded guilty in return for the government's promise that it would not oppose a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 12. Nonetheless, the government effectively opposed such a reduction when, in its sentencing memorandum to the district court, it explicitly argued that the defendant did not appear to qualify for it. <i>Id.</i> In <i>United States v. Canada,</i> the government, as part of the plea agreement, agreed to recommend a 36-month sentence and to notify the court of the full nature and extent of the defendant's cooperation. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 268. The government simply failed to do either. <i>See id.</i> at 269-70. In Frazier's case, however, the government did not fail to argue something that it explicitly promised to, nor did the government explicitly argue anything prohibited by the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language at issue in the plea agreement was in a section entitled \"Sentence Recommendation,\" and, by its own terms, only refers to <i>sentencing.</i> Neither at Frazier's initial sentencing, nor at his resentencing subsequent to his previous appeal, did the government ever recommend, move, argue, or otherwise support an upward departure. Indeed, the government repeatedly stated in the district court that it was bound <i>not</i> to seek an upward departure. While the government did indicate at one point during Frazier's initial hearing after remand that it \"would be happy\" to provide briefing in support of an upward departure, the government ultimately retreated from that position once it actually took the time to re-examine the original plea agreement. Hence we conclude that the government did not technically violate the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as noted, the government cannot rely on mere technical compliance, and adherence to the terms of a plea agreement \"requires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.\" <i>Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6. Instead, the prosecution's \"overall conduct must be reasonably consistent\" with the promises contained in a plea agreement. <i>Canada,</i> 960 F.2d at 269. At first blush, the government's behavior in this case seems dubious. Why would the government aver in the plea agreement that \"there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\" but then include the language at issue in its appellate brief, unless the government concluded that there was a basis for &#8212; indeed, that it <i>sought</i> &#8212; an upward departure from the district court? Moreover, the government complicated matters by putting that very language, and that language alone, in boldfaced and italicized typeface. The government concedes the clumsiness of its conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that, had it been mindful of the provision barring it from seeking an upward departure, it would have taken pains to ensure that the this [sic] Court's remand order did not affirmatively call the district court's attention to its option of upwardly departing. The government contends, however, that it was not barred by the plea agreement from seeking an accurate remand order in this case. Thus, while the government regrets that [sic] did not handle this situation with more care, it respectfully submits that its action did not rise to either an intentional or unintentional breach of the plea agreement warranting yet another remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the government's explanation, we must be cognizant of the unusual procedural history of this case. After laying out a challenge to his career offender designation in his initial appellate brief, Frazier asked us to remand the case \"for resentencing by the District Court after consideration of the Defendant's Role in the Offense objection.\" Seeing this language, the government was concerned that merely conceding the erroneous career offender designation without saying more might have led us to vacate the sentence and remand with unduly limiting directions, i.e., we might have issued a judgment saying that \"the case is remanded for resentencing and consideration of the defendant's objection to the two-level adjustment for his role in the offense,\" and no more. Such a remand could have misled the district court into believing that it could not <i>sua sponte</i> consider an upward departure at resentencing. If this had happened, Frazier, in effect, would have gotten <i>more</i> than he had bargained for in his plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Hence, according to the government, it was simply seeking \"an accurate remand order\" by including the contested language in its brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the government's concern about the phrasing of Frazier's remand request was warranted, and that its goal of seeking \"an accurate remand order\" was therefore within its rights under the plea agreement, as well as its obligation under the law. The government is under a constant obligation to ensure the integrity of the proceedings at all levels, notwithstanding the terms of any plea agreement. <i>See Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d at 6 (\"The government's obligation to furnish relevant information ... does not vanish merely because the government has a corollary obligation to honor commitments under a plea agreement.\"). Seeing the potential for an unduly and unwittingly restrictive remand order from the court of appeals because of the unusual posture of this case, the government acted reasonably in alerting us to this possibility. Although an alert with different phrasing and format might have produced a remand order from us that preserved the flexibility of the district court without a specific reference to an upward departure, we cannot equate the clumsiness of the government's alert with a breach of the plea agreement. We were not the sentencing court. The government never advocated for an upward departure before the district court. It furnished \"the consideration due the defendant under the plea agreement.\" <i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 14 n. 3. The government did nothing more than urge us to fashion a remand order that did not impose an unwarranted restriction on the sentencing court. Therefore, we conclude that the contested language contained in the government's appellate brief did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frazier asserts that the sentencing court erred in upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, which provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Frazier argues that his criminal history does not support such a departure. He does not challenge, however, the factual findings upon which the district court premised the departure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; that when Frazier was arrested in 1995 on drug charges, he was found in possession of three firearms and fifteen rounds of ammunition for which he was not charged;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; that he had committed two \"very serious\" separate assaults and batteries on a female friend for which he received only one sentence;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; while in custody for one of his assaults, he threatened to kill the victim if the charges were not dropped;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; when he was served with a restraining order, he told the police officer that he was going to \"fuck[ ] up\" the complainant and that the serving officer had \"better be careful\" when he was out on the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing the significance of these findings, we must first take into account Congress's recent enactment of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\"), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003). Section 401 of the PROTECT Act amends 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742 which governs our review of sentencing appeals. In <i>United States v. Thurston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span> (1st Cir.2003), we held that the PROTECT Act applies to appeals pending as of its effective date, April 30, 2003. <i>See id.</i> 338 F.3d at 71-72. While <i>Thurston</i> concerned an appeal by the government of an unacceptably low sentence, we see nothing in the language of the PROTECT Act which limits its applicability to downward departures. Section 401(d)(1) of the PROTECT Act refers to \"review of departures,\" without distinguishing between the upward or downward varieties. We also note that &#167; 401(d)(3) of the Act specifically contemplates situations in which \"the sentence is too high\" and \"the sentence is too low.\" <i>See id.</i> (amending 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(f)(2)). We therefore conclude that &#167; 401(d) of the PROTECT Act applies to our review of upward as well as downward departures in cases pending on direct review as of April 30, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the new law, we must now review de novo the question whether the underlying facts of this case warranted the district court's consideration of an upward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See id.</i> 338 F.3d at 72-73. In enacting the PROTECT Act,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress requires the courts of appeals to consider whether a sentence that departs from the applicable guideline range is based on a factor that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b); or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) is not justified by the facts of the case[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Thurston,</i> 338 F.3d at 44 (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e)(3)(B)). Upon due consideration of these three criteria, we conclude that the upward departure was permissible and warranted under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, largely for the reasons articulated by the district court at sentencing and memorialized in the court's Statement of Reasons appended to its Amended Judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We also conclude that the degree of departure was amply justified by the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We write further to highlight only one other point. Frazier cites only two cases in support of his claim that the departure was unwarranted &#8212; <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997), and <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990). In both of these cases we affirmed upward departures for defendants whose factual histories, Frazier insists, were more egregious than his. That may or may not be the case. However, it was only a two-month quirk of timing that kept Frazier's prior criminal conduct from garnering him a career offender designation and a CHC of VI. Therefore, the district court's sentence was more than warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The bracketed material was inserted by hand into the typewritten agreement and initialed by all parties</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We have previously indicated, however, that \"minor deviations from the plea agreement will not mandate resentencing.\"<i>Clark,</i> 55 F.3d at 14 n. 3.
