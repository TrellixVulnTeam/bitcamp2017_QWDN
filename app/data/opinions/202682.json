Fitzgerald, Assistant Federal Defender, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart and Stephanie S. Browne, Assistant U.S.\nAttorneys, and Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 28, 2007\n\f                 Per Curiam.       This is an appeal from resentencing\n\n  after remand from this court on defendant's prior appeal.                  See\n\n  United States v. Medina, 427 F.3d 88 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Medina\n\n  I\")       (affirming    defendant's      conviction   but   remanding      for\n\n  resentencing in light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n  (2005)).       On remand, defendant was sentenced to 15 years'\n\n  imprisonment,        the     mandatory    minimum   for   the   offenses   of\n\n  conviction.\n\n                 In this appeal from that sentence, defendant focuses\n\n  solely on the mandatory minimum contained in 18 U.S.C. § 841,\n\n  which he continues to argue applies only to offenses involving\n\n  crack cocaine, despite this court's ruling to the contrary in\n\n  his first appeal.1           See Medina I, 427 F.3d at 92 (holding that\n\n  21 U.S.C. § 841 regulates exactly what it's terms suggest: the\n\n  possession      of     any   form   of   'cocaine   base'\").      Under    the\n\n  doctrines of law of the case and stare decisis, we decline to\n\n  reconsider this court's prior rulings on that issue.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      Although in Medina I, this court was interpreting the phrase\n\"cocaine base\" in 21 U.S.C. § 841 to determine whether the district\ncourt accurately defined the substantive offense, while here the\nsame phrase is being interpreted to determine whether the mandatory\nminimum provision of that same statute applies, the difference is\nimmaterial. Indeed, the very case that established the meaning of\nthat phrase in this circuit did so in the sentencing context.\nUnited States v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir. 1992)\n(per curiam) (as amended on rehearing).\n\n                                           -2-\n\f           Under the relevant branch of the law of the case\n\ndoctrine, \"a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or\n\ncriminal proceeding . . . remain[s] the law of that case\n\nthroughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is\n\nmodified   or   overruled    by   a   higher   court.    That   branch\n\nbinds . . . a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in\n\nthe same case . . . .\"       United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); see also Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636,\n\n646-47 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining the \"salutary policies\"\n\nbehind this doctrine).\n\n           Although that branch of the doctrine is prudential\n\nand has certain exceptions, the only one even potentially\n\napplicable here--that adhering to the law of the case would\n\nyield \"a manifestly unjust result,\" Ellis, 313 F.3d at 648--is\n\nunavailing. \"[A] litigant seeking to fit within [the] confines\n\n[of this exception] must negotiate a steep uphill climb. . . .\n\n[A] finding of manifest injustice requires, at a bare minimum,\n\n'a   definite   and   firm   conviction   that   a   prior   ruling   is\n\nunreasonable or obviously wrong.'\"             Moran, 393 F.3d at 8\n\n(quoting Ellis, 313 F.3d at 648).\n\n           That demanding standard is not met here.           Far from\n\nbeing \"obviously wrong,\" the panel's ruling in the first appeal\n\nwas itself dictated by the decisions of other panels on this\n\nissue in previous cases, Medina I, 427 F.3d at 92 (citing\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fLopez-Gil, 965 F.3d at 1134, and United States v. Richardson,\n\n225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000)), which that panel was not free\n\nto revisit, absent supervening authority, which did not and\n\nstill does not exist, see United States v. Anderson, 452 F.3d\n\n66, 86 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 696 (2006).\n\nApparently acknowledging that point, defendant suggests in his\n\nbrief that this appeal be heard en banc.   However, he filed no\n\npetition to that effect.     See Fed. R. App. P. 35(b).   That\n\nprocedural consideration aside, under the law of the case\n\ndoctrine discussed above, this case would be an unlikely\n\nvehicle for en banc consideration, which could have been but\n\nwas not sought before or after the panel's decision in the\n\nfirst appeal.   United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Because we therefore decline to revisit our prior\n\nrulings that the phrase \"cocaine base\" in 21 U.S.C. § 841\n\napplies not only to crack cocaine but to any form of cocaine\n\nbase, we do not reach defendant's subsidiary arguments that he\n\nwas entitled to but did not receive a jury finding beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, or even a judicial finding by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence, that the substance involved here was crack\n\ncocaine.\n\n           Affirmed.
