Appellant   Godfrey      Brooks\n\n(“Brooks\")   was   convicted    in   January   2004   as   a   member    of   a\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in Maine. He was\n\nfound guilty of several counts, including: conspiracy to distribute\n\nand possess with intent to distribute cocaine base under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A) and 846 (\"Count II\"); distribution and\n\naiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base under 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Counts VII\n\nand VIII\"); and possession with intent to distribute at least five\n\ngrams of cocaine base and aiding and abetting under 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Count IX\").            The jury\n\nfound that the quantity of cocaine base involved in Counts II and\n\nIX equaled five or more grams, but that the amount involved in\n\nCount II did not exceed fifty grams.\n\n          Brooks was sentenced to 276 months on Counts II and IX,\n\nand 240 months on Counts VII and VIII, to be served concurrently.\n\nThe sentence was based on a finding by the court that Brooks was\n\nresponsible for 73.4 grams of cocaine base, that he was the leader\n\nof the conspiracy listed under Count II, and that he had obstructed\n\njustice by persisting with a false identification.             As calculated\n\nin the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") and by the court, the sentencing\n\nguideline range for his offense level of 38, and a criminal history\n\ncategory of II, was 262-327 months.\n\n          Brooks appeals on six grounds: (1) the sentence is in\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fexcess of what was authorized by the jury and is based on evidence\n\nnot presented at trial, necessitating a remand under United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) or United States v. Antonokapolous,\n\n399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005); (2) disproportionate weight was\n\nattributed to drug quantity during the sentencing process and\n\nconstituted a violation of Brooks' Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights; (3) the findings upon which sentencing enhancements were\n\nbased were clearly erroneous, unsupported by the evidence, as well\n\nas in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nBlakely    v.   Washington,     542    U.S.    296    (2004),       and    Crawford   v.\n\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004); (4) the court deprived Brooks of\n\nhis right to confront witnesses; (5) the trial court failed to give\n\na   multiple    conspiracy      instruction;         and    (6)     the   prosecutor's\n\nimproper    vouching     for   the    cooperating          witnesses      affected    the\n\noutcome of the trial.\n\n            For   the     reasons     stated     below,        we    affirm    Brooks'\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n            Brooks was indicted in May 2003 as a member of one of two\n\noverlapping conspiracies to distribute cocaine base.                          Roderick\n\nAllen     (\"Allen\")     was    the    common    co-conspirator            between     one\n\nconspiracy run by Easton Wilson (\"Wilson\"), and another in which\n\nBrooks was involved.          At trial, Allen testified as a cooperating\n\nwitness for the Government and provided details about the second\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fconspiracy, which included himself, Brooks, Cecile St. Hilaire\n\n(\"St. Hilaire\"), and Linda Williams (\"Williams\").\n\n          In late 2002, Allen and Brooks traveled together from\n\nNorth Carolina to Maine.   Upon arriving in Maine, Brooks and Allen\n\nstayed with Williams before driving back to North Carolina.    They\n\nreturned to Maine soon thereafter, stopping in Boston to pick up\n\ncocaine for which Brooks paid, and discussing distribution options\n\nto people Allen knew.      Williams and Allen testified that they\n\nreceived cocaine from Brooks, while Donceia Robinson (\"Robinson\")\n\ntestified that she purchased cocaine from either Brooks or Williams\n\nat least five times.    Brooks was a guest at Williams' home from\n\nDecember 2002 to March 2003.\n\n          Nancy LeMar (\"LeMar\"), with whom Allen stayed for a\n\nperiod, testified that another couple, Josh Arbor (\"Arbor\") and\n\nNicole Truman (\"Truman\"), also bought cocaine from Brooks.    Allen\n\nconfirmed that Brooks supplied LeMar and her boyfriend with cocaine\n\nand that Brooks also gave crack to someone who lived downstairs\n\nfrom LeMar.   According to LeMar, Brooks was at her house up to five\n\ntimes a week selling crack.\n\n          Due to his own cocaine addiction, Allen became less\n\ndependable in the distribution chain and LeMar sometimes dealt with\n\ncustomers such as St. Hilaire, who estimated that she bought\n\ncocaine from LeMar several times, as well as directly from Allen\n\nand Brooks.   St. Hilaire also recalled meeting LeMar's suppliers,\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fidentified as Brooks and Allen, as well as driving Allen and Brooks\n\nto Boston in order for them to buy cocaine.\n\n           About a month after Wilson's arrest, Brooks and Allen\n\nbroke off relations and Allen returned to North Carolina.   Brooks\n\ncontinued to live with Williams and to sell crack from LeMar's home\n\nwith occasional help from St. Hilaire.\n\n           The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") arranged for\n\nTom Foss (\"Foss\") to make controlled crack purchases from Williams\n\non April 2 and 9, 2003, which were monitored over a body wire on\n\nFoss.   Foss first purchased 3.1 grams and then 2.8 grams of crack\n\nthat Williams claimed she had obtained from Brooks.\n\n           A third deal between Williams and Foss was planned by\n\nMDEA for 5:00 p.m. on April 11, 2003.       According to Williams,\n\nBrooks was to provide Williams with $1,000 worth of crack for her\n\nto sell to Foss.   On the afternoon of April 11, an MDEA agent saw\n\nBrooks leave Williams' house in a car.   The agent requested a stop\n\nby local police in order to identify Brooks.      When stopped for\n\ndriving without a front license plate, Brooks identified himself as\n\nDennis Nembhard and presented a New York driver's license with a\n\nphotograph that did not resemble him.    Brooks was let go with a\n\nwarning.\n\n           That same day, Williams was arrested upon returning to\n\nher house, where 6.0 grams of crack were found in a kitchen drawer,\n\nand $2,500 in cash was found in a bag.    Williams cooperated with\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fpolice and made a phone call to Brooks, which was taped.                     Brooks\n\nwas   arrested   upon   his    return    to    Williams'     house,   and,    by   a\n\nsubsequent search of his person, was found to possess $1,000 in\n\nsmall bills inside his shoes.\n\n           Brooks was tried together with Stephen McMann (\"McMann\"),\n\na member of the Wilson conspiracy, and found guilty on January 13,\n\n2004.   The PSR reflects Brooks' objections to the drug quantity\n\nattributed to him as being \"insufficiently reliable, based on\n\nevidence not presented at trial, and being contrary to the verdict\n\nreturned by the jury.\"        Brooks also objected to the obstruction of\n\njustice and leadership role enhancements.               The court ultimately\n\nfound   Brooks   responsible     for    73.4    grams   of   cocaine   base    and\n\nsentenced him to 276 months, stating:\n\n           The Court:          I'm not going to give you the\n                               320 months that Mr. Toof thinks\n                               you ought to get, and perhaps\n                               he is correct.    I'm also not\n                               going to give you the minimum\n                               because I'm concerned that what\n                               happened in Connecticut in\n                               terms    of   the   outstanding\n                               warrants, I'm concerned with\n                               the     international      drug\n                               smuggling. I'm going to give\n                               you 276 months, which is toward\n                               the lower end of the guideline\n                               range.\n\nBrooks timely appeals his conviction and sentence on the grounds\n\nspecified above.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                               II. Discussion\n\nA. Drug Quantity, Leadership Role, and Obstruction of Justice\nEnhancements\n\n             Brooks contends that remand is required because the\n\nsentence     he   received   was    based   on    judicial     fact-finding    in\n\nviolation of Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker.             According to the PSR,\n\nBrooks objected to the drug quantity determination on the grounds\n\nthat   it   was   \"insufficiently     reliable,       based   on   evidence   not\n\npresented at trial and ... contrary to the verdict returned by the\n\njury.\"      Brooks also objected to the court's finding that the\n\nsubstance was cocaine base, as well as the enhancements premised on\n\na determination that Brooks played a leadership role and was guilty\n\nof   obstruction    of   justice.     Based      on   his   objections,    Brooks\n\nmaintains that he preserved a Booker error sufficient to require a\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n             The Government argues that Brooks did not in fact present\n\nany Apprendi or Blakely objections. Directing our attention to the\n\nrecord, the Government states, \"Brooks lodged no constitutional\n\nobjections based upon Apprendi or Blakely.                    Thus, he did not\n\npreserve Booker error.\" The Government maintains that the district\n\ncourt's determination of drug quantity and imposition of further\n\nenhancements for sentencing purposes were not clearly erroneous\n\nbecause     the   findings   were   based   on    reliable     evidence.      The\n\nGovernment contends that Brooks cannot show that the sentencing\n\njudge would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory\n\n                                      -7-\n\fGuidelines system and thus fails to meet the plain error standard\n\nnecessary to remand an unpreserved Booker error.\n\n               This Court has recently defined a Booker error as, \"not\n\nthat a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts\n\nunder    the    Guidelines    which   increased     a    sentence   beyond    that\n\nauthorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant;\n\nthe error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines\n\nsystem.\"       Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\n               A Booker error is only preserved, however, \"if the\n\ndefendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.\"             Id. at 76.      At a minimum, an\n\nobjection sufficient to preserve a Booker error \"must fall at least\n\narguably within the encincture of the constitutional concerns\n\nraised   in     Apprendi,    Blakely,    and   Booker.\"       United   States    v.\n\nMartins, 413 F.3d 139, 153 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n               Prior to sentencing, Brooks lodged an objection to the\n\nPSR, arguing that the drug quantity finding was \"insufficiently\n\nreliable, based on evidence not presented at trial and ... contrary\n\nto the verdict returned by the jury.\"                   At sentencing, Brooks'\n\nobjections to the drug quantity determination, as well as the other\n\nsentencing       enhancements,    were    again     premised    solely   on     the\n\nsufficiency and reliability of the evidence.                    These types of\n\nobjections do not amount to Apprendi/Blakely or constitutional\n\narguments      that   preserve   Booker    error.       See   United   States    v.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fVillafane-Jimenez, 410 F.3d 74, 85 n.13 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir. 2005).                      To preserve\n\na Booker error, a defendant must assail, \"as a constitutional\n\nviolation, the imposition of enhancements that bring his sentence\n\nabove the maximum sentence authorized by jury fact-finding or\n\nadmitted facts.\" United States v. Fornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 73\n\n(1st   Cir.    2005).    By   objecting      to    the    use   of    hearsay      and\n\nquestioning the credibility of witnesses, Brooks did not present an\n\nApprendi/Blakely or constitutional argument which satisfies the\n\nAntonakopoulos standard for preserving Booker error.\n\n              Unpreserved Booker error is evaluated according to the\n\nplain error standard enunciated in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n\n725, 732 (1993), which consists of four factors: (1) an \"error,\"\n\n(2) that is \"plain,\" and (3) that \"affects substantial rights.\"\n\nId.    If the first three factors are met, we may exercise our\n\ndiscretion     to   correct   the   error,   but    (4)    only      if    the   error\n\n\"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\" Id. at 736. Any sentence imposed under the\n\nmandatory Guidelines system satisfies the first two Olano prongs.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.        As to the third and fourth prongs,\n\nthere must be a \"reasonable probability that the district court\n\nwould impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant\n\nunder the new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"                   Id. at 75.\n\n              The sentencing judge's comments do not support a finding\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat there is a reasonable probability he would have imposed a more\n\nfavorable sentence in the absence of the mandatory Guidelines. The\n\njudge specifically sentenced Brooks above the minimum due to\n\nconcerns with Brooks' outstanding warrants and the international\n\nnature of the drug smuggling.     Additionally, the judge imposed a\n\nsupervised release term significantly longer than was mandatory and\n\nfound that the estimates concerning drug quantity were \"extremely\n\nconservative.\"     It is unlikely the judge would have imposed a\n\nlesser sentence under an advisory Guidelines system, and \"[i]t is\n\nnot enough for a defendant merely to argue that his sentence might\n\nhave been different had the guidelines been advisory at the time of\n\nsentencing.\"     United States v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 80\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    Brooks does not point to anything \"concrete ...\n\nthat provides a plausible basis\" for a finding that the judge would\n\nhave sentenced differently under an advisory Guidelines framework.\n\nUnited States v. Guzmán, 419 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2005).     Olano\n\nprongs three and four therefore are not satisfied and we find that\n\nthe sentencing based on the judge's findings as to drug quantity\n\ndid not constitute plain error.\n\n          Nor did the judge's findings as to Brooks' leadership\n\nrole in the conspiracy and obstruction of justice constitute clear\n\nerror.   A leadership role enhancement is appropriate when the\n\nsentencing court finds first, that the defendant has acted as an\n\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity, and second, that the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\factivity involved five or more participants or was otherwise\n\nextensive.   United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   Based on the evidence presented, the judge found that\n\nBrooks played a leadership role because he\n\n          devised and implemented a plan on how to\n          distribute [the drugs] in terms of locations\n          and distribution network, either ordered\n          others to recruit members of the conspiracy or\n          recruited them himself and issued orders with\n          regard to how the drugs were obtained, stored\n          and distributed.\n\nThe judge also found that the conspiracy clearly involved at least\n\nseven members who helped Brooks \"deliver cocaine, helped him re-\n\nsupply with cocaine and provided him with transportation.\"     The\n\nrecord supports the judge's conclusion as to Brooks' leadership\n\nrole and because \"such 'role in the offense' assessments are fact-\n\nspecific, the district court's views must be accorded 'considerable\n\nrespect.'\"   Id. (citing United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)).     We therefore find that no clear error was\n\ncommitted.\n\n          Finally, the obstruction of justice enhancement was not\n\nclearly erroneous. Perjury serves as a trigger for the obstruction\n\nof justice enhancement, United States v. Campbell, 61 F.3d 976, 984\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), and the sentencing judge correctly assessed that\n\nBrooks committed perjury.   In continually denying that he sold any\n\ncocaine or was involved in cocaine trafficking in Maine, Brooks\n\nwillfully provided false testimony as to a material fact.      The\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fjudge cited a litany of instances from the record in which Brooks\n\ndenied selling or trafficking cocaine despite the significant\n\nevidence indicating otherwise.               We can overturn the district\n\ncourt's findings as to the obstruction of justice enhancement only\n\nif they are clearly erroneous, United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199,\n\n202 (1st Cir. 1994), and the record negates such a finding.\n\n             In sum, given the lack of plain error under Booker or as\n\nto the weight given to the drug quantity, and the absence of clear\n\nerror   as   to    the   leadership   role    and   obstruction    of    justice\n\nenhancements, the sentence is affirmed.\n\nB. Multiple Conspiracy Instruction\n\n             Brooks contends that, because he was tried concurrently\n\nwith McMann, the distributor for Wilson's conspiracy, a multiple\n\nconspiracy instruction was required and the judge's failure to give\n\nsuch an instruction resulted in a violation of Brooks' right to a\n\nfair trial.       The Government argues that, at trial, Brooks' counsel\n\nrequested     only    standard    instructions      and,   after   the     judge\n\ninstructed the jury, Brooks' counsel failed to object to the\n\nconspiracy     instruction       or   ask     for   a   multiple   conspiracy\n\ninstruction.\n\n             Brooks' counsel did not request a multiple conspiracy\n\ninstruction, nor did he object to the conspiracy instructions after\n\nthey were explained to the jury.              Plain error review therefore\n\napplies.     See Ramirez-Burgos v. United States, 313 F.3d 23, 28-29\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f(1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n            A court \"should instruct on the [multiple conspiracy]\n\nissue ‘if, on the evidence adduced at trial, a reasonable jury\n\ncould find more than one such illicit agreement, or could find an\n\nagreement different from the one charged.'\" United States v.\n\nBalthazard, 360 F.3d 309, 315-16 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 449 (1st Cir. 1994)).             Plain error\n\nis not evident in the district court's failure to charge multiple\n\nconspiracies,   however,    because   Count   I    charged   a    conspiracy\n\ninvolving   McMann   and   not   Brooks,   while    Count    II    charged   a\n\nconspiracy including Brooks, but not McMann.         Furthermore, in his\n\ninstructions on conspiracy, the judge correctly instructed the jury\n\nthat the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n\"the agreement specified in the indictment, and not some other\n\nagreement or agreements, existed between at least two people.\" See\n\nUnited States v. Gómez-Rosario, 418 F.3d 90, 104-105 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Counts I and II are largely distinct in time and membership\n\nsuch that McMann and Brooks cannot be said to have been charged as\n\nmembers of a single overarching conspiracy and the jury did not\n\nhave an opportunity to convict Brooks of the same conspiracy to\n\nwhich McMann was a party.        Given the separate conspiracies with\n\nwhich McMann and Brooks were charged, a multiple conspiracy charge\n\nwas not warranted.\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           Furthermore, we find that the jury's verdict - which, by\n\nits   differentiation    of    the   drug      quantities   involved     in    each\n\nconspiracy   reflected     the    jury's       understanding      that   the   two\n\nconspiracies were distinct - is dispositive on the question of\n\nwhether the proceedings suffered from unfairness or prejudice.                  In\n\nfinding McMann guilty on Count I, the jury determined that the\n\nfirst conspiracy was responsible for more than fifty grams of\n\ncocaine base.      In finding Brooks guilty on Count II, however, the\n\njury determined that the second conspiracy was responsible for more\n\nthan five grams but less than fifty grams of cocaine base.                     The\n\nverdict belies Brooks' claim that the jury found him to be part of\n\na single overarching conspiracy which included McMann. Contrary to\n\nBrooks' assertion that the jury failed to identify more than one\n\nconspiracy, the verdict reveals the jury's clear cognizance that\n\nmultiple conspiracies existed and therefore leaves us incapable of\n\nfinding that a multiple conspiracy instruction was necessary to\n\nrender Brooks' trial fair.\n\nC. Right to Confront Witnesses\n\n           Brooks     argues     that    the    admission    of     out-of-court\n\nstatements by his co-conspirators violated his right to a fair\n\ntrial.   Brooks asserts that on several occasions during the trial,\n\nstatements made by witnesses who were not available for cross-\n\nexamination were permitted in violation of Crawford v. Washington.\n\nThe   Government    contends     that,     although    Crawford     applies     to\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ftestimonial statements, the statements Brooks disputes were made by\n\nco-conspirators \"in furtherance of a conspiracy,\" and therefore\n\nwere not testimonial in nature.        Id. at 56.   Brooks did not raise\n\nthis issue below and we therefore review for plain error.               See\n\nMitchell, 85 F.3d at 807.\n\n             Brooks' allegation that the statements at issue were\n\nsubject to Crawford fails to recognize that we find statements of\n\nco-conspirators to be nontestimonial and thereby not subject to\n\nCrawford.     See United States v. Felton, 417 F.3d 97, 103 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (\"[T]he statements [of co-conspirators] fall within a firmly\n\nrooted hearsay exception, so their admission does not violate [the\n\ndefendant's] Sixth Amendment rights.\").          We also fail to see the\n\nrelevance of Brooks' objection to the disputed double hearsay\n\nstatements - they pertain only to the McMann conspiracy in Count I\n\nand make no mention of Brooks.            We therefore do not find the\n\nadmission of these statements to constitute error.\n\nD. Improper Vouching for Cooperating Witnesses\n\n             Brooks contends that, although witness plea agreements\n\nmay     be   admitted   into   evidence    for   purposes   of     assessing\n\ncredibility, United States v. Doherty, 675 F.Supp. 726, 738 (D.\n\nMass.    1987),   the   Government's   closing    statement      constituted\n\nimproper vouching for each cooperating witness to the extent that\n\nthe trial outcome was likely affected.           The Government responds\n\nthat the prosecutor's statements during the closing argument did\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fnot constitute improper vouching because \"the prosecutor simply\n\npointed out a fact in evidence - that [the witnesses'] plea\n\nagreement[s] required [them] to testify candidly,\" United States v.\n\nMillan, 230 F.3d 431, 438 (1st Cir. 2000), and the statements did\n\nnot insinuate any personal belief which took advantage of the\n\nprosecutor's    status   as    \"a   representative   of   the   government.\"\n\nUnited States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           We have previously held that it is not error for the\n\nprosecutor to \"assert reasons why a witness ought to be accepted as\n\ntruthful by the jury.\"        United States v. Rodríguez, 215 F.3d 110,\n\n123 (1st Cir. 2000). The prosecutor may properly \"admit a witness'\n\nplea agreement into evidence, discuss the details of the plea\n\nduring closing arguments, and comment upon a witness' incentive to\n\ntestify truthfully.\"     United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citing United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n1991)).   Prosecutorial behavior crosses into the realm of improper\n\nvouching when the prosecutor \"places the prestige of the government\n\nbehind a witness by making personal assurances about the witness'\n\ncredibility.\"    Id. at 7 (quoting United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d\n\n1190, 1207 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n           In the closing arguments, after summarizing the terms of\n\nthe plea agreement, the prosecutor made the following remark:\n\n           So you can either take the defense version,\n           they clearly suggest that these guys will say\n\n                                     -16-\n\f           anything in order to convict these men in\n           order to earn a lower sentence or at least the\n           recommendation from the government, or they\n           have to comply with the plea agreement. I'll\n           leave it at that.\n\nWith nothing further, the prosecutor's conduct cannot be found to\n\nconstitute an instance of improper vouching.              The prosecutor\n\ndiscussed the details of the agreement and commented upon the\n\nwitnesses' motivations stemming from the plea agreements, actions\n\nwhich we have deemed acceptable.      See Millan, 230 F.3d at 438.     The\n\nrecord   contains   no   indication   that   the   prosecutor   personally\n\nendorsed the witnesses and therefore no prejudice resulted from a\n\nsense that the Government backed the witnesses.          Brooks fails to\n\nprovide any other evidence indicating improper vouching that might\n\nhave affected the outcome of the trial.        United States v. Wihbey,\n\n75 F.3d 761, 771-72 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Improper statements during\n\nclosing argument are considered harmful if, given the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, they are likely to have affected the trial's\n\noutcome.\").    We therefore find that the prosecutor's closing\n\nremarks did not constitute improper vouching.\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons stated herein, Brooks' conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f",

Appellant   Godfrey      Brooks\n\n(“Brooks\")   was   convicted    in   January   2004   as   a   member    of   a\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in Maine. He was\n\nfound guilty of several counts, including: conspiracy to distribute\n\nand possess with intent to distribute cocaine base under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A) and 846 (\"Count II\"); distribution and\n\naiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base under 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Counts VII\n\nand VIII\"); and possession with intent to distribute at least five\n\ngrams of cocaine base and aiding and abetting under 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Count IX\").            The jury\n\nfound that the quantity of cocaine base involved in Counts II and\n\nIX equaled five or more grams, but that the amount involved in\n\nCount II did not exceed fifty grams.\n\n          Brooks was sentenced to 276 months on Counts II and IX,\n\nand 240 months on Counts VII and VIII, to be served concurrently.\n\nThe sentence was based on a finding by the court that Brooks was\n\nresponsible for 73.4 grams of cocaine base, that he was the leader\n\nof the conspiracy listed under Count II, and that he had obstructed\n\njustice by persisting with a false identification.             As calculated\n\nin the Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") and by the court, the sentencing\n\nguideline range for his offense level of 38, and a criminal history\n\ncategory of II, was 262-327 months.\n\n          Brooks appeals on six grounds: (1) the sentence is in\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fexcess of what was authorized by the jury and is based on evidence\n\nnot presented at trial, necessitating a remand under United States\n\nv.

Background\n\n            Brooks was indicted in May 2003 as a member of one of two\n\noverlapping conspiracies to distribute cocaine base.                          Roderick\n\nAllen     (\"Allen\")     was    the    common    co-conspirator            between     one\n\nconspiracy run by Easton Wilson (\"Wilson\"), and another in which\n\nBrooks was involved.          At trial, Allen testified as a cooperating\n\nwitness for the Government and provided details about the second\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fconspiracy, which included himself, Brooks, Cecile St. Hilaire\n\n(\"St. Hilaire\"), and Linda Williams (\"Williams\").\n\n          In late 2002, Allen and Brooks traveled together from\n\nNorth Carolina to Maine.   Upon arriving in Maine, Brooks and Allen\n\nstayed with Williams before driving back to North Carolina.    They\n\nreturned to Maine soon thereafter, stopping in Boston to pick up\n\ncocaine for which Brooks paid, and discussing distribution options\n\nto people Allen knew.      Williams and Allen testified that they\n\nreceived cocaine from Brooks, while Donceia Robinson (\"Robinson\")\n\ntestified that she purchased cocaine from either Brooks or Williams\n\nat least five times.    Brooks was a guest at Williams' home from\n\nDecember 2002 to March 2003.\n\n          Nancy LeMar (\"LeMar\"), with whom Allen stayed for a\n\nperiod, testified that another couple, Josh Arbor (\"Arbor\") and\n\nNicole Truman (\"Truman\"), also bought cocaine from Brooks.    Allen\n\nconfirmed that Brooks supplied LeMar and her boyfriend with cocaine\n\nand that Brooks also gave crack to someone who lived downstairs\n\nfrom LeMar.   According to LeMar, Brooks was at her house up to five\n\ntimes a week selling crack.\n\n          Due to his own cocaine addiction, Allen became less\n\ndependable in the distribution chain and LeMar sometimes dealt with\n\ncustomers such as St. Hilaire, who estimated that she bought\n\ncocaine from LeMar several times, as well as directly from Allen\n\nand Brooks.   St. Hilaire also recalled meeting LeMar's suppliers,\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fidentified as Brooks and Allen, as well as driving Allen and Brooks\n\nto Boston in order for them to buy cocaine.\n\n           About a month after Wilson's arrest, Brooks and Allen\n\nbroke off relations and Allen returned to North Carolina.   Brooks\n\ncontinued to live with Williams and to sell crack from LeMar's home\n\nwith occasional help from St. Hilaire.\n\n           The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") arranged for\n\nTom Foss (\"Foss\") to make controlled crack purchases from Williams\n\non April 2 and 9, 2003, which were monitored over a body wire on\n\nFoss.   Foss first purchased 3.1 grams and then 2.8 grams of crack\n\nthat Williams claimed she had obtained from Brooks.\n\n           A third deal between Williams and Foss was planned by\n\nMDEA for 5:00 p.m. on April 11, 2003.       According to Williams,\n\nBrooks was to provide Williams with $1,000 worth of crack for her\n\nto sell to Foss.   On the afternoon of April 11, an MDEA agent saw\n\nBrooks leave Williams' house in a car.   The agent requested a stop\n\nby local police in order to identify Brooks.      When stopped for\n\ndriving without a front license plate, Brooks identified himself as\n\nDennis Nembhard and presented a New York driver's license with a\n\nphotograph that did not resemble him.    Brooks was let go with a\n\nwarning.\n\n           That same day, Williams was arrested upon returning to\n\nher house, where 6.0 grams of crack were found in a kitchen drawer,\n\nand $2,500 in cash was found in a bag.    Williams cooperated with\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fpolice and made a phone call to Brooks, which was taped.                     Brooks\n\nwas   arrested   upon   his    return    to    Williams'     house,   and,    by   a\n\nsubsequent search of his person, was found to possess $1,000 in\n\nsmall bills inside his shoes.\n\n           Brooks was tried together with Stephen McMann (\"McMann\"),\n\na member of the Wilson conspiracy, and found guilty on January 13,\n\n2004.   The PSR reflects Brooks' objections to the drug quantity\n\nattributed to him as being \"insufficiently reliable, based on\n\nevidence not presented at trial, and being contrary to the verdict\n\nreturned by the jury.\"        Brooks also objected to the obstruction of\n\njustice and leadership role enhancements.               The court ultimately\n\nfound   Brooks   responsible     for    73.4    grams   of   cocaine   base    and\n\nsentenced him to 276 months, stating:\n\n           The Court:          I'm not going to give you the\n                               320 months that Mr. Toof thinks\n                               you ought to get, and perhaps\n                               he is correct.    I'm also not\n                               going to give you the minimum\n                               because I'm concerned that what\n                               happened in Connecticut in\n                               terms    of   the   outstanding\n                               warrants, I'm concerned with\n                               the     international      drug\n                               smuggling. I'm going to give\n                               you 276 months, which is toward\n                               the lower end of the guideline\n                               range.\n\nBrooks timely appeals his conviction and sentence on the grounds\n\nspecified above.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                               II. Discussion\n\nA. Drug Quantity, Leadership Role, and Obstruction of Justice\nEnhancements\n\n             Brooks contends that remand is required because the\n\nsentence     he   received   was    based   on    judicial     fact-finding    in\n\nviolation of Apprendi, Blakely, and Booker.             According to the PSR,\n\nBrooks objected to the drug quantity determination on the grounds\n\nthat   it   was   \"insufficiently     reliable,       based   on   evidence   not\n\npresented at trial and ... contrary to the verdict returned by the\n\njury.\"      Brooks also objected to the court's finding that the\n\nsubstance was cocaine base, as well as the enhancements premised on\n\na determination that Brooks played a leadership role and was guilty\n\nof   obstruction    of   justice.     Based      on   his   objections,    Brooks\n\nmaintains that he preserved a Booker error sufficient to require a\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n             The Government argues that Brooks did not in fact present\n\nany Apprendi or Blakely objections. Directing our attention to the\n\nrecord, the Government states, \"Brooks lodged no constitutional\n\nobjections based upon Apprendi or Blakely.                    Thus, he did not\n\npreserve Booker error.\" The Government maintains that the district\n\ncourt's determination of drug quantity and imposition of further\n\nenhancements for sentencing purposes were not clearly erroneous\n\nbecause     the   findings   were   based   on    reliable     evidence.      The\n\nGovernment contends that Brooks cannot show that the sentencing\n\njudge would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory\n\n                                      -7-\n\fGuidelines system and thus fails to meet the plain error standard\n\nnecessary to remand an unpreserved Booker error.\n\n               This Court has recently defined a Booker error as, \"not\n\nthat a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts\n\nunder    the    Guidelines    which   increased     a    sentence   beyond    that\n\nauthorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant;\n\nthe error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines\n\nsystem.\"       Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\n               A Booker error is only preserved, however, \"if the\n\ndefendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.\"             Id. at 76.

As to the third and fourth prongs,\n\nthere must be a \"reasonable probability that the district court\n\nwould impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant\n\nunder the new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"                   Id. at 75.\n\n              The sentencing judge's comments do not support a finding\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat there is a reasonable probability he would have imposed a more\n\nfavorable sentence in the absence of the mandatory Guidelines.

Olano\n\nprongs three and four therefore are not satisfied and we find that\n\nthe sentencing based on the judge's findings as to drug quantity\n\ndid not constitute plain error.\n\n          Nor did the judge's findings as to Brooks' leadership\n\nrole in the conspiracy and obstruction of justice constitute clear\n\nerror.   A leadership role enhancement is appropriate when the\n\nsentencing court finds first, that the defendant has acted as an\n\norganizer or leader of a criminal activity, and second, that the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\factivity involved five or more participants or was otherwise\n\nextensive.

Multiple Conspiracy Instruction\n\n             Brooks contends that, because he was tried concurrently\n\nwith McMann, the distributor for Wilson's conspiracy, a multiple\n\nconspiracy instruction was required and the judge's failure to give\n\nsuch an instruction resulted in a violation of Brooks' right to a\n\nfair trial.       The Government argues that, at trial, Brooks' counsel\n\nrequested     only    standard    instructions      and,   after   the     judge\n\ninstructed the jury, Brooks' counsel failed to object to the\n\nconspiracy     instruction       or   ask     for   a   multiple   conspiracy\n\ninstruction.\n\n             Brooks' counsel did not request a multiple conspiracy\n\ninstruction, nor did he object to the conspiracy instructions after\n\nthey were explained to the jury.

Furthermore, in his\n\ninstructions on conspiracy, the judge correctly instructed the jury\n\nthat the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n\"the agreement specified in the indictment, and not some other\n\nagreement or agreements, existed between at least two people.\" See\n\nUnited States v. Gómez-Rosario, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201760\"><a href=\"/opinion/201760/united-states-v-gomez-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104-105 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Counts I and II are largely distinct in time and membership\n\nsuch that McMann and Brooks cannot be said to have been charged as\n\nmembers of a single overarching conspiracy and the jury did not\n\nhave an opportunity to convict Brooks of the same conspiracy to\n\nwhich McMann was a party.        Given the separate conspiracies with\n\nwhich McMann and Brooks were charged, a multiple conspiracy charge\n\nwas not warranted.\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f           Furthermore, we find that the jury's verdict - which, by\n\nits   differentiation    of    the   drug      quantities   involved     in    each\n\nconspiracy   reflected     the    jury's       understanding      that   the   two\n\nconspiracies were distinct - is dispositive on the question of\n\nwhether the proceedings suffered from unfairness or prejudice.                  In\n\nfinding McMann guilty on Count I, the jury determined that the\n\nfirst conspiracy was responsible for more than fifty grams of\n\ncocaine base.      In finding Brooks guilty on Count II, however, the\n\njury determined that the second conspiracy was responsible for more\n\nthan five grams but less than fifty grams of cocaine base.                     The\n\nverdict belies Brooks' claim that the jury found him to be part of\n\na single overarching conspiracy which included McMann. Contrary to\n\nBrooks' assertion that the jury failed to identify more than one\n\nconspiracy, the verdict reveals the jury's clear cognizance that\n\nmultiple conspiracies existed and therefore leaves us incapable of\n\nfinding that a multiple conspiracy instruction was necessary to\n\nrender Brooks' trial fair.\n\nC. Right to Confront Witnesses\n\n           Brooks     argues     that    the    admission    of     out-of-court\n\nstatements by his co-conspirators violated his right to a fair\n\ntrial.   Brooks asserts that on several occasions during the trial,\n\nstatements made by witnesses who were not available for cross-\n\nexamination were permitted in violation of Crawford v. Washington.\n\nThe   Government    contends     that,     although    Crawford     applies     to\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ftestimonial statements, the statements Brooks disputes were made by\n\nco-conspirators \"in furtherance of a conspiracy,\" and therefore\n\nwere not testimonial in nature.        Id. at 56.   Brooks did not raise\n\nthis issue below and we therefore review for plain error.               See\n\nMitchell, 85 F.3d at 807.\n\n             Brooks' allegation that the statements at issue were\n\nsubject to Crawford fails to recognize that we find statements of\n\nco-conspirators to be nontestimonial and thereby not subject to\n\nCrawford.     See United States v. Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791236\"><a href=\"/opinion/791236/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-leo-v-felton-erica/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (\"[T]he statements [of co-conspirators] fall within a firmly\n\nrooted hearsay exception, so their admission does not violate [the\n\ndefendant's] Sixth Amendment rights.\").
