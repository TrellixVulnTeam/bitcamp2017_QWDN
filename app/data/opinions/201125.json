Petitioner Jacky Andre appeals the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals's (\"BIA\") order affirming the denial of his\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture.       We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           Petitioner, a native and citizen of Haiti, entered the\n\nUnited States from Canada at Buffalo, New York, on September 18,\n\n1999.    On September 5, 2000, petitioner filed an application for\n\nasylum   and   withholding   of    removal    with    the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\").1          This application was denied and\n\npetitioner was charged with removability under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).\n\n           At a hearing before the Immigration Judge on May 22,\n\n2001, petitioner admitted the factual allegations against him,\n\nconceded   removability,     and   requested     asylum,    withholding    of\n\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n           After a hearing on October 18, 2001, the Immigration\n\nJudge denied petitioner's applications for asylum and withholding\n\nof removal, finding that he was not a credible witness and that he\n\nfailed to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     The   Immigration    Judge    also    denied   petitioner's\n\n\n1\n       In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                    -2-\n\frequest for relief under the Convention Against Torture, finding it\n\nunlikely that he would be tortured in the future by the Haitian\n\ngovernment or with the consent or acquiescence of a government\n\nofficial.     Finally, the Immigration Judge denied petitioner's\n\nrequest for voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion, and\n\npretermitted petitioner's application for adjustment of status\n\npursuant    to   8   U.S.C.   §   1255(i),      stating    that    it   lacked\n\njurisdiction.2\n\n            Petitioner   appealed   to    the   BIA,    which   affirmed   the\n\nImmigration Judge's decision on January 13, 2003.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.          Asylum\n\n            Petitioner   bears    the     burden   of     demonstrating    his\n\neligibility for asylum.       See Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     Petitioner may meet that burden by demonstrating\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based\n\non \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"       Id. (quoting 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.13(a)) (internal quotation marks omitted). To establish past\n\npersecution, an applicant must provide \"conclusive evidence\" that\n\n\n\n2\n     Petitioner does not appeal the denial of voluntary departure\nand adjustment of status. We therefore only consider his claims\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhe was targeted on any of the five grounds.              Fesseha v. Ashcroft,\n\n333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).             To show a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution, an applicant must meet both subjective and\n\nobjective prongs.        Id.       To satisfy the objective prong, an\n\napplicant's    testimony       alone   may   be    sufficient,   but   it   must\n\nconstitute credible and specific evidence of a reasonable fear of\n\npersecution.    El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   To meet the subjective prong, the applicant must show his\n\nfear is genuine.    See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     If an applicant has proved past persecution, \"a\n\nregulatory presumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution is triggered.\"              Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).\n\n           \"Determinations of eligibility for asylum or withholding\n\nof   deportation   are     reviewed     under     the   substantial    evidence\n\nstandard.\"    Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18.        The agency decision is upheld\n\nif it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"            Id. (quoting INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).              Under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding, we must find that\n\nthe evidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it\n\n. . . .\"       Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Petitioner testified to the following facts.          He began\n\nliving with his aunt and uncle in Port-au-Prince after his mother\n\ndied in April 1988.       In 1989, he became a member of the Parti\n\nAgricole Industrial National (\"PAIN\"), a party that sought to\n\nfoster solidarity and to further democracy in Haiti.         In September\n\n1993, he began working for PAIN as a driver.              Petitioner also\n\nworked as a coordinator and mechanic for PAIN.       The leader of PAIN\n\nwas Louis Dejoie II, a man whom petitioner knew personally.\n\n           In July 1995, the home of petitioner's aunt was set on\n\nfire while he was in bed about to go to sleep.        The neighbors put\n\nthe fire out before the house burned down.           Petitioner was not\n\nharmed. Petitioner testified that he believed the fire was started\n\nbecause he was a member of PAIN.        After this incident, petitioner\n\nleft his aunt's house and slept at different places until 1999,\n\nalthough he continued to use his aunt's address as his place of\n\nresidence. Petitioner testified that his aunt received daily phone\n\ncalls from unknown individuals who asked for petitioner and said\n\nthey \"would get\" petitioner.\n\n           Petitioner's    testimony    described   two   incidents   that\n\noccurred in July 1999 relating to his job as a driver for PAIN.\n\nThe first incident involved an unidentified person who fired shots\n\nin the air as the bus petitioner was driving passed by while other\n\npeople threw rocks at the bus which caused the windshield to\n\nshatter.   Petitioner was not harmed.      Petitioner testified that he\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\freported this incident to Louis Dejoie II.             The second incident\n\ninvolved a policeman who fired shots into the air after petitioner\n\nhad parked the bus and was walking home.          Petitioner reported the\n\nincident to the police who allegedly accused him of lying and\n\nlaughed at him.\n\n            Petitioner flew to Canada, where he stayed with a friend\n\nfor fifteen days before entering the United States. When asked why\n\nhe   did   not   remain    in   Canada,   petitioner   stated   that   he   had\n\nrelatives and friends in the United States and knew he would be\n\nsafe here.       Petitioner also testified that, since his arrival in\n\nthe United States, he learned that PAIN's headquarters had been\n\nburned down and Louis Dejoie II had died.\n\n            1.       Credibility\n\n            The Immigration Judge found that petitioner was not a\n\ncredible witness.         \"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a\n\nwitness makes an adverse credibility finding and supports it with\n\nspecific findings, an appellate court ordinarily should accord it\n\nsignificant respect.\"           Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 571.        In this\n\ncase, the Immigration Judge supported her credibility determination\n\nwith specific findings which \"amply justified the IJ's conclusion\n\nthat the petitioner's testimony lacked crediblility.\"              Id.      The\n\nImmigration Judge noted several inconsistencies in petitioner's\n\ntestimony relating to the alleged instances of persecution. First,\n\npetitioner testified that he reported the first July 1999 incident\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fto Louis Dejoie II.      Petitioner also testified that he learned of\n\nLouis Dejoie II's death after his arrival in the United States.\n\nHowever, one of the documents petitioner submitted stated that\n\nLouis   Dejoie   II    died   in   1998.   When    confronted   with   this\n\ninconsistency, petitioner merely repeated his prior testimony.\n\nSecond, petitioner originally testified that, in the first July\n\nincident, shots were fired at the tires of the bus he was driving.\n\nHe later testified that these shots were fired into the air.           The\n\nImmigration Judge also noted other inconsistencies in petitioner's\n\ntestimony that supported an adverse credibility finding.               The\n\nImmigration Judge supported her credibility determination with\n\nspecific findings, and nothing in the record before us compels a\n\ncontrary conclusion.       See id.\n\n           2.         Past Persecution\n\n           The Immigration Judge found that petitioner's testimony,\n\nwere it credible, did not sustain his burden of proving either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.               \"To\n\nqualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"          Nelson v.\n\nINS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).           We are not compelled to\n\nmake a decision contrary to the Immigration Judge and BIA based on\n\na favorable reading of petitioner's testimony.            Petitioner was\n\nnever physically harmed in any way, nor was he ever confined.\n\nPetitioner also failed to show that the alleged incidents of\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpersecution occurred as a result of his political opinion or any\n\nother protected ground.3         We agree with the Immigration Judge's\n\nfinding that it was more likely that the July 1999 incidents where\n\npetitioner was driving a bus with \"PAIN\" written on the side\n\noccurred   due    to    the   general    civil      unrest    in     Haiti   than    to\n\npetitioner's political opinion.          The Immigration Judge's and BIA's\n\nconclusion that petitioner failed to show past persecution is\n\ntherefore supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           3.          Future Persecution\n\n           Substantial        evidence     also      exists     to     support      the\n\ndetermination that petitioner did not demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.        Because petitioner did not prove past\n\npersecution, he is not entitled to the regulatory presumption of a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.               See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 15.\n\nPetitioner could still establish a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution      by    proving   that    his    fear   is     \"both    genuine      and\n\nobjectively reasonable.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572. We focus\n\nour discussion on the objective prong.                 The relevant inquiry is\n\n\"whether   a      reasonable      person       in    the     asylum     applicant's\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily\n\n\n3\n        There was no evidence that the fire at the home of\npetitioner's aunt was set intentionally, much less that the fire\nwas set due to petitioner's membership in PAIN.     Regarding the\nalleged threatening telephone calls to petitioner's aunt, there is\nagain no evidence demonstrating a political motive for the calls.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprotected    ground.\"     Id.;      see     also    Fesseha,   333    F.3d    at   19.\n\nPetitioner    argues    that   he     has    a    well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution    because    he    and    his       political   party,   PAIN,    faced\n\npersecution in the past, and because the documentary evidence he\n\nsubmitted shows that there is a pattern of political crime and\n\ndisorder in Haiti.       However, as stated above, petitioner has not\n\nmet his burden of proving past persecution on account of his\n\nmembership in PAIN. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that,\n\nat   best,   petitioner's      documentary         evidence,   including     country\n\nreports, shows that Haiti has suffered a great deal of unrest and\n\ncrime.   This evidence does not compel a finding that a reasonable\n\nperson in petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution on\n\naccount of a statutorily-protected ground.\n\n             Because we find substantial evidence to support the\n\nImmigration Judge's and BIA's findings that petitioner was not a\n\ncredible witness, failed to demonstrate past persecution due to a\n\nprotected ground, and failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution due to a protected ground, we affirm the denial\n\nof asylum.\n\nB.           Withholding of Removal\n\n             If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, he is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of deportation.              Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365,\n\n372 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                          -9-\n\fC.          Convention Against Torture\n\n            Petitioner's final argument is that he will be tortured\n\nif he is deported to Haiti.      Under Article III of the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture, petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely\n\nthan not that he will be tortured if removed to Haiti in order to\n\nobtain   relief.    8   C.F.R.   §    208.16(c)(2).      The    regulations\n\nimplementing the Convention Against Torture define torture as\n\n\"severe pain or suffering, . . . inflicted by or at the instigation\n\nof or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or\n\nother person acting in an official capacity.\"          8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.18(a)(1). Petitioner has not presented any evidence that any\n\ngovernmental official or other person acting in official capacity\n\nhas tortured petitioner, and his documentary evidence does not\n\nsubstantiate his allegations of torture in Haiti.              See Elien v.\n\nAshcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 399 (1st Cir. 2004).          We see no reason to\n\ndisturb the findings of the Immigration Judge as to the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture and the BIA's affirmance thereof.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, the BIA's order is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

Under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding, we must find that\n\nthe evidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it\n\n. . . .\"       Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Petitioner testified to the following facts.          He began\n\nliving with his aunt and uncle in Port-au-Prince after his mother\n\ndied in April 1988.       In 1989, he became a member of the Parti\n\nAgricole Industrial National (\"PAIN\"), a party that sought to\n\nfoster solidarity and to further democracy in Haiti.         In September\n\n1993, he began working for PAIN as a driver.              Petitioner also\n\nworked as a coordinator and mechanic for PAIN.       The leader of PAIN\n\nwas Louis Dejoie II, a man whom petitioner knew personally.\n\n           In July 1995, the home of petitioner's aunt was set on\n\nfire while he was in bed about to go to sleep.        The neighbors put\n\nthe fire out before the house burned down.           Petitioner was not\n\nharmed. Petitioner testified that he believed the fire was started\n\nbecause he was a member of PAIN.        After this incident, petitioner\n\nleft his aunt's house and slept at different places until 1999,\n\nalthough he continued to use his aunt's address as his place of\n\nresidence. Petitioner testified that his aunt received daily phone\n\ncalls from unknown individuals who asked for petitioner and said\n\nthey \"would get\" petitioner.\n\n           Petitioner's    testimony    described   two   incidents   that\n\noccurred in July 1999 relating to his job as a driver for PAIN.\n\nThe first incident involved an unidentified person who fired shots\n\nin the air as the bus petitioner was driving passed by while other\n\npeople threw rocks at the bus which caused the windshield to\n\nshatter.   Petitioner was not harmed.      Petitioner testified that he\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\freported this incident to Louis Dejoie II.             The second incident\n\ninvolved a policeman who fired shots into the air after petitioner\n\nhad parked the bus and was walking home.          Petitioner reported the\n\nincident to the police who allegedly accused him of lying and\n\nlaughed at him.\n\n            Petitioner flew to Canada, where he stayed with a friend\n\nfor fifteen days before entering the United States. When asked why\n\nhe   did   not   remain    in   Canada,   petitioner   stated   that   he   had\n\nrelatives and friends in the United States and knew he would be\n\nsafe here.       Petitioner also testified that, since his arrival in\n\nthe United States, he learned that PAIN's headquarters had been\n\nburned down and Louis Dejoie II had died.\n\n            1.       Credibility\n\n            The Immigration Judge found that petitioner was not a\n\ncredible witness.         \"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a\n\nwitness makes an adverse credibility finding and supports it with\n\nspecific findings, an appellate court ordinarily should accord it\n\nsignificant respect.\"           Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 571.        In this\n\ncase, the Immigration Judge supported her credibility determination\n\nwith specific findings which \"amply justified the IJ's conclusion\n\nthat the petitioner's testimony lacked crediblility.\"              Id.      The\n\nImmigration Judge noted several inconsistencies in petitioner's\n\ntestimony relating to the alleged instances of persecution. First,\n\npetitioner testified that he reported the first July 1999 incident\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fto Louis Dejoie II.      Petitioner also testified that he learned of\n\nLouis Dejoie II's death after his arrival in the United States.\n\nHowever, one of the documents petitioner submitted stated that\n\nLouis   Dejoie   II    died   in   1998.   When    confronted   with   this\n\ninconsistency, petitioner merely repeated his prior testimony.\n\nSecond, petitioner originally testified that, in the first July\n\nincident, shots were fired at the tires of the bus he was driving.\n\nHe later testified that these shots were fired into the air.           The\n\nImmigration Judge also noted other inconsistencies in petitioner's\n\ntestimony that supported an adverse credibility finding.               The\n\nImmigration Judge supported her credibility determination with\n\nspecific findings, and nothing in the record before us compels a\n\ncontrary conclusion.       See id.\n\n           2.         Past Persecution\n\n           The Immigration Judge found that petitioner's testimony,\n\nwere it credible, did not sustain his burden of proving either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.               \"To\n\nqualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"          Nelson v.\n\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).           We are not compelled to\n\nmake a decision contrary to the Immigration Judge and BIA based on\n\na favorable reading of petitioner's testimony.            Petitioner was\n\nnever physically harmed in any way, nor was he ever confined.\n\nPetitioner also failed to show that the alleged incidents of\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpersecution occurred as a result of his political opinion or any\n\nother protected ground.3         We agree with the Immigration Judge's\n\nfinding that it was more likely that the July 1999 incidents where\n\npetitioner was driving a bus with \"PAIN\" written on the side\n\noccurred   due    to    the   general    civil      unrest    in     Haiti   than    to\n\npetitioner's political opinion.          The Immigration Judge's and BIA's\n\nconclusion that petitioner failed to show past persecution is\n\ntherefore supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           3.          Future Persecution\n\n           Substantial        evidence     also      exists     to     support      the\n\ndetermination that petitioner did not demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.        Because petitioner did not prove past\n\npersecution, he is not entitled to the regulatory presumption of a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.               See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 15.\n\nPetitioner could still establish a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution      by    proving   that    his    fear   is     \"both    genuine      and\n\nobjectively reasonable.\" Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572. We focus\n\nour discussion on the objective prong.                 The relevant inquiry is\n\n\"whether   a      reasonable      person       in    the     asylum     applicant's\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily\n\n\n3\n        There was no evidence that the fire at the home of\npetitioner's aunt was set intentionally, much less that the fire\nwas set due to petitioner's membership in PAIN.     Regarding the\nalleged threatening telephone calls to petitioner's aunt, there is\nagain no evidence demonstrating a political motive for the calls.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprotected    ground.\"     Id.;      see     also    Fesseha,   333    F.3d    at   19.\n\nPetitioner    argues    that   he     has    a    well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution    because    he    and    his       political   party,   PAIN,    faced\n\npersecution in the past, and because the documentary evidence he\n\nsubmitted shows that there is a pattern of political crime and\n\ndisorder in Haiti.       However, as stated above, petitioner has not\n\nmet his burden of proving past persecution on account of his\n\nmembership in PAIN. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that,\n\nat   best,   petitioner's      documentary         evidence,   including     country\n\nreports, shows that Haiti has suffered a great deal of unrest and\n\ncrime.   This evidence does not compel a finding that a reasonable\n\nperson in petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution on\n\naccount of a statutorily-protected ground.\n\n             Because we find substantial evidence to support the\n\nImmigration Judge's and BIA's findings that petitioner was not a\n\ncredible witness, failed to demonstrate past persecution due to a\n\nprotected ground, and failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution due to a protected ground, we affirm the denial\n\nof asylum.\n\nB.           Withholding of Removal\n\n             If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, he is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of deportation.

Convention Against Torture\n\n            Petitioner's final argument is that he will be tortured\n\nif he is deported to Haiti.      Under Article III of the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture, petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely\n\nthan not that he will be tortured if removed to Haiti in order to\n\nobtain   relief.    8   C.F.R.   §    208.16(c)(2).      The    regulations\n\nimplementing the Convention Against Torture define torture as\n\n\"severe pain or suffering, . . . inflicted by or at the instigation\n\nof or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or\n\nother person acting in an official capacity.\"          8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.18(a)(1). Petitioner has not presented any evidence that any\n\ngovernmental official or other person acting in official capacity\n\nhas tortured petitioner, and his documentary evidence does not\n\nsubstantiate his allegations of torture in Haiti.
