Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n                                                 \n\n                                         \n\n                            Before\n\n                     Breyer, Chief Judge,\n                                        \n             Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n                                                \n\n                                         \n\nJerry  Larrivee on  Memorandum of  Law  Seeking Probable  Cause to\n               \nAppeal.\n\n                                         \n\n                                         \n\n          Per  Curiam.   Petitioner  Jerry  Larrivee seeks  a\n                     \n\ncertificate of probable cause to  appeal the dismissal of his\n\n28 U.S.C.   2254 habeas petition.  For  the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we deny his request.   Petitioner was convicted, after\n\na jury  trial, of burglary,  robbery, theft of a  firearm and\n\npossession of  a firearm by  a felon.   This  was his  second\n\nconviction;  both  convictions  arose  out  of  robberies  of\n\ntaxicab  drivers.    His conviction  was  affirmed  on direct\n\nappeal.  See State v. Larrivee, 563 A.2d 1104 (Me. 1989).\n                              \n\n          Petitioner's habeas petition  contains four grounds\n\nfor   relief:    (1)   withholding  of  information   by  the\n\nprosecutor;  (2) conviction obtained  by the use  of perjured\n\ntestimony of a witness; (3) conviction obtained by the use of\n\nan   inadmissable  and   involuntary   confession;  and   (4)\n\nconviction   obtained   by   an   unconstitutional   in-court\n\nidentification.  The district court referred the  matter to a\n\nmagistrate judge.   He  rejected grounds one  and two  on the\n\nbasis that they had been disposed of on the merits in a prior\n\nhabeas petition.\n\n          As for grounds three and four, the magistrate judge\n\nbasically determined  that these claims had  been \"exhausted\"\n\nin  the  sense  that  petitioner now  would  be  barred  from\n\npursuing any  state remedy.   However,  the magistrate  judge\n\nwent on, petitioner  failed to show cause for this procedural\n\ndefault.  In addition, the  magistrate judge stated that  the\n\nFourth Amendment aspect of  the admissability of petitioner's\n\nconfession was  barred.  See  Stone v. Powell, 428  U.S. 465,\n                                             \n\n494 (1976) (where habeas petitioner had a full opportunity to\n\nlitigate  such a  matter  in state  court,  federal court  is\n\nbarred from considering it in a   2254 petition).\n\n          We agree that petitioner may not pursue grounds one\n\nand  two in  this habeas action.   In addition  to the reason\n\ngiven by  the district court,  it is plain that  these claims\n\nhave been procedurally defaulted.   Petitioner presented both\n\nof these  grounds in a Maine R. Crim.  P. 33 new trial motion\n\nand in a  post-conviction review petition.   In rejecting the\n\nclaims in the  latter proceeding, the  state court held  that\n\nthe  issues  of  the  use   of  perjured  testimony  and  the\n\nwithholding  of evidence from the defense  were barred on the\n\nbasis that \"[r]ather than relitigating [these] grounds in the\n\npresent proceeding, the proper procedure  for contesting [the\n\nRule 33] decision  is through direct appeal to  the Maine Law\n\nCourt.\"  Under  Coleman v. Thompson, 111 S.  Ct. 2546 (1991),\n                                   \n\nif  a \"state court decline[s] to address a prisoner's federal\n\nclaims  because the  prisoner ha[s]  failed to  meet a  state\n\nprocedural  requirement,\" the  prisoner must  show cause  and\n\nprejudice to  be entitled to  federal habeas review.   Id. at\n                                                          \n\n2554, 2565.  Petitioner has not made this showing.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  We also agree with the district court's reliance on Stone\n                                                             \nv. Powell to  dismiss the claim that  petitioner's confession\n         \nwas obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment; petitioner\n\n                             -3-\n\n          In relation to  grounds three and four,  it appears\n\nfrom the State's  Response to the habeas  petition that there\n\nis a  real question  whether  petitioner may  have, in  fact,\n\nsatisfied the exhaustion requirement.  Rather than remand the\n\nmatter, however, we  will assume exhaustion for  the purposes\n\nof disposing  of petitioner's  request for  a certificate  of\n\nprobable cause on the merits.\n\n          1.   Involuntary  Confession.   Petitioner  alleges\n                                      \n\nthat the following events rendered his confession involuntary\n\nand,  hence,  inadmissable.    After  his arrest,  petitioner\n\nstates that he  was interrogated by four  police officers for\n\ntwo hours; one of the officers stood behind him at all times.\n\nAt some point, according to  petitioner, he was informed that\n\nthe  police had  in  their possession  a  statement from  two\n\npersons  implicating  him  in  the  offense.    According  to\n\npetitioner, there only  was a statement from  one individual.\n\nFinally, upon  being promised that  if he confessed  he would\n\nnot  be  prosecuted,  petitioner narrated  a  statement.   He\n\nasserts that  the only reason he  did so was because  of this\n                      \n\npromise.  He further alleges that he was not allowed  to read\n\nover his statement in order to make changes.2  \n\n                    \n\nhas not  alleged the denial  of an opportunity to  raise this\nissue in state court.\n\n2.  Petitioner's assertion that the state  trial court should\nhave held a  hearing on the question of  the voluntariness of\nhis confession  once petitioner  testified that  it was  made\nunder  \"the use  of inducement\"  is  without merit.   In  the\n\n                             -4-\n\n          To determine the question of voluntariness, we must\n\nconsider what effect the totality of the circumstances had on\n\npetitioner's will.   See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,  412 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n218,  226-27 (1973).    In  the context  of  a habeas  corpus\n\npetition, petitioner has the burden of demonstrating that his\n\nwill was overborne  by police tactics and that,  as a result,\n\nhis confession was  the product of a  \"`critically impaired'\"\n\nintellect.  See Jenner v. Smith, 982 F.2d 329, 333 (8th Cir.)\n                               \n\n(citation omitted), cert.  denied, 62  U.S.L.W. 3245  (1993);\n                                 \n\nsee also United States v.  Lawrence, 889 F.2d 1187, 1189 (1st\n                                   \n\nCir. 1989) (a showing that psychological or physical pressure\n\noverrode a  defendant's will required).  A  confession is not\n\ninvoluntary unless the police  overreached by using  coercive\n\ntactics  to   elicit  an   incriminating  statement   from  a\n\ndefendant.  See  Colorado v. Connelly,  479 U.S. 157,  163-64\n                                     \n\n(1986).\n\n          Here, there is nothing to indicate  that petitioner\n\nwas anything  else but of  normal intelligence.  He  does not\n\nassert that  he was  illiterate or uneducated.   Further,  we\n\nassume, because petitioner does not indicate to the contrary,\n\n                    \n\nabsence of a motion to  suppress the statement prior to trial\nor  an objection  to its  admission during trial,  there must\nexist \"alerting circumstances\" before a court has the duty to\nsua  sponte inquire into  the voluntariness of  a confession.\n           \nSee United  States v. Santiago  Soto, 871 F.2d 200,  202 (1st\n                                    \nCir.) (per  curiam), cert. denied,  493 U.S. 831 (1989).   No\n                                 \nsuch circumstances exist  here.  Id. (duty to  hold a hearing\n                                    \nif it appears  defendant is impaired physically  or mentally)\n(citing cases).\n\n                             -5-\n\nthat  he had  been advised  of  his Miranda  rights upon  his\n                                           \n\narrest.  See Miranda  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Thus,\n                                \n\nhe was aware that any statement he made could be used against\n\nhim.  See  Evans v. Dowd, 932  F.2d 739, 742 (8th  Cir.) (per\n                        \n\ncuriam)  (Where Miranda  warnings were  given,  \"it would  be\n                       \n\ndifficult  to conclude that the police coerced the confession\n\nwhile at the  same time warning [defendant] that  he need not\n\nsay anything.\"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 385 (1991).\n                             \n\n          Petitioner's most  serious allegation  is that  the\n\npolice  specifically promised that he would not be prosecuted\n\nif he confessed.   In  Bram v.  United States,  168 U.S.  532\n                                             \n\n(1897), upon  which petitioner relies, the Court  held that a\n\nconfession  is  involuntary   if  it  was  obtained   by  any\n                                                             \n\npromises -- implied or direct, substantial or slight.  Id. at\n                                                          \n\n542-43.   However, Bram \"has not been interpreted as a per se\n                                                             \n\nproscription against any promises made during interrogation.\"\n\nMiller v. Fenton, 796 F.2d  598, 608 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n479 U.S. 989 (1986).  The question is whether the promise, by\n\novercoming  the will  of petitioner, induced  the confession;\n                    \n\nthat is, \"whether,  under the totality of  the circumstances,\n\nthe statement induced the confession, not whether it was,  on\n\nits face, a promise.\"  Id.  at 609 n.10.\n                          \n\n          The  bare  statement  that  petitioner  decided  to\n\nconfess  because of  a police  promise that  he would  not be\n\nprosecuted, standing  alone, does not  satisfy this  inquiry.\n\n                             -6-\n\nWhat  is  missing  are factual  allegations  of  any specific\n\nbehavior or  conversations.   See United  States v.  Santiago\n                                                             \n\nSoto, 871 F.2d 200, 202  (1st Cir.) (per curiam) (no coercion\n    \n\nwhere  allegation   that  defendant  was   afraid  of  postal\n\ninspectors  not supported by  \"a description of  any specific\n\nbehavior\"),  cert. denied,  493 U.S.  831  (1989).   Further,\n                         \n\nthere is no indication in any of  petitioner's pleadings that\n\nhe  was in  a weakened  state  of mind  due to  psychological\n\npressures or that, due to  the length of the questioning, the\n\nuse of  physical punishments,  or the threat  of violence  or\n\nprolonged  incarceration, he was no longer rational.  Compare\n                                                             \n\nDavis  v. North  Carolina, 384 U.S.  737, 745-47,  752 (1966)\n                         \n\n(defendant held for sixteen days under repeated interrogation\n\nwithout   being  told  of  rights;  confession  found  to  be\n\ninvoluntary); Payne  v. Arkansas,  356 U.S.  560, 567  (1958)\n                                \n\n(confession  involuntary  where   defendant  not  advised  of\n\nrights,  held incommunicado for  three days, denied  food for\n\nlong periods of time and threatened with violence).\n\n          We only note  that courts have upheld  as voluntary\n\nconfessions given in circumstances more coercive than alleged\n\nhere.  See, e.g., Stein v. New York, 346 U.S. 156, 185 (1953)\n                                   \n\n(12-hour interrogation stretched out over 32-hour period, not\n\nso \"oppressive as to overwhelm powers of resistance\"); United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v.  Kiendra, 663  F.2d  349, 351-52  (1st  Cir. 1981)\n                   \n\n(confession held voluntary despite fact that defendant,  with\n\n                             -7-\n\na ninth-grade education, held in solitary confinement for one\n\nmonth before confession);  United States v. Parker,  549 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n1217,  1220-21  (9th  Cir.)  (confession  determined   to  be\n\nvoluntary even  though defendant interrogated  for four hours\n\nand despite  existence of dispute  as to whether  agents used\n\npromises of drugs and physical force), cert. denied, 430 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n971 (1977).  See generally Lawrence, 889 F.2d at 1190.\n                                   \n\n          2.     Unconstitutional  In-court   Identification.\n                                                            \n\nAlthough not entirely clear, petitioner apparently bases this\n\nclaim on his assertion that he did not resemble either of the\n\ndescriptions of the  perpetrators given to the  police by the\n\nvictim.  As a result, he asserts, the in-court identification\n\nwas impermissibly  \"tainted.\"   Petitioner goes  on to  argue\n\nthat if the fact of the prior descriptions had been disclosed\n\nto  the defense,  the  \"misidentification\"  never would  have\n\noccurred.\n\n          These  allegations do  not  state a  constitutional\n\nclaim.   This  is not  the case  where a  suggestive pretrial\n\nidentification procedure \"tainted\" an in-court identification\n\nduring trial.  See e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S.  293, 302\n                                         \n\n(1967)  (individual  showup  in   hospital  room).    Rather,\n\npetitioner's  concern appears  to be  evidentiary in  nature.\n\nThat is, he argues that if he had had,  at the time of trial,\n\nthe   information   concerning  the   victim's   description,\n\npetitioner  could have  impeached  the victim's  credibility.\n\n                             -8-\n\nBecause  petitioner  has  procedurally  defaulted  the  claim\n\nconcerning  the  failure  of  the   prosecution  to  disclose\n\nexculpatory   material,  this  claim,   by  itself,   is  not\n\ncognizable  under   2254.  See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188,\n                                              \n\n196-201 (1972).\n\n          The  request for a certificate of probable cause is\n\ndenied.  The motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is\n      \n\nmoot.\n    \n\n                             -9-\n",

Petitioner  Jerry  Larrivee seeks  a\n                     \n\ncertificate of probable cause to  appeal the dismissal of his\n\n28 U.S.C.   2254 habeas petition.  For  the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we deny his request.   Petitioner was convicted, after\n\na jury  trial, of burglary,  robbery, theft of a  firearm and\n\npossession of  a firearm by  a felon.   This  was his  second\n\nconviction;  both  convictions  arose  out  of  robberies  of\n\ntaxicab  drivers.    His conviction  was  affirmed  on direct\n\nappeal.  See State v. Larrivee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Me. 1989).\n                              \n\n          Petitioner's habeas petition  contains four grounds\n\nfor   relief:    (1)   withholding  of  information   by  the\n\nprosecutor;  (2) conviction obtained  by the use  of perjured\n\ntestimony of a witness; (3) conviction obtained by the use of\n\nan   inadmissable  and   involuntary   confession;  and   (4)\n\nconviction   obtained   by   an   unconstitutional   in-court\n\nidentification.  The district court referred the  matter to a\n\nmagistrate judge.   He  rejected grounds one  and two  on the\n\nbasis that they had been disposed of on the merits in a prior\n\nhabeas petition.\n\n          As for grounds three and four, the magistrate judge\n\nbasically determined  that these claims had  been \"exhausted\"\n\nin  the  sense  that  petitioner now  would  be  barred  from\n\npursuing any  state remedy.   However,  the magistrate  judge\n\nwent on, petitioner  failed to show cause for this procedural\n\ndefault.  In addition, the  magistrate judge stated that  the\n\nFourth Amendment aspect of  the admissability of petitioner's\n\nconfession was  barred.  See  Stone v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109540\"><a href=\"/opinion/109540/stone-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n494 (1976) (where habeas petitioner had a full opportunity to\n\nlitigate  such a  matter  in state  court,  federal court  is\n\nbarred from considering it in a   2254 petition).\n\n          We agree that petitioner may not pursue grounds one\n\nand  two in  this habeas action.   In addition  to the reason\n\ngiven by  the district court,  it is plain that  these claims\n\nhave been procedurally defaulted.   Petitioner presented both\n\nof these  grounds in a Maine R. Crim.  P. 33 new trial motion\n\nand in a  post-conviction review petition.   In rejecting the\n\nclaims in the  latter proceeding, the  state court held  that\n\nthe  issues  of  the  use   of  perjured  testimony  and  the\n\nwithholding  of evidence from the defense  were barred on the\n\nbasis that \"[r]ather than relitigating [these] grounds in the\n\npresent proceeding, the proper procedure  for contesting [the\n\nRule 33] decision  is through direct appeal to  the Maine Law\n\nCourt.\"  Under  Coleman v.

We also agree with the district court's reliance on Stone\n                                                             \nv. Powell to  dismiss the claim that  petitioner's confession\n         \nwas obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment; petitioner\n\n                             -3-\n\n          In relation to  grounds three and four,  it appears\n\nfrom the State's  Response to the habeas  petition that there\n\nis a  real question  whether  petitioner may  have, in  fact,\n\nsatisfied the exhaustion requirement.  Rather than remand the\n\nmatter, however, we  will assume exhaustion for  the purposes\n\nof disposing  of petitioner's  request for  a certificate  of\n\nprobable cause on the merits.\n\n          1.   Involuntary  Confession.   Petitioner  alleges\n                                      \n\nthat the following events rendered his confession involuntary\n\nand,  hence,  inadmissable.    After  his arrest,  petitioner\n\nstates that he  was interrogated by four  police officers for\n\ntwo hours; one of the officers stood behind him at all times.\n\nAt some point, according to  petitioner, he was informed that\n\nthe  police had  in  their possession  a  statement from  two\n\npersons  implicating  him  in  the  offense.    According  to\n\npetitioner, there only  was a statement from  one individual.\n\nFinally, upon  being promised that  if he confessed  he would\n\nnot  be  prosecuted,  petitioner narrated  a  statement.   He\n\nasserts that  the only reason he  did so was because  of this\n                      \n\npromise.  He further alleges that he was not allowed  to read\n\nover his statement in order to make changes.2  \n\n                    \n\nhas not  alleged the denial  of an opportunity to  raise this\nissue in state court.\n\n2.  Petitioner's assertion that the state  trial court should\nhave held a  hearing on the question of  the voluntariness of\nhis confession  once petitioner  testified that  it was  made\nunder  \"the use  of inducement\"  is  without merit.   In  the\n\n                             -4-\n\n          To determine the question of voluntariness, we must\n\nconsider what effect the totality of the circumstances had on\n\npetitioner's will.

In  the context  of  a habeas  corpus\n\npetition, petitioner has the burden of demonstrating that his\n\nwill was overborne  by police tactics and that,  as a result,\n\nhis confession was  the product of a  \"`critically impaired'\"\n\nintellect.

This  is not  the case  where a  suggestive pretrial\n\nidentification procedure \"tainted\" an in-court identification\n\nduring trial.  See e.g., Stovall v. Denno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107488\"><a href=\"/opinion/107488/stovall-v-denno/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302\n                                         \n\n(1967)  (individual  showup  in   hospital  room).    Rather,\n\npetitioner's  concern appears  to be  evidentiary in  nature.\n\nThat is, he argues that if he had had,  at the time of trial,\n\nthe   information   concerning  the   victim's   description,\n\npetitioner  could have  impeached  the victim's  credibility.\n\n                             -8-\n\nBecause  petitioner  has  procedurally  defaulted  the  claim\n\nconcerning  the  failure  of  the   prosecution  to  disclose\n\nexculpatory   material,  this  claim,   by  itself,   is  not\n\ncognizable  under   2254.  See Neil v. Biggers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                              \n\n196-201 (1972).\n\n          The  request for a certificate of probable cause is\n\ndenied.  The motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is\n      \n\nmoot.\n    \n\n                             -9-\n</pre>",
