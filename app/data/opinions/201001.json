John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge. In this diversity case, a customer\n\nwho sustained injuries when he ordered his milk cold but received\n\nit hot, brought a civil action against the restauranteur for\n\nnegligence under Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 5141.     In due course, the defendant moved to\n\ndismiss on the ground that the plaintiff had sued too late.    The\n\ndistrict court converted the motion to one for summary judgment,\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), wrote a thoughtful rescript explaining\n\nwhy the limitations period had expired, and granted judgment\n\naccordingly.   Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 283 F. Supp.\n\n2d 450 (D.P.R. 2003).   The plaintiff now appeals.\n\n          We often have stated, and today reaffirm, that when a\n\ntrial court accurately sizes up a case, applies the law faultlessly\n\nto the discerned facts, decides the matter, and articulates a\n\nconvincing rationale for the decision, there is no need for a\n\nreviewing court to wax longiloquent. See, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. P.R.\n\nSun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 2000); Lawton v. State\n\nMut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996); Ayala v.\n\nUnion de Tronquistas, Local 901, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nHolders Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont\n\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).    This\n\ncase fits neatly within that integument.   We therefore affirm the\n\njudgment below for substantially the reasons set forth in the\n\ndistrict court's finely honed opinion.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            There is one aspect of the case, however, that requires\n\nadditional comment.        In this venue, the plaintiff presses an\n\nargument not squarely presented below (and, hence, not addressed by\n\nthe district court).          In order to put this nascent point in\n\ncontext, we briefly rehearse both the legal landscape and the\n\ndistrict court's opinion.\n\n            The parties agree that Puerto Rico law governs in this\n\ndiversity tort action.        See, e.g., Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,\n\n14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994); Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of\n\nSan Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 1993).                   Consequently, the\n\nplaintiff's claim is subject to a one-year limitations period. See\n\n31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5298(2).            Because the \"hot milk\" incident\n\noccurred on February 13, 2001, the limitations period began to run\n\non that date.    Rodriguez-Suris v. Montesinos, 123 F.3d 10, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).   The plaintiff did not commence his action until March\n\n27, 2002.     Thus, as the district court explained, \"unless the\n\nprescription of the cause of action was interrupted, the present\n\ntort action is time-barred.\"          Vargas-Ruiz, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 456.\n\n            Under Puerto Rico law, interruption of the one-year\n\nlimitations period in a personal injury case can occur, inter alia,\n\n\"by   extrajudicial     claim    of   the    creditor   [or]   by    any   act   of\n\nacknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"               31 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n5303.     Once   such    an     interruption     occurs,   it       restarts     the\n\nlimitations clock as of the date of the extrajudicial claim or\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\facknowledgment of debt.          Tokyo Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v. Perez &\n\nCia. de P.R., Inc., 142 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The plaintiff asserted below that a claim letter sent to\n\nthe defendant's adjuster occasioned such an interruption. Although\n\nhe did not proffer the letter itself, the district court noted that\n\nthe adjuster had responded on March 6 and therefore concluded that\n\nthe plaintiff had sent such a missive on or before that date.\n\nVargas-Ruiz, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 456.             Assuming this to be an\n\nextrajudicial claim capable of tolling the limitations period, a\n\nnew one-year period began to run at that time.           See id.   That did\n\nnot cure the temporal problem, however, because this new period\n\nwould have expired no later than March 7, 2002 — yet the plaintiff\n\ndid not commence his action until nearly three weeks after that\n\ndate.\n\n            In the district court, the plaintiff attempted to skirt\n\nthe temporal hazard by contending that the adjuster's              turn-down\n\nletter (dated January 11, 2002) constituted an acknowledgment of\n\ndebt and that this fresh interruption marked the beginning of yet\n\nanother one-year prescriptive period.           The trial court rejected\n\nthat contention, id. at 457, and the plaintiff makes only a half-\n\nhearted effort to convince us that the court erred in so ruling.\n\nWe   do   not   discuss   that   contention,   but,   rather,   endorse   the\n\ndistrict court's rejection of it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             On appeal, the plaintiff recasts his argument and insists\n\nthat he did not have access to the adjuster's file; that if such\n\naccess had been afforded, he might have discovered more weighty\n\nevidence of a fresh interruption; and that, therefore, the lower\n\ncourt erred in rushing to an adverse judgment.\n\n             Because this argument was not squarely presented below,\n\nthe plaintiff has forfeited the right to urge it here.                 Teamsters\n\nUnion, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nWe analyze it, however, to ensure that no plain error exists.                  We\n\ndiscern none.\n\n             Where, as in this case, a party professes an inability to\n\nrespond     to   a    summary   judgment      motion   because   of   incomplete\n\ndiscovery, his recourse is by way of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).1                That\n\nrule \"describes a method of buying time for a party who, when\n\nconfronted       by   a   summary   judgment    motion,   can    demonstrate   an\n\n\n\n     1\n         The rule reads:\n\n             Should it appear from the affidavits of a\n             party opposing the motion [for summary\n             judgment] that the party cannot for reasons\n             stated present by affidavit facts essential to\n             justify the party's opposition, the court may\n             refuse the application for judgment or may\n             order a continuance to permit affidavits to be\n             obtained or depositions to be taken or\n             discovery to be had or may make such other\n             order as is just.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fauthentic need for, and an entitlement to, an additional interval\n\nin which to marshal facts essential to mount an opposition.\"\n\nResolution Trust Corp. v. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198,\n\n1203 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          Here, however, the plaintiff did not invoke Rule 56(f)\n\nbefore the district court.2   By the same token, he filed no motion\n\nto defer the decision, prepared no affidavit delineating either the\n\netiology or the dimensions of his inability to proceed, and offered\n\nthe district court no coherent explanation of why he needed extra\n\ntime or what fruits he anticipated that extra time might yield.\n\n          While we do not insist on slavish compliance with the\n\nimperatives of Rule 56(f) in order to obtain its benefits, see\n\nPaterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d\n\n985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988); Taylor v. Gallagher, 737 F.2d 134, 137\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      At oral argument in this court, the plaintiff attempted to\nexplain his failure by insinuating that he was taken unawares when\nthe district court converted the defendant's motion to dismiss to\na motion for summary judgment.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)\n(providing that if, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \"matters outside the\npleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the\nmotion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of\nas provided in Rule 56\"). We find that suggestion disingenuous.\nAfter all, it was the plaintiff who, in opposing the defendant's\ndispositive motion, made a documentary proffer, consisting, inter\nalia,   of   the   turn-down   letter   and   other   miscellaneous\ncorrespondence between the plaintiff's lawyer and the adjuster. In\ntaking that tack, the plaintiff invited the conversion — and he\ncannot credibly claim to have been surprised when the court\naccepted his invitation. Gurary v. Winehouse, 190 F.3d 37, 43 (2d\nCir. 1999); Collier v. City of Chicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 603 (1st\nCir. 1998).\n\n                                -6-\n\f(1st Cir. 1984), we do insist upon substantial compliance.    As we\n\nexplained in Paterson-Leitch:\n\n            [A party] departs from the plain language of\n            [Rule 56(f)] at his peril. When a departure\n            occurs, the alternative proffer must simulate\n            the rule in important ways. It should be made\n            in written form and in a timely manner . . . .\n            The statement must be made, if not by\n            affidavit, then in some authoritative manner —\n            say, by the party under penalty of perjury or\n            by written representations of counsel subject\n            to the strictures of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 — and\n            filed with the court.    Then, too, it should\n            articulate some plausible basis for the\n            party's belief that specified \"discoverable\"\n            material facts likely exist which have not yet\n            come in from the cold.     There must also be\n            shown some realistic prospect that the facts\n            can   be   obtained    within   a   reasonable\n            (additional) time, and will, if obtained,\n            suffice to engender an issue both genuine and\n            material. Last, the litigant must demonstrate\n            good cause for failure to have conducted the\n            discovery earlier.\n\n840 F.2d at 988.\n\n            The plaintiff argues, in effect, that he substantially\n\ncomplied with the requirements of Rule 56(f).    That argument rings\n\nhollow.     He mentioned the absence of the adjuster's file to the\n\ndistrict court only in the most oblique terms and his proffers\n\nfailed in several important ways to simulate what Rule 56(f)\n\nrequires.     We first describe those references and then describe\n\ntheir shortcomings.\n\n            The defendant's dispositive motion was filed on December\n\n30, 2002.     In an opposition to it, filed on March 18, 2003, the\n\nplaintiff stated that he had written \"a letter requesting the\n\n                                 -7-\n\f[adjuster's] file\" and had made follow-up telephone calls \"without\n\nany results.\"       If obtained, he predicted that the file would show\n\n\"that plaintiff made a timely claim to defendant.\"             To be sure, the\n\nplaintiff at one point suggested that, in his view, \"the instant\n\ncase should not be dismissed until [the adjuster's] file . . . is\n\nproduced.\"     But he then undercut this observation by asking the\n\ncourt   to   deny    the   motion   outright   instead    of    delaying   its\n\nadjudication. In all events, the reference quoted above was buried\n\nin the body of a memorandum, devoted mostly to other matters.              Its\n\nperipheral nature is emphasized by the fact that the defendant's\n\nrebuttal memorandum, filed on April 25, 2003, did not even mention\n\nthe adjuster's file.\n\n             On May 1, 2003, the plaintiff served a sur-reply.             In a\n\nfootnote, he mentioned that, on the same date, he had made a\n\nrequest for     production    of    the   adjuster's   file.     Once   again,\n\nhowever, he did not ask the court to delay adjudication of the\n\ndispositive motion. To the contrary, he continued to press for its\n\ndenial.\n\n             The plaintiff's proffers to the district court bear no\n\nreal resemblance to what Rule 56(f) requires.                  To begin, the\n\nplaintiff's first allusion to the adjuster's file was not made\n\npromptly upon service of the defendant's dispositive motion, but,\n\nrather, almost three months later.           A party seeking relief under\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fRule 56(f) must act celeritously to inform the trial court of his\n\npredicament.   See N. Bridge Assocs., 22 F.3d at 1203-05.\n\n          For another thing, a petitioning party must offer the\n\ntrial court more than optimistic surmise.   He must give the court\n\nreason to believe that undiscovered facts exist and that those\n\nfacts, if obtained, would help defeat the pending motion.    See id.\n\nat 1203, 1206-08.   The plaintiff did neither of these things.    In\n\nhis opposition to the dispositive motion, he indicated only that\n\nthe adjuster's file contained evidence that he had \"made a timely\n\nclaim to defendant.\" Fairly read, this allusion seems to emphasize\n\nthe initial claim letter; and the plaintiff's proffers, taken as a\n\nwhole, contained nothing sufficient to inculcate a plausible belief\n\nthat the adjuster's file held something, apart from the claim\n\nletter, that might serve to restart the limitations clock.     As to\n\nthe claim letter itself, the district court gave the appellant its\n\nfull benefit and, thus, the formality of producing the physical\n\nletter could not conceivably have affected the resolution of the\n\nmatter.\n\n          Last — but far from least — a party seeking to postpone\n\nthe adjudication of a summary judgment motion on the ground of\n\nincomplete discovery must explain why, in the exercise of due\n\ndiligence, he has been unable to obtain the necessary information.\n\nSee N. Bridge Assocs., 22 F.3d at 1203, 1205-06.     The plaintiff\n\nshirked this obligation with respect to the adjuster's file.     The\n\n\n                                -9-\n\ftimeliness issue had been in the case since the defendant first\n\nanswered the complaint, asserting a statute of limitations defense.\n\nThe action had been pending for nine months when the defendant made\n\nits dispositive motion and for over fifteen months when the lower\n\ncourt ruled on that motion.      The plaintiff had available to him a\n\nfull complement of discovery devices.         Yet he apparently chose not\n\nto use these devices in a timely fashion and he made no effort to\n\nenlighten the district court as to why he had not undertaken the\n\nnecessary discovery with reasonable dispatch.           This lassitude is\n\nfatal to his argument on appeal.     See Herbert v. Wicklund, 744 F.2d\n\n218, 222   (1st   Cir.   1984)   (\"Although    a   district   court   should\n\ngenerally apply Rule 56(f) liberally, the court need not employ the\n\nrule to spare litigants from their own lack of diligence.\").\n\n           To sum up, when the defendant sought brevis disposition,\n\nthe plaintiff flouted both the letter and the spirit of Rule 56(f).\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, he asked the district court to rule\n\nthen and there on the dispositive motion.          The court followed his\n\nurging and decided the pending motion on the record before it.          The\n\nplaintiff's disappointment with that ruling is understandable, but\n\nthere is no principled way that we can turn back the clock and give\n\nhim a further opportunity to reconfigure the record.\n\n           We need go no further.         Having scoured the briefs,\n\nentertained oral argument, and carefully canvassed the record, we,\n\nlike the district court, find no significantly probative evidence\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fsufficient to create a genuine dispute as to any material fact.\n\nThe defendant   was,   as   the   district   court   ruled,   entitled   to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

When a departure occurs, the alternative proffer must simulate the rule in important ways. It should be made in written form and in a timely manner.... The statement must be made, if not by affidavit, then in some authoritative manner &#8212; say, by the party under penalty of perjury or by written representations of counsel subject to the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 &#8212; and filed with the court. Then, too, it should articulate some plausible basis for the party's belief that specified \"discoverable\" material facts likely exist which have not yet come in from the cold. There must also be shown some realistic prospect that the facts can be obtained within a reasonable (additional) time, and will, if obtained, suffice to engender an issue both genuine and material. Last, the litigant must demonstrate good cause for failure to have conducted the discovery earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">840 F.2d at 988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues, in effect, that he substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 56(f). That argument rings hollow. He mentioned the absence of the adjuster's file to the district court only in the most oblique terms and his proffers failed in several important ways to simulate what Rule 56(f) requires. We first describe those references and then describe their shortcomings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's dispositive motion was filed on December 30, 2002. In an opposition to it, filed on March 18, 2003, the plaintiff stated that he had written \"a letter requesting the [adjuster's] file\" and had made follow-up telephone calls \"without any results.\" If obtained, he predicted that the file would show \"that plaintiff made a timely claim to defendant.\" To be sure, the plaintiff at one point suggested that, in his view, \"the instant case should not be dismissed until [the adjuster's] file ... is produced.\" But he then undercut this observation by asking the court to deny the motion outright instead of delaying its adjudication. In all events, the reference quoted above was buried in the body of a memorandum, devoted mostly to other matters. Its peripheral nature is emphasized by the fact that the defendant's rebuttal memorandum, filed on April 25, 2003, did not even mention the adjuster's file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2003, the plaintiff served a sur-reply. In a footnote, he mentioned that, on the same date, he had made a request for production of the adjuster's file. Once again, however, he did not ask the court to delay adjudication of the dispositive motion. To the contrary, he continued to press for its denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's proffers to the district court bear no real resemblance to what Rule 56(f) requires. To begin, the plaintiff's first allusion to the adjuster's file was not made promptly upon service of the defendant's dispositive motion, but, rather, almost three months later. A party seeking relief under Rule 56(f) must act celeritously to inform the trial court of his predicament. <i>See N. Bridge Assocs.,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203-05.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, a petitioning party must offer the trial court more than optimistic surmise. He must give the court reason to believe that undiscovered facts exist and that those facts, if obtained, would help defeat the pending motion. <i>See id.</i> at 1203, 1206-08. The plaintiff did neither of these things. In his opposition to the dispositive motion, he indicated only that the adjuster's file contained evidence that he had \"made a timely claim to defendant.\" Fairly read, this allusion seems to emphasize the initial claim letter; and the plaintiff's proffers, taken as a whole, contained nothing sufficient to inculcate a plausible belief that the adjuster's file held something, apart from the claim letter, that might serve to restart the limitations clock. As to the claim letter itself, the district court gave the appellant its full benefit and, thus, the formality of producing the physical letter could not conceivably have affected the resolution of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; a party seeking to postpone the adjudication of a summary judgment motion on the ground of incomplete discovery must explain why, in the exercise of due diligence, he has been unable to obtain the necessary information. <i>See N. Bridge Assocs.,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203, 1205-06. The plaintiff shirked this obligation with respect to the adjuster's file. The timeliness issue had been in the case since the defendant first answered the complaint, asserting a statute of limitations defense. The action had been pending for nine months when the defendant made its dispositive motion and for over fifteen months when the lower court ruled on that motion. The plaintiff had available to him a full complement of discovery devices. Yet he apparently chose not to use these devices in a timely fashion and he made no effort to enlighten the district court as to why he had not undertaken the necessary discovery with reasonable dispatch. This lassitude is fatal to his argument on appeal. <i>See Hebert v. Wicklund,</i> 744 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1984) (\"Although a district court should generally apply Rule 56(f) liberally, the court need not employ the rule to spare litigants from their own lack of diligence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, when the defendant sought brevis disposition, the plaintiff flouted both the letter and the spirit of Rule 56(f). To make a bad situation worse, he asked the district court to rule then and there on the dispositive motion. The court followed his urging and decided the pending motion on the record before it. The plaintiff's disappointment with that ruling is understandable, but there is no principled way that we can turn back the clock and give him a further opportunity to reconfigure the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Having scoured the briefs, entertained oral argument, and carefully canvassed the record, we, like the district court, find no significantly probative evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to any material fact. The defendant was, as the district court ruled, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

We find that suggestion disingenuous. After all, it was the plaintiff who, in opposing the defendant's dispositive motion, made a documentary proffer, consisting, inter alia, of the turn-down letter and other miscellaneous correspondence between the plaintiff's lawyer and the adjuster. In taking that tack, the plaintiff invited the conversion &#8212; and he cannot credibly claim to have been surprised when the court accepted his invitation. <i>Gurary v.

When a departure occurs, the alternative proffer must simulate the rule in important ways. It should be made in written form and in a timely manner.... The statement must be made, if not by affidavit, then in some authoritative manner &#8212; say, by the party under penalty of perjury or by written representations of counsel subject to the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 &#8212; and filed with the court. Then, too, it should articulate some plausible basis for the party's belief that specified \"discoverable\" material facts likely exist which have not yet come in from the cold. There must also be shown some realistic prospect that the facts can be obtained within a reasonable (additional) time, and will, if obtained, suffice to engender an issue both genuine and material. Last, the litigant must demonstrate good cause for failure to have conducted the discovery earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">840 F.2d at 988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff argues, in effect, that he substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 56(f). That argument rings hollow. He mentioned the absence of the adjuster's file to the district court only in the most oblique terms and his proffers failed in several important ways to simulate what Rule 56(f) requires. We first describe those references and then describe their shortcomings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's dispositive motion was filed on December 30, 2002. In an opposition to it, filed on March 18, 2003, the plaintiff stated that he had written \"a letter requesting the [adjuster's] file\" and had made follow-up telephone calls \"without any results.\" If obtained, he predicted that the file would show \"that plaintiff made a timely claim to defendant.\" To be sure, the plaintiff at one point suggested that, in his view, \"the instant case should not be dismissed until [the adjuster's] file ... is produced.\" But he then undercut this observation by asking the court to deny the motion outright instead of delaying its adjudication. In all events, the reference quoted above was buried in the body of a memorandum, devoted mostly to other matters. Its peripheral nature is emphasized by the fact that the defendant's rebuttal memorandum, filed on April 25, 2003, did not even mention the adjuster's file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2003, the plaintiff served a sur-reply. In a footnote, he mentioned that, on the same date, he had made a request for production of the adjuster's file. Once again, however, he did not ask the court to delay adjudication of the dispositive motion. To the contrary, he continued to press for its denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's proffers to the district court bear no real resemblance to what Rule 56(f) requires. To begin, the plaintiff's first allusion to the adjuster's file was not made promptly upon service of the defendant's dispositive motion, but, rather, almost three months later. A party seeking relief under Rule 56(f) must act celeritously to inform the trial court of his predicament. <i>See N. Bridge Assocs.,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203-05.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, a petitioning party must offer the trial court more than optimistic surmise. He must give the court reason to believe that undiscovered facts exist and that those facts, if obtained, would help defeat the pending motion. <i>See id.</i> at 1203, 1206-08. The plaintiff did neither of these things. In his opposition to the dispositive motion, he indicated only that the adjuster's file contained evidence that he had \"made a timely claim to defendant.\" Fairly read, this allusion seems to emphasize the initial claim letter; and the plaintiff's proffers, taken as a whole, contained nothing sufficient to inculcate a plausible belief that the adjuster's file held something, apart from the claim letter, that might serve to restart the limitations clock. As to the claim letter itself, the district court gave the appellant its full benefit and, thus, the formality of producing the physical letter could not conceivably have affected the resolution of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; a party seeking to postpone the adjudication of a summary judgment motion on the ground of incomplete discovery must explain why, in the exercise of due diligence, he has been unable to obtain the necessary information. <i>See N. Bridge Assocs.,</i> 22 F.3d at 1203, 1205-06. The plaintiff shirked this obligation with respect to the adjuster's file. The timeliness issue had been in the case since the defendant first answered the complaint, asserting a statute of limitations defense. The action had been pending for nine months when the defendant made its dispositive motion and for over fifteen months when the lower court ruled on that motion. The plaintiff had available to him a full complement of discovery devices. Yet he apparently chose not to use these devices in a timely fashion and he made no effort to enlighten the district court as to why he had not undertaken the necessary discovery with reasonable dispatch. This lassitude is fatal to his argument on appeal. <i>See Hebert v. Wicklund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"441974\"><a href=\"/opinion/441974/linda-l-hebert-v-cordelia-wicklund-dba-lake-farm/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1984) (\"Although a district court should generally apply Rule 56(f) liberally, the court need not employ the rule to spare litigants from their own lack of diligence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, when the defendant sought brevis disposition, the plaintiff flouted both the letter and the spirit of Rule 56(f). To make a bad situation worse, he asked the district court to rule then and there on the dispositive motion. The court followed his urging and decided the pending motion on the record before it. The plaintiff's disappointment with that ruling is understandable, but there is no principled way that we can turn back the clock and give him a further opportunity to reconfigure the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Having scoured the briefs, entertained oral argument, and carefully canvassed the record, we, like the district court, find no significantly probative evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to any material fact. The defendant was, as the district court ruled, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

We find that suggestion disingenuous. After all, it was the plaintiff who, in opposing the defendant's dispositive motion, made a documentary proffer, consisting, inter alia, of the turn-down letter and other miscellaneous correspondence between the plaintiff's lawyer and the adjuster. In taking that tack, the plaintiff invited the conversion &#8212; and he cannot credibly claim to have been surprised when the court accepted his invitation. <i>Gurary v.
