Fick, Federal Defender Office, with whom Page\nKelley was on brief, for appellant.\n     B. Stephanie Siegmann, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        November 17, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge. The appellant in this case is the\n\nchief executive officer and president of a corporation.              Both\n\nappellant and the corporation are under investigation by a grand\n\njury.    To preserve the secrecy of the investigation, we shall\n\ndiscuss the relevant facts at a high degree of generality and omit\n\nmention of details, procedural and otherwise, that are not relevant\n\nto our disposition.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\n           Appellant,   an   individual   represented   by   the   Federal\n\nDefender's Office, challenges district court orders (1) compelling\n\nan attorney who represented the corporation (which is no longer in\n\ngood standing, but which has not formally been dissolved) to answer\n\nbefore the grand jury a number of questions about a conversation\n\nbetween counsel and appellant in his corporate capacity, and (2)\n\ndenying his motion to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n24(a) to assert the corporation's attorney-client privilege.          The\n\ndistrict court's orders are grounded on a finding that appellant,\n\nin his corporate capacity, waived the corporation's privilege to\n\nbar counsel from answering the questions when he recounted aspects\n\nof the conversation in extrajudicial statements made in the news\n\nmedia.   Although appellant does not know the specific questions\n\nthat the district court has ordered counsel to answer, he brings\n\nthis appeal to argue that the court erred insofar as it might have\n\ndirected counsel to provide details about the conversation beyond\n\nthose disclosed in the media interviews.      See In re Keeper of the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fRecords (XYZ Corp.), 348 F.3d 16, 23-26 (1st Cir. 2003) (discussing\n\nwhether and to what extent waivers of the attorney-client privilege\n\nshould be inferred from extrajudicial disclosures about privileged\n\nattorney-client communications).\n\n           We start with appellant's intervention argument, the\n\nsuccess of which is a prerequisite to our reaching the merits of\n\nthe privilege claim.       Appellant says that the district court\n\nmistakenly failed to appreciate that, in seeking to assert the\n\ncorporation's privilege, he met the requirements of Rule 24(a),\n\nwhich requires that \"the applicant claim[] an interest relating to\n\nthe property or transaction which is the subject of the action,\"\n\nand that \"the applicant [be] so situated that the disposition of\n\nthe action may as a practical matter impair or impede [his] ability\n\nto protect that interest, unless [his] interest is adequately\n\nrepresented by existing parties.\"         The argument has superficial\n\nappeal   for,   as   appellant   points   out,   a   corporation's   chief\n\nexecutive officer and president generally is empowered to invoke\n\nthe privilege on the corporation's behalf, see Paul R. Rice,\n\nAttorney-Client Privilege in the United States, ยง 4.20 (2d ed.\n\n1999), and \"[c]olorable claims of attorney-client privilege qualify\n\nas sufficient interests to ground intervention as of right,\" In re\n\nGrand Jury Subpoena (Newparent, Inc.), 274 F.3d 563, 570 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   But there is a fatal problem, overlooked by the parties,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwith the capacity in which appellant has sought to assert the\n\ncorporation's privilege.\n\n           Appellant has sought to intervene in this action solely\n\nin his individual capacity.         As set forth above, appellant is\n\nhimself   under    investigation    by    the   grand    jury,   and   he   is\n\nrepresented in this matter by the Federal Defender's Office, which\n\nmust represent appellant's interests, not those of the corporation,\n\nand which, in any event, lacks the authority to represent corporate\n\ndefendants because it is a creature of the Criminal Justice Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 3006A.    See United States v. Hartsell, 127 F.3d 343, 350\n\n(4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Unimex, Inc., 991 F.2d 546, 550\n\n(9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Rivera,        912 F. Supp. 634, 637-38\n\n(D. P.R. 1996).     And, quite clearly, appellant, in his personal\n\ncapacity, lacks standing to assert the corporation's interest.\n\nSee, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 144 F.3d 653, 658 (10th Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 119 F.3d 210, 215\n\n(2d Cir. 1997) (collecting cases).\n\n           To require appellant to assert the privilege in his\n\ncorporate capacity is not to engage in empty formalism, for to\n\npermit an individual corporate officer -- even an individual with\n\nauthority to act on behalf of the corporation -- to assert the\n\ncorporation's interests in his personal capacity would be to invite\n\nan   intolerable   conflict   of   interests.      The   interests     of   the\n\ncorporation and the interests of the individual corporate officer\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\ffrequently diverge where, as here, both are under investigation.\n\nIn such situations, it might well behoove the corporation to waive\n\nthe privilege, even though the waiver may damage the individual\n\nofficer.   See generally In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Newparent,\n\nInc.), 274 F.3d at 573.    Also, under the circumstances of this\n\ncase, where appellant's counsel is authorized only to represent\n\nappellant in his personal capacity, permitting appellant to assert\n\nthe corporation's privilege in his personal capacity would give\n\nrise to a situation in which the corporation's interests are not\n\nrepresented by authorized counsel.   This is impermissible.    Cf.\n\nRowland v. Cal. Men's Colony, 506 U.S. 194, 201-03 (1993) (\"It has\n\nbeen the law for the better part of two centuries . . . that a\n\ncorporation may appear in the federal courts only through licensed\n\ncounsel.\").\n\n           One final point is worth mentioning.   If appellant had\n\nmade a colorable claim of entitlement to assert privilege because\n\ncounsel also represented appellant in his personal capacity in\n\nconnection with the conversation in question, the district court\n\nwould have been obliged to grant intervention.    See In re Grand\n\nJury Subpoena (Newparent, Inc.), 274 F.3d at 570.    But appellant\n\nhas made no such claim. Notwithstanding a few bald assertions made\n\nin his filings, below and on appeal, that counsel also represented\n\nappellant in his personal capacity, appellant never developed an\n\nargument before the district court that he should be entitled to\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fintervene to assert his own privilege.       To the contrary, in the\n\nseveral hearings at which the district court permitted appellant's\n\ncounsel to appear and argue, the intervention issue consistently\n\nwas framed in terms of whether appellant could intervene to assert\n\nthe corporation's privilege.      Moreover, in his appellate brief,\n\nappellant has neither developed any argument that the district\n\ncourt misapprehended the ground on which he sought intervention nor\n\nargued that he could make the demanding showing required for the\n\ngrant of a motion to quash in his personal capacity.       See In re\n\nGrand Jury Subpoena (Newparent, Inc.), 274 F.3d at 571-72.        We\n\ntherefore lack any basis for disturbing the district court's denial\n\nof appellant's motion to intervene.     See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

This is impermissible. <i>Cf. Rowland v. Cal. Men's Colony,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112802\"><a href=\"/opinion/112802/rowland-v-california-mens-colony-unit-ii-mens-advisory-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 201-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112802\"><a href=\"/opinion/112802/rowland-v-california-mens-colony-unit-ii-mens-advisory-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If appellant had made a colorable claim of entitlement to assert privilege because counsel also represented appellant in his personal capacity in connection with the conversation in question, the district court would have been obliged to grant intervention. <i>See In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Newparent, Inc.),</i> 274 F.3d at 570. But appellant has made no such claim. Notwithstanding a few bald assertions made in his filings, below and on appeal, that counsel also represented appellant in his personal capacity, appellant never developed an argument before the district court that he should be entitled to intervene to assert his own privilege. To the contrary, in the several hearings at which the district court permitted appellant's counsel to appear and argue, the intervention issue consistently was framed in terms of whether appellant could intervene to assert the <i>corporation's</i> privilege. Moreover, in his appellate brief, appellant has neither developed any argument that the district court misapprehended the ground on which he sought intervention nor argued that he could make the demanding showing required for the grant of a motion to quash in his personal capacity. <i>See In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Newparent, Inc.),</i> 274 F.3d at 571-72. We therefore lack any basis for disturbing the district court's denial of appellant's motion to intervene. <i>See United States v.
