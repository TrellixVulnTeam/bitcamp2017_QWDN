Prior to April 1, 1997, non-criminal aliens\n\nfacing deportation were entitled to seek discretionary relief under\n\na regime known as \"suspension of deportation\" if, inter alia, they\n\nhad accumulated seven years of continuous presence in the United\n\nStates.    See Immigration and Nationality Act            § 244, 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1254   (repealed    April      1,   1997).   The    Immigration    Reform     and\n\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110\n\nStat. 3009, 3546 (IIRIRA), which went into effect on April 1, 1997,\n\neliminated this entitlement and replaced it with a stricter regime,\n\ntitled \"cancellation of removal,\" which is available only to aliens\n\nwho have been continuously present in the United States for ten\n\nyears.    The IIRIRA specified that only aliens who had been placed\n\n\"in deportation proceedings\" prior to April 1, 1997, remained\n\neligible to apply for suspension of deportation.                  See IIRIRA §\n\n309(c)(1).\n\n            Petitioners are illegal aliens who, due to the length of\n\ntheir continuous residency within the United States, would have\n\nbeen entitled      to   seek    suspension   of    deportation    but   are   not\n\nentitled to request cancellation of removal.            In early March 1997,\n\nthey presented themselves to an Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService office after their attorney (allegedly) was told that, if\n\nthey did so, prior to April 1, 1997, they would be placed in\n\ndeportation proceedings -- meaning that papers charging them with\n\ndeportability (to use the old parlance) or removability would be\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffiled with the Immigration Court, see Costa v. INS, 233 F.3d 31,\n\n34-37 (1st Cir. 2000) (defining what it means to be \"in deportation\n\nproceedings\" within the meaning of the IIRIRA).                   Notwithstanding\n\nthis alleged promise, the INS did not file the relevant charging\n\npapers until after April 1.           Subsequently, and over petitioners'\n\nobjections,   an    immigration       judge    found    them      ineligible       for\n\ndiscretionary relief from deportation/removal and ordered them to\n\ndepart the country by a date certain.                The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals dismissed petitioners' appeal from this order. Petitioners\n\nseek relief from the BIA's ruling.\n\n            We are foreclosed by circuit precedent from granting\n\npetitioners   the   relief     they    seek.     The    Costa     panel     held   on\n\nindistinguishable facts that an alien in petitioners' situation was\n\nnot entitled to seek suspension of deportation.                   See id.    To the\n\nextent that petitioners seek to avoid the effect of Costa by\n\ninvoking the doctrines of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling,\n\ntheir efforts fail.       Assuming arguendo the potential availability\n\nof these doctrines against the government, petitioners have failed\n\nto show the reasonable reliance essential to an estoppel claim, see\n\nid. at 38 & n.7 (observing that reasonable reliance cannot be shown\n\nwhere petitioners have no right to \"call the tune as to when the\n\nINS would commence deportation proceedings\" and because the hope of\n\nobtaining   discretionary      relief    in    the    form   of    suspension      of\n\ndeportation   is    not   a   \"right\"    which   the    government        might    be\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fequitably estopped from infringing).
