Pro se appellant Gordon Reid appeals a\n\n  district court decision which granted judgment as a matter of\n\n  to appellee Simmons on Reid’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for the\n\n  failure to disclose exculpatory impeachment evidence.        We have\n\n  thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties' briefs on\n\n  appeal.   While we are not in complete agreement with the\n\n  district court's thoughtful opinion, we agree that the evidence\n\n  was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that Simmons\n\n  failed to disclose the evidence in issue either deliberately or\n\n  with reckless indifference to Reid’s constitutional rights.1\n\n  Accordingly,   appellant's   motion   to   correct   the   record   is\n\n  denied, and the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n  See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         We reject Reid's contention that Simmons is procedurally\nbarred from obtaining judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) because he\nfailed to renew his motion for JMOL after resting.
