George Z. Singal,* U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Steven A. Swan on brief pro se.\n     Richard B. Myrus, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert Clark\nCorrente, United States Attorney, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            March 11, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per   Curiam.    Steven    Swan   appeals   pro   se   from   the\n\ndismissal of litigation growing out of his conviction for federal\n\ntax violations.    He has previously filed two Bivens actions for\n\ndamages and injunctive relief, claiming that judges, prosecutors\n\nand others violated his civil rights in obtaining the conviction.\n\nThese having failed, he filed the present suit for damages and\n\ninjunctive relief under RICO, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, alleging\n\nwrongdoing by judges, prosecutors and others in relation to his\n\nconviction and also in connection with his latest Bivens actions.\n\n          A magistrate judge screened the complaint and found it\n\nfrivolous.    28 U.S.C. § 1915A.    He ruled that most of the claims\n\nwere barred under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), because\n\nthey rested on the supposed invalidity of Swan's conviction, and in\n\nany event the claims were patently frivolous.         The district court\n\nupheld the magistrate judge's recommendation, and Swan now has\n\nappealed to this court.   He also has filed several motions.\n\n          His principal motion seeks the recusal of all First\n\nCircuit judges and the transfer of the appeal to another circuit.\n\nThe recusal and transfer claims are based on the fact that the\n\nnamed defendants include the district court judge and three judges\n\nof this court who were involved in earlier phases of Swan's\n\nlitigation.   No member of the present panel is a named defendant.\n\n          Under the recusal standard, we ask whether a fully\n\ninformed, rational observer would have reason to question a judge's\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fimpartiality.     In re United States, 441 F.3d 44, 56-57 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   If Swan had any colorable claim, we would consider whether\n\njudges from another circuit should hear the present appeal.                But\n\nthe patently frivolous claims presented leave no room for any\n\nrational   person   to   imagine   that    any   bias   could   underlie    an\n\naffirmance.     There is, in addition, a countervailing concern \"to\n\nprevent parties from too easily obtaining the disqualification of\n\na judge, thereby potentially manipulating the system for strategic\n\nreasons . . . .\"    In re Allied-Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 970 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n           In this instance, a judgment in Swan's favor would impugn\n\nthe validity of his conviction, which is clearly impermissible\n\nunder Heck.      E.g., Moore v. Guesno, 485 F. Supp. 2d 300, 308\n\n(W.D.N.Y.,    2007).      Heck's   bar      cannot   be     circumvented   by\n\nsubstituting a supposed RICO action for the earlier Bivens claims\n\nineffectually designed for the same purpose.              As it happens, the\n\nRICO claim itself is not properly pleaded, but given Heck, there is\n\nno reason to describe the substantive defects.\n\n           Swan's pending motion to file a late reply brief is\n\ngranted, but the motion to transfer the case is denied and the\n\nappeal is dismissed as frivolous.         28 U.S.C. § 1915.     The motion to\n\nrecuse is denied with respect to the present panel and is dismissed\n\nas moot as to the circuit judges who are not on this panel but were\n\nnamed by Swan as defendants.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                    -4-\n\f",
