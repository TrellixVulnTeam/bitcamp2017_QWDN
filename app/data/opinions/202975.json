Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Rafael A.

Plaintiff-appellant Ana I. Rivera-Olmo appeals\n\nthe dismissal of her action against her now former employer,\n\ndefendant-appellee Puerto Rico’s State Insurance Fund Corporation\n\n(“SIFC”).    Rivera-Olmo alleged violations of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 (2006); Law 44\n\nof July 2, 1985, as amended, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, §§ 501 et seq.\n\n(Puerto Rico’s Law on Discrimination Against People with Physical\n\nand/or Mental Disabilities); and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico\n\nCivil   Code,   P.R.    Laws   Ann.   tit.    31,   §   5141   (a   claim   for\n\nnegligence).\n\n            The district court dismissed her claims with prejudice,\n\nfinding that they were barred by a settlement agreement that\n\nresolved a previous suit brought by Rivera-Olmo against SIFC. The\n\ncourt also dismissed with prejudice the claims for enforcement of\n\nthe settlement agreement for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nRivera-Olmo now appeals.       We affirm.\n\n            The allegations of the complaint concern a settlement\n\nagreement between SIFC and Rivera-Olmo resulting from a suit that\n\nRivera-Olmo filed in 1999 for violations of the ADA, Law 44, and\n\nArticle 1802.    The parties entered negotiations to settle shortly\n\nbefore trial in November 2001.              A dispute arose about whether\n\nRivera-Olmo had agreed to the settlement, and the district court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing on that question in February 2002. The\n\ncourt determined that Rivera-Olmo was bound by the agreement and\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdismissed the complaint with prejudice in April 2002.\n\n            Rivera-Olmo filed the instant complaint in July 2005,\n\nclaiming that SIFC had failed to adhere to the terms of the\n\nsettlement agreement in numerous ways, and that these failures\n\nconstituted violations of the ADA, Law 44, and Article 1802.\n\nRivera-Olmo also alleged additional or ongoing violations of the\n\nADA   and   Law    44,    based   on   conduct    by   SIFC   and   Rivera-Olmo’s\n\nsupervisors that occurred after the settlement agreement.\n\n            Until the filing of the second case, the parties had not\n\nacted to carry out the obligations of the settlement agreement,\n\nwhich   provided         for    Rivera-Olmo      to    be   evaluated   for   her\n\nqualification to perform the duties of certain positions.                 Rivera-\n\nOlmo was also to receive a payment of $35,000, and was to receive\n\na second payment of $25,000 if SIFC ultimately determined that\n\nthere   were      no   open    positions   suitable     for   Rivera-Olmo.     In\n\nSeptember 2005, SIFC made the first payment of $35,000.                       On\n\nFebruary 26, 2006, the final report evaluating Rivera-Olmo was\n\ncompleted by the Human Resources Department. On July 18, 2006,\n\nRivera-Olmo was given a dismissal letter, and on August 7, 2006, a\n\ncheck for $25,000 was issued, as called for by the settlement\n\nagreement.     Thus as of that date (a little more than a year after\n\nthe filing of the second complaint) the settlement agreement had\n\nbeen fully performed.\n\n            We review the district court’s granting of the motion to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdismiss de novo.   Rodríguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc., 490 F.3d\n\n92, 95 (1st Cir. 2007).    We do not address Rivera-Olmo’s request\n\nfor enforcement of the settlement agreement as the terms of the\n\nagreement have now been carried out.\n\n          Rivera-Olmo does not dispute that she is bound by the\n\nsettlement agreement.   In the agreement, Rivera-Olmo released “all\n\nclaims, demands, agreements, obligations and causes of action . .\n\n. arising out of or in any way connected with any transactions,\n\noccurrences, acts or omissions set forth or facts alleged in\n\npleadings on file in” her 1999 lawsuit.        All of the causes of\n\naction listed in the 2005 complaint are somehow “connected with”\n\nthe allegations raised in the 1999 complaint.     The 2005 complaint\n\nrelies upon the same causes of action as the 1999 complaint, and\n\nthe   facts   complained   of   concern   Rivera-Olmo’s     evaluation,\n\nclassification, compensation, and accommodation.          Rivera-Olmo’s\n\n2005 complaint is premised on the problems that prompted her to\n\nfile her 1999 complaint not having been remedied.     (And, as noted\n\nabove, the settlement agreement has since been carried out and\n\nRivera-Olmo’s employment has ended.)       Her claims are therefore\n\nbarred by the settlement agreement.\n\n          Assuming arguendo that some of the claims in the 2005\n\ncomplaint are not “connected with” the facts alleged in the 1999\n\ncomplaint, these claims are nevertheless barred by the settlement\n\nagreement’s general release of all ADA, Law 44, or Article 1802\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fclaims related to Rivera-Olmo’s employment with SIFC.                 Under the\n\nsettlement    agreement,      Rivera-Olmo        “releas[ed]    and     forever\n\ndischarg[ed] [SIFC] for any and all claims, without limitation . .\n\n. including . . . a release and discharge for any potential and/or\n\nactual liability for any causes of action pursuant [sic] and/or\n\nunder” various laws and statutes, including the ADA, Law 44, and\n\nArticle 1802.     An employee may waive her right to sue under the\n\nADA, as well as under other federal or state employment statutes,\n\nif the waiver is knowing and voluntary.           Rivera-Flores v. Bristol-\n\nMyers   Squibb   Caribbean,   112   F.3d    9,    11   n.3   (1st   Cir.   1997)\n\n(upholding the validity of a settlement agreement that plaintiff\n\n“shall file no action against the Company . . . which might be\n\ndirectly or indirectly related to his employment with the Company\n\n. . . ”).    Any of Rivera-Olmo’s claims alleging new violations of\n\nthe ADA, Law 44, and Article 1802 are therefore barred by the\n\ngeneral release.\n\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
