This appeal stems from\n\nparents' laudable efforts to provide the best possible education\n\nfor their profoundly disabled daughter.        After disagreements arose\n\nover the contents of the child's proposed individualized education\n\nprogram (IEP), a state hearing officer overruled the parents'\n\nobjections and concluded that the proposed IEP complied with the\n\nstrictures of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n\n(IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1491 (2000).1         A federal district court\n\naffirmed that decision.\n\n           On appeal, we hold that the defendants — the local school\n\ndistrict   and    the   state   educational   agency   —   fulfilled   their\n\nresponsibilities under the IDEA, that the delays complained of were\n\nattributable to the parents (and, thus, afford no grounds for\n\nrelief), and that the IEP at issue here satisfied the applicable\n\nstatutory imperatives. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           At the heart of this litigation stands a young woman\n\nnamed Stephanie Lessard, who was eighteen years of age at the time\n\nof the relevant events.          We rehearse the facts pertaining to\n\nStephanie's plight as supportably found by the district court. See\n\n\n\n      1\n      The IDEA was amended by the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat.\n2647, but the relevant amendments did not take effect until July 1,\n2005. See id. § 302(a)(1). Because that date is subsequent to the\noccurrence of the events at issue here, we refer throughout to the\nearlier version of the IDEA.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fLessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Coop. Sch. Dist., 2007 WL 1221103,\n\nat *1-4 (D.N.H. Apr. 23, 2007).\n\n          Stephanie Lessard has been diagnosed with moderate mental\n\nretardation (she possesses an IQ of 42), cognitive delays, speech\n\nimpairments,   a     seizure   disorder,   scoliosis,   a    leg-length\n\ndiscrepancy, and partial paralysis of her left side.        Since 2001,\n\nshe has been a day student at Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation\n\nCenter, a New Hampshire facility providing special needs services\n\nto the Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District (the School\n\nDistrict).\n\n          In April of 2004, Stephanie's mother, Linda Lessard, met\n\nwith representatives of the School District to map out Stephanie's\n\nIEP for the coming school year (2004-2005). Between that inaugural\n\nmeeting and December of the same year, Mrs. Lessard and the IEP\n\nteam huddled on at least four occasions to discuss the IEP, but\n\nprogress was slow.    In the interim, the School District continued\n\nto implement Stephanie's 2003-2004 IEP.\n\n          Of particular pertinence for present purposes is the\n\nmeeting that took place on August 16, 2004.    On her own initiative,\n\nMrs. Lessard brought a psycholinguist (Dr. Kemper) to the meeting.\n\nHe explained to the assemblage why the Lindamood-Bell Phoneme\n\nProcessing System (LiPS) was in his view the most effective way to\n\nteach literacy to a child with learning disabilities as pronounced\n\nas Stephanie's.    The IEP team declined to adopt that view, noting\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat none of those assembled was schooled in that particular\n\npedagogical methodology.        The team nonetheless agreed to look into\n\nthe matter.\n\n            At the same meeting, the School District gave Mrs.\n\nLessard a proposed IEP for the upcoming school year and requested\n\nthat she sign it.      The IEP did not contain a component specifically\n\naddressing the correction of Stephanie's behavioral problems; that\n\ncomponent    was   under   ongoing   review   by   personnel   at    Crotched\n\nMountain.    Curiously, a one-page \"transition plan\" (the last page\n\nof the IEP) ended abruptly in mid-sentence.\n\n            Lessard refused to sign the proffered IEP.2             After the\n\nmeeting, the School District sent her a letter requesting that she\n\nmake clear what portions of the IEP engendered dissatisfaction.\n\nThe School District also offered to schedule additional meetings to\n\ndiscuss and perhaps reshape the IEP.          The Lessards kept their own\n\ncounsel and did not communicate their specific objections to the\n\nIEP.\n\n            Another meeting took place in October.          It soon became\n\napparent    that   a   schism   existed:   whereas   the   School    District\n\nenvisioned the task at hand to be putting the finishing touches on\n\nthe proffered IEP, Mrs. Lessard envisioned the IEP process as in\n\n\n\n       2\n      This was not the first time that Stephanie's parents had\nbalked at signing a newly tendered IEP. Stephanie's 2002-2003 IEP\nwas not signed until June of 2003, and her 2003-2004 IEP was not\nsigned until January of 2004.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fits infancy. Yet, despite her evident displeasure, Mrs. Lessard\n\nagain declined to chronicle any specific criticisms of the IEP as\n\nit stood.      After the October meeting, the School District again\n\nrequested by letter that Mrs. Lessard delineate in writing her\n\nobjections to the proffered IEP.               No such delineation ensued.\n\n              Persistent       scheduling            conflicts        prevented     the\n\nprotagonists from reconvening until December 2.                      At that time, the\n\nSchool District presented a new version of the IEP, which contained\n\nboth   the    now-vetted     behavioral        plan    as    well    as   a   full-blown\n\ntransition     plan    (that    is,   a   plan       designed    to    transition    the\n\ndisabled child into independent, adult life). Mrs. Lessard refused\n\nto sign the December IEP, complaining that the team had yet to\n\n\"develop[]\" the IEP. This reaction prompted the School District to\n\ninvoke its right to a due process hearing, see N.H. Code Admin. R.\n\nAnn.   Ed.    1125.05(c)       (2007),    as     a    means     of    determining   the\n\nsuitability of the recently submitted IEP.\n\n              That hearing took place over two days, during which eight\n\nmembers of the IEP team testified on behalf of the School District.\n\nIn rebuttal, the parents introduced the expert testimony of a\n\nreading specialist and a physical therapist; another literacy\n\nexpert (Dr. Kemper) testified solely through the medium of written\n\nfindings.      In a decision dated March 22, 2005, the state hearing\n\nofficer      ruled    that   the   December          IEP    suffered      from   neither\n\nprocedural nor substantive faults.               He therefore ordered it placed\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\finto effect and denied the parents' cross-petition for compensatory\n\neducation and other relief.\n\n           The Lessards rejoined by filing an action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of New Hampshire.                      See 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2).           Their suit raised the same procedural and\n\nsubstantive objections that had been advanced in the due process\n\nhearing   and        sought    compensatory     education     for    the     alleged\n\ndeprivation of the free appropriate public education (FAPE) owed to\n\nStephanie Lessard under the IDEA.             The suit added a claim that the\n\nadministrative        hearing,    as   conducted,      violated     the     Lessards'\n\nprocedural due process rights.\n\n           In the court case, Mrs. Lessard — who had declined to\n\ntestify before the state hearing officer — took the witness stand;\n\notherwise,      the    evidence     before     the   district       court     largely\n\nreplicated the evidence in the administrative record. The district\n\ncourt   found    no    fault    with   the   conduct    of   the    administrative\n\nhearing, upheld the hearing officer's findings and conclusions, and\n\ndenied the Lessards' requests for relief.                 See Lessard, 2007 WL\n\n1221103, at *11.\n\n           The Lessards, qua appellants, prosecuted this timely\n\nappeal.   Before us, they do not challenge the district court's\n\nresolution      of    their    procedural    due   process   claim.         They   do,\n\nhowever, press the other objections that were raised below.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fII.    THE STATUTORY SCHEME\n\n               The IDEA declares that, as a condition for receiving\n\nfederal funds, states must provide all disabled children with a\n\nFAPE.     See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(8), 1412(a)(1)(A).                          The primary\n\nvehicle for delivery of a FAPE is the child's IEP.                         The IEP must\n\ninclude,       at   a    bare    minimum,    the     child's    present        level    of\n\neducational attainment, the short- and long-term goals for his or\n\nher education, objective criteria with which to measure progress\n\ntoward those goals, and the specific services to be offered.                           See\n\nid. § 1414(d)(1)(A); Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083,\n\n1086 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n               An IEP is subject to both procedural and substantive\n\nrequirements.         Those requirements can flow from either federal or\n\nstate   law     (at      least   to   the   extent    that     the       latter   is   not\n\nincompatible with the former).                   See Roland M. v. Concord Sch.\n\nComm., 910 F.2d 983, 987 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n               As   an     example    of     a    federally-imposed            procedural\n\nrequirement, the IDEA specifically confers upon parents a right to\n\nbe part of the \"IEP team,\" that is, the group of individuals\n\ncharged    with     formulating       a   particular    child's          IEP   and   which\n\ncomprises educational professionals who either possess specialized\n\nknowledge about or will be involved in the child's education.                          See\n\n20    U.S.C.    §     1414(d)(1)(B).         An    example     of    a    state-imposed\n\nprocedural requirement is the New Hampshire regulation stipulating\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fthat parents must annually consent to and sign their child's IEP.\n\nSee N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.04(a)(3) (2007); cf. 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(b)(3) (imposing the lesser requirement that the\n\nschool district give notice to the parents of proposed changes to\n\nan extant IEP).   Federal and state law converge in demanding that\n\nan IEP be in effect by the commencement of the school year.             See 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.342(a) (2000); N.H. Code\n\nAdmin. R. Ann. Ed. 1109.08(c) (2007).\n\n          There is no mechanical checklist by which an inquiring\n\ncourt can determine the proper content of an IEP; \"IEPs are by\n\ntheir very nature idiosyncratic.\"          Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v.\n\nMr. & Mrs. R., 321 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).           One thing is clear:\n\nthe substance of an IEP must be something different than the normal\n\nschool curriculum and something more than a generic, one-size-fits-\n\nall program for children with special needs.                In the Supreme\n\nCourt's phrase, an IEP must be \"individually designed to provide\n\neducational benefit to [a particular] handicapped child.\" Hendrick\n\nHudson Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 201 (1982).\n\n          It is worth emphasizing that the obligation to devise a\n\ncustom-tailored   IEP   does   not   imply    that   a   disabled    child   is\n\nentitled to the maximum educational benefit possible.               See id. at\n\n206-08; C.G. v. Five Town Cmty. Sch. Dist., ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2008) [No. 07-1708, slip op. at 9]; Lt. T.B. v. Warwick Sch.\n\nComm., 361 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 2004).           An IEP need only supply\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f\"some educational benefit,\" not an optimal or an ideal level of\n\neducational benefit, in order to survive judicial scrutiny.                      Mr. &\n\nMrs. R., 321 F.3d at 11; see Roland M., 910 F.2d at 992.\n\n              Serial review mechanisms present the means for enforcing\n\nthese procedural and substantive rights.               By statute, parents may\n\nfile a complaint with the state educational agency, which must\n\nconvene a hearing (sometimes called a \"due process hearing\") to\n\npass upon the adequacy of a proposed IEP.                20 U.S.C. § 1415(f).\n\nUnder New Hampshire law, the School District also may pursue a due\n\nprocess hearing to test the validity of a proposed IEP.                    See N.H.\n\nCode Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.05(c) (2007).                   Either side may then\n\nappeal from the hearing officer's final decision to either a\n\nfederal or state court of competent jurisdiction.                    20 U.S.C. §\n\n1415(i)(2)(A).\n\nIII.    THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              In reviewing the hearing officer's decision, the district\n\ncourt is tasked with determining the IEP's appropriateness on the\n\nbasis    of    the     preponderance    of    the     evidence.      See    id.     §\n\n1415(i)(2)(B).         Judges are not trained pedagogues, and they must\n\naccord    deference      to    the   state    agency's       application    of    its\n\nspecialized knowledge.         See Renner v. Bd. of Educ. of Pub. Schs. of\n\nAnn Arbor, 185 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir. 1999) (remarking that\n\n\"federal      courts     are   generalists     with     no    expertise    in     the\n\neducational needs of handicapped children\") (citation and internal\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fquotation marks omitted); see           also González v. P.R. Dep't of\n\nEduc., 254 F.3d 350, 352 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that a district\n\ncourt, faced with conflicting expert testimony anent educational\n\nplacement,    may    justifiably     feel    \"bound     to   affirm\"   the    state\n\nagency's determination).            As a result, judicial review falls\n\nsomewhere between the highly deferential clear-error standard and\n\nthe non-deferential de novo standard.             See Roland M., 910 F.2d at\n\n989; see also Nack v. Orange City Sch. Dist., 454 F.3d 604, 609\n\n(6th Cir. 2006) (observing that district court may give some\n\ndeference to the fact findings of the hearing officer, especially\n\nwhen educational expertise is essential to the findings).\n\n            In this case, the district court appropriately engaged in\n\na bounded, independent review of the state hearing officer's\n\ndecision, see, e.g., Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976 F.2d\n\n48, 53 (1st Cir. 1992), giving due deference to the hearing\n\nofficer's    determinations.         Because      the   court's     findings   and\n\nconclusions are consistent with those of the hearing officer, we\n\nfor   the   most    part   abjure   separate      reference    to    the   hearing\n\nofficer's decision and focus on the decision of the district court.\n\n            With respect to that decision, we grant its factual\n\nfindings     the    deference   implicit     in    clear-error      review,    see\n\nGonzález, 254 F.3d at 352, while evaluating its answers to abstract\n\nquestions of law de novo, see Five Town, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op.\n\nat 7].   Determinations as to an IEP's appropriateness and adequacy\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fpresent mixed questions of law and fact.         These questions are\n\nhandled on a degree-of-deference continuum, and the exact standard\n\nof review depends on whether and to what extent a particular\n\ndetermination is law- or fact-dominated.     See id. at ___ [slip op.\n\nat 8]; Mr. I. v. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 55, 480 F.3d 1, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).      Absent an error of law, we will reverse only if the\n\ndistrict court's determination, when seen in light of the record as\n\na whole, is clearly erroneous.       See Lt. T.B., 361 F.3d at 84;\n\nRoland M., 910 F.2d at 990-91.\n\nIV.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The appellants raise both procedural and substantive\n\nobjections to the decision below. Their procedural objection rests\n\non an allegation that the district court improperly excused the\n\nSchool District's delay in proffering a completed IEP.         Their\n\nsubstantive objection has twin foci: first, they assert that the\n\ndistrict court used an incorrect standard in evaluating the IEP;\n\nsecond, they assert that the final version of the IEP failed to\n\nprovide for adequate literacy, transition, and behavioral services.\n\nWe address these objections sequentially.\n\n                     A.   The Procedural Objection.\n\n           The appellants claim that the August IEP was incomplete\n\nand that the December IEP was so tardy as to constitute a per se\n\ndenial of Stephanie's right to a FAPE.     In mounting this argument,\n\nthey emphasize the IDEA's requirement that \"[a]t the beginning of\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\feach school year, each local educational agency . . . shall have in\n\neffect, for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction, an\n\nindividualized education program.\"              20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A).\n\n               This     assault     depends     entirely        on       the     alleged\n\nincompleteness of the August IEP.              That allegation is grounded on\n\ntwo   perceived        shortcomings    in     that    document:      the       truncated\n\ntransition      plan    and   the   absence    of    a    behavioral      plan.      The\n\nappellants contend that these shortcomings eloquently attest that\n\nthe August IEP offered Stephanie only a fraction of what she was\n\nentitled to receive.\n\n               This contention substantially misconceives what the IDEA\n\nrequires. The transition plan contained in the August IEP consists\n\nsolely    of    background     information      and       performance      goals,    and\n\nsuddenly       ends    mid-sentence.        That     is   hardly     a   full-fledged\n\ntransition plan.          The rub, however, is that the IDEA does not\n\nrequire a stand-alone transition plan as part of an IEP.\n\n               Sections 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) and (II), reproduced in\n\nthe margin,3 require that IEPs contain statements of transition\n\n\n      3\n      That statute provides in pertinent part that an IEP must\ninclude:\n     (I) beginning at age 14, and updated annually, a\n     statement of the transition service needs of the child\n     under the applicable components of the child's IEP that\n     focuses on the child's courses of study (such as\n     participation in advanced-placement courses or a\n     vocational education program); [and] (II) beginning at\n     age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by the IEP\n     Team), a statement of needed transition services for the\n     child, including, when appropriate, a statement of the\n\n                                       -12-\n\fservices.    But neither section requires that those statements be\n\narticulated in a separate component of the IEP.     In fact, section\n\n1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) specifically contemplates the inclusion of\n\nstatements of transition services \"under the applicable components\n\nof the child's IEP.\"     Thus, merely pointing to the absence of a\n\nstand-alone transition plan cannot form the basis for a founded\n\nclaim of procedural error.\n\n            To be sure, the statutory provisions quoted in the margin\n\nimplicitly acknowledge that transition services must be provided to\n\ndisabled children who need them, in accordance with the Rowley\n\nstandard.    See, e.g., Browell v. Lemahieu, 127 F. Supp. 2d 1117,\n\n1126 (D. Haw. 2000).    Here, however, the appellants have made no\n\nclaim that the August IEP lacks sufficient transition services\n\n(which, in fact, are integrated throughout the IEP's various\n\ncomponents).   We thus reject the \"transition plan\" claim of error.\n\n            An even more egregious misunderstanding of the IDEA's\n\nrequirements undermines the claim of procedural error based on a\n\nmissing behavioral plan.    The IDEA only requires a behavioral plan\n\nwhen certain disciplinary actions are taken against a disabled\n\nchild.   See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(k)(1)(A) & (B)(I); see also Alex R.\n\nv. Forrestville Valley Sch. Dist., 375 F.3d 603, 614 (7th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n     interagency responsibilities or any needed linkages; . .\n     .\n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii).\n\n                                 -13-\n\f2004).      The       appellants     make    no    claim   that    the   necessary\n\ndisciplinary predicate had transpired in this instance.\n\n           The other statutory provision cited by the appellants —\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(I) — also falls short of requiring a\n\nbehavioral plan as an ubiquitous feature in every IEP.                          That\n\nstatute,    in    terms,     directs        IEP   teams    to   \"consider,      when\n\nappropriate,\" formulating such plans. The record is pellucid that,\n\nby the time the August IEP was prepared, the IEP team already had\n\nconsidered and formulated a behavioral plan but had opted not to\n\ninclude it in the IEP pending Crotched Mountain's approval.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the appellants\n\ncall our attention to a federal regulation, 34 C.F.R. § 300.346(c)\n\n(2000), which states: \"If . . . the IEP team determines that a\n\nchild    needs    a     particular    device       or   service    (including     an\n\nintervention, accommodation, or other program modification) in\n\norder for the child to receive FAPE, the IEP team must include a\n\nstatement to that effect in the child's IEP.\"                     Although such a\n\nregulation is entitled to judicial deference, see Greenland Sch.\n\nDist. v. Amy N., 358 F.3d 150, 161 (1st Cir. 2004), this regulation\n\ndid not require the August IEP to encompass a behavioral plan,\n\nmerely to consider formulating one.               Here, the IEP team mulled the\n\nmatter and determined that a behavioral plan was not necessary in\n\norder to afford Stephanie a FAPE.              No more was exigible.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f            That effectively ends this aspect of the matter.                 We\n\nconclude, without serious question, that the district court did not\n\nerr   in   finding   that   the   absence     of   either   a   transition   or\n\nbehavioral plan did not constitute a procedural defect within the\n\nmeaning of the IDEA.\n\n            Once it is determined that the August IEP was complete,\n\nthe appellants' argument quickly unravels. All that remains is the\n\nlack of a signed IEP at the start of the school year.              But even in\n\na regime in which parental assent is required before an IEP can\n\nbecome effective, it cannot be that a school system transgresses\n\nthe IDEA whenever a parent — for whatever reason — refuses to sign\n\na completed IEP before the school year commences.                  Otherwise,\n\nschool systems would be at the mercy of obdurate parents — a result\n\nplainly at odds with the collaborative relationship fostered by the\n\nIDEA framework.      See, e.g., Five Town, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n10] (\"The development of an IEP is meant to be a collaborative\n\nproject.\"); MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 303 F.3d 523,\n\n535 (4th Cir. 2002) (explaining that \"it would be improper to hold\n\n[a] School District liable for the procedural violation of failing\n\nto have the IEP completed and signed, when that failure was the\n\nresult of [the parents'] lack of cooperation\") (citation and\n\ninternal    quotation    marks    omitted).        Consequently,   a   parent's\n\nobstruction of the IEP process, caused by his or her unreasonable\n\ndelay in acting upon a completed IEP, can relieve a school system\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\ffrom its obligation to have an assented-to IEP in place at the\n\nstart of the school year.   See Doe v. Defendant I, 898 F.2d 1186,\n\n1189 (6th Cir. 1990); see also Roland M., 910 F.2d at 995 (\"The law\n\nought not to abet parties who block assembly of the required team\n\nand then, dissatisfied with the ensuing IEP, attempt to jettison it\n\nbecause of problems created by their own obstructionism.\").\n\n            The case at bar presents a paradigmatic example of a\n\nsituation in which a delay in having a signed IEP in place is\n\nfairly laid at the parents' doorstep.     On August 16, the School\n\nDistrict presented Stephanie's mother with a completed IEP that\n\ncovered every essential component.     From that point forward, the\n\nrecord discloses a consistent pattern in which the School District\n\nwould strive to identify the parents' specific concerns and the\n\nparents would refuse to say more than that they wanted further\n\nmeetings.    The School District made numerous attempts to arrange\n\nsuch meetings and succeeded in holding two extended sessions with\n\nStephanie's mother. These meetings proved fruitless: the most that\n\ncould be gleaned from Mrs. Lessard was her opinion that the\n\nproffered IEP was, for some unexplained reason, still \"in the\n\ndeveloping stage.\"\n\n            Given this mise-en-scène, we can discern no clear error\n\nin the district court's conclusion that whatever delays plagued the\n\nsigning of Stephanie's 2004-2005 IEP were the product of her\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fmother's own intransigence.4   See Lessard, 2007 WL 1221103, at *7.\n\nThose delays, in turn, justified the court in exonerating the\n\nSchool District with respect to the IEP's late implementation. The\n\ninteractive process constructed by Congress was not intended to\n\ndeal a trump card to parents bent on prolonging IEP negotiations\n\nindefinitely.   See MM, 303 F.3d at 535.\n\n          The   appellants   object    to    this   finding,   citing    our\n\nremonstrances in Mr. & Mrs. R..       There, we cautioned that \"[i]n\n\nmounting a challenge to a current or proposed IEP, the most that\n\nparents can be expected to do is to point out areas in which the\n\nIEP is deficient.\"   321 F.3d at 20.        The appellants suggest that,\n\nunder this precept, they cannot be faulted for having failed to\n\nrespond to the School District's requests for insight.                  This\n\nsuggestion is baseless.\n\n          Line-drawing is often difficult, and in the IEP context\n\nit is impossible to draw a precise line separating healthy requests\n\nfor parental input from impermissible demands that parents do the\n\nschool system's work.   Here the record leaves no doubt as to where\n\nalong that continuum the present case falls.            When the School\n\nDistrict contacted Stephanie's mother following her rejection of\n\n\n     4\n      We emphasize that the August IEP was complete, and there is\nno evidence that the appellants' refusal to sign it interfered with\nStephanie's receipt of a FAPE (at bottom, they argued only that the\nabsence of a signature constituted a per se violation of the IDEA's\nrequirements). Indeed, during the appellants' negotiations with\nthe other members of the IEP team, the 2003-2004 IEP continued to\nbe fully implemented.\n\n                                -17-\n\fthe August IEP, it asked her to \"state specifically what you agree\n\nor disagree with.\"           Such an entreaty, which the School District\n\nessentially repeated in letters of inquiry sent to her on August\n\n25, October 24, November 16, and November 30, respectively, strikes\n\nus   as   the   functional         equivalent   of   a    request    to    point   out\n\ndeficiencies in an IEP.\n\n                       B.    The Substantive Objections.\n\n            We turn next to the appellants' substantive objections,\n\nwhich are addressed to the December IEP.                         We subdivide this\n\ndiscussion      into        four    segments    to       match    the     appellants'\n\nasseverational array.\n\n            1. Incorrect Legal Standard. The appellants insist that\n\nthe lower court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard.\n\nSpecifically, they argue that, in the area of transition services,\n\nthe Rowley standard has been supplanted by the 1997 amendments to\n\nthe IDEA, see IDEA Amendments for 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-17, 111\n\nStat. 37, but the court failed to recognize this development.\n\n            To put this argument into perspective, we start with the\n\nRowley Court's mandate that IEP components must be \"reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\"\n\n458 U.S. at 207.        The appellants contend that Congress, in 1997,\n\nraised the bar for IEP transition services, directing that those\n\nservices must result in actual and substantial progress toward\n\nintegrating disabled children into society.\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f                Existing precedent forecloses this contention.              In Lt.\n\nT.B., the parents advanced a similar though slightly more ambitious\n\nthesis; they posited that, given Congress's statement of goals, the\n\n1997 amendments must have replaced the Rowley standard across the\n\nboard with a requirement that an IEP furnish a disabled child with\n\nthe \"maximum benefit\" available.                361 F.3d at 83.          We flatly\n\nrejected that thesis, noting that it had no support in the text of\n\nthe amendments and that no other court of appeals, post-1997, had\n\nexhibited a willingness to scuttle the Rowley standard.                   Id.   For\n\naught that appears, the decision in Lt. T.B. remains good law.5\n\n                To the interpretive mix presented in Lt. T.B., the\n\nappellants add only an allusion to the amendments' definition of\n\n\"transition services.\"         In relevant part, the amendments defined\n\nthat term to mean \"a coordinated set of activities for a student\n\nwith a disability that is designed within an outcome-oriented\n\nprocess,        which   promotes    movement    from    school   to    post-school\n\nactivities.\"        20 U.S.C. § 1401(30)(A).           The appellants theorize\n\nthat       an   \"outcome-oriented    process\"    must    mean    a    process   that\n\nactually achieves substantial progress toward that outcome and,\n\n\n\n       5\n      In arguing for a contrary result the appellants rely on two\ncases.    Neither decision is persuasive.        The first is an\nunpublished district court decision, J.L. v. Mercer Island Sch.\nDist., 2006 WL 3628033 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 8, 2006). The reasoning of\nthat decision is unconvincing and we decline to follow it. The\nsecond, Deal v. Hamilton County Bd. of Educ., 392 F.3d 840, 861-64\n(6th Cir. 2004), purports to construe the original Rowley standard.\nThe opinion is, therefore, inapposite.\n\n                                       -19-\n\fthus, the 1997 amendments must to this extent have superseded the\n\nRowley standard.\n\n          The appellants read far too much into Congress's 1997\n\ndefinition of transition services. It seems obvious to us that the\n\nword \"process\" denotes a praxis or procedure; it does not imply a\n\nsubstantive standard or a particular measure of progress.              The\n\nadjectival phrase \"outcome-oriented\" is similarly agnostic with\n\nrespect to ultimate results; it specifies the perspective that\n\nparticipants in the process should strive to attain but does not\n\nestablish a standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.\n\n          For these reasons, we decline the appellants' invitation\n\nto defenestrate the Rowley standard.      The district court did not\n\napply an incorrect legal rule in evaluating the adequacy of the\n\ntransition services limned in Stephanie's final IEP.\n\n          2.     Literacy.    The appellants' next claim relates to\n\nStephanie's proposed reading program.         In their view, the School\n\nDistrict's   literacy   methodology   produced    a   level   of   progress\n\ncategorically beneath what their daughter was capable of attaining.\n\nSince superior methodologies were readily available (in particular\n\nthe LiPS system advocated by Dr. Kemper), the School District's\n\nchosen methodology denied Stephanie a FAPE.\n\n          It is difficult to prevail on a claim of this nature.\n\nThe Supreme Court has pointed out with conspicuous clarity that the\n\nIDEA   confers   primary     responsibility    upon   state    and   local\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\feducational     agencies     to    choose      among    competing     pedagogical\n\nmethodologies    and    to   select      the   method    most   suitable      to   a\n\nparticular child's needs.         Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207.           Then-Justice\n\nRehnquist, writing for the majority, added that \"it seems highly\n\nunlikely that Congress intended courts to overturn a State's choice\n\nof appropriate educational theories in a proceeding conducted\n\npursuant to [the IDEA].\"          Id. at 207-08.        After all, courts lack\n\nthe   \"specialized     knowledge       and   experience\"    needed    to   resolve\n\n\"persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\" Id. at\n\n208 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                  Thus, \"once\n\na court determines that the requirements of the [IDEA] have been\n\nmet, questions of methodology are for resolution by the States.\"\n\nId.\n\n           Rowley sends a very clear message.               The short of it is\n\nthat courts are entrusted with ascertaining the adequacy of an\n\nIEP's educational components but not with weighing the comparative\n\nmerit of the components when stacked against other heuristic\n\nmethods.   See, e.g., Lt. T.B., 361 F.3d at 86; G.D. v. Westmoreland\n\nSch. Dist., 930 F.2d 942, 948 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           In    an    effort     to     expand    the     scope     of    judicial\n\nintervention, the appellants resort to an esoteric definition of\n\n\"appropriate educational theories,\" which they equate with theories\n\nthat produce results.        They do not contest that the IEP favored a\n\nstandard, multisensory reading methodology.                 Nevertheless, they\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fargue that since Dr. Kemper concluded that Stephanie had progressed\n\nvery    little    under     that   methodology,     it   was,      a   fortiori,\n\n\"inappropriate.\"\n\n            This construct inverts the rule of decision.                  Actual\n\neducational progress can (and sometimes will) demonstrate that an\n\nIEP provides a FAPE.        See, e.g., Rowley, 458 U.S. at 209-10; Nack,\n\n454 F.3d at 612; see also Roland M., 910 F.2d at 991 (explaining\n\nthat \"actual educational results are relevant to determining the\n\nefficacy of educators' policy choices\"). But to impose the inverse\n\nof this rule — that a lack of progress necessarily betokens an\n\nIEP's inadequacy — would contradict the fundamental concept that\n\n\"[a]n IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective.\"           Roland M., 910 F.2d\n\nat 992.    Where, as here, a school system develops an IEP component\n\nin reliance upon a widely-accepted methodology, an inquiring court\n\nought not to condemn that methodology ex post merely because the\n\ndisabled    child's   progress     does   not   meet   the   parents'     or   the\n\neducators' expectations. See Lachman v. Ill. St. Bd. of Educ., 852\n\nF.2d 290, 297 (7th Cir. 1988).\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — we remark\n\nthe    district   court's    finding    that    Stephanie    had   been   making\n\nreasonable progress in reading.           See Lessard, 2007 WL 1221103, at\n\n*8.    That finding is fully supportable: in his testimony at the due\n\nprocess hearing, Stephanie's reading teacher painted a far more\n\npositive picture than did Dr. Kemper, testifying that Stephanie had\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fbeen making steady headway.            The hearing officer and the district\n\ncourt were entitled to accept that assessment.              After all, levels\n\nof progress must be judged with respect to the potential of the\n\nparticular child. Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermed. Unit 16, 853\n\nF.2d 171, 185 (3d Cir. 1988).           So here: while the reported progress\n\nis modest by most standards, it is reasonable in the context of\n\nStephanie's manifold disabilities and low IQ.\n\n               That disposes of the literacy-related claim.              On this\n\nrecord, we are compelled to conclude that, in the subject area of\n\nreading, the proffered IEP afforded Stephanie educational benefits\n\nconsistent with a FAPE.\n\n               3.      Transition      Services.      The   appellants     voice\n\ndissatisfaction with the transition services component of the\n\nDecember IEP.        They claim that this component was too generic and\n\nthat    a    personalized    IEP    tailored   to   Stephanie's   needs    would\n\nnecessarily         have   contained    \"relatively    intense    services    in\n\ncommunity-based settings to prepare her to be a contributing member\n\nof society.\"        Appellants' Br. at 43.     They acknowledge that the IEP\n\nprovided for monthly field trips into the community, but aver that\n\nthose       trips   were   inadequate    because    behavior   problems    often\n\nprevented Stephanie from participating in them.\n\n               In our estimation, the district court did not clearly err\n\nin finding the panoply of transition services adequate.                      See\n\nLessard, 2007 WL 1221103, at *9.               In addition to the scheduled\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\ffield trips, the December IEP incorporated a wide array of other\n\ntransition services.     These included six hours of pre-vocational\n\ntraining each week and regular instruction in specific transition-\n\nrelated skills (such as using a telephone, identifying workers in\n\ncommunity settings, maintaining proper self-hygiene, and preparing\n\nfood).   This regimen apparently had some efficacy; the district\n\ncourt found that Stephanie's transition skills were improving. See\n\nid.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellants argue that a specific service — activities conducted in\n\ncommunity settings — failed adequately to provide educational\n\nbenefits in an important area of need.      Though artfully framed,\n\nthis argument fails for two reasons.      First, in considering the\n\nadequacy of a myriad of transition services, an inquiring court\n\nmust view those services in the aggregate and in light of the\n\nchild's overall needs.    See, e.g., Rettig v. Kent City Sch. Dist.,\n\n788 F.2d 328, 332 (7th Cir. 1986).      The test is whether the IEP,\n\ntaken in its entirety, is reasonably calculated to enable the\n\nparticular child to garner educational benefits.    See id.; Karl v.\n\nBd. of Educ. of Geneseo Cent. Sch. Dist., 736 F.2d 873, 877 (2d\n\nCir. 1984).   Were the law otherwise, parents could endlessly parse\n\nIEPs into highly particularized components and circumvent the\n\ngeneral rule that parents cannot unilaterally dictate the content\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fof their child's IEP.         See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207-08; Lachman, 852\n\nF.2d at 297.\n\n            The second reason why the appellants' argument founders\n\nis that the district court concluded that the extant community-\n\noriented services, when evaluated in conjunction with the IEP's\n\nother transition services, furnished Stephanie with the requisite\n\neducational benefit.           Lessard, 2007 WL 1221103, at *9.               This\n\nfinding   is     not   clearly   erroneous.      While    we   can   accept   the\n\npossibility that monthly field trips might not be an ideal service\n\ncomponent given Stephanie's needs, the IDEA does not require an\n\nideal or optimal IEP, simply an adequate one.              See Five Town, ___\n\nF.3d at ___ [slip op. at 9]; Lenn, 998 F.2d at 1086.\n\n            4.    Behavioral Plan.      The appellants' last substantive\n\nobjection      focuses   on    the   supposed    inadequacy     of   the   IEP's\n\nbehavioral     plan.      This    objection     fails    for   reasons   already\n\ndiscussed: no behavioral plan is required for purposes of this IEP.\n\nSee supra Part IV(A); see also Alex R., 375 F.3d at 614.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            Many judges are parents too, and we can admire the\n\ndetermination with which the appellants have pursued the best\n\npossible education for their profoundly disabled daughter. That is\n\nas it should be.         See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 209 (predicting that\n\nparents \"will not lack ardor in seeking to ensure that handicapped\n\nchildren receive all of the benefits to which they are entitled by\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fthe Act\").    But determination must be tempered by an understanding\n\nthat school districts, like parents and children, have legal rights\n\nwith respect to special education. In demanding more than the IDEA\n\nrequires,     the   appellants   frustrated   the   operation   of   a\n\ncollaborative process and put the School District in an untenable\n\nposition.     Under the circumstances, the School District cannot be\n\nfaulted either for the timing of the resultant IEP or for its\n\nsubstance.\n\n             We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the district court's conclusion that the School District\n\nacted in conformity with its responsibilities under the IDEA.\n\nConsequently, we descry no basis for granting the appellants'\n\nprayer for compensatory education or other redress.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f",

After disagreements arose over the contents of the child's proposed individualized education program (IEP), a state hearing officer overruled the parents' objections and concluded that the proposed IEP complied with the strictures of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1491 (2000).<sup>[1]</sup> A federal district court affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p>On appeal, we hold that the defendants  the local school district and the state educational agency  fulfilled their responsibilities under the IDEA, that the delays complained of were attributable to the parents (and, thus, afford no grounds for relief), and that the IEP at issue here satisfied the applicable statutory imperatives. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>At the heart of this litigation stands a young woman named Stephanie Lessard, who was eighteen years of age at the time of the relevant events. We rehearse the facts pertaining to Stephanie's plight as supportably found by the district court. <i>See Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Coop. Sch. Dist.,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *1-4 (D.N.H. Apr. 23, 2007).</p>\n<p>Stephanie Lessard has been diagnosed with moderate mental retardation (she possesses an IQ of 42), cognitive delays, speech impairments, a seizure disorder, scoliosis, a leg-length discrepancy, and partial paralysis of her left side. Since 2001, she has been a day student at Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, a New Hampshire facility providing special needs services to the Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District (the School District).</p>\n<p>In April of 2004, Stephanie's mother, Linda Lessard, met with representatives of the School District to map out Stephanie's IEP for the coming school year (2004-2005). Between that inaugural meeting and December of the same year, Mrs. Lessard and the IEP team huddled on at least four occasions to discuss the IEP, but progress was slow. In the interim, the School District continued to implement Stephanie's 2003-2004 IEP.</p>\n<p>Of particular pertinence for present purposes is the meeting that took place on August 16, 2004. On her own initiative, Mrs. Lessard brought a psycholinguist (Dr. Kemper) to the meeting. He explained to the assemblage why the Lindamood-Bell Phoneme Processing System (LiPS) was in his view the most effective way to teach literacy to a child with learning disabilities as pronounced as Stephanie's. The IEP team declined to adopt that view, noting that none of those assembled was schooled in that particular pedagogical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> methodology. The team nonetheless agreed to look into the matter.</p>\n<p>At the same meeting, the School District gave Mrs. Lessard a proposed IEP for the upcoming school year and requested that she sign it. The IEP did not contain a component specifically addressing the correction of Stephanie's behavioral problems; that component was under ongoing review by personnel at Crotched Mountain. Curiously, a one-page \"transition plan\" (the last page of the IEP) ended abruptly in mid-sentence.</p>\n<p>Lessard refused to sign the proffered IEP.<sup>[2]</sup> After the meeting, the School District sent her a letter requesting that she make clear what portions of the IEP engendered dissatisfaction. The School District also offered to schedule additional meetings to discuss and perhaps reshape the IEP. The Lessards kept their own counsel and did not communicate their specific objections to the IEP.</p>\n<p>Another meeting took place in October. It soon became apparent that a schism existed: whereas the School District envisioned the task at hand to be putting the finishing touches on the proffered IEP, Mrs. Lessard envisioned the IEP process as in its infancy. Yet, despite her evident displeasure, Mrs. Lessard again declined to chronicle any specific criticisms of the IEP as it stood. After the October meeting, the School District again requested by letter that Mrs. Lessard delineate in writing her objections to the proffered IEP. No such delineation ensued.</p>\n<p>Persistent scheduling conflicts prevented the protagonists from reconvening until December 2. At that time, the School District presented a new version of the IEP, which contained both the now-vetted behavioral plan as well as a full-blown transition plan (that is, a plan designed to transition the disabled child into independent, adult life). Mrs. Lessard refused to sign the December IEP, complaining that the team had yet to \"develop[]\" the IEP. This reaction prompted the School District to invoke its right to a due process hearing, <i>see</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.05(c) (2007), as a means of determining the suitability of the recently submitted IEP.</p>\n<p>That hearing took place over two days, during which eight members of the IEP team testified on behalf of the School District. In rebuttal, the parents introduced the expert testimony of a reading specialist and a physical therapist; another literacy expert (Dr. Kemper) testified solely through the medium of written findings. In a decision dated March 22, 2005, the state hearing officer ruled that the December IEP suffered from neither procedural nor substantive faults. He therefore ordered it placed into effect and denied the parents' cross-petition for compensatory education and other relief.</p>\n<p>The Lessards rejoined by filing an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). Their suit raised the same procedural and substantive objections that had been advanced in the due process hearing and sought compensatory education for the alleged deprivation of the free appropriate public education (FAPE) owed to Stephanie Lessard under the IDEA. The suit added a claim that the administrative hearing, as conducted, violated the Lessards' procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p>In the court case, Mrs. Lessard  who had declined to testify before the state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> hearing officer  took the witness stand; otherwise, the evidence before the district court largely replicated the evidence in the administrative record. The district court found no fault with the conduct of the administrative hearing, upheld the hearing officer's findings and conclusions, and denied the Lessards' requests for relief. <i>See Lessard,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *11.</p>\n<p>The Lessards, <i>qua</i> appellants, prosecuted this timely appeal. Before us, they do not challenge the district court's resolution of their procedural due process claim. They do, however, press the other objections that were raised below.</p>\n<p>II. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n<p>The IDEA declares that, as a condition for receiving federal funds, states must provide all disabled children with a FAPE. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(8), 1412(a)(1)(A). The primary vehicle for delivery of a FAPE is the child's IEP. The IEP must include, at a bare minimum, the child's present level of educational attainment, the short- and long-term goals for his or her education, objective criteria with which to measure progress toward those goals, and the specific services to be offered. <i>See id.</i> § 1414(d)(1)(A); <i>Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> 998 F.2d 1083, 1086 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>An IEP is subject to both procedural and substantive requirements. Those requirements can flow from either federal or state law (at least to the extent that the latter is not incompatible with the former). <i>See </i><i>Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm.,</i> 910 F.2d 983, 987 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>As an example of a federally-imposed procedural requirement, the IDEA specifically confers upon parents a right to be part of the \"IEP team,\" that is, the group of individuals charged with formulating a particular child's IEP and which comprises educational professionals who either possess specialized knowledge about or will be involved in the child's education. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B). An example of a state-imposed procedural requirement is the New Hampshire regulation stipulating that parents must annually consent to and sign their child's IEP. <i>See</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.04(a)(3) (2007); <i>cf.</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(3) (imposing the lesser requirement that the school district give notice to the parents of proposed changes to an extant IEP). Federal and state law converge in demanding that an IEP be in effect by the commencement of the school year. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.342(a) (2000); N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1109.08(c) (2007).</p>\n<p>There is no mechanical checklist by which an inquiring court can determine the proper content of an IEP; \"IEPs are by their very nature idiosyncratic.\" <i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir.2003). One thing is clear: the substance of an IEP must be something different than the normal school curriculum and something more than a generic, one-size-fits-all program for children with special needs. In the Supreme Court's phrase, an IEP must be \"individually designed to provide educational benefit to [a particular] handicapped child.\" <i>Hendrick Hudson Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 201, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982).</p>\n<p>It is worth emphasizing that the obligation to devise a custom-tailored IEP does not imply that a disabled child is entitled to the maximum educational benefit possible. <i>See id.</i> at 206-08, 102 S.Ct. 3034; <i>C.G. v. Five Town Cmty. Sch. Dist.,</i> 513 F.3d 279, 284-85 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Lt. T.B. v. Warwick Sch. Comm.,</i> 361 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir.2004). An IEP need only supply \"some educational benefit,\" not an optimal or an ideal level of educational benefit, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> in order to survive judicial scrutiny. <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d at 11; <i>see </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 992.</p>\n<p>Serial review mechanisms present the means for enforcing these procedural and substantive rights. By statute, parents may file a complaint with the state educational agency, which must convene a hearing (sometimes called a \"due process hearing\") to pass upon the adequacy of a proposed IEP. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f). Under New Hampshire law, the School District also may pursue a due process hearing to test the validity of a proposed IEP. <i>See</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.05(c) (2007). Either side may then appeal from the hearing officer's final decision to either a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>III. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>In reviewing the hearing officer's decision, the district court is tasked with determining the IEP's appropriateness on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence. <i>See id.</i> § 1415(i)(2)(B). Judges are not trained pedagogues, and they must accord deference to the state agency's application of its specialized knowledge. <i>See </i><i>Renner v. Bd. of Educ. of Pub. Schs. of Ann Arbor,</i> 185 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir. 1999) (remarking that \"federal courts are generalists with no expertise in the educational needs of handicapped children\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>González v. P.R. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 254 F.3d 350, 352 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that a district court, faced with conflicting expert testimony anent educational placement, may justifiably feel \"bound to affirm\" the state agency's determination). As a result, judicial review falls somewhere between the highly deferential clear-error standard and the non-deferential de novo standard. <i>See </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 989; <i>see also </i><i>Nack v. Orange City Sch. Dist.,</i> 454 F.3d 604, 609 (6th Cir.2006) (observing that district court may give some deference to the fact findings of the hearing officer, especially when educational expertise is essential to the findings).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court appropriately engaged in a bounded, independent review of the state hearing officer's decision, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski,</i> 976 F.2d 48, 53 (1st Cir.1992), giving due deference to the hearing officer's determinations. Because the court's findings and conclusions are consistent with those of the hearing officer, we for the most part abjure separate reference to the hearing officer's decision and focus on the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p>With respect to that decision, we grant its factual findings the deference implicit in clear-error review, <i>see </i><i>González,</i> 254 F.3d at 352, while evaluating its answers to abstract questions of law de novo, <i>see </i><i>Five Town,</i> 513 F.3d at 283-84. Determinations as to an IEP's appropriateness and adequacy present mixed questions of law and fact. These questions are handled on a degree-of-deference continuum, and the exact standard of review depends on whether and to what extent a particular determination is law- or fact-dominated. <i>See id.</i> at 284; <i>Mr. I. v. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 55,</i> 480 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2007). Absent an error of law, we will reverse only if the district court's determination, when seen in light of the record as a whole, is clearly erroneous. <i>See </i><i>Lt. T.B.,</i> 361 F.3d at 84; <i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 990-91.</p>\n<p>IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p>The appellants raise both procedural and substantive objections to the decision below. Their procedural objection rests on an allegation that the district court improperly excused the School District's delay in proffering a completed IEP. Their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> substantive objection has twin foci: first, they assert that the district court used an incorrect standard in evaluating the IEP; second, they assert that the final version of the IEP failed to provide for adequate literacy, transition, and behavioral services. We address these objections sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The Procedural Objection.</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants claim that the August IEP was incomplete and that the December IEP was so tardy as to constitute a per se denial of Stephanie's right to a FAPE. In mounting this argument, they emphasize the IDEA's requirement that \"[a]t the beginning of each school year, each local educational agency . . . shall have in effect, for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction, an individualized education program.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>This assault depends entirely on the alleged incompleteness of the August IEP. That allegation is grounded on two perceived shortcomings in that document: the truncated transition plan and the absence of a behavioral plan. The appellants contend that these shortcomings eloquently attest that the August IEP offered Stephanie only a fraction of what she was entitled to receive.</p>\n<p>This contention substantially misconceives what the IDEA requires. The transition plan contained in the August IEP consists solely of background information and performance goals, and suddenly ends mid-sentence. That is hardly a full-fledged transition plan. The rub, however, is that the IDEA does not require a stand-alone transition plan as part of an IEP.</p>\n<p>Sections 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) and (II), reproduced in the margin,<sup>[3]</sup> require that IEPs contain statements of transition services. But neither section requires that those statements be articulated in a separate component of the IEP. In fact, section 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) specifically contemplates the inclusion of statements of transition services \"under the applicable components of the child's IEP.\" Thus, merely pointing to the absence of a stand-alone transition plan cannot form the basis for a founded claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the statutory provisions quoted in the margin implicitly acknowledge that transition services must be provided to disabled children who need them, in accordance with the <i>Rowley</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Browell v. Lemahieu,</i> 127 F.Supp.2d 1117, 1126 (D.Haw.2000). Here, however, the appellants have made no claim that the August IEP lacks sufficient transition services (which, in fact, are integrated throughout the IEP's various components). We thus reject the \"transition plan\" claim of error.</p>\n<p>An even more egregious misunderstanding of the IDEA's requirements undermines the claim of procedural error based on a missing behavioral plan. The IDEA only requires a behavioral plan when certain disciplinary actions are taken against a disabled child. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(k)(1)(A) &amp; (B); <i>see also </i><i>Alex R. v. Forrestville Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 375 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> 603, 614 (7th Cir.2004). The appellants make no claim that the necessary disciplinary predicate had transpired in this instance.</p>\n<p>The other statutory provision cited by the appellants  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i)  also falls short of <i>requiring</i> a behavioral plan as an ubiquitous feature in every IEP. That statute, in terms, directs IEP teams to \"consider, when appropriate,\" formulating such plans. The record is pellucid that, by the time the August IEP was prepared, the IEP team already had considered and formulated a behavioral plan but had opted not to include it in the IEP pending Crotched Mountain's approval.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the appellants call our attention to a federal regulation, 34 C.F.R. § 300.346(c) (2000), which states: \"If . . . the IEP team determines that a child needs a particular device or service (including an intervention, accommodation, or other program modification) in order for the child to receive FAPE, the IEP team must include a statement to that effect in the child's IEP.\" Although such a regulation is entitled to judicial deference, <i>see </i><i>Greenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N.,</i> 358 F.3d 150, 161 (1st Cir.2004), this regulation did not <i>require</i> the August IEP to encompass a behavioral plan, merely to <i>consider</i> formulating one. Here, the IEP team mulled the matter and determined that a behavioral plan was <i>not</i> necessary in order to afford Stephanie a FAPE. No more was exigible.</p>\n<p>That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. We conclude, without serious question, that the district court did not err in finding that the absence of either a transition or behavioral plan did not constitute a procedural defect within the meaning of the IDEA.</p>\n<p>Once it is determined that the August IEP was complete, the appellants' argument quickly unravels. All that remains is the lack of a <i>signed</i> IEP at the start of the school year. But even in a regime in which parental assent is required before an IEP can become effective, it cannot be that a school system transgresses the IDEA whenever a parent  for whatever reason  refuses to sign a completed IEP before the school year commences. Otherwise, school systems would be at the mercy of obdurate parents  a result plainly at odds with the collaborative relationship fostered by the IDEA framework. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Five Town,</i> 513 F.3d at 285 (\"The development of an IEP is meant to be a collaborative project.\"); <i>MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County,</i> 303 F.3d 523, 535 (4th Cir.2002) (explaining that \"it would be improper to hold [a] School District liable for the procedural violation of failing to have the IEP completed and signed, when that failure was the result of [the parents'] lack of cooperation\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, a parent's obstruction of the IEP process, caused by his or her unreasonable delay in acting upon a completed IEP, can relieve a school system from its obligation to have an assented-to IEP in place at the start of the school year. <i>See </i><i>Doe v. Defendant I,</i> 898 F.2d 1186, 1189 (6th Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 995 (\"The law ought not to abet parties who block assembly of the required team and then, dissatisfied with the ensuing IEP, attempt to jettison it because of problems created by their own obstructionism.\").</p>\n<p>The case at bar presents a paradigmatic example of a situation in which a delay in having a signed IEP in place is fairly laid at the parents' doorstep. On August 16, the School District presented Stephanie's mother with a completed IEP that covered every essential component. From that point forward, the record discloses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> a consistent pattern in which the School District would strive to identify the parents' specific concerns and the parents would refuse to say more than that they wanted further meetings. The School District made numerous attempts to arrange such meetings and succeeded in holding two extended sessions with Stephanie's mother. These meetings proved fruitless: the most that could be gleaned from Mrs. Lessard was her opinion that the proffered IEP was, for some unexplained reason, still \"in the developing stage.\"</p>\n<p>Given this mise-en-scène, we can discern no clear error in the district court's conclusion that whatever delays plagued the signing of Stephanie's 2004-2005 IEP were the product of her mother's own intransigence.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See Lessard,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *7. Those delays, in turn, justified the court in exonerating the School District with respect to the IEP's late implementation. The interactive process constructed by Congress was not intended to deal a trump card to parents bent on prolonging IEP negotiations indefinitely. <i>See </i><i>MM,</i> 303 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p>The appellants object to this finding, citing our remonstrances in <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.</i> There, we cautioned that \"[i]n mounting a challenge to a current or proposed IEP, the most that parents can be expected to do is to point out areas in which the IEP is deficient.\" 321 F.3d at 20. The appellants suggest that, under this precept, they cannot be faulted for having failed to respond to the School District's requests for insight. This suggestion is baseless.</p>\n<p>Line-drawing is often difficult, and in the IEP context it is impossible to draw a precise line separating healthy requests for parental input from impermissible demands that parents do the school system's work. Here the record leaves no doubt as to where along that continuum the present case falls. When the School District contacted Stephanie's mother following her rejection of the August IEP, it asked her to \"state specifically what you agree or disagree with.\" Such an entreaty, which the School District essentially repeated in letters of inquiry sent to her on August 25, October 24, November 16, and November 30, respectively, strikes us as the functional equivalent of a request to point out deficiencies in an IEP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Substantive Objections.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn next to the appellants' substantive objections, which are addressed to the December IEP. We subdivide this discussion into four segments to match the appellants' asseverational array.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Incorrect Legal Standard.</i> The appellants insist that the lower court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard. Specifically, they argue that, in the area of transition services, the <i>Rowley</i> standard has been supplanted by the 1997 amendments to the IDEA, <i>see</i> IDEA Amendments for 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37, but the court failed to recognize this development.</p>\n<p>To put this argument into perspective, we start with the <i>Rowley</i> Court's mandate that IEP components must be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" 458 U.S. at 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034. The appellants contend that Congress, in 1997, raised the bar for IEP transition services, directing that those services must result in actual and substantial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> progress toward integrating disabled children into society.</p>\n<p>Existing precedent forecloses this contention. In <i>Lt. T.B.,</i> the parents advanced a similar though slightly more ambitious thesis; they posited that, given Congress's statement of goals, the 1997 amendments must have replaced the <i>Rowley</i> standard across the board with a requirement that an IEP furnish a disabled child with the \"maximum benefit\" available. 361 F.3d at 83. We flatly rejected that thesis, noting that it had no support in the text of the amendments and that no other court of appeals, post-1997, had exhibited a willingness to scuttle the <i>Rowley</i> standard. <i>Id.</i> For aught that appears, the decision in <i>Lt. T.B.</i> remains good law.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To the interpretive mix presented in <i>Lt. T.B.,</i> the appellants add only an allusion to the amendments' definition of \"transition services.\" In relevant part, the amendments defined that term to mean \"a coordinated set of activities for a student with a disability that is designed within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes movement from school to post-school activities.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(30)(A). The appellants theorize that an \"outcome-oriented process\" must mean a process that actually achieves substantial progress toward that outcome and, thus, the 1997 amendments must to this extent have superseded the <i>Rowley</i> standard.</p>\n<p>The appellants read far too much into Congress's 1997 definition of transition services. It seems obvious to us that the word \"process\" denotes a praxis or procedure; it does not imply a substantive standard or a particular measure of progress. The adjectival phrase \"outcome-oriented\" is similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results; it specifies the perspective that participants in the process should strive to attain but does not establish a standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we decline the appellants' invitation to defenestrate the <i>Rowley</i> standard. The district court did not apply an incorrect legal rule in evaluating the adequacy of the transition services limned in Stephanie's final IEP.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Literacy.</i> The appellants' next claim relates to Stephanie's proposed reading program. In their view, the School District's literacy methodology produced a level of progress categorically beneath what their daughter was capable of attaining. Since superior methodologies were readily available (in particular the LiPS system advocated by Dr. Kemper), the School District's chosen methodology denied Stephanie a FAPE.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to prevail on a claim of this nature. The Supreme Court has pointed out with conspicuous clarity that the IDEA confers primary responsibility upon state and local educational agencies to choose among competing pedagogical methodologies and to select the method most suitable to a particular child's needs. <i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034. Then-Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, added that \"it seems highly unlikely that Congress intended courts to overturn a State's choice of appropriate educational theories in a proceeding conducted pursuant to [the IDEA].\" <i>Id.</i> at 207-08, 102 S.Ct. 3034. After all, courts lack the \"specialized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> knowledge and experience\" needed to resolve \"persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 208, 102 S.Ct. 3034 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \"once a court determines that the requirements of the [IDEA] have been met, questions of methodology are for resolution by the States.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Rowley</i> sends a very clear message. The short of it is that courts are entrusted with ascertaining the adequacy of an IEP's educational components but not with weighing the comparative merit of the components when stacked against other heuristic methods. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lt. T.B.,</i> 361 F.3d at 86; <i>G.D. v. Westmoreland Sch. Dist.,</i> 930 F.2d 942, 948 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>In an effort to expand the scope of judicial intervention, the appellants resort to an esoteric definition of \"appropriate educational theories,\" which they equate with theories that produce results. They do not contest that Stephanie was the beneficiary of a standard, multisensory reading methodology. Nevertheless, they argue that since Dr. Kemper concluded that Stephanie had progressed very little under that methodology, it was, a fortiori, \"inappropriate.\"</p>\n<p>This construct inverts the rule of decision. Actual educational progress can (and sometimes will) demonstrate that an IEP provides a FAPE. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 209-10, 102 S.Ct. 3034; <i>Nack,</i> 454 F.3d at 612; <i>see also </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 991 (explaining that \"actual educational results are relevant to determining the efficacy of educators' policy choices\"). But to impose the inverse of this rule  that a lack of progress necessarily betokens an IEP's inadequacy  would contradict the fundamental concept that \"[a]n IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective.\" <i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 992. Where, as here, a school system develops an IEP component in reliance upon a widely-accepted methodology, an inquiring court ought not to condemn that methodology ex post merely because the disabled child's progress does not meet the parents' or the educators' expectations. <i>See </i><i>Lachman v. Ill. St. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 852 F.2d 290, 297 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  we remark the district court's finding that Stephanie had been making reasonable progress in reading. <i>See Lessard,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *8. That finding is fully supportable: in his testimony at the due process hearing, Stephanie's reading teacher painted a far more positive picture than did Dr. Kemper, testifying that Stephanie had been making steady headway. The hearing officer and the district court were entitled to accept that assessment. After all, levels of progress must be judged with respect to the potential of the particular child. <i>Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermed. Unit 16,</i> 853 F.2d 171, 185 (3d Cir.1988). So here: while the reported progress is modest by most standards, it is reasonable in the context of Stephanie's manifold disabilities and low IQ.</p>\n<p>That disposes of the literacy-related claim. On this record, we are compelled to conclude that, in the subject area of reading, the proffered IEP afforded Stephanie educational benefits consistent with a FAPE.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Transition Services.</i> The appellants voice dissatisfaction with the transition services component of the December IEP. They claim that this component was too generic and that a personalized IEP tailored to Stephanie's needs would necessarily have contained \"relatively intense services in community-based settings to prepare her to be a contributing member of society.\" Appellants' Br. at 43. They acknowledge that the IEP provided for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> monthly field trips into the community, but aver that those trips were inadequate because behavior problems often prevented Stephanie from participating in them.</p>\n<p>In our estimation, the district court did not clearly err in finding the panoply of transition services adequate. <i>See Lessard,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *9. In addition to the scheduled field trips, the December IEP incorporated a wide array of other transition services. These included six hours of pre-vocational training each week and regular instruction in specific transition-related skills (such as using a telephone, identifying workers in community settings, maintaining proper self-hygiene, and preparing food). This regimen apparently had some efficacy; the district court found that Stephanie's transition skills were improving. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the appellants argue that a specific service  activities conducted in community settings  failed adequately to provide educational benefits in an important area of need. Though artfully framed, this argument fails for two reasons. First, in considering the adequacy of a myriad of transition services, an inquiring court must view those services in the aggregate and in light of the child's overall needs. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rettig v. Kent City Sch. Dist.,</i> 788 F.2d 328, 332 (7th Cir.1986). The test is whether the IEP, taken in its entirety, is reasonably calculated to enable the particular child to garner educational benefits. <i>See id.; </i><i>Karl v. Bd. of Educ. of Geneseo Cent. Sch. Dist.,</i> 736 F.2d 873, 877 (2d Cir.1984). Were the law otherwise, parents could endlessly parse IEPs into highly particularized components and circumvent the general rule that parents cannot unilaterally dictate the content of their child's IEP. <i>See </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 207-08, 102 S.Ct. 3034; <i>Lachman,</i> 852 F.2d at 297.</p>\n<p>The second reason why the appellants' argument founders is that the district court concluded that the extant community-oriented services, when evaluated in conjunction with the IEP's other transition services, furnished Stephanie with the requisite educational benefit. <i>Lessard,</i> 2007 WL 1221103, at *9. This finding is not clearly erroneous. While we can accept the possibility that monthly field trips might not be an ideal service component given Stephanie's needs, the IDEA does not require an ideal or optimal IEP, simply an adequate one. <i>See </i><i>Five Town,</i> 513 F.3d at 284-85; <i>Lenn,</i> 998 F.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Behavioral Plan.</i> The appellants' last substantive objection focuses on the supposed inadequacy of the IEP's behavioral plan. This objection fails for reasons already discussed: no behavioral plan is required for purposes of this IEP. <i>See supra</i> Part IV(A); <i>see also </i><i>Alex R.,</i> 375 F.3d at 614.</p>\n<p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>Many judges are parents too, and we can admire the determination with which the appellants have pursued the best possible education for their profoundly disabled daughter. That is as it should be. <i>See </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 209, 102 S.Ct. 3034 (predicting that parents \"will not lack ardor in seeking to ensure that handicapped children receive all of the benefits to which they are entitled by the Act\"). But determination must be tempered by an understanding that school districts, like parents and children, have legal rights with respect to special education. In demanding more than the IDEA requires, the appellants frustrated the operation of a collaborative process and put the School District in an untenable position. Under the circumstances, the School District cannot be faulted either for the timing of the resultant IEP or for its substance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the district court's conclusion that the School District acted in conformity with its responsibilities under the IDEA. Consequently, we descry no basis for granting the appellants' prayer for compensatory education or other redress.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The IDEA was amended by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647, but the relevant amendments did not take effect until July 1, 2005. <i>See id.</i> § 302(a)(1). Because that date is subsequent to the occurrence of the events at issue here, we refer throughout to the earlier version of the IDEA.</p>\n<p>[2]  This was not the first time that Stephanie's parents had balked at signing a newly tendered IEP. Stephanie's 2002-2003 IEP was not signed until June of 2003, and her 2003-2004 IEP was not signed until January of 2004.</p>\n<p>[3]  That statute provides in pertinent part that an IEP must include:\n</p>\n<p>(I) beginning at age 14, and updated annually, a statement of the transition service needs of the child under the applicable components of the child's IEP that focuses on the child's courses of study (such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a vocational education program); [and] (II) beginning at age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by the IEP Team), a statement of needed transition services for the child, including, when appropriate, a statement of the interagency responsibilities or any needed linkages; . . .</p>\n<p>20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p>[4]  We emphasize that the August IEP was complete, and there is no evidence that the appellants' refusal to sign it interfered with Stephanie's receipt of a FAPE (at bottom, they argued only that the absence of a signature constituted a per se violation of the IDEA's requirements). Indeed, during the appellants' negotiations with the other members of the IEP team, the 2003-2004 IEP continued to be fully implemented.</p>\n<p>[5]  In arguing for a contrary result the appellants rely on two cases. Neither decision is persuasive. The first is an unpublished district court decision, <i>J.L. v. Mercer Island Sch. Dist.,</i> 2006 WL 3628033 (W.D.Wash. Dec. 8, 2006). The reasoning of that decision is unconvincing and we decline to follow it. The second, <i>Deal v. Hamilton County Bd. of Educ,</i> 392 F.3d 840, 861-64 (6th Cir.2004), purports to construe the original <i>Rowley</i> standard. The opinion is, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n\n</div>",

After disagreements arose over the contents of the child's proposed individualized education program (IEP), a state hearing officer overruled the parents' objections and concluded that the proposed IEP complied with the strictures of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1491 (2000).<sup>[1]</sup> A federal district court affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p>On appeal, we hold that the defendants  the local school district and the state educational agency  fulfilled their responsibilities under the IDEA, that the delays complained of were attributable to the parents (and, thus, afford no grounds for relief), and that the IEP at issue here satisfied the applicable statutory imperatives. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>At the heart of this litigation stands a young woman named Stephanie Lessard, who was eighteen years of age at the time of the relevant events. We rehearse the facts pertaining to Stephanie's plight as supportably found by the district court. <i>See Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Coop. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *1-4 (D.N.H. Apr. 23, 2007).</p>\n<p>Stephanie Lessard has been diagnosed with moderate mental retardation (she possesses an IQ of 42), cognitive delays, speech impairments, a seizure disorder, scoliosis, a leg-length discrepancy, and partial paralysis of her left side. Since 2001, she has been a day student at Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, a New Hampshire facility providing special needs services to the Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District (the School District).</p>\n<p>In April of 2004, Stephanie's mother, Linda Lessard, met with representatives of the School District to map out Stephanie's IEP for the coming school year (2004-2005). Between that inaugural meeting and December of the same year, Mrs. Lessard and the IEP team huddled on at least four occasions to discuss the IEP, but progress was slow. In the interim, the School District continued to implement Stephanie's 2003-2004 IEP.</p>\n<p>Of particular pertinence for present purposes is the meeting that took place on August 16, 2004. On her own initiative, Mrs. Lessard brought a psycholinguist (Dr. Kemper) to the meeting. He explained to the assemblage why the Lindamood-Bell Phoneme Processing System (LiPS) was in his view the most effective way to teach literacy to a child with learning disabilities as pronounced as Stephanie's. The IEP team declined to adopt that view, noting that none of those assembled was schooled in that particular pedagogical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> methodology. The team nonetheless agreed to look into the matter.</p>\n<p>At the same meeting, the School District gave Mrs. Lessard a proposed IEP for the upcoming school year and requested that she sign it. The IEP did not contain a component specifically addressing the correction of Stephanie's behavioral problems; that component was under ongoing review by personnel at Crotched Mountain. Curiously, a one-page \"transition plan\" (the last page of the IEP) ended abruptly in mid-sentence.</p>\n<p>Lessard refused to sign the proffered IEP.<sup>[2]</sup> After the meeting, the School District sent her a letter requesting that she make clear what portions of the IEP engendered dissatisfaction. The School District also offered to schedule additional meetings to discuss and perhaps reshape the IEP. The Lessards kept their own counsel and did not communicate their specific objections to the IEP.</p>\n<p>Another meeting took place in October. It soon became apparent that a schism existed: whereas the School District envisioned the task at hand to be putting the finishing touches on the proffered IEP, Mrs. Lessard envisioned the IEP process as in its infancy. Yet, despite her evident displeasure, Mrs. Lessard again declined to chronicle any specific criticisms of the IEP as it stood. After the October meeting, the School District again requested by letter that Mrs. Lessard delineate in writing her objections to the proffered IEP. No such delineation ensued.</p>\n<p>Persistent scheduling conflicts prevented the protagonists from reconvening until December 2. At that time, the School District presented a new version of the IEP, which contained both the now-vetted behavioral plan as well as a full-blown transition plan (that is, a plan designed to transition the disabled child into independent, adult life). Mrs. Lessard refused to sign the December IEP, complaining that the team had yet to \"develop[]\" the IEP. This reaction prompted the School District to invoke its right to a due process hearing, <i>see</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.05(c) (2007), as a means of determining the suitability of the recently submitted IEP.</p>\n<p>That hearing took place over two days, during which eight members of the IEP team testified on behalf of the School District. In rebuttal, the parents introduced the expert testimony of a reading specialist and a physical therapist; another literacy expert (Dr. Kemper) testified solely through the medium of written findings. In a decision dated March 22, 2005, the state hearing officer ruled that the December IEP suffered from neither procedural nor substantive faults. He therefore ordered it placed into effect and denied the parents' cross-petition for compensatory education and other relief.</p>\n<p>The Lessards rejoined by filing an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). Their suit raised the same procedural and substantive objections that had been advanced in the due process hearing and sought compensatory education for the alleged deprivation of the free appropriate public education (FAPE) owed to Stephanie Lessard under the IDEA. The suit added a claim that the administrative hearing, as conducted, violated the Lessards' procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p>In the court case, Mrs. Lessard  who had declined to testify before the state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> hearing officer  took the witness stand; otherwise, the evidence before the district court largely replicated the evidence in the administrative record. The district court found no fault with the conduct of the administrative hearing, upheld the hearing officer's findings and conclusions, and denied the Lessards' requests for relief. <i>See Lessard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *11.</p>\n<p>The Lessards, <i>qua</i> appellants, prosecuted this timely appeal. Before us, they do not challenge the district court's resolution of their procedural due process claim. They do, however, press the other objections that were raised below.</p>\n<p>II. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n<p>The IDEA declares that, as a condition for receiving federal funds, states must provide all disabled children with a FAPE. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(8), 1412(a)(1)(A). The primary vehicle for delivery of a FAPE is the child's IEP. The IEP must include, at a bare minimum, the child's present level of educational attainment, the short- and long-term goals for his or her education, objective criteria with which to measure progress toward those goals, and the specific services to be offered. <i>See id.</i> § 1414(d)(1)(A); <i>Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1086 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>An IEP is subject to both procedural and substantive requirements. Those requirements can flow from either federal or state law (at least to the extent that the latter is not incompatible with the former). <i>See </i><i>Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546213\"><a href=\"/opinion/546213/roland-m-and-miriam-m-v-the-concord-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 987 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>As an example of a federally-imposed procedural requirement, the IDEA specifically confers upon parents a right to be part of the \"IEP team,\" that is, the group of individuals charged with formulating a particular child's IEP and which comprises educational professionals who either possess specialized knowledge about or will be involved in the child's education. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B). An example of a state-imposed procedural requirement is the New Hampshire regulation stipulating that parents must annually consent to and sign their child's IEP. <i>See</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.04(a)(3) (2007); <i>cf.</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(3) (imposing the lesser requirement that the school district give notice to the parents of proposed changes to an extant IEP). Federal and state law converge in demanding that an IEP be in effect by the commencement of the school year. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.342(a) (2000); N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1109.08(c) (2007).</p>\n<p>There is no mechanical checklist by which an inquiring court can determine the proper content of an IEP; \"IEPs are by their very nature idiosyncratic.\" <i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781035\"><a href=\"/opinion/781035/maine-school-administrative-district-no-35-v-mr-and-mrs-r-on-their/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003). One thing is clear: the substance of an IEP must be something different than the normal school curriculum and something more than a generic, one-size-fits-all program for children with special needs. In the Supreme Court's phrase, an IEP must be \"individually designed to provide educational benefit to [a particular] handicapped child.\" <i>Hendrick Hudson Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 201, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span> (1982).</p>\n<p>It is worth emphasizing that the obligation to devise a custom-tailored IEP does not imply that a disabled child is entitled to the maximum educational benefit possible. <i>See id.</i> at 206-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An IEP need only supply \"some educational benefit,\" not an optimal or an ideal level of educational benefit, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> in order to survive judicial scrutiny. <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d at 11; <i>see </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 992.</p>\n<p>Serial review mechanisms present the means for enforcing these procedural and substantive rights. By statute, parents may file a complaint with the state educational agency, which must convene a hearing (sometimes called a \"due process hearing\") to pass upon the adequacy of a proposed IEP. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f). Under New Hampshire law, the School District also may pursue a due process hearing to test the validity of a proposed IEP. <i>See</i> N.H.Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed. 1125.05(c) (2007). Either side may then appeal from the hearing officer's final decision to either a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>III. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p>In reviewing the hearing officer's decision, the district court is tasked with determining the IEP's appropriateness on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence. <i>See id.</i> § 1415(i)(2)(B). Judges are not trained pedagogues, and they must accord deference to the state agency's application of its specialized knowledge. <i>See </i><i>Renner v. Bd. of Educ. of Pub. Schs. of Ann Arbor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765399\"><a href=\"/opinion/765399/brian-renner-kim-renner-individually-and-as-parents-and-next-friends-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 641 (6th Cir. 1999) (remarking that \"federal courts are generalists with no expertise in the educational needs of handicapped children\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>González v. P.R. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773709\"><a href=\"/opinion/773709/hector-gonzalez-gricelle-i-nazario-gonzalez-and-gabriel-gonzalez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that a district court, faced with conflicting expert testimony anent educational placement, may justifiably feel \"bound to affirm\" the state agency's determination). As a result, judicial review falls somewhere between the highly deferential clear-error standard and the non-deferential de novo standard. <i>See </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 989; <i>see also </i><i>Nack v. Orange City Sch.

Their procedural objection rests on an allegation that the district court improperly excused the School District's delay in proffering a completed IEP. Their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> substantive objection has twin foci: first, they assert that the district court used an incorrect standard in evaluating the IEP; second, they assert that the final version of the IEP failed to provide for adequate literacy, transition, and behavioral services. We address these objections sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The Procedural Objection.</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants claim that the August IEP was incomplete and that the December IEP was so tardy as to constitute a per se denial of Stephanie's right to a FAPE. In mounting this argument, they emphasize the IDEA's requirement that \"[a]t the beginning of each school year, each local educational agency . . . shall have in effect, for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction, an individualized education program.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>This assault depends entirely on the alleged incompleteness of the August IEP. That allegation is grounded on two perceived shortcomings in that document: the truncated transition plan and the absence of a behavioral plan. The appellants contend that these shortcomings eloquently attest that the August IEP offered Stephanie only a fraction of what she was entitled to receive.</p>\n<p>This contention substantially misconceives what the IDEA requires. The transition plan contained in the August IEP consists solely of background information and performance goals, and suddenly ends mid-sentence. That is hardly a full-fledged transition plan. The rub, however, is that the IDEA does not require a stand-alone transition plan as part of an IEP.</p>\n<p>Sections 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) and (II), reproduced in the margin,<sup>[3]</sup> require that IEPs contain statements of transition services. But neither section requires that those statements be articulated in a separate component of the IEP. In fact, section 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(I) specifically contemplates the inclusion of statements of transition services \"under the applicable components of the child's IEP.\" Thus, merely pointing to the absence of a stand-alone transition plan cannot form the basis for a founded claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the statutory provisions quoted in the margin implicitly acknowledge that transition services must be provided to disabled children who need them, in accordance with the <i>Rowley</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Browell v. Lemahieu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512137\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512137/browell-v-lemahieu/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1126 (D.Haw.2000). Here, however, the appellants have made no claim that the August IEP lacks sufficient transition services (which, in fact, are integrated throughout the IEP's various components). We thus reject the \"transition plan\" claim of error.</p>\n<p>An even more egregious misunderstanding of the IDEA's requirements undermines the claim of procedural error based on a missing behavioral plan. The IDEA only requires a behavioral plan when certain disciplinary actions are taken against a disabled child. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(k)(1)(A) &amp; (B); <i>see also </i><i>Alex R. v. Forrestville Valley Sch. Dist.,</i> 375 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> 603, 614 (7th Cir.2004). The appellants make no claim that the necessary disciplinary predicate had transpired in this instance.</p>\n<p>The other statutory provision cited by the appellants  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i)  also falls short of <i>requiring</i> a behavioral plan as an ubiquitous feature in every IEP. That statute, in terms, directs IEP teams to \"consider, when appropriate,\" formulating such plans. The record is pellucid that, by the time the August IEP was prepared, the IEP team already had considered and formulated a behavioral plan but had opted not to include it in the IEP pending Crotched Mountain's approval.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the appellants call our attention to a federal regulation, 34 C.F.R. § 300.346(c) (2000), which states: \"If . . . the IEP team determines that a child needs a particular device or service (including an intervention, accommodation, or other program modification) in order for the child to receive FAPE, the IEP team must include a statement to that effect in the child's IEP.\" Although such a regulation is entitled to judicial deference, <i>see </i><i>Greenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span>, 161 (1st Cir.2004), this regulation did not <i>require</i> the August IEP to encompass a behavioral plan, merely to <i>consider</i> formulating one. Here, the IEP team mulled the matter and determined that a behavioral plan was <i>not</i> necessary in order to afford Stephanie a FAPE. No more was exigible.</p>\n<p>That effectively ends this aspect of the matter. We conclude, without serious question, that the district court did not err in finding that the absence of either a transition or behavioral plan did not constitute a procedural defect within the meaning of the IDEA.</p>\n<p>Once it is determined that the August IEP was complete, the appellants' argument quickly unravels. All that remains is the lack of a <i>signed</i> IEP at the start of the school year. But even in a regime in which parental assent is required before an IEP can become effective, it cannot be that a school system transgresses the IDEA whenever a parent  for whatever reason  refuses to sign a completed IEP before the school year commences. Otherwise, school systems would be at the mercy of obdurate parents  a result plainly at odds with the collaborative relationship fostered by the IDEA framework. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Five Town,</i> 513 F.3d at 285 (\"The development of an IEP is meant to be a collaborative project.\"); <i>MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779115\"><a href=\"/opinion/779115/mm-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-dm-and-em-and-on-their-own-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, 535 (4th Cir.2002) (explaining that \"it would be improper to hold [a] School District liable for the procedural violation of failing to have the IEP completed and signed, when that failure was the result of [the parents'] lack of cooperation\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, a parent's obstruction of the IEP process, caused by his or her unreasonable delay in acting upon a completed IEP, can relieve a school system from its obligation to have an assented-to IEP in place at the start of the school year. <i>See </i><i>Doe v. Defendant I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538539\"><a href=\"/opinion/538539/john-doe-a-minor-by-and-through-his-parent-and-next-friend-mary-doe-v-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span>, 1189 (6th Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 995 (\"The law ought not to abet parties who block assembly of the required team and then, dissatisfied with the ensuing IEP, attempt to jettison it because of problems created by their own obstructionism.\").</p>\n<p>The case at bar presents a paradigmatic example of a situation in which a delay in having a signed IEP in place is fairly laid at the parents' doorstep. On August 16, the School District presented Stephanie's mother with a completed IEP that covered every essential component. From that point forward, the record discloses <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> a consistent pattern in which the School District would strive to identify the parents' specific concerns and the parents would refuse to say more than that they wanted further meetings. The School District made numerous attempts to arrange such meetings and succeeded in holding two extended sessions with Stephanie's mother. These meetings proved fruitless: the most that could be gleaned from Mrs. Lessard was her opinion that the proffered IEP was, for some unexplained reason, still \"in the developing stage.\"</p>\n<p>Given this mise-en-scène, we can discern no clear error in the district court's conclusion that whatever delays plagued the signing of Stephanie's 2004-2005 IEP were the product of her mother's own intransigence.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See Lessard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *7. Those delays, in turn, justified the court in exonerating the School District with respect to the IEP's late implementation. The interactive process constructed by Congress was not intended to deal a trump card to parents bent on prolonging IEP negotiations indefinitely. <i>See </i><i>MM,</i> 303 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p>The appellants object to this finding, citing our remonstrances in <i>Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.</i> There, we cautioned that \"[i]n mounting a challenge to a current or proposed IEP, the most that parents can be expected to do is to point out areas in which the IEP is deficient.\" 321 F.3d at 20. The appellants suggest that, under this precept, they cannot be faulted for having failed to respond to the School District's requests for insight. This suggestion is baseless.</p>\n<p>Line-drawing is often difficult, and in the IEP context it is impossible to draw a precise line separating healthy requests for parental input from impermissible demands that parents do the school system's work. Here the record leaves no doubt as to where along that continuum the present case falls. When the School District contacted Stephanie's mother following her rejection of the August IEP, it asked her to \"state specifically what you agree or disagree with.\" Such an entreaty, which the School District essentially repeated in letters of inquiry sent to her on August 25, October 24, November 16, and November 30, respectively, strikes us as the functional equivalent of a request to point out deficiencies in an IEP.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Substantive Objections.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We turn next to the appellants' substantive objections, which are addressed to the December IEP. We subdivide this discussion into four segments to match the appellants' asseverational array.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Incorrect Legal Standard.</i> The appellants insist that the lower court erred by applying an incorrect legal standard. Specifically, they argue that, in the area of transition services, the <i>Rowley</i> standard has been supplanted by the 1997 amendments to the IDEA, <i>see</i> IDEA Amendments for 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-17, 111 Stat. 37, but the court failed to recognize this development.</p>\n<p>To put this argument into perspective, we start with the <i>Rowley</i> Court's mandate that IEP components must be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" 458 U.S. at 207, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>. The appellants contend that Congress, in 1997, raised the bar for IEP transition services, directing that those services must result in actual and substantial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> progress toward integrating disabled children into society.</p>\n<p>Existing precedent forecloses this contention. In <i>Lt. T.B.,</i> the parents advanced a similar though slightly more ambitious thesis; they posited that, given Congress's statement of goals, the 1997 amendments must have replaced the <i>Rowley</i> standard across the board with a requirement that an IEP furnish a disabled child with the \"maximum benefit\" available. 361 F.3d at 83. We flatly rejected that thesis, noting that it had no support in the text of the amendments and that no other court of appeals, post-1997, had exhibited a willingness to scuttle the <i>Rowley</i> standard. <i>Id.</i> For aught that appears, the decision in <i>Lt. T.B.</i> remains good law.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To the interpretive mix presented in <i>Lt. T.B.,</i> the appellants add only an allusion to the amendments' definition of \"transition services.\" In relevant part, the amendments defined that term to mean \"a coordinated set of activities for a student with a disability that is designed within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes movement from school to post-school activities.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(30)(A). The appellants theorize that an \"outcome-oriented process\" must mean a process that actually achieves substantial progress toward that outcome and, thus, the 1997 amendments must to this extent have superseded the <i>Rowley</i> standard.</p>\n<p>The appellants read far too much into Congress's 1997 definition of transition services. It seems obvious to us that the word \"process\" denotes a praxis or procedure; it does not imply a substantive standard or a particular measure of progress. The adjectival phrase \"outcome-oriented\" is similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results; it specifies the perspective that participants in the process should strive to attain but does not establish a standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we decline the appellants' invitation to defenestrate the <i>Rowley</i> standard. The district court did not apply an incorrect legal rule in evaluating the adequacy of the transition services limned in Stephanie's final IEP.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Literacy.</i> The appellants' next claim relates to Stephanie's proposed reading program. In their view, the School District's literacy methodology produced a level of progress categorically beneath what their daughter was capable of attaining. Since superior methodologies were readily available (in particular the LiPS system advocated by Dr. Kemper), the School District's chosen methodology denied Stephanie a FAPE.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to prevail on a claim of this nature. The Supreme Court has pointed out with conspicuous clarity that the IDEA confers primary responsibility upon state and local educational agencies to choose among competing pedagogical methodologies and to select the method most suitable to a particular child's needs. <i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 207, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>. Then-Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, added that \"it seems highly unlikely that Congress intended courts to overturn a State's choice of appropriate educational theories in a proceeding conducted pursuant to [the IDEA].\" <i>Id.</i> at 207-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>. After all, courts lack the \"specialized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> knowledge and experience\" needed to resolve \"persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 208, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \"once a court determines that the requirements of the [IDEA] have been met, questions of methodology are for resolution by the States.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Rowley</i> sends a very clear message. The short of it is that courts are entrusted with ascertaining the adequacy of an IEP's educational components but not with weighing the comparative merit of the components when stacked against other heuristic methods. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lt. T.B.,</i> 361 F.3d at 86; <i>G.D. v. Westmoreland Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559501\"><a href=\"/opinion/559501/gd-etc-v-westmoreland-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 948 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>In an effort to expand the scope of judicial intervention, the appellants resort to an esoteric definition of \"appropriate educational theories,\" which they equate with theories that produce results. They do not contest that Stephanie was the beneficiary of a standard, multisensory reading methodology. Nevertheless, they argue that since Dr. Kemper concluded that Stephanie had progressed very little under that methodology, it was, a fortiori, \"inappropriate.\"</p>\n<p>This construct inverts the rule of decision. Actual educational progress can (and sometimes will) demonstrate that an IEP provides a FAPE. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 209-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>; <i>Nack,</i> 454 F.3d at 612; <i>see also </i><i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 991 (explaining that \"actual educational results are relevant to determining the efficacy of educators' policy choices\"). But to impose the inverse of this rule  that a lack of progress necessarily betokens an IEP's inadequacy  would contradict the fundamental concept that \"[a]n IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective.\" <i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 992. Where, as here, a school system develops an IEP component in reliance upon a widely-accepted methodology, an inquiring court ought not to condemn that methodology ex post merely because the disabled child's progress does not meet the parents' or the educators' expectations. <i>See </i><i>Lachman v. Ill. St. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509040\"><a href=\"/opinion/509040/ronald-lachman-and-mary-ann-lachman-on-behalf-of-benjamin-lachman-a-minor/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 297 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  we remark the district court's finding that Stephanie had been making reasonable progress in reading. <i>See Lessard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *8. That finding is fully supportable: in his testimony at the due process hearing, Stephanie's reading teacher painted a far more positive picture than did Dr. Kemper, testifying that Stephanie had been making steady headway. The hearing officer and the district court were entitled to accept that assessment. After all, levels of progress must be judged with respect to the potential of the particular child. <i>Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermed. Unit 16,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509546\"><a href=\"/opinion/509546/polk-ronald-and-polk-cindy-parents-and-natural-guardians-of-christopher/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 185 (3d Cir.1988). So here: while the reported progress is modest by most standards, it is reasonable in the context of Stephanie's manifold disabilities and low IQ.</p>\n<p>That disposes of the literacy-related claim. On this record, we are compelled to conclude that, in the subject area of reading, the proffered IEP afforded Stephanie educational benefits consistent with a FAPE.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Transition Services.</i> The appellants voice dissatisfaction with the transition services component of the December IEP. They claim that this component was too generic and that a personalized IEP tailored to Stephanie's needs would necessarily have contained \"relatively intense services in community-based settings to prepare her to be a contributing member of society.\" Appellants' Br. at 43. They acknowledge that the IEP provided for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> monthly field trips into the community, but aver that those trips were inadequate because behavior problems often prevented Stephanie from participating in them.</p>\n<p>In our estimation, the district court did not clearly err in finding the panoply of transition services adequate. <i>See Lessard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *9. In addition to the scheduled field trips, the December IEP incorporated a wide array of other transition services. These included six hours of pre-vocational training each week and regular instruction in specific transition-related skills (such as using a telephone, identifying workers in community settings, maintaining proper self-hygiene, and preparing food). This regimen apparently had some efficacy; the district court found that Stephanie's transition skills were improving. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the appellants argue that a specific service  activities conducted in community settings  failed adequately to provide educational benefits in an important area of need. Though artfully framed, this argument fails for two reasons. First, in considering the adequacy of a myriad of transition services, an inquiring court must view those services in the aggregate and in light of the child's overall needs. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rettig v. Kent City Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468583\"><a href=\"/opinion/468583/thomas-m-rettig-eva-o-rettig-cross-appellants-v-kent-city-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 332 (7th Cir.1986). The test is whether the IEP, taken in its entirety, is reasonably calculated to enable the particular child to garner educational benefits. <i>See id.; </i><i>Karl v. Bd. of Educ. of Geneseo Cent. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437243\"><a href=\"/opinion/437243/lisa-karl-by-her-parents-and-natural-guardians-harold-and-virginia-karl/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></a></span>, 877 (2d Cir.1984). Were the law otherwise, parents could endlessly parse IEPs into highly particularized components and circumvent the general rule that parents cannot unilaterally dictate the content of their child's IEP. <i>See </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 207-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span>; <i>Lachman,</i> 852 F.2d at 297.</p>\n<p>The second reason why the appellants' argument founders is that the district court concluded that the extant community-oriented services, when evaluated in conjunction with the IEP's other transition services, furnished Stephanie with the requisite educational benefit. <i>Lessard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1221103</span></span>, at *9. This finding is not clearly erroneous. While we can accept the possibility that monthly field trips might not be an ideal service component given Stephanie's needs, the IDEA does not require an ideal or optimal IEP, simply an adequate one. <i>See </i><i>Five Town,</i> 513 F.3d at 284-85; <i>Lenn,</i> 998 F.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Behavioral Plan.</i> The appellants' last substantive objection focuses on the supposed inadequacy of the IEP's behavioral plan. This objection fails for reasons already discussed: no behavioral plan is required for purposes of this IEP. <i>See supra</i> Part IV(A); <i>see also </i><i>Alex R.,</i> 375 F.3d at 614.</p>\n<p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>Many judges are parents too, and we can admire the determination with which the appellants have pursued the best possible education for their profoundly disabled daughter. That is as it should be. <i>See </i><i>Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. at 209, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3034</span></a></span> (predicting that parents \"will not lack ardor in seeking to ensure that handicapped children receive all of the benefits to which they are entitled by the Act\"). But determination must be tempered by an understanding that school districts, like parents and children, have legal rights with respect to special education. In demanding more than the IDEA requires, the appellants frustrated the operation of a collaborative process and put the School District in an untenable position. Under the circumstances, the School District cannot be faulted either for the timing of the resultant IEP or for its substance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the district court's conclusion that the School District acted in conformity with its responsibilities under the IDEA. Consequently, we descry no basis for granting the appellants' prayer for compensatory education or other redress.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The IDEA was amended by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub.L.

Stephanie's 2002-2003 IEP was not signed until June of 2003, and her 2003-2004 IEP was not signed until January of 2004.</p>\n<p>[3]  That statute provides in pertinent part that an IEP must include:\n</p>\n<p>(I) beginning at age 14, and updated annually, a statement of the transition service needs of the child under the applicable components of the child's IEP that focuses on the child's courses of study (such as participation in advanced-placement courses or a vocational education program); [and] (II) beginning at age 16 (or younger, if determined appropriate by the IEP Team), a statement of needed transition services for the child, including, when appropriate, a statement of the interagency responsibilities or any needed linkages; . . .</p>\n<p>20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p>[4]  We emphasize that the August IEP was complete, and there is no evidence that the appellants' refusal to sign it interfered with Stephanie's receipt of a FAPE (at bottom, they argued only that the absence of a signature constituted a per se violation of the IDEA's requirements). Indeed, during the appellants' negotiations with the other members of the IEP team, the 2003-2004 IEP continued to be fully implemented.</p>\n<p>[5]  In arguing for a contrary result the appellants rely on two cases. Neither decision is persuasive. The first is an unpublished district court decision, <i>J.L. v. Mercer Island Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3628033</span></span> (W.D.Wash. Dec. 8, 2006). The reasoning of that decision is unconvincing and we decline to follow it. The second, <i>Deal v. Hamilton County Bd. of Educ,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788676\"><a href=\"/opinion/788676/maureen-deal-phillip-deal-parents-on-behalf-of-zachary-deal-v-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span>, 861-64 (6th Cir.2004), purports to construe the original <i>Rowley</i> standard. The opinion is, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n\n</div>",
