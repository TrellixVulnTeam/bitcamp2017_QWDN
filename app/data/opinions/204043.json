Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n            Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Steven M. Potolsky for appellant Catalán-Roman.\n     David Abraham Silva for appellant Medina-Villegas.\n     Maria A. Dominguez-Victoriano and Thomas Klumper, Assistant\nUnited States Attorneys, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez,\nUnited States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 23, 2009\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      Appellants Lorenzo Catalán-Roman\n\n(\"Catalán\") and Hernaldo Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\") were convicted\n\nafter a jury trial of several counts relating to a conspiracy to\n\nrob armored vehicles and the shooting death of an armored vehicle\n\nguard, Gilberto Rodríguez-Cabrera (\"Rodríguez\"), which occurred\n\nduring a robbery committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n           This appeal requires us to consider Catalán's claim that\n\nhis constitutional rights were violated when the district court\n\nprevented him from introducing extrinsic evidence to impeach a key\n\ngovernment witness.        In addition, Catalán challenges: 1) the\n\ncourt's denial of his request to sever his trial from that of\n\nMedina, 2) restrictions on cross-examination, and 3) its decision\n\nto quash a subpoena for the tax records of the victimized armored\n\ncar company and its owner.       He also challenges his convictions on\n\ncounts two, eight, and nine on double jeopardy grounds.\n\n           Medina challenges: 1) the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the convictions on counts five and six (the carjacking\n\ncharges) and eight (the murder charge), 2) the court's failure to\n\nallow him the opportunity for allocution before sentencing him to\n\nlife   imprisonment   on   the   murder   charge,    and   3)   the   court's\n\ncalculation of the guideline sentencing range on the murder charge.\n\n           The government concedes that the convictions on counts\n\neight and nine violated double jeopardy.            It also concedes that\n\nMedina must be re-sentenced on count eight because he was not\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fallowed the opportunity to allocute for that count.        After careful\n\nconsideration, we reject appellants' other claims.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           We   recount   the   pertinent   facts   in   the   light   most\n\nfavorable to the jury's verdict.        United States v. Cruz-Diaz, 550\n\nF.3d 169, 171 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nA.   The November 30 Armed Robbery\n\n           On November 30, 2001, James Cruz-Matias (\"Cruz\"), an\n\narmored truck guard working for Ranger American Armored Services\n\n(\"Ranger\"), was robbed at gunpoint while making a delivery of cash\n\nfor his employer to the Saulo D. Rodriguez Credit Union in Gurabo,\n\nPuerto Rico.    That day, Cruz worked as the messenger in a two-man\n\nteam.   As such, he had to carry the cash from the truck to the\n\nbank.   His co-worker, Eluber Torres-Alejandro (\"Torres\"), was the\n\ndriver and remained inside the truck during the delivery.         As Cruz\n\ncarried a bag containing $180,000 toward the door of the credit\n\nunion, a man who had been waiting by the credit union's ATM\n\napproached him, pointed a gun at his face, and demanded the money.\n\nTwo other assailants then appeared, also pointing guns toward\n\nCruz's head.    Cruz gave them the money.    Before leaving, one of the\n\nassailants took Cruz's pistol from its holster, cocked it, and\n\npointed it at Cruz's face.       Instead of pulling the trigger, the\n\nassailants left with the gun and the $180,000, fleeing the parking\n\nlot in a gray or blue Jeep Cherokee Laredo.              Soon after the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\frobbery, Gurabo municipal police recovered nearby a burned-out blue\n\nCherokee Laredo that had been carjacked from its owner two days\n\nbefore the robbery.        Six fingerprints matching Medina's were\n\nretrieved from a newspaper left near the ATM, where the first\n\nassailant had been waiting just before the robbery. At trial, Cruz\n\nidentified Medina as the first assailant.\n\nB.   The March 6 Attempted Armed Robbery\n\n              On March 6, 2002, several men attempted to rob two Ranger\n\nguards. Torres was again working that day, acting this time as the\n\nmessenger while his partner, Rodríguez, drove the truck. As Torres\n\ncarried a bag containing $300,000 from the armored truck to the\n\ndoor of the Valenciano Credit Union in Juncos, Puerto Rico, a man\n\nappeared and walked towards him in the parking lot.       The man made\n\na gesture toward his waist, revealing a firearm tucked in his\n\nwaistband.      Torres and Rodríguez both pulled out their own weapons\n\nand pointed them towards the man, who had pulled out the pistol and\n\nmanaged to point it at Torres.       Apparently realizing that he was\n\noutnumbered, the man turned and ran away.       Torres saw a two-toned\n\nmotorcycle and a blue Chevrolet Lumina depart from the parking\n\nlot.1       At trial, Torres identified Catalán as the man who had\n\nwalked toward him in the parking lot and flashed a weapon before\n\nfleeing.\n\n\n        1\n        David Morales-Machuca (\"Morales\"), an indicted co-\nconspirator, drove a blue Chevy Lumina, and Medina drove a two-\ntoned motorcycle.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fC.   The March 26 Carjacking\n\n            On    March   26,   2002,      while    parked   in     his   green     Ford\n\nExplorer outside his daughter's house and talking with her, Armando\n\nJulía-Diaz (\"Julía\") was approached by two assailants, one of whom\n\npointed a nickel-plated pistol at him and demanded he turn over the\n\nvehicle.2       The two assailants stole the Explorer, along with a\n\nblack,    9mm    Glock    pistol    that     Julía    had    kept    in     the   glove\n\ncompartment.\n\nD.   The March 27 Armed Robbery and Murder\n\n            The next day, on March 27, 2002, Ranger guards Torres and\n\nRodríguez   were    assigned       to   deliver     $100,000    to    the    Saulo   D.\n\nRodríguez credit union in Gurabo.              Torres, the driver, remained in\n\nthe truck while Rodríguez, the messenger, exited with the money and\n\nwalked towards the credit union.                   As Rodríguez approached the\n\nentrance, an assailant appeared and pointed a black, 9mm Glock\n\npistol at his face and chest.               A second assailant then appeared\n\ncarrying a Beretta semi-automatic firearm.                     At trial, Torres\n\nidentified the first assailant as Medina and the second as Catalán.\n\nRodríguez raised his hands above his head in an act of surrender.\n\nAs   Catalán     attempted   to     remove     Rodríguez's     firearm       from    its\n\nholster, Medina fired two shots at Rodríguez.                  Torres then opened\n\nthe door of the armored truck and began firing at Catalán, who was\n\n\n\n      2\n        According to Morales's ex-girlfriend, who testified at\ntrial, Morales always carried a nickel-plated pistol.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fhit and fell to the ground.   Torres was shot in the left hand by a\n\nfourth     indicted    co-conspirator,    Quester    Sterling-Suarez\n\n(\"Sterling\").     Torres fell back into the truck and closed its\n\ndoors.\n\n            Medina took the money and fled the scene in a green Ford\n\nExplorer, leaving the injured Catalán behind.     Rodríguez was still\n\nalive at this point.    According to Torres, Rodríguez pleaded for\n\nhis life just before Catalán, seated on the ground nearby, picked\n\nup his Beretta firearm and fired it several times into him.\n\nSterling then arrived and tried to help Catalán, but fled the scene\n\nalone when police arrived.3   Catalán was apprehended at the scene,\n\nseriously wounded and still holding the Beretta.      Rodríguez died\n\nsoon thereafter, having received a total of eight gunshot wounds,\n\nthree of which would have proven fatal even independent of the\n\nother wounds.   One of the fatal wounds came from Medina's 9mm Glock\n\n(the gun that had been stolen from Julía the day before), while the\n\nother two came from Catalán's Beretta.        At the scene, the FBI\n\nobtained shell casings, bullet fragments, and bullets that matched\n\nCatalán's Beretta and Medina's Glock.        Not far from the credit\n\nunion, police recovered Julía's stolen green Ford Explorer with its\n\ndoors open, the engine running, and a small tank of gasoline\n\nnearby.     Inside the vehicle, they recovered the stolen Glock 9mm\n\npistol used by Medina during the robbery.\n\n\n     3\n         Sterling was quickly apprehended.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          Shortly   after    the   robbery,   Morales   picked   up    his\n\ngirlfriend,   Jocelyn   Serrano-Castro    (\"Serrano\"),    in   his    blue\n\nChevrolet Lumina.   She spent the day with him, during which time he\n\nswitched the car he was driving, retrieved a pistol hidden behind\n\na highway mile marker, and conversed with a fifth co-conspirator,\n\nPablo Sanchez-Rodríguez (\"Sanchez\"), about \"getting rid\" of the\n\nblue Lumina. At six o'clock that evening, Serrano observed Morales\n\nretrieve a sack of cash from Sanchez and buy new cell phones with\n\nsome of the cash.   Several days after the robbery, she went with\n\nMorales to visit appellant Medina at his home.     Medina and his wife\n\nhad bought all new furniture.       Medina told Serrano that he had\n\n\"scored a robbery and that they had to take everything out and\n\nbring in everything new.\"\n\n          The FBI arrested Medina on April 2, 2002.        The vehicle\n\nMedina was driving at the time of his arrest had three newspaper\n\narticles about the March 27 robbery in the glove compartment.\n\nAfter his arrest, he was housed in the same prison cell as Miguel\n\nAlamo-Castro (\"Alamo\").     At trial, Alamo testified that while they\n\nwere cellmates Medina had revealed several incriminating details\n\nabout the conspiracy to rob Ranger vehicles.      For example, Medina\n\ntold Alamo that he had carjacked a green Ford Explorer from a man\n\nand his daughter the night before the March 27 robbery, stealing a\n\n9 mm Glock in the process.    He said that he had participated in the\n\nshootout during the March 27 robbery and that the FBI had recovered\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthe gun he had used from the seat of the stolen Explorer after the\n\nrobbery.   Medina also told Alamo that he was going to use the\n\nrobbery money to buy furniture and remodel his home, among other\n\nthings.\n\nE.   The Indictment and Trial\n\n           Approximately one year later, on March 14, 2003, a grand\n\njury returned a ten-count second superseding indictment charging\n\nCatalán, Medina, Morales, Sterling, and Sanchez with conspiracy to\n\nrob armored vehicles and a number of substantive offenses related\n\nto the conspiracy.    Specifically, both Catalán and Medina were\n\ncharged with: conspiracy to commit robbery of an armored vehicle,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3) (count one), aiding and\n\nabetting the use of a firearm in relation to the conspiracy in\n\ncount one, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count\n\ntwo),4 aiding and abetting the March 27 robbery of an armored\n\nvehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count seven),\n\naiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit a crime of\n\nviolence (the March 27 robbery) that resulted in the unlawful\n\nkilling of Rodríguez, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) and 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 1111 (count eight), and aiding and abetting the use of\n\na firearm to commit a crime of violence (the March 27 robbery), in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count nine).    In\n\n\n      4\n       18 U.S.C. § 2, included in all of the aiding and abetting\ncharges, makes it illegal to aid and abet the commission of a\nfederal offense.\n\n                                -8-\n\faddition, Medina was also charged with aiding and abetting the\n\nNovember 30, 2001 robbery of an armored vehicle in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count three), aiding and abetting the use of\n\na firearm to commit the November 30 robbery, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3) (count four), aiding and abetting the March\n\n26, 2002 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2119(1) (count\n\nfive), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit the\n\nMarch 26 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3)\n\n(count six).   There were no charges based on the attempted robbery\n\nof March 6, 2002, nor was that attempted robbery cited as an overt\n\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n          Jury selection began on January 25, 2005 and lasted\n\nthirteen days.   Three days before trial, Catalán moved to exclude\n\nevidence that he was involved in the March 6, 2002 attempted\n\nrobbery or, alternatively, for the severance of his trial from\n\nMedina's. He claimed that if the trials were severed, Medina would\n\ntestify that Catalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt.\n\nAfter an in camera conference with Medina's lawyer during which the\n\nlawyer made a proffer of his client's expected testimony, the court\n\ndenied the motion.\n\n          Trial began on March 7, 2005.   At the conclusion of the\n\ngovernment's case, both appellants moved for judgment of acquittal\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.    The district\n\ncourt denied their motions.   At the start of appellants' case, the\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fgovernment moved to exclude the testimony of several witnesses whom\n\nthe   defendants   intended    to   call    to    impeach   the   testimony   of\n\nTorres, the armored car guard who was shot in the hand during the\n\nMarch 27 robbery.    After hearing argument on the matter, the court\n\ngranted the government's motion in part, excluding the impeachment\n\ntestimony of five law enforcement officers.\n\n            On March 16, government witness Juan Bravo-Hernandez\n\n(\"Bravo\") moved to quash a subpoena for tax records that had been\n\nissued at the request of defendants.               Bravo, the president and\n\nowner of Ranger American Armored Services, had been subpoenaed to\n\nproduce Ranger's corporate tax returns as well as his personal tax\n\nreturns.    The trial court granted the motion to quash, determining\n\nthat the tax documents could not be relevant to the interstate\n\nnexus inquiry,5 which had already been established through Bravo's\n\ntestimony and could not possibly be affected by any information\n\ncontained in either the company's or Bravo's own tax returns.\n\n            After completing their evidence, appellants again moved\n\nfor a judgment of acquittal, and the trial court again denied their\n\nmotions.     The jury found each appellant guilty of every count\n\ncharged against him.        Because the defendants had been previously\n\ncertified   as   eligible    for    the   death    penalty,   the   trial   then\n\n\n      5\n        18 U.S.C. § 1951, under which appellants were charged,\ncriminalizes only those robberies which \"obstruct[], delay[], or\naffect[]\" interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3). See infra\nPart II(B).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fproceeded to the death penalty phase, which lasted fifteen days.\n\nThe same jury that decided appellants' guilt decided whether to\n\nimpose the death penalty.     At the conclusion of the penalty phase\n\nevidence, the jury did not agree to impose the death penalty upon\n\neither defendant.    18 U.S.C.A. § 3593(e)(3).         In special verdict\n\nforms, it asked the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment\n\nwithout parole for Catalán and indicated that it could not agree to\n\ninstruct the court to impose a life sentence for Medina.6         Instead,\n\nthe jury left Medina's sentence to the judge but indicated that it\n\nunderstood   that   the   judge   would   impose   a   sentence   of   life\n\nimprisonment without parole.      For count eight, the murder charge,\n\nthe district court imposed on each defendant a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment without possibility of parole; it later also imposed\n\nsentences for each of the other convictions.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          We first confront Catalán's challenges to his convictions\n\nand sentence.   Again, he challenges 1) the trial court's denial of\n\nhis request to sever his trial from that of Medina, 2) the trial\n\ncourt's rulings restricting impeachment of Torres, including the\n\n     6\n         Under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3591 et seq., \"[u]pon a recommendation under section 3593(e) that\nthe defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment\nwithout possibility of release, the court shall sentence the\ndefendant accordingly.     Otherwise, the court shall impose any\nlesser sentence that is authorized by law.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3594; see\nalso Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 377-79 (1999)\n(describing jury's role in imposing death penalty pursuant to the\nFederal Death Penalty Act).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcourt's decision to exclude extrinsic evidence that would allegedly\n\nimpeach Torres's testimony, 3) the trial court's decision to quash\n\nthe subpoena for tax records, and 4) the convictions on counts two,\n\neight, and nine on double jeopardy grounds.\n\nA.   Severance\n\n           During jury selection, the defendants learned for the\n\nfirst time that the government planned to introduce testimony from\n\nTorres identifying Catalán as having been involved in the March 6\n\nattempted robbery.           Two-and-a-half weeks later, and four days\n\nbefore   trial    was   to    commence,   Catalán   moved   to   exclude   the\n\nevidence, or alternatively, to sever his trial from that of Medina.\n\nHe argued that if severance were granted, Medina would testify that\n\nCatalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt.            However, if\n\nseverance were not granted it would be unfair for the government to\n\npresent Torres's testimony about Catalán's involvement, as Catalán\n\nwould not be able to rebut that account through Medina's testimony.\n\nIn a hearing on the motion,          Medina's lawyer confirmed that his\n\nclient would testify for Catalán if the trials were severed.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the judge held an in camera conference with\n\nMedina's lawyer, who made a proffer of his client's expected\n\ntestimony.       The court then denied the motion to exclude the\n\nevidence and the alternative motion for severance.               Catalán now\n\nchallenges the denial of his motion for severance.\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f           We review the court's denial of a motion for severance\n\nfor manifest abuse of discretion, United States v. DeCologero, 530\n\nF.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir. 2008), and affirm the lower court's decision\n\nunless the defendant makes a strong and convincing showing that\n\nprejudice resulted from the denial of severance, United States v.\n\nRichardson,   515     F.3d   74,   81   (1st      Cir.   2008).      Defendants\n\nchallenging the denial of severance must meet this high barrier on\n\nappeal because, as we have explained, in the normal course of\n\nevents   \"[p]ersons    who   are   indicted    together     should    be   tried\n\ntogether, since this practice helps both to prevent inconsistent\n\nverdicts and to conserve resources (judicial and prosecutorial).\"\n\nUnited States v. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n           In deciding the motion for severance based on the alleged\n\nneed for the testimony of a co-defendant, district courts are to\n\nemploy the two-tiered analysis set forth in United States v.\n\nDrougas, 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 1984).           To meet the first tier of\n\nthat test, a defendant must demonstrate: \"(1) a bona fide need for\n\nthe   testimony;    (2)   the   substance    of    the   testimony;    (3)   its\n\nexculpatory nature and effect; and (4) that the co-defendant will\n\nin fact testify if the cases are severed.\"           United States v. Smith,\n\n46 F.3d 1223, 1231 (1st Cir. 1995).         If the defendant can make that\n\nshowing, the court should move on to the second tier of the Drougas\n\nanalysis and \"(1) examine the significance of the testimony in\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\frelation to the defendant's theory of defense; (2) consider whether\n\nthe    testimony         would     be   subject   to    substantial,     damaging\n\nimpeachment; (3) assess the counter arguments of judicial economy;\n\nand (4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.\"                   Smith, 46\n\nF.2d at 1231.\n\n               Focusing on a first tier factor, the district court\n\nemphasized that Catalán had \"failed to make a detailed proffer for\n\nthis       court   to   evaluate    the   exculpatory    nature    of   [Medina's]\n\ntestimony.\"        Given that Catalán was not charged with the March 6\n\nattempted robbery, a proffer about the evidence's \"exculpatory\n\nnature\" would have been especially important to the district\n\ncourt's analysis. This is particularly so because the focus of the\n\ngovernment's case against Catalán, naturally, was on the overt act\n\ncharged against him in the indictment: the March 27 robbery and\n\nmurder of Rodríguez. The government's strong evidence of Catalán's\n\ninvolvement in that robbery and the general conspiracy to rob\n\narmored       truck     guards   included   damning     physical   evidence    and\n\ntestimony linking Catalán to the scene of Rodríguez's murder, where\n\nCatalán had assisted the robbery and was apprehended holding the\n\nmurder weapon.7           Without a detailed proffer of the exculpatory\n\n\n       7\n       Beyond asserting that Torres's testimony about the March 6\nincident was \"highly beneficial to the government on the issues of\npremeditation and participation in the conspiracy,\" Catalán does\nnot develop an argument that, if the jury were to disbelieve Torres\nthat Catalán was involved in the March 6 attempt, the substantial\nevidence of his participation in the March 27 robbery would have\nbeen insufficient to convict him of the conspiracy (count one) or\n\n                                          -14-\n\fnature of testimony about the March 6 attempted robbery, the\n\ndistrict court was well within its discretion to conclude that\n\nCatalán had not shown a \"bona fide need for the testimony.\"    Smith,\n\n46 F.3d at 1231.\n\n            Although it concluded that Catalán had not met the first\n\ntier of the Drougas analysis, the district court nonetheless\n\nproceeded to explain that he had also not met the second tier.     In\n\nparticular, the court emphasized the untimeliness of the motion,\n\nthe highly impeachable nature of the testimony, and Catalán's lack\n\nof an explanation of the testimony's significance to his defense.\n\nId.; see also, Smith, 46 F.3d 1231 (\"Judicial economy is obviously\n\nnot dispositive, but it is important in a lengthy conspiracy\n\ntrial.\").     There was no manifest abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's denial of the motion.\n\nB.   Order to Quash the Subpoena for Tax Returns\n\n            Catalán objects to the district court's grant of Bravo's\n\nmotion to quash a subpoena for his personal tax records and the tax\n\nrecords of his company, Ranger American Armored Security.      A trial\n\ncourt may quash an \"unreasonable or oppressive\" subpoena, and we\n\nreview the trial court's decision to quash for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Henry, 482 F.3d    27, 30 (1st. Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\naiding and abetting the use of a firearm in furtherance of the\nconspiracy (count two). Because this argument is not developed\n\"beyond a cursory mention,\" Cao v. Puerto Rico, 525 F.3d 112, 114\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2008), we deem it to be waived.\n\n                                -15-\n\f            The defendants were indicted under the Hobbs Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1951(a), which criminalizes robberies that have an effect\n\non interstate commerce.     United States v. Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d\n\n3, 7 (1st Cir. 2006).       At trial, Bravo testified at length about\n\nthe products his business regularly purchases from the mainland\n\nUnited    States   (such   as   specially   equipped   armored   vehicles,\n\nweapons, and high-tech carrier's money bags).          He also testified\n\nthat the company was forced to pay high deductibles after each\n\nrobbery, totaling $75,000, and explained that its insurer raised\n\nboth its premium and deductible as a result of the robberies.\n\n            The defendants sought the personal and corporate tax\n\nrecords of Bravo and his company to challenge the government's\n\nassertion that the robberies affected interstate commerce.             The\n\ntrial court granted Bravo's motion to quash, determining that the\n\ntax records could not be relevant to the question whether the\n\nrobbery sufficiently affected interstate commerce. In granting the\n\nmotion, the court relied on this circuit's settled case law that a\n\nrobbery need only have \"a realistic probability of a de minimus\n\neffect on interstate commerce\" to bring it within the reach of the\n\nHobbs Act.    United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (quoting United States v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).    \"One common method for the government to establish the\n\nrequired 'de minimis' effect on interstate commerce is to show that\n\nthe defendant's activity 'minimally depletes the assets of an\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fentity doing business in interstate commerce.'\"     Capozzi, 347 F.3d\n\nat 337 (quoting United States v. Nguyen, 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st. Cir.\n\n2001)).\n\n          We agree that Bravo's testimony about his company's\n\nparticipation   in   interstate   commerce   (including   its   regular\n\npurchases of carrier money bags, weapons, and vehicles from the\n\nUnited States), combined with his testimony about the financial\n\neffects of the robberies, was sufficient to establish a de minimus\n\neffect on interstate commerce so as to bring the robberies within\n\nthe reach of the Hobbs Act.   We also agree that nothing in Bravo's\n\npersonal or corporate tax returns could have negated the interstate\n\nnexus proven through Bravo's testimony, even if the company's\n\nbottom line was unchanged from -- or, for that matter, even if it\n\nimproved over -- that of years past.     See, e.g., Capozzi, 347 F.3d\n\nat 337 (de minimis effect established when defendant had threatened\n\nto extort $4,000 from a car dealer who participated in interstate\n\ncommerce and a jury could have reasonably concluded that if the\n\ndefendant had been successful the business's assets and purchasing\n\npower would have been at least temporarily depleted by $4,000).\n\nTherefore, there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nexercise of its power to quash unreasonable subpoenas.8\n\n\n     8\n       Catalán also complains that the district court's order\nquashing the Bravo subpoena denied him his Sixth Amendment right\n\"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\"\nU.S. Const. Amend. VI. This constitutional claim was not raised at\ntrial, and we therefore review it for plain error. United States\n\n                                  -17-\n\fC.    Restrictions on Impeachment9\n\n1.    Background\n\n            Catalán claims that his Sixth Amendment right to confront\n\nthe   witnesses    against    him   and   his   Due   Process   rights   were\n\nunconstitutionally impeded by the trial court's refusal to allow\n\nhim to introduce extrinsic evidence that would have contradicted\n\nthe    testimony   of   the   government's      key   eyewitness,   Torres.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that he should have been permitted to\n\nintroduce the testimony of several FBI agents who would have\n\nimpeached Torres's trial account of the robberies and the murder.\n\nCatalán claims that the agents' excluded testimony was \"crucial to\n\nthe defense theory\" because he \"wished to argue . . . that Torres\n\nAlejandro was unworthy of belief because (among other reasons) he\n\ndramatically changed his version of events very shortly before\n\ntrial, adding new and highly aggravating details.\"\n\n            Catalán names five FBI agents whom he should have been\n\nallowed to call at trial.           Agents Angel Marrero and María Cruz\n\ninterviewed Torres shortly after the March 27 robbery, while he was\n\nin the hospital.    Marrero and Cruz took notes of their interview in\n\n\nv. Rodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 38 (1st. Cir. 2009). Given our\nview about the minimal relevance of the tax records to the\ninterstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act charges, there was no\ndenial of Catalán's constitutional right to have compulsory process\nfor obtaining witnesses in his favor.\n       9\n      The discussion from section C.1 through section C.5 reflects\nthe views of the writing judge only. My colleagues express their\nseparate views in the concurrence that follows this opinion.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fan official FBI FD-302 Form (\"302\"), a form for reporting and\n\nsummarizing such an interview. United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez,\n\n570 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam).               The 302 of their\n\ninterview,   which   purports   to    record   Torres's    account   of   the\n\nrobbery, does not mention certain details which Torres gave in his\n\ntrial testimony and which Catalán claims \"were directly relevant to\n\nthe government's theory of premeditation and death penalty.\"              For\n\nexample, the 302 does not mention that Rodríguez pleaded for his\n\nlife and held up his arms to shield himself before Catalán shot him\n\nseveral times at \"point blank range,\" or that Catalán glanced\n\ndefiantly at Torres before taking that action.10            Catalán argued\n\nbelow and argues again on appeal that the agents' testimony about\n\nthe March 27 incident would have undermined Torres's credibility\n\nthrough impeachment by omission, because Torres would not have left\n\nout such important details in his first interview if they were\n\n\n     10\n        In his brief, Catalán also claims that Agents Marrero and\nCruz would have been able to impeach Torres's trial account of the\nMarch 6 attempted robbery.     As far as can be discerned from the\nrecord (appellant gives us no citations other than an unidentified\nquotation, and the agents' report is not included in the record),\nthis is a misleading statement of the evidence. At no time during\nthe extensive discussions and arguments over this matter during\ntrial -- not even when the defendants made a proffer about Agent\nCruz's testimony -- was it suggested that Marrero or Cruz had ever\ndiscussed the March 6 attempt with Torres.        The record does\nindicate, however, that FBI agent José Rios Calzada conducted an\ninterview of Torres after the March 6 attempt and that Torres's\naccount of the attempt was different during that interview than it\nwas at trial. Nonetheless, the defendants were permitted to call\nhim to the stand and, for purposes of impeachment, they entered the\n302 report of the interview into evidence. See discussion infra.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\ftrue.     See, e.g., Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 239 (1980)\n\n(\"Common law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by\n\ntheir previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which\n\nthat fact naturally would have been asserted.\").\n\n            Catalán also wished to call FBI Agents Francisco Ng and\n\nFélix Alvarado, who interviewed Torres after the November 30\n\nrobbery and also filed a 302 report.                 He argues that their\n\ntestimony would have impeached Torres's trial account of the\n\nNovember 30 robbery.        Whereas Torres testified at trial that he\n\nhad not observed the November 30 robbery, Alvarado and Ng's report\n\nof their interview recounts that Torres had seen the robbery but\n\nhad \"frozen\" and was unable to call for help.             Contrary to his\n\ntrial   testimony,   the    report   states   that    Torres   did    see   the\n\nassailants, although it also states that he said he could not\n\nprovide a good description of them.\n\n            Finally, Catalán claims that he should have been able to\n\ncall Agent Carlos Marchand, the FBI's case agent, to impeach\n\nTorres's account of the March 27 robbery.              Catalán claims that\n\nAgent Marchand would have testified that he had never heard certain\n\ndetails in Torres's trial account, such as that Rodríguez pleaded\n\nfor his life before Catalán unloaded his pistol into him, until\n\nTorres testified at trial.\n\n            The trial court excluded the testimony of all five\n\nagents,     ruling   that   it   constituted     impeachment         by   prior\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\finconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence of a collateral\n\nmatter and that the prior statements offered through agents Cruz\n\nand Marrero were not in fact inconsistent with Torres's trial\n\ntestimony. However, Catalán was permitted to impeach Torres's\n\ncredibility     by   extrinsic    evidence   of   inconsistent   statements\n\nthrough two other witnesses.          He was permitted to call Carlos\n\nBonilla-Rivera, a security investigator for Ranger American who\n\nrecorded a statement from Torres after the November 30 robbery that\n\nwas signed by Torres.       In that statement, contrary to his trial\n\ntestimony, Torres said that he saw, and was able to describe, one\n\nof the assailants.     The defendants also called Agent Ríos-Calzada,\n\nwho interviewed Torres after the March 6 robbery and took a written\n\nstatement from him that was inconsistent with his trial testimony.\n\nThe   written   statement   was    entered   into   evidence.    The   court\n\nprovided no explanation for why these witnesses could be called for\n\nimpeachment and not the others, except that Torres had signed the\n\nstatements he made to the two witnesses and therefore he had\n\n\"adopted\" the statements.11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        That distinction has no basis in the rules of evidence or\nthe common law of impeachment.        \"Any form of statement is\nacceptable\" for impeachment by prior inconsistent statement.      1\nMcCormick on Evidence § 34 at n.5 (6th ed. 2006).   Federal Rule of\nEvidence 613(b) only requires that the impeached witness be\n\"afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the [prior statement]\nand the opposite party [be] afforded the opportunity to interrogate\nthe witness thereon,\" and has no requirement that the witness have\nadopted the prior statement.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           On appeal, Catalán contests the court's decision to\n\nexclude the testimony of Agents Ng, Alvaredo, Cruz, Marrero, and\n\nMarchand.12\n\n2.   Catalán's Constitutional Claims\n\n           The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment protects\n\na criminal defendant's right \"to be confronted with the witnesses\n\nagainst him.\"   U.S. Const. Amend. VI.    Although the ability to\n\npursue an impeaching line of inquiry with the introduction of\n\nextrinsic evidence supporting that inquiry might be viewed as part\n\nand parcel of the right to cross-examination, this circuit has yet\n\nto decide whether the Confrontation Clause provides defendants a\n\nright to impeach witnesses through extrinsic evidence. In White v.\n\nCoplan, 399 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir. 2005), for example, a criminal\n\ndefendant was found to have the right under the Confrontation\n\nClause to cross-examine his accusers about false allegations they\n\nhad made in the past, but the panel did not reach the question\n\nwhether he had a right to introduce extrinsic evidence about those\n\nallegations. It was specifically noted that \"cross-examination and\n\nextrinsic proof are two different issues.\"   Id. at 25.   The panel\n\nwrote that \"we are not endorsing any open-ended constitutional\n\n\n      12\n        The government argues that two of the five witnesses \"would\nhave possibly presented cumulative testimony.\" Cruz and Marrero\nwould presumably have given similar testimony, as would Ng and\nAlvarado.    See Fed. R. Evid. 403 (relevant evidence may be\nexcluded, among other reasons, if it constitutes \"needless\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\").      For reasons discussed\nbelow, it is not crucial that this contention be resolved.\n\n                               -22-\n\fright to offer extrinsic evidence [for impeachment purposes]. Such\n\nan excursion requires more witnesses and documents, and so greater\n\nrisk of confusion and delay . . . .\"         Id. at 26; see also Farley v.\n\nLafler, 193 Fed. Appx. 543, 547 (6th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (\"The\n\nSupreme Court has not recognized the sweep of the Confrontation\n\nClause to extend beyond guaranteeing the criminal defendant's\n\nright[] to physically confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses\n\nto encompass the right to impeach an adverse witness by putting on\n\na third-party witness.\") (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nAppellant makes no attempt to address White or otherwise explain\n\nspecifically why the Confrontation Clause requires the introduction\n\nof   the   extrinsic    evidence   for    impeachment   purposes,    and   has\n\ntherefore waived his conclusory Confrontation Clause argument.\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            However, as appellant points out, and the government\n\nacknowledges, \"[w]hether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, or in the Compulsory Process or\n\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution\n\nguarantees criminal defendants 'a meaningful opportunity to present\n\na complete defense.'\" Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986).\n\nIn Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973) (also cited by\n\nappellant    in   his   brief),     the   Supreme   Court   recognized     the\n\nconstitutional    dimension    of    a    defendant's   right   to   present\n\nwitnesses in his defense, noting that \"[f]ew rights are more\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\ffundamental.\"      In Chambers, the excluded witnesses could have\n\nimplicated a person other than the defendant, and their testimony\n\nwould have impeached that other person's denial of involvement in\n\nthe crime.    Id. at 292.   The exclusion of those witnesses infringed\n\nthe defendant's due process right to \"present witnesses in his own\n\ndefense\" and contributed to the denial of a constitutionally fair\n\ntrial.    Id. at 302-03\n\n             Because   appellant   has   cited   Chambers   and   other   Due\n\nProcess cases, he has not waived that constitutional claim, and his\n\ncomplaint must be examined under the Due Process rubric.            In that\n\nanalysis, \"[a] defendant's right to present relevant evidence is\n\nnot unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\"\n\nUnited States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998);13 see also\n\nTaylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 410 (1988) (\"The accused does not\n\n\n\n     13\n          In Scheffer, the Court wrote that:\n\n     A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not\n     unlimited,   but   rather   is  subject   to   reasonable\n     restrictions. A defendant's interest in presenting such\n     evidence may thus bow to accommodate other legitimate\n     interests in the criminal trial process. As a result,\n     state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under\n     the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence\n     from criminal trials.     Such rules do not abridge an\n     accused's right to present a defense so long as they are\n     not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they\n     are designed to serve.     Moreover, we have found the\n     exclusion of relevant evidence to be unconstitutionally\n     arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed\n     upon a weighty interest of the accused.\n\nId.

The Trial Court's Ruling on Inconsistency\n\n           The court ruled that the statement made by Torres at the\n\nhospital following the March 27 murder of Rodríguez, recorded in a\n\n302 by agents Marerro and Cruz, was not inconsistent with Torres's\n\ntrial testimony.15   The court concluded that in light of Torres's\n\n\n      14\n         The government argues that \"[s]ince the defendant failed\nto raise some of [the] specific claims or arguments at trial or\nbelow, the Court reviews the claims for plain error.\"          The\ngovernment's only specific contention in this regard is that\nCatalán did not raise the argument that the impeachment would\nexpose Torres's bias or motive to testify, which, in the words of\nCatalán, was to \"fix[] up all holes in the government's case,\nmaximizing the chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death\npenalty verdict in modern times.” However, appellant argued below:\n\n     The defense gets to say to the jury . . . are these\n     details things that would be left out . . . if they\n     really happened? Or are these details that are being\n     added on later to make it a better death penalty case?\n     That's our right to argue . . . .\n\nAlthough the issue is close, appellant's bias and motive argument\nis treated as having been properly raised. In addition to arguing\nthat it would expose bias and motive, appellant unquestionably made\nthe argument below that the impeachment would call into doubt\nTorres's credibility generally in the sense that, for whatever\nreason, he testified at trial to inflammatory details about the\nrobberies and murder that he had not mentioned during prior\ninterviews.\n      15\n       The court offered this ruling as a supplemental basis for\nexclusion of the impeachment, after making its ruling on the\n\n                               -25-\n\finjured condition at the time of the interview, the fact that he\n\nhad taken pain medication, the short duration of the interview, and\n\nthe fact that \"we don't know what type of questions the agents\n\nasked,\" it would not have been \"natural\" for Torres to include the\n\naggravating details.   See United States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314,\n\n320-21 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Prior statements . . . that omit details\n\nincluded in a witness's trial testimony are inconsistent if it\n\nwould have been 'natural' for the witness to include the details in\n\nthe earlier statement.\").   The substance of defendants' proffer\n\nspecifically stated, however, that Agent Cruz would testify that in\n\nher estimation Torres was an appropriate subject for an interview.\n\nDefense counsel proffered that Agent Cruz would testify as follows:\n\n          She would say that she recognized that he was\n          in pain, that he had been shot, I think it was\n          in the left hand, that she, in accordance with\n          procedure and policy, took notes during the\n          interview, that she recorded all of the\n          important things that he said about the event,\n          that the notes were effectively transcribed\n          into a written report which . . . she\n          reviewed, initialed, as did Mr. Marrero, for\n          accuracy . . . . She said that while he was\n          in pain, in her opinion he was a subject for\n          an interview. She did not feel that he was\n          incapacitated    or    incapable   of    being\n          interviewed and providing information. That\n          during the interview itself, as he described\n          the events that took place on March 27th, at\n          no time during that interview did he indicate\n          Mr. Rodríguez has his arms raised in a\n          submissive mode prior to being shot. He did\n\n\ncollateral fact issue. See infra Part II(c)(4). This issue is\ndiscussed first, however, because it is the logical antecedent of\nthe ruling that the impeachment was collateral.\n\n                               -26-\n\f          not at any time indicate that, prior to Mr.\n          Rodríguez being shot, in the position with his\n          arms raised, did he hear him say, please, no,\n          please, no, please, no, and he did not\n          indicate in any way that prior to that, in the\n          mode   with  his   hands   raised,  that   the\n          assailant, who he later identified in court as\n          Mr. Hernaldo Medina Villegas, approached him\n          from the front and shot him twice in the\n          chest.16\n\nDefense counsel also proffered that Agent Cruz had stated that she\n\ndid not remember whether the interview was conducted in a question\n\nand answer format, or whether she had simply recorded Torres's\n\nnarrative.\n\n          Unlike Meserve, on which the district court relied for\n\nits ruling that the omitted details were not inconsistent with\n\nTorres's trial testimony, the details omitted in Torres's earlier\n\nstatement were not \"peripheral\" but went directly to the important\n\nelement of premeditation as well as the possible imposition of the\n\ndeath penalty. Cf. Meserve, 271 F.3d at 321 (where \"nuances [were]\n\nperipheral,\"   district   court   did    not   abuse   its   discretion   in\n\nexcluding impeachment by omission through extrinsic evidence).            As\n\ndescribed in the discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting Medina's conviction on the murder charge, see infra Part\n\nIII(A), the indictment charged that the defendants had acted \"with\n\n\n     16\n          Although it is not included in the proffer, later\ndiscussions among the parties make clear that the 302 also recorded\nthat Torres described a second shooter who, while wounded on the\nground, fired several shots at the victim. However, this account\nof the second shooter, presumably Catalán, did not include the\ndetails of concern to appellant.\n\n                                  -27-\n\fpremeditation\"   in     killing     Rodríguez.       With      respect   to\n\npremeditation,   \"it    is   the   fact   of   deliberation,    of   second\n\nthought[,] that is important.\" United States v. Frappier, 807 F.2d\n\n257, 261 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S.\n\n463, 469 n.3 (1946)).    The victim crying out for his life before he\n\nwas shot by the defendant was some of the government's most\n\npersuasive evidence that Catalán had acted with premeditation in\n\nshooting Rodríguez.17\n\n          Second, the impeachment was inconsistent in an important\n\nsense because the details that were essential to the government's\n\ndeath penalty case were left out of Torres's first interview.            The\n\nsame jury that decided the guilt phase was later asked to determine\n\nwhether the death penalty was appropriate, and in doing so was\n\nspecifically instructed that it could \"consider any evidence that\n\nwas presented during the guilt phase of the trial.\"         In the penalty\n\n\n     17\n         The government could have secured a first degree murder\nconviction without specifically charging premeditation, see 18\nU.S.C. § 1111(a), but it nonetheless included premeditation in the\ncharge on count eight as an element of the charged offense. The\njudge instructed the jury that it must find both malice\naforethought as well as premeditation in order to convict the\ndefendants. Although the defendants were charged with \"aiding and\nabetting\" the commission of the murder in count eight, that charge\ndid not lessen the mental state required to convict appellant of\nthe murder charge. Even under the aiding and abetting theory of\nliability, the government was required to prove that Catalán\n\"consciously shared\" the principal's intent.      United States v.\nMangual-Corchado, 139 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 1998) (an aiding and\nabetting murder conviction \"required proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Cirilo, before the murder occurred, consciously shared\n[the principal's] intention to kill Meijas and sought to ensure the\nsuccess of the criminal enterprise . . . .\").\n\n                                   -28-\n\fphase, the jury was asked to consider whether certain \"statutory\n\naggravating factors\" applied to the crime.              See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591,\n\n3592.        These   included   whether   the   crime    was   committed     in   a\n\n\"heinous, cruel or depraved manner,\" and whether the victim was\n\nvulnerable.\n\n              In the final analysis, the jury had to decide whether the\n\nmurder of Rodríguez was a cold-blooded execution, or something\n\nelse.        Torres added several details at trial that went to that\n\ncore issue and formed a central aspect of his narrative of the\n\nevents of March 27, but which he had not mentioned in his earlier\n\naccount.      There was uncertainty about Torres's mental and physical\n\ncondition at the time of the interview in the hospital, and the way\n\nin which the interview was conducted.            Under these circumstances,\n\nit was an abuse of discretion for the court to determine that the\n\ncrucial      omissions   in   Marrero    and   Cruz's   302    report   of   their\n\ninterview with Torres were \"natural\" and not inconsistent with his\n\ntrial testimony.         The significance of the omissions was a jury\n\nissue.18\n\n\n        18\n             See 1 McCormick on Evidence § 34 (6th ed. 2006):\n\n     [W]hat degree of inconsistency between the witness's\n     testimony and his previous statement is required? . . .\n     The test ought to be: Could the jury reasonably find that\n     a witness who believed the truth of the facts testified\n     to would be unlikely to make a prior statement of this\n     tenor? . . . Instead of restricting the use of prior\n     statements by a mechanical test of inconsistency, in case\n     of doubt the courts should lean toward receiving such\n     statements to aid in evaluating the testimony.      After\n\n                                        -29-\n\f4.   The Trial Court's Collateral Fact Rulings\n\n             Under the common law of evidence and the law of this\n\ncircuit, impeachment by extrinsic evidence is normally restricted\n\nto impeachment on matters that are not collateral.              United States\n\nv. Cruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"'It is well\n\nestablished that a party may not present extrinsic evidence to\n\nimpeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.'\")\n\n(quoting United States v. Beauchamp, 986 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)).19    A matter is considered collateral if \"'the matter itself\n\nis   not    relevant   in    the   litigation    to   establish     a   fact   of\n\nconsequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere\n\ncontradiction     of   the    in-court       testimony   of   the   witness.'\"\n\nBeauchamp, 986 F.2d at 4 (quoting 1 McCormick on Evidence § 45 (4th\n\ned. 1992)).\n\n\n      all, the pretrial statements were made when memory was\n      fresher and when there was less time for the play of\n      bias. Thus, they are often more trustworthy than the\n      testimony.\n      19\n           But see 1 McCormick on Evidence § 49 (6th ed. 2006)\n(\"Given Rule 402 [which provides that \"all relevant evidence is\nadmissible\"], there is a powerful argument that the collateral fact\nrule was impliedly repealed by enactment of the Federal Rules.\nUnder this reading of the Federal Rules, there is no rigid\nprohibition on introducing extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness\non a collateral matter; rather, under Rule 403, the judge would\nmake a practical judgment as to whether the importance of the\nwitness's testimony and the impeachment warrants the expenditure of\nthe additional trial time. However, the collateral fact rule was\nso ingrained at common law that many federal opinions continue to\nmention 'collateral' evidence.\"). This circuit continues to apply\nthe collateral fact rule. See, e.g., Cruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d at\n30; United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                      -30-\n\f            The    rule       restricting     impeachment      to    non-collateral\n\nmatters is analogous to Rule 403's relevancy balancing test, which\n\ncalls for relevant evidence to be excluded when its \"probative\n\nvalue is substantially outweighed by . . . considerations of undue\n\ndelay, [or] waste of time . . . .\"                  Fed. R. Evid. 403; see also\n\nBeauchamp, 986 F.2d at 4.            Although any demonstrated inconsistency\n\nin a witness's statement may impeach a witness's credibility, other\n\nconcerns (such as wasting time and misleading the jury) become more\n\nimportant when the inconsistency at issue involves a statement\n\nrelating to a matter that \"'is not relevant in the litigation to\n\nestablish   a     fact    of    consequence.'\"       Beauchamp,     986   F.2d    at    4\n\n(quoting 1 McCormick on Evidence § 45, 169 (4th ed. 1992)).                      On the\n\nother    hand,    when    a    statement     that    would    be    the   subject      of\n\nimpeachment \"is logically relevant to the merits of the case as\n\nwell as the witness's credibility, it is worth the additional court\n\ntime entailed in hearing extrinsic evidence.\"                       1 McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 49 (6th ed. 2006).\n\n            Over defendants' protestations to the contrary, the trial\n\ncourt repeatedly ruled that evidence of Torres's prior inconsistent\n\nstatements about the robberies was not admissible because it was\n\n\"collateral.\"      For example, in response to defendants' request to\n\nimpeach Torres's claim that Rodríguez had pleaded for his life\n\nbefore   being     shot,       the   court   said,    \"it's   collateral     source,\n\ncollateral impeachment by extrinsic evidence because whether he\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fsaid, no, no, or -- yes, yes . . . that all doesn't go directly to\n\nthe issues of guilt or innocence of the two defendants.\"\n\n            It is true that this circuit has said that \"[i]n light of\n\nthe collateral issue rule, in order to be admissible, . . .\n\ntestimony must not only contradict a statement . . . but also be\n\nmaterial to [the defendant's] guilt or innocence.\"     United States\n\nv. Mulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d 983, 988 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Payne, 102 F.3d 289, 295 (7th Cir. 1996)).\n\nHowever, it appears that the district court may have interpreted\n\nthat statement -- or one like it -- to mean that in order to be\n\nmaterial here, the extrinsic evidence at issue must relate to\n\nwhether the defendant did or did not shoot Rodríguez, or whether he\n\nstole the money, and not how the shooting or robbery were carried\n\nout.\n\n            This is too narrow a view.   As has been noted, some of\n\nthe details Catalán sought to impeach -- such as the defendants'\n\nand victim's behavior during the shooting -- plainly helped the\n\ngovernment establish the premeditation that was charged as an\n\naspect of the murder in count eight.     Furthermore, several of the\n\ndetails were certainly relevant to the jury's consideration of the\n\ndeath penalty if the defendants were convicted.20       See Kines v.\n\n\n\n       20\n          Because it is not necessary to this decision, the\nsignificance, if any, of the fact that Agents Ng and Alvarado would\nhave testified about a robbery for which appellant was not charged\n(the November 30 robbery) is not addressed.\n\n                                 -32-\n\fButterworth, 669 F.2d at 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1981).                     Torres was the\n\nonly eyewitness to the March 27 murder of his partner, and was also\n\na witness to and victim of the November 30 robbery.                           He had\n\ntestified that the crimes were committed in a certain way, and the\n\ndefendants sought to impeach him by introducing evidence through\n\nhis    prior     inconsistent       statements    that    the   crimes      were    not\n\ncommitted that way.         His accounts of the robberies and murder were\n\nunquestionably material to the government's case against Catalán,\n\nincluding       its     request   for   the    death     penalty,    even    if     the\n\nimpeachment of Torres on details of those accounts may not have\n\nexculpated Catalán from involvement in the crime.\n\n               Furthermore, Catalán argued below and argues on appeal\n\nthat the trial court should have permitted the impeachment because\n\nit went to matters brought out on direct examination by the\n\ngovernment, not through cross-examination by the defendant.                        That\n\ndistinction is significant.                 The government's own belief that\n\nTorres's account of the details of the robberies and the murder\n\nwere        important    supports     the     non-collateral     nature      of     the\n\ninconsistencies identified by Catalán.21                  Cf. United States v.\n\n\n       21\n        However, this is not to suggest that testimony elicited on\ndirect is always or automatically impeachable. See, e.g., Charles\nAlan Wright & Victor James Gold, 27 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6096\n(2d ed. 2005) (\"Some older authority suggests that the collateral\nmatter doctrine applies only when the testimony to be contradicted\nwas elicited on cross-examination. Under this approach, when a\nwitness testifies to facts during direct examination she may be\nimpeached by extrinsic evidence even if those facts are collateral.\nMore recent authority and commentary rejects this approach,\n\n                                        -33-\n\fSotomayor-Vázquez, 249 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2001) (despite the\n\nprohibitions of Rule 404(b), \"[w]hen a defendant has, on direct\n\nexamination, made a general denial of engaging in conduct material\n\nto the case, the prosecution may impeach that testimony by proving\n\nthat   the   defendant    did    engage   in   that   conduct   on   a     prior\n\noccasion\").       Finally,      Catalán   argues   that   exposure    of    the\n\ninconsistencies would have revealed Torres's motive to testify\n\nfalsely: \"fixing up all holes in the government's case, maximizing\n\nthe chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death penalty verdict\n\nin modern times.\"     This circuit has said that \"a witness's . . .\n\nmotive to testify falsely is generally considered to be a non-\n\ncollateral issue.\"       Beauchamp, 986 F.2d at 4.\n\n             For all of these reasons, the district court erred in\n\nexcluding the testimony of the agents because of its view that\n\ntheir testimony dealt with a collateral matter.\n\n5.   Harmless Error\n\n             Both of the district court's rationales for excluding the\n\nimpeachment testimony of the five government agents -- that some of\n\nthe statements were not inconsistent and that all of the proffered\n\ntestimony was collateral -- were erroneous applications of the\n\nrules of evidence.       However, \"[v]iolation of a rule of evidence\n\ndoes not itself amount to a constitutional violation.\"               Evans v.\n\n\nreasoning that contradiction as to a trivial matter wastes time and\nconfuses the issues no matter whether the contradiction occurs on\ndirect or cross examination.\").\n\n                                     -34-\n\fVerdini, 466 F.3d 141, 145 (1st Cir. 2006).      It is not necessary to\n\ndecide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic evidence was an error\n\nof constitutional dimension. Under the circumstances of this case,\n\neven if there was a constitutional error, the error was harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.       The evidence against Catalán was\n\noverwhelming: he was found wounded at the scene of the March 27\n\nrobbery and murder, holding one of the two murder weapons, and he\n\nwas later identified in court as the perpetrator. That inculpatory\n\nevidence would not have been impeached by the evidence that he\n\nsought to introduce through any of the agents.              Furthermore,\n\nCatalán was permitted to impeach Torres's credibility by extrinsic\n\nevidence of inconsistent statements through Bonilla and Ríos, whose\n\ninterviews with Torres following the November 30 and March 6\n\nincidents differed from Torres's accounts at trial.\n\n           Of course, if Catalán had been sentenced to death, it\n\nmight be necessary to decide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic\n\nevidence   about   the   March   27     incident22   was   an   error   of\n\nconstitutional dimension, because the harmless error analysis might\n\nwell be different.   As noted, in the penalty phase of the trial,\n\nthe same jury that had decided appellants' guilt was asked to\n\ndetermine whether to impose the death penalty, and was expressly\n\ninstructed that it could consider the evidence it heard in the\n\n\n\n     22\n        The desired impeachment through agents Ng and Alvarado was\nnot relevant to the March 27 murder.\n\n                                 -35-\n\fguilt phase.      Defense counsel expressed this concern at trial,\n\narguing    that   if    Torres's      testimony       went   unimpeached,       the\n\ndefendants' lawyers would not later be able to \"unring the bell\"\n\nabout the reprehensible details when it came time for the jury to\n\ndeliberate    about    whether   to    impose   the    death   penalty.        That\n\nargument was apt, but, in the final analysis, the jury apparently\n\ndid unring the bell.23\n\n6.   The Trial Court's Sua Sponte Comments\n\n           Catalán     points    to     several     portions    in    the     trial\n\ntranscript where the judge interrupted defense counsel, restricting\n\nor directing the course of defense counsel's examination.                   Catalán\n\nclaims that these interruptions violated his Confrontation Clause\n\nright to cross-examine witnesses against him.                After reading the\n\nexcerpted portions of the transcript in context, it is clear that\n\nappellant's    objections    are      groundless.       In   many    places,    the\n\ndistrict court directed counsel on the proper way to conduct the\n\nexamination; in others, the court reprimanded trial counsel for\n\nignoring its earlier rulings.            The court also interrupted the\n\ngovernment's lawyers on occasion, and frequently sided with the\n\n\n\n      23\n       Strangely, Catalán apparently did not seek to have any of\nthe agents testify about Torres's out-of-court account of the March\n27 robbery and murder during the penalty phase of the trial, even\nthough the court clearly took a different view of the relevance of\nthe evidence in that phase of the trial. For example, it allowed\nco-defendant Medina to present previously excluded impeachment by\nextrinsic evidence through Agent Marchand during Medina's penalty-\nphase case. (Catalán's penalty-phase case preceded Medina's.)\n\n                                       -36-\n\fdefendants on objections.        \"It is well-established that a judge is\n\nnot a mere umpire; he is the governor of the trial for the purpose\n\nof assuring its proper conduct, and has a perfect right -- albeit\n\na right that should be exercised with care -- to participate\n\nactively in the trial proper.\"         Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted).            After careful consideration\n\nof   the   trial   transcript,    it    is    clear   that    the   trial   court\n\noverstepped no boundaries.\n\nD.   Double Jeopardy\n\n            Catalán claims that some of his convictions violated the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids\n\npunishing a person twice for the same offense.               U.S. Const. amend.\n\nV.   In Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932), the\n\nSupreme Court set forth the following test for determining whether\n\nmultiple    punishments   for    related      offenses   violate     the    Double\n\nJeopardy Clause: \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a\n\nviolation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be\n\napplied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is\n\nwhether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other\n\ndoes not.\"\n\n            The government has sensibly conceded that the convictions\n\nfor the offenses in counts eight and nine violated the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause.     Count nine set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for carrying a firearm in furtherance of the\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\fMarch 27 robbery.    Count eight set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n924(j) for use of firearm during the March 27th robbery, which\n\nresulted in the death of Rodríguez.         Count nine was a lesser\n\nincluded offense of count eight, as it did not require proof of any\n\nfact not required for conviction on count eight. See United States\n\nv. Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d 3, 10 (1st Cir. 2006) (a § 924(c)(1)\n\noffense can be a lesser included offense of a § 924(j) offense).24\n\n           On the other hand, we reject Catalán's contention that\n\nhis convictions on counts two and eight constitute a violation of\n\ndouble jeopardy.    Because he did not raise this claim below, we\n\nreview it for plain error.     United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d. 655,\n\n659 (1st Cir. 1995).    Thus, Catalán must show that: 1) there was an\n\nerror, 2) it was plain, 3) it affected a substantial right, and 4)\n\nit   \"seriously   affect[ed]   the   fairness,   integrity,   or   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"      United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732 (1993).    The firearm conviction on count two is for\n\nthe use of a firearm in connection with the overall conspiracy to\n\nrob armored vehicles (the count one conspiracy), whereas the\n\nfirearm conviction on count eight is for use of a firearm in\n\n\n\n      24\n       Oddly, counsel for Medina has not also argued that Medina's\nconvictions on counts eight and nine violate double jeopardy.\nAlthough in exceptional circumstances we may address arguments not\nraised by counsel, see United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160\n(1936), those circumstances are very rare and not present here.\nOther than a $100 special assessment imposed for count nine,\nMedina's conviction on count nine does not and cannot affect his\nsentence, which is life imprisonment.\n\n                                  -38-\n\fconnection with the substantive robbery committed on March 27 (the\n\ncount        seven   robbery).

Marino, 277 F.3d at 39 (\"[A] substantive RICO\n\nviolation and a RICO conspiracy are not the same offense for double\n\njeopardy purposes.\").            We therefore find no error, let alone plain\n\nerror, in Catalán's conviction on count two.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                Appellant Medina challenges: 1) the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting the conviction of count eight (the murder\n\ncount),        2)    the   sufficiency      of     the    evidence     supporting   the\n\nconviction of counts five and six (the carjacking counts), 3) the\n\ndistrict        court's     failure    to    allow       him   the    opportunity   for\n\nallocution before being sentenced to life imprisonment on count\n\neight, and 4) the district court's calculation of the guideline\n\nsentencing range on count eight.25\n\n\n\n\n        25\n        In his pro se supplemental brief, Medina also argues that\nhis \"conviction[s] and sentences on all counts must be vacated as\nthe evidence was legally insufficient.\" However, while he presents\ndetailed arguments about the insufficiency of the evidence for\ncounts five, six, and eight, he does not even mention the other\ncounts, let alone explain why the evidence was insufficient. Even\naffording him a more lenient standard because he is pro se on these\nclaims, see, e.g., Johnson v. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 107 (1st\nCir. 1991), this argumentation is insufficient to bring the\nsufficiency of the evidence for claims one through four and seven\nbefore us. Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                            -39-\n\fA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n              Before discussing Medina's specific challenges to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence against him on counts five, six, and\n\neight, we discuss a more general challenge that he apparently\n\nintends to make for all of the counts that charge him with \"aiding\n\nand abetting\" in the perpetration of a crime.             He contends that he\n\ncould not have been convicted of aiding and abetting because no\n\n\"principal\"    was   charged   with    and   convicted     of    the    crimes.\n\n           Appellant's claim is based on a mistaken understanding of\n\nour law.      \"One who aids and abets a crime is punishable as a\n\nprincipal,\"    United States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 507 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2, and \"an aider and abettor in\n\nthe commission of a federal offense may be convicted, although the\n\nprincipal had been acquitted of the offense charged.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Cyr, 712 F.2d 729, 732 (1st Cir. 1983) (citing Standefer\n\nv. United States, 447 U.S. 10, 20 (1980)).                      While \"[i]t is\n\naxiomatic that an aiding and abetting conviction requires proof\n\nthat the substantive crime has been committed,\"             Cyr, 712 F.2d at\n\n732, there was overwhelming proof that the underlying crimes --\n\nessentially robbery, use of firearms, carjacking, and murder --\n\nwere committed.      Among other evidence, there was testimony from\n\nCruz, Torres, and Bravo which, taken together, detailed how armed\n\nassailants, pointing weapons, stole significant sums of cash from\n\nRanger's   guards    on   November     30,   2001   and    March       27,    2002.\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fFurthermore, Julía testified that his Ford Explorer was stolen from\n\nhim by men pointing firearms at him, and the same Ford Explorer was\n\nlater found abandoned with the engine running near the scene of the\n\nMarch 27 robbery.     Julía's Glock, stolen along with the Explorer,\n\nwas found inside the vehicle and had been fired several times\n\nduring the robbery.    Finally, and tragically, it is unquestionable\n\nthat Rodríguez was gunned down on March 27 while performing his\n\nduties as a Ranger guard. The testimony of Torres, law enforcement\n\nofficers who arrived at the scene, and forensics experts who\n\nexamined the ballistics from the scene all consistently explain how\n\nRodríguez was murdered in the course of the robbery.     Simply put,\n\nthere is nothing to appellant's claim that the evidence that any\n\nprincipal had actually committed these crimes was too thin for him\n\nto be convicted as an aider and abettor in the crimes.\n\n          More specifically, Medina also challenges the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence undergirding his convictions for carjacking (count\n\nfive), use of a firearm during carjacking (count six), and the\n\nmurder of Rodríguez (count eight).      We review sufficiency of the\n\nevidence challenges de novo, \"evaluating whether, after viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"     United States v. Meléndez-\n\nTorres, 420 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n                                 -41-\n\f           Conviction for carjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119 requires\n\nthe government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant:\n\n1) took or attempted to take from the person or presence of\n\nanother, 2) a motor vehicle that had been \"transported shipped, or\n\nreceived in interstate or foreign commerce,\" 3) with \"force and\n\nviolence or by intimidation\", 4) with \"intent to cause death or\n\nserious bodily harm.\"       18 U.S.C. § 2119; United States v. García-\n\nAlvarez, 541 F.3d 8, 16 (1st. Cir. 2008).             A rational jury could\n\nhave found each of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Julía\n\ntestified that his green Ford Explorer was taken from him by two\n\nmen on the night of March 26, 2002 and that one of the men pointed\n\na nickel-plated pistol at Julía's face while demanding he exit the\n\ncar. Co-conspirator Morales always carried a nickel-plated pistol.\n\nThe same Ford Explorer, which the parties stipulated had traveled\n\nthrough interstate commerce, was found the next day near the scene\n\nof the robbery.    Julía's Glock firearm, which had been in the glove\n\ncompartment of the Ford Explorer when it was stolen, had been used\n\nduring the robbery to shoot and kill Rodríguez.           Torres identified\n\nMedina as the person who had used the Glock during the shootout.\n\nA   government   witness,    Castro,   testified   that    while   he    was   a\n\ncellmate   of    Medina,   Medina   recounted   his    involvement      in   the\n\ncarjacking as well as other crimes in the conspiracy.\n\n           There was also sufficient evidence to convict Medina on\n\ncount six, the related offense of aiding and abetting the use of a\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\ffirearm in conjunction with the carjacking. Again, Julía testified\n\nthat the men who had stolen the car had pointed a nickel-plated\n\npistol at his face.\n\n            Finally, there was sufficient evidence from which a\n\nrational jury could conclude that Medina was guilty of count eight,\n\nwhich charged that he aided and abetted the use of a firearm during\n\na violent crime that unlawfully killed Rodríguez, with malice\n\naforethought      (as    defined   in    18    U.S.C.   §     1111)   \"and     with\n\npremeditation.\"         \"18 U.S.C. § 1111 'was intended to adopt the\n\nfelony murder rule, and for a stated felony the 'malice' element is\n\nsatisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.'\"                     United\n\nStates v. Morales-Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nUnited   States    v.    Shea,   211    F.3d   658,   674   (1st   Cir.   2000)).\n\nTherefore, murder that results from robbery is first degree murder.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (\"Every murder . . . committed in the\n\nperpetration of . . . robbery . . . is murder in the first\n\ndegree.\").        Nonetheless,     the     indictment       also   charged    that\n\ndefendants acted with premeditation.           \"Premeditation\" contemplates\n\na temporal dimension, which need only be an \"appreciable\" amount of\n\ntime; \"it is the fact of deliberation, of second thought[,] that is\n\nimportant.\"    Frappier, 807 F.2d at 261 (citing Fisher, 328 U.S. at\n\n469 n.3).    The judge instructed the jury that:\n\n            [P]remeditation is typically associated with\n            killing in cold blood and require[s] the\n            period   of  time   in  which   the  accused\n            deliberates or thinks the matter over before\n\n                                        -43-\n\f           acting. The law does not specify or require\n           any exact period of time that must pass\n           between the formation of the intent to kill\n           and the killing itself. But it must be long\n           enough for the killer after forming the intent\n           to kill to be fully consc[ious] of that\n           intent.\n\n\n           A reasonable jury could have found all of the elements of\n\ncount eight beyond a reasonable doubt.           First, Torres identified\n\nMedina as having fired the first of several shots at Rodríguez,\n\nwhile Rodríguez was on the ground with his arms raised and was not\n\nholding a weapon.     Medina bragged to his prison cellmate, Alamo,\n\nthat he had obtained a Glock with a laser from a carjacking which\n\nhe later used in the March 27 shootout.                 Government experts\n\nexplained that the Glock had been fired several times at the scene,\n\nand that at least one of its bullets hit Rodríguez and would have\n\nproven fatal even if Rodríguez had not also been wounded by\n\nCatalán's Berretta.       Finally, Medina was in possession of several\n\nnewspaper articles about the March 27 robbery at the time of his\n\narrest.   There was sufficient evidence not only that Medina \"aided\n\nand abetted\" the violent felony that brought about the death of\n\nRodríguez,   but   that    he   also   shared   with   Catalán   the   primary\n\nresponsibility for that death.\n\n           Based on this evidence, a rational jury could conclude\n\nthat Medina is guilty of count eight as well as counts five and\n\nsix.   Therefore, we affirm all of the convictions against Medina.\n\n\n\n                                       -44-\n\fB.   Sentencing Challenges\n\n           Medina challenges the district court's failure to allow\n\nhim the opportunity to allocute before sentencing him on count\n\neight,   the   felony   murder   charge.     Federal   Rule   of   Criminal\n\nProcedure 32(i)(4)(A) requires that before imposing sentence a\n\njudge \"address the defendant personally and ask the defendant if\n\nthe defendant wishes to make a statement in the defendant's own\n\nbehalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\"\n\nMedina was not afforded that opportunity before being sentenced on\n\ncount eight.\n\n           The government correctly concedes that Medina should be\n\nre-sentenced at a proceeding where he is present and afforded the\n\nopportunity to address the court.          See United States v. Burgos-\n\nAndújar, 275 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2001) (due to the importance of\n\nRule 32(i)(4)(A), which \"reflects our long tradition of giving all\n\ndefendants the right to directly address the court and plead for\n\nmercy,\" \"if a sentencing court fails to provide a defendant with\n\nthe chance to address the court, the reviewing court must remand\n\nthe case for resentencing, generally without needing to inquire\n\ninto prejudice.\"). Therefore, we vacate Medina's sentence on count\n\neight and remand to the district court for re-sentencing.          Because\n\nwe remand for resentencing, we need not reach Medina's alternative\n\n\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fargument    that   the    district    court   failed   to   comply    with   the\n\nrequirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).26\n\n                                      IV.\n\n            For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the conviction\n\nand sentence of appellant Catalán on count nine and further direct\n\nthat the special assessment on that count be removed.                We further\n\nvacate     Medina's      sentence    on   count   eight     and   remand     for\n\nresentencing.      All other convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n                      - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n     26\n        18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) requires a sentencing court to \"state\nin open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular\nsentence . . . .\"\n\n                                      -46-\n\f              BOUDIN and STAHL, Circuit Judges, concurring.              Although\n\nwe concur in the result and in most of what our colleague has\n\nwritten, our reasons differ from his in rejecting one of the\n\nprincipal claims of error.             Among other claims raised on appeal,\n\nLorenzo Catalán-Roman (\"Catalán\") challenges the district court's\n\nexclusion of testimony from FBI agents that he contends would have\n\nimpeached Eluber Torres-Alejandro's (\"Torres\") testimony, most\n\nimportantly, Torres' testimony about the robbery and murder on\n\nMarch 27, 2002.        Our colleague believes there was error but that it\n\nwas harmless; in our view no error was committed by the district\n\njudge.\n\n              Torres     testified       that   Gilberto       Rodríguez-Cabrera\n\n(\"Rodríguez\") had his hands in the air before any shots were fired,\n\nand    that   after    Torres    heard    the   first   shot,    Rodríguez   fell\n\nbackward, leaning against the front window of the credit union at\n\nwhich the robbery occurred; with his hands still raised, Rodríguez\n\nthen    pleaded   for    his    life   before   being   shot    by   co-defendant\n\nHernaldo Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\"); Rodríguez then fell to the\n\nground wounded, after which Catalán shot him multiple times.27                The\n\nallegedly inconsistent testimony that Catalán wanted to introduce\n\nwas expected testimony from FBI agents, who interviewed Torres in\n\n       27\n      There is some discrepancy between the testimony, both as we\nread it and in the description of it given in the briefs, as to\njust when the hand raising occurred; we have chosen the version\nthat seems to be best supported, but the differences are not\nmaterial to the outcome.\n\n                                         -47-\n\fthe hospital, that Torres did not mention Rodríguez' raising of\n\nhands and pleading for his life.\n\n              The district judge said that the omissions were not\n\ninconsistent with Torres' court testimony (the court testimony\n\nadded details but did not contradict the hospital statements) and,\n\nin addition, the hand raising and pleading (if they occurred) were\n\nmerely \"collateral\" to the issues on trial and therefore not proper\n\nsubjects for impeachment by extrinsic evidence.            Under applicable\n\nevidence law, either ruling--if correct--would justify excluding\n\nthe testimony, 1 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence §§ 34, 36, at 152,\n\n156 (6th ed. 2006), but Catalán disputes both rulings, contending\n\nthat    his   constitutional   right   to   present   a   fair   defense     was\n\nimpaired by mistaken evidentiary rulings.\n\n              Although Catalán cites constitutional precedent, such as\n\nChambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973), he does not develop\n\nany constitutional claim independent of his assertion that the\n\ncourt    misapplied     familiar   federal     common-law        doctrine     on\n\nimpeachment by inconsistency and the collateral issue rule.                 Even\n\nif we assumed arguendo that errors in applying those rules were\n\nthemselves constitutional error--hardly like to be so in all cases-\n\n-it would affect only the harmless error standard to be applied,\n\nChapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 22-24 (1967), and in this case\n\nwe think there was no error by the district judge in finding the\n\nomissions not inconsistent with Torres' testimony.\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\f          Starting with the issue of inconsistency, the ordinary\n\nrule is that earlier omissions in reciting the same story--although\n\nnot literally contradictions of later testimony--can be used to\n\nimpeach a witness for inconsistency (on cross examination of the\n\nwitness but not necessarily by extrinsic evidence) if the omitted\n\ninformation was not stated earlier \"in circumstances in which that\n\nfact naturally would have been asserted.\" Jenkins v. Anderson, 447\n\nU.S. 231, 239 (1980); United States v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 320-\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2001). Ordinarily, one might think that lurid details\n\nof the kind supplied in Torres' trial testimony might well have\n\nbeen supplied in the prior FBI interview; so, if they were not,\n\nthis would allow, although it would not compel, an inference of\n\ninconsistency and so make the omissions relevant.\n\n          But the circumstances here were not ordinary. Torres was\n\ninterviewed in the hospital, in pain and under medication; and\n\nwhile he was a critical witness, he was interviewed for only 15 to\n\n20 minutes.   Defense counsel asserted to the district court that\n\none agent would testify that although Torres \"was in pain,\" in her\n\nopinion he was not \"incapacitated or incapable of being interviewed\n\nand providing information,\" but this does not mean that he was in\n\nthe same condition as an ordinary witness or likely to be subject\n\nto the same degree or duration of questioning.       Another agent\n\ntestified (during co-defendant Medina's penalty phase) that such an\n\n\n\n\n                               -49-\n\finterview usually lasts several hours and that Torres' interview\n\nwas \"[o]bviously not\" conducted under ideal circumstances.\n\n          In addition, the agents' main job was to find out who\n\nwere the robbers and who had done the shooting.           That Torres would\n\nlikely have volunteered from his hospital bed details about raised\n\nhands and pleading is far from obvious, and so the supposed\n\ninference of inconsistency is of very doubtful force. There was no\n\nproffer by Catalán, and no reason to believe, that any agent was\n\nprepared to testify that Torres had been asked about raised hands,\n\npleading or anything else focusing on these details and had denied\n\nsuch happenings.      Absent inconsistency, the failure to mention the\n\ndetails had no impeachment value.\n\n          Although some trial judges might have left the matter to\n\nthe jury, the district judge is entitled to make the threshold\n\njudgment as to inconsistency as an admissibility ruling, and such\n\na call (like most other threshold admissibility rulings), is\n\nreviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.           Meserve, 271 F.3d\n\nat 321.   The trial judge found that in the circumstances it would\n\nnot have been natural for Torres to add the details in question;\n\nand,   given   that    admissibility      depends   not   on   any   literal\n\ninconsistency but entirely on an inference about what a witness\n\nwould likely have volunteered in these circumstances, we are not\n\nprepared to find an abuse of discretion here.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\f          Likely   the    district     judge   would   not   have    prevented\n\nCatalán from cross-examining Torres himself as to whether and why\n\nhe had previously omitted details, and Catalán's counsel did ask\n\nTorres some questions about the March 27 interview with the FBI\n\nagents (although Torres largely testified only that he did not\n\nremember what happened in the interview).          Typically, latitude is\n\nallowed in cross-examining the witness already on the stand whose\n\nreactions may be grist for the jury even without inconsistency.\n\nBut before having other witnesses called, and trial time spent as\n\nwell on exploring another dimension of Torres' medical condition,\n\nthe district judge was entitled to insist on inconsistency and\n\nreasonably concluded that the omissions here did not qualify.\n\n          Although   it   does   not    affect   the   outcome      as   to   the\n\nomissions in this case, a further limitation exists on the right to\n\ncall a separate witness to testify to inconsistent statements: the\n\ntraditional rule is that extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent\n\nstatements by the witness can be offered only if the earlier\n\nstatements also were relevant to the substance of the case (in\n\njargon, were \"not collateral\").        United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,\n\n541 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1017\n\n(2009); United States v. Beauchamp, 986 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   If so, the excursion required by extrinsic evidence is\n\ndeemed worthwhile; otherwise, not.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\f                 Here, the indictment charged premeditation--although it\n\ncould have relied on felony murder instead, 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a)\n\n(2006)28--and one might think that the supposed hand raising and\n\npleading could bear on premeditation.                      But forensic evidence\n\nestablished that Catalán shot Rodríguez after the latter had\n\nalready been wounded by Medina, and Torres' testimony, unimpeached\n\nin this regard, merely confirmed this sequence of events. Shooting\n\nan   already       wounded   man   ordinarily      meets    the   requirements   of\n\npremeditation--no particular interval is required, United States v.\n\nBrown, 518 F.2d 821, 826 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 917\n\n(1975)--so as to guilt it scarcely mattered whether Rodríguez had\n\nraised his hands and pleaded.\n\n                 The lurid details about hand raising and pleading were\n\nrelevant--that is, not collateral--to the jury's further choice in\n\nthe second phase of the trial as to whether to recommend death or\n\nlife imprisonment. Thus, if the hospital-bed omissions were deemed\n\ninconsistent, extrinsic evidence of them would have to be allowed\n\nat that second stage.            It is hard to imagine that at any penalty\n\nstage        a   judge   would   have   excluded   testimony      bearing   on   the\n\n\n        28\n       Count eight of the second superseding indictment charged\nCatalán under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) with aiding and abetting the\nuse of a firearm to cause the death of a person in the course of a\ncrime of violence, specifically, a robbery.      Section 924(j)(1)\ncross-references 18 U.S.C. § 1111 and provides that if the killing\nis \"murder (as defined in section 1111),\" the perpetrator shall \"be\npunished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for\nlife.\"   18 U.S.C. § 924(j)(1).    The indictment also explicitly\ncross-referenced the definition of murder in section 1111.\n\n                                         -52-\n\fcircumstances of the killing even if it consisted merely of Torres'\n\nfailure to mention any details in an earlier interview.29            In the\n\nevent, the jury did not recommend the death penalty and the judge\n\nmade clear his own default position was life imprisonment.\n\n           A more direct contradiction, about which Catalán also\n\ncomplains, concerns Torres' testimony about the earlier robbery on\n\nNovember 30, 2001.        At trial, Torres testified that he did not\n\nobserve the November 30 robbery or the assailants; earlier, it\n\nappears, two other FBI agents had interviewed him about the robbery\n\nand he told the FBI agents (according to their notes) that he saw\n\nthe robbery but \"froze\" and could not call for help and that he saw\n\nthe assailants but could not describe them.            At trial Catalán\n\nsought to have the agents testify to the inconsistency, but the\n\ntrial judge ruled it a collateral issue.\n\n           If Torres did make the earlier statements, they were\n\ncertainly inconsistent and so went to his credibility, but (as\n\nalready   noted)   this    permits    impeachment   only   through    cross\n\nexamination and not by extrinsic evidence unless the contradiction\n\nis material to the merits of the case.      Here, it is hard to see how\n\nthe contradiction is of any assistance to Catalán on the merits.\n\nHe was not charged with participation in the November 30 robbery,\n\n\n     29\n      There is no indication that Catalán sought to introduce the\nsupposed omissions at the penalty phase, and the judge permitted\nco-defendant Medina to introduce in the penalty phase testimony\nfrom Agent Carlos Marchand on the omissions in Torres' prior\nstatements about March 27.\n\n                                     -53-\n\fand neither version of Torres' testimony--the one offered at trial\n\nor the one given earlier to the agents--implicated Catalán in that\n\nrobbery.   Nor does Catalán offer in his brief any explanation\n\nbeyond saying that the two versions contradict one another--which\n\ngoes only to credibility and not to the subject matter of the case.\n\n           Catalán also claims that, beyond impeaching the specific\n\nfacts in Torres' testimony, the excluded FBI agent testimony in\n\nboth instances also would have demonstrated Torres' bias and\n\nimproper motive in testifying, and so was not collateral. But this\n\nis not so and the claim is not persuasively explained; the excluded\n\ntestimony did not establish what Torres' bias and improper motive\n\nwere, it merely contradicted certain details in Torres' version of\n\nevents. Nor did Catalán make this bias or motive argument in the\n\ndistrict   court:   he   argued   only   that   Torres'    testimony   was\n\ninconsistent and Torres therefore not credible; the new ground is\n\nnot only unsupported but forfeit.        Fed. R. Evid. 103(a); United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993).\n\n           Accordingly, we conclude that with respect to the claimed\n\nevidentiary errors, the district judge permissibly excluded the\n\nextrinsic evidence in question. Harmless error doctrine happens to\n\nproduce the same result in this case, but it is important to future\n\ncases that governing evidence law be reaffirmed.          Trials are full\n\nof such evidentiary rulings, often made under pressure, and those\n\nmade here were within the province of the trial judge.\n\n\n                                  -54-\n\f",

In addition, Catalán challenges: 1) the court's denial of his request to sever his trial from that of Medina, 2) restrictions on cross-examination, and 3) its decision to quash a subpoena for the tax records of the victimized armored car company and its owner. He also challenges his convictions on counts two, eight, and nine on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p>Medina challenges: 1) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the convictions on counts five and six (the carjacking charges) and eight (the murder charge), 2) the court's failure to allow him the opportunity for allocution before sentencing him to life imprisonment on the murder charge, and 3) the court's calculation of the guideline sentencing range on the murder charge.</p>\n<p>The government concedes that the convictions on counts eight and nine violated double jeopardy. It also concedes that Medina must be re-sentenced on count eight because he was not allowed the opportunity to allocute for that count. After careful consideration, we reject appellants' other claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Cruz-Diaz,</i> 550 F.3d 169, 171 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The November 30 Armed Robbery</h2>\n<p>On November 30, 2001, James Cruz-Matias (\"Cruz\"), an armored truck guard working for Ranger American Armored Services (\"Ranger\"), was robbed at gunpoint while making a delivery of cash for his employer to the Saulo D. Rodriguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. That day, Cruz worked as the messenger in a two-man team. As such, he had to carry the cash from the truck to the bank. His co-worker, Eluber Torres-Alejandro (\"Torres\"), was the driver and remained inside the truck during the delivery. As Cruz carried a bag containing $180,000 toward the door of the credit union, a man who had been waiting by the credit union's ATM approached him, pointed a gun at his face, and demanded the money. Two other assailants then appeared, also pointing guns toward Cruz's head. Cruz gave them the money. Before leaving, one of the assailants took Cruz's pistol from its holster, cocked it, and pointed it at Cruz's face. Instead of pulling the trigger, the assailants left with the gun and the $180,000, fleeing the parking lot in a gray or blue Jeep Cherokee Laredo. Soon after the robbery, Gurabo municipal police recovered nearby a burned-out blue Cherokee Laredo that had been carjacked from its owner two days before the robbery. Six fingerprints matching Medina's were retrieved from a newspaper left near the ATM, where the first assailant had been waiting just before the robbery. At trial, Cruz identified Medina as the first assailant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The March 6 Attempted Armed Robbery</h2>\n<p>On March 6, 2002, several men attempted to rob two Ranger guards. Torres was again working that day, acting this time as the messenger while his partner, Rodríguez, drove the truck. As Torres carried a bag containing $300,000 from the armored truck to the door of the Valenciano Credit Union in Juncos, Puerto Rico, a man appeared and walked towards him in the parking lot. The man made a gesture toward his waist, revealing a firearm tucked in his waistband. Torres and Rodríguez both pulled out their own weapons and pointed them towards the man, who had pulled out the pistol and managed to point it at Torres. Apparently realizing that he was outnumbered, the man turned and ran away. Torres saw a two-toned motorcycle and a blue Chevrolet Lumina depart from the parking lot.<sup>[1]</sup> At trial, Torres identified Catalán as the man who had walked toward him in the parking lot and flashed a weapon before fleeing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The March 26 Carjacking</h2>\n<p>On March 26, 2002, while parked in his green Ford Explorer outside his daughter's house and talking with her, Armando Jula-Diaz (\"Julía\") was approached by two assailants, one of whom pointed a nickel-plated pistol at him and demanded he turn over the vehicle.<sup>[2]</sup> The two assailants stole the Explorer, along with a black, 9mm Glock pistol that Julía had kept in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> D. The March 27 Armed Robbery and Murder</h2>\n<p>The next day, on March 27, 2002, Ranger guards Torres and Rodríguez were assigned to deliver $100,000 to the Saulo D. Rodríguez credit union in Gurabo. Torres, the driver, remained in the truck while Rodríguez, the messenger, exited with the money and walked towards the credit union. As Rodríguez approached the entrance, an assailant appeared and pointed a black, 9mm Glock pistol at his face and chest. A second assailant then appeared carrying a Beretta semi-automatic firearm. At trial, Torres identified the first assailant as Medina and the second as Catalán. Rodríguez raised his hands above his head in an act of surrender. As Catalán attempted to remove Rodríguez's firearm from its holster, Medina fired two shots at Rodríguez. Torres then opened the door of the armored truck and began firing at Catalán, who was hit and fell to the ground. Torres was shot in the left hand by a fourth indicted co-conspirator, Quester Sterling-Suarez (\"Sterling\"). Torres fell back into the truck and closed its doors.</p>\n<p>Medina took the money and fled the scene in a green Ford Explorer, leaving the injured Catalán behind. Rodríguez was still alive at this point. According to Torres, Rodríguez pleaded for his life just before Catalán, seated on the ground nearby, picked up his Beretta firearm and fired it several times into him. Sterling then arrived and tried to help Catalán, but fled the scene alone when police arrived.<sup>[3]</sup> Catalán was apprehended at the scene, seriously wounded and still holding the Beretta. Rodríguez died soon thereafter, having received a total of eight gunshot wounds, three of which would have proven fatal even independent of the other wounds. One of the fatal wounds came from Medina's 9mm Glock (the gun that had been stolen from Jula the day before), while the other two came from Catalán's Beretta. At the scene, the FBI obtained shell casings, bullet fragments, and bullets that matched Catalán's Beretta and Medina's Glock. Not far from the credit union, police recovered Jula's stolen green Ford Explorer with its doors open, the engine running, and a small tank of gasoline nearby. Inside the vehicle, they recovered the stolen Glock 9mm pistol used by Medina during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the robbery, Morales picked up his girlfriend, Jocelyn Serrano-Castro (\"Serrano\"), in his blue Chevrolet Lumina. She spent the day with him, during which time he switched the car he was driving, retrieved a pistol hidden behind a highway mile marker, and conversed with a fifth co-conspirator, Pablo Sanchez-Rodríguez (\"Sanchez\"), about \"getting rid\" of the blue Lumina. At six o'clock that evening, Serrano observed Morales retrieve a sack of cash from Sanchez and buy new cell phones with some of the cash. Several days after the robbery, she went with Morales to visit appellant Medina at his home. Medina and his wife had bought all new furniture. Medina told Serrano that he had \"scored a robbery and that they had to take everything out and bring in everything new.\"</p>\n<p>The FBI arrested Medina on April 2, 2002. The vehicle Medina was driving at the time of his arrest had three newspaper articles about the March 27 robbery in the glove compartment. After his arrest, he was housed in the same prison cell as Miguel Alamo-Castro (\"Alamo\"). At trial, Alamo testified that while they were cellmates Medina had revealed several incriminating details about the conspiracy to rob Ranger vehicles. For example, Medina <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> told Alamo that he had carjacked a green Ford Explorer from a man and his daughter the night before the March 27 robbery, stealing a 9 mm Glock in the process. He said that he had participated in the shootout during the March 27 robbery and that the FBI had recovered the gun he had used from the seat of the stolen Explorer after the robbery. Medina also told Alamo that he was going to use the robbery money to buy furniture and remodel his home, among other things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Indictment and Trial</h2>\n<p>Approximately one year later, on March 14, 2003, a grand jury returned a ten-count second superseding indictment charging Catalán, Medina, Morales, Sterling, and Sanchez with conspiracy to rob armored vehicles and a number of substantive offenses related to the conspiracy. Specifically, both Catalán and Medina were charged with: conspiracy to commit robbery of an armored vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3) (count one), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in relation to the conspiracy in count one, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count two),<sup>[4]</sup> aiding and abetting the March 27 robbery of an armored vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count seven), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit a crime of violence (the March 27 robbery) that resulted in the unlawful killing of Rodríguez, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1111 (count eight), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit a crime of violence (the March 27 robbery), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count nine). In addition, Medina was also charged with aiding and abetting the November 30, 2001 robbery of an armored vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count three), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit the November 30 robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3) (count four), aiding and abetting the March 26, 2002 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2119(1) (count five), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit the March 26 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3) (count six). There were no charges based on the attempted robbery of March 6, 2002, nor was that attempted robbery cited as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Jury selection began on January 25, 2005 and lasted thirteen days. Three days before trial, Catalán moved to exclude evidence that he was involved in the March 6, 2002 attempted robbery or, alternatively, for the severance of his trial from Medina's. He claimed that if the trials were severed, Medina would testify that Catalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt. After an in camera conference with Medina's lawyer during which the lawyer made a proffer of his client's expected testimony, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>Trial began on March 7, 2005. At the conclusion of the government's case, both appellants moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The district court denied their motions. At the start of appellants' case, the government moved to exclude the testimony of several witnesses whom the defendants intended to call to impeach the testimony of Torres, the armored car guard who was shot in the hand during the March 27 robbery. After hearing argument on the matter, the court granted the government's motion in part, excluding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> impeachment testimony of five law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p>On March 16, government witness Juan Bravo-Hernandez (\"Bravo\") moved to quash a subpoena for tax records that had been issued at the request of defendants. Bravo, the president and owner of Ranger American Armored Services, had been subpoenaed to produce Ranger's corporate tax returns as well as his personal tax returns. The trial court granted the motion to quash, determining that the tax documents could not be relevant to the interstate nexus inquiry,<sup>[5]</sup> which had already been established through Bravo's testimony and could not possibly be affected by any information contained in either the company's or Bravo's own tax returns. After completing their evidence, appellants again moved for a judgment of acquittal, and the trial court again denied their motions. The jury found each appellant guilty of every count charged against him. Because the defendants had been previously certified as eligible for the death penalty, the trial then proceeded to the death penalty phase, which lasted fifteen days. The same jury that decided appellants' guilt decided whether to impose the death penalty. At the conclusion of the penalty phase evidence, the jury did not agree to impose the death penalty upon either defendant. 18 U.S.C.A. § 3593(e)(3). In special verdict forms, it asked the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for Catalán and indicated that it could not agree to instruct the court to impose a life sentence for Medina.<sup>[6]</sup> Instead, the jury left Medina's sentence to the judge but indicated that it understood that the judge would impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. For count eight, the murder charge, the district court imposed on each defendant a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole; it later also imposed sentences for each of the other convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first confront Catalán's challenges to his convictions and sentence. Again, he challenges 1) the trial court's denial of his request to sever his trial from that of Medina, 2) the trial court's rulings restricting impeachment of Torres, including the court's decision to exclude extrinsic evidence that would allegedly impeach Torres's testimony, 3) the trial court's decision to quash the subpoena for tax records, and 4) the convictions on counts two, eight, and nine on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Severance</h2>\n<p>During jury selection, the defendants learned for the first time that the government planned to introduce testimony from Torres identifying Catalán as having been involved in the March 6 attempted robbery. Two-and-a-half weeks later, and four days before trial was to commence, Catalán moved to exclude the evidence, or alternatively, to sever his trial from that of Medina. He argued that if severance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> were granted, Medina would testify that Catalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt. However, if severance were not granted it would be unfair for the government to present Torres's testimony about Catalán's involvement, as Catalán would not be able to rebut that account through Medina's testimony. In a hearing on the motion, Medina's lawyer confirmed that his client would testify for Catalán if the trials were severed. Following the hearing, the judge held an in camera conference with Medina's lawyer, who made a proffer of his client's expected testimony. The court then denied the motion to exclude the evidence and the alternative motion for severance. Catalán now challenges the denial of his motion for severance.</p>\n<p>We review the court's denial of a motion for severance for manifest abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir.2008), and affirm the lower court's decision unless the defendant makes a strong and convincing showing that prejudice resulted from the denial of severance, <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 515 F.3d 74, 81 (1st Cir.2008). Defendants challenging the denial of severance must meet this high barrier on appeal because, as we have explained, in the normal course of events \"[p]ersons who are indicted together should be tried together, since this practice helps both to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve resources (judicial and prosecutorial).\" <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir.2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>In deciding the motion for severance based on the alleged need for the testimony of a co-defendant, district courts are to employ the two-tiered analysis set forth in <i>United States v. Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d 8, 19 (1st Cir.1984). To meet the first tier of that test, a defendant must demonstrate: \"(1) a bona fide need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the testimony; (3) its exculpatory nature and effect; and (4) that the co-defendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 46 F.3d 1223, 1231 (1st Cir.1995). If the defendant can make that showing, the court should move on to the second tier of the <i>Drougas</i> analysis and \"(1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant's theory of defense; (2) consider whether the testimony would be subject to substantial, damaging impeachment; (3) assess the counter arguments of judicial economy; and (4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Focusing on a first tier factor, the district court emphasized that Catalán had \"failed to make a detailed proffer for this court to evaluate the exculpatory nature of [Medina's] testimony.\" Given that Catalán was not charged with the March 6 attempted robbery, a proffer about the evidence's \"exculpatory nature\" would have been especially important to the district court's analysis. This is particularly so because the focus of the government's case against Catalán, naturally, was on the overt act charged against him in the indictment: the March 27 robbery and murder of Rodríguez. The government's strong evidence of Catalán's involvement in that robbery and the general conspiracy to rob armored truck guards included damning physical evidence and testimony linking Catalán to the scene of Rodríguez's murder, where Catalán had assisted the robbery and was apprehended holding the murder weapon.<sup>[7]</sup> Without a detailed proffer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> of the exculpatory nature of testimony about the March 6 attempted robbery, the district court was well within its discretion to conclude that Catalán had not shown a \"bona fide need for the testimony.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Although it concluded that Catalán had not met the first tier of the <i>Drougas</i> analysis, the district court nonetheless proceeded to explain that he had also not met the second tier. In particular, the court emphasized the untimeliness of the motion, the highly impeachable nature of the testimony, and Catalán's lack of an explanation of the testimony's significance to his defense. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also, </i><i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231 (\"Judicial economy is obviously not dispositive, but it is important in a lengthy conspiracy trial.\"). There was no manifest abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of the motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Order to Quash the Subpoena for Tax Returns</h2>\n<p>Catalán objects to the district court's grant of Bravo's motion to quash a subpoena for his personal tax records and the tax records of his company, Ranger American Armored Security. A trial court may quash an \"unreasonable or oppressive\" subpoena, and we review the trial court's decision to quash for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Henry,</i> 482 F.3d 27, 30 (1st. Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The defendants were indicted under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which criminalizes robberies that have an effect on interstate commerce. <i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2006). At trial, Bravo testified at length about the products his business regularly purchases from the mainland United States (such as specially equipped armored vehicles, weapons, and high-tech carrier's money bags). He also testified that the company was forced to pay high deductibles after each robbery, totaling $75,000, and explained that its insurer raised both its premium and deductible as a result of the robberies.</p>\n<p>The defendants sought the personal and corporate tax records of Bravo and his company to challenge the government's assertion that the robberies affected interstate commerce. The trial court granted Bravo's motion to quash, determining that the tax records could not be relevant to the question whether the robbery sufficiently affected interstate commerce. In granting the motion, the court relied on this circuit's settled case law that a robbery need only have \"a realistic probability of a de minimus effect on interstate commerce\" to bring it within the reach of the Hobbs Act. <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)). \"One common method for the government to establish the required `de minimis' effect on interstate commerce is to show that the defendant's activity `minimally depletes the assets of an entity doing business in interstate commerce.'\" <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (quoting <i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> 246 F.3d 52, 54 (1st. Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>We agree that Bravo's testimony about his company's participation in interstate commerce (including its regular purchases of carrier money bags, weapons, and vehicles from the United States), combined with his testimony about the financial effects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> of the robberies, was sufficient to establish a de minimus effect on interstate commerce so as to bring the robberies within the reach of the Hobbs Act. We also agree that nothing in Bravo's personal or corporate tax returns could have negated the interstate nexus proven through Bravo's testimony, even if the company's bottom line was unchanged fromor, for that matter, even if it <i>improved</i> overthat of years past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (de minimis effect established when defendant had threatened to extort $4,000 from a car dealer who participated in interstate commerce and a jury could have reasonably concluded that if the defendant had been successful the business's assets and purchasing power would have been at least temporarily depleted by $4,000). Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's exercise of its power to quash unreasonable subpoenas.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Restrictions on Impeachment<sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>Catalán claims that his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him and his Due Process rights were unconstitutionally impeded by the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce extrinsic evidence that would have contradicted the testimony of the government's key eyewitness, Torres. Specifically, he argues that he should have been permitted to introduce the testimony of several FBI agents who would have impeached Torres's trial account of the robberies and the murder. Catalán claims that the agents' excluded testimony was \"crucial to the defense theory\" because he \"wished to argue... that Torres Alejandro was unworthy of belief because (among other reasons) he dramatically changed his version of events very shortly before trial, adding new and highly aggravating details.\"</p>\n<p>Catalán names five FBI agents whom he should have been allowed to call at trial. Agents Angel Marrero and María Cruz interviewed Torres shortly after the March 27 robbery, while he was in the hospital. Marrero and Cruz took notes of their interview in an official FBI FD-302 Form (\"302\"), a form for reporting and summarizing such an interview. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez,</i> 570 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam). The 302 of their interview, which purports to record Torres's account of the robbery, does not mention certain details which Torres gave in his trial testimony and which Catalán claims \"were directly relevant to the government's theory of premeditation and death penalty.\" For example, the 302 does not mention that Rodríguez pleaded for his life and held up his arms to shield himself before Catalán shot him several times at \"point blank range,\" or that Catalán glanced defiantly at Torres before taking that action.<sup>[10]</sup> Catalán argued below and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> argues again on appeal that the agents' testimony about the March 27 incident would have undermined Torres's credibility through impeachment by omission, because Torres would not have left out such important details in his first interview if they were true. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jenkins v. Anderson,</i> 447 U.S. 231, 239, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980) (\"Common law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.\").</p>\n<p>Catalán also wished to call FBI Agents Francisco Ng and Félix Alvarado, who interviewed Torres after the November 30 robbery and also filed a 302 report. He argues that their testimony would have impeached Torres's trial account of the November 30 robbery. Whereas Torres testified at trial that he had not observed the November 30 robbery, Alvarado and Ng's report of their interview recounts that Torres had seen the robbery but had \"frozen\" and was unable to call for help. Contrary to his trial testimony, the report states that Torres did see the assailants, although it also states that he said he could not provide a good description of them.</p>\n<p>Finally, Catalán claims that he should have been able to call Agent Carlos Marchand, the FBI's case agent, to impeach Torres's account of the March 27 robbery. Catalán claims that Agent Marchand would have testified that he had never heard certain details in Torres's trial account, such as that Rodríguez pleaded for his life before Catalán unloaded his pistol into him, until Torres testified at trial.</p>\n<p>The trial court excluded the testimony of all five agents, ruling that it constituted impeachment by prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter and that the prior statements offered through agents Cruz and Marrero were not in fact inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony. However, Catalán was permitted to impeach Torres's credibility by extrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements through two other witnesses. He was permitted to call Carlos Bonilla-Rivera, a security investigator for Ranger American who recorded a statement from Torres after the November 30 robbery that was signed by Torres. In that statement, contrary to his trial testimony, Torres said that he saw, and was able to describe, one of the assailants. The defendants also called Agent Ríos-Calzada, who interviewed Torres after the March 6 robbery and took a written statement from him that was inconsistent with his trial testimony. The written statement was entered into evidence. The court provided no explanation for why these witnesses could be called for impeachment and not the others, except that Torres had signed the statements he made to the two witnesses and therefore he had \"adopted\" the statements.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> On appeal, Catalán contests the court's decision to exclude the testimony of Agents Ng, Alvaredo, Cruz, Marrero, and Marchand.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Catalán's Constitutional Claims</h2>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment protects a criminal defendant's right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const. Amend. VI. Although the ability to pursue an impeaching line of inquiry with the introduction of extrinsic evidence supporting that inquiry might be viewed as part and parcel of the right to cross-examination, this circuit has yet to decide whether the Confrontation Clause provides defendants a right to impeach witnesses through extrinsic evidence. In <i>White v. Coplan,</i> 399 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.2005), for example, a criminal defendant was found to have the right under the Confrontation Clause to cross-examine his accusers about false allegations they had made in the past, but the panel did not reach the question whether he had a right to introduce extrinsic evidence about those allegations. It was specifically noted that \"cross-examination and extrinsic proof are two different issues.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. The panel wrote that \"we are not endorsing any open-ended constitutional right to offer extrinsic evidence [for impeachment purposes]. Such an excursion requires more witnesses and documents, and so greater risk of confusion and delay....\" <i>Id.</i> at 26; <i>see also </i><i>Farley v. Lafler,</i> 193 Fed.Appx. 543, 547 (6th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (\"The Supreme Court has not recognized the sweep of the Confrontation Clause to extend beyond guaranteeing the criminal defendant's right[ ] to physically confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses to encompass the right to impeach an adverse witness by putting on a third-party witness.\") (quotation marks and citation omitted). Appellant makes no attempt to address <i>White</i> or otherwise explain specifically why the Confrontation Clause requires the introduction of the extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes, and has therefore waived his conclusory Confrontation Clause argument. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>However, as appellant points out, and the government acknowledges, \"[w]hether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986). In <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973) (also cited by appellant in his brief), the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional dimension of a defendant's right to present witnesses in his defense, noting that \"[f]ew rights are more fundamental.\" In <i>Chambers,</i> the excluded witnesses could have implicated a person other than the defendant, and their testimony <span class=\"star-pagination\">*466</span> would have impeached that other person's denial of involvement in the crime. <i>Id.</i> at 292, 93 S.Ct. 1038. The exclusion of those witnesses infringed the defendant's due process right to \"present witnesses in his own defense\" and contributed to the denial of a constitutionally fair trial. <i>Id.</i> at 302-03, 93 S.Ct. 1038</p>\n<p>Because appellant has cited <i>Chambers</i> and other Due Process cases, he has not waived that constitutional claim, and his complaint must be examined under the Due Process rubric. In that analysis, \"[a] defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998);<sup>[13]</sup><i>see also </i><i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988) (\"The accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"). Constitutional errors are reviewed for harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Bembury v. Butler,</i> 968 F.2d 1399, 1400 (1st Cir.1992).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Trial Court's Ruling on Inconsistency</h2>\n<p>The court ruled that the statement made by Torres at the hospital following the March 27 murder of Rodríguez, recorded in a 302 by agents Marerro and Cruz, was not inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony.<sup>[15]</sup> The court concluded that in light of Torres's injured condition at the time of the interview, the fact that he had taken pain medication, the short duration of the interview, and the fact that \"we don't know what type of questions the agents asked,\" it would not have been \"natural\" for Torres <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> to include the aggravating details. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 320-21 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Prior statements... that omit details included in a witness's trial testimony are inconsistent if it would have been `natural' for the witness to include the details in the earlier statement.\"). The substance of defendants' proffer specifically stated, however, that Agent Cruz would testify that in her estimation Torres was an appropriate subject for an interview. Defense counsel proffered that Agent Cruz would testify as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>She would say that she recognized that he was in pain, that he had been shot, I think it was in the left hand, that she, in accordance with procedure and policy, took notes during the interview, that she recorded all of the important things that he said about the event, that the notes were effectively transcribed into a written report which ... she reviewed, initialed, as did Mr. Marrero, for accuracy.... She said that while he was in pain, in her opinion he was a subject for an interview. She did not feel that he was incapacitated or incapable of being interviewed and providing information. That during the interview itself, as he described the events that took place on March 27th, at no time during that interview did he indicate Mr. Rodríguez has his arms raised in a submissive mode prior to being shot. He did not at any time indicate that, prior to Mr. Rodríguez being shot, in the position with his arms raised, did he hear him say, please, no, please, no, please, no, and he did not indicate in any way that prior to that, in the mode with his hands raised, that the assailant, who he later identified in court as Mr. Hernaldo Medina Villegas, approached him from the front and shot him twice in the chest.<sup>[16]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Defense counsel also proffered that Agent Cruz had stated that she did not remember whether the interview was conducted in a question and answer format, or whether she had simply recorded Torres's narrative.</p>\n<p>Unlike <i>Meserve,</i> on which the district court relied for its ruling that the omitted details were not inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony, the details omitted in Torres's earlier statement were not \"peripheral\" but went directly to the important element of premeditation as well as the possible imposition of the death penalty. <i>Cf. </i><i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 321 (where \"nuances [were] peripheral,\" district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding impeachment by omission through extrinsic evidence). As described in the discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Medina's conviction on the murder charge, <i>see infra</i> Part III(A), the indictment charged that the defendants had acted \"with premeditation\" in killing Rodríguez. With respect to premeditation, \"it is the fact of deliberation, of second thought[,] that is important.\" <i>United States v. Frappier,</i> 807 F.2d 257, 261 (1st Cir. 1986) (<i>citing </i><i>Fisher v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 463, 469 n. 3, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946)). The victim crying out for his life before he was shot by the defendant was some of the government's most persuasive evidence that Catalán had acted with premeditation in shooting Rodríguez.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> Second, the impeachment was inconsistent in an important sense because the details that were essential to the government's death penalty case were left out of Torres's first interview. The same jury that decided the guilt phase was later asked to determine whether the death penalty was appropriate, and in doing so was specifically instructed that it could \"consider any evidence that was presented during the guilt phase of the trial.\" In the penalty phase, the jury was asked to consider whether certain \"statutory aggravating factors\" applied to the crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591, 3592. These included whether the crime was committed in a \"heinous, cruel or depraved manner,\" and whether the victim was vulnerable.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, the jury had to decide whether the murder of Rodríguez was a cold-blooded execution, or something else. Torres added several details at trial that went to that core issue and formed a central aspect of his narrative of the events of March 27, but which he had not mentioned in his earlier account. There was uncertainty about Torres's mental and physical condition at the time of the interview in the hospital, and the way in which the interview was conducted. Under these circumstances, it was an abuse of discretion for the court to determine that the crucial omissions in Marrero and Cruz's 302 report of their interview with Torres were \"natural\" and not inconsistent with his trial testimony. The significance of the omissions was a jury issue.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The Trial Court's Collateral Fact Rulings</h2>\n<p>Under the common law of evidence and the law of this circuit, impeachment by extrinsic evidence is normally restricted to impeachment on matters that are not collateral. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.2008) (\"`It is well established that a party may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993)).<sup>[19]</sup> A matter is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> considered collateral if \"`the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the witness.'\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4 (quoting 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 45 (4th ed. 1992)).</p>\n<p>The rule restricting impeachment to non-collateral matters is analogous to Rule 403's relevancy balancing test, which calls for relevant evidence to be excluded when its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by ... considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time....\" Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4. Although any demonstrated inconsistency in a witness's statement may impeach a witness's credibility, other concerns (such as wasting time and misleading the jury) become more important when the inconsistency at issue involves a statement relating to a matter that \"`is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence.'\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4 (quoting 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 45, 169 (4th ed. 1992)). On the other hand, when a statement that would be the subject of impeachment \"is logically relevant to the merits of the case as well as the witness's credibility, it is worth the additional court time entailed in hearing extrinsic evidence.\" 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence § 49</i> (6th ed. 2006).</p>\n<p>Over defendants' protestations to the contrary, the trial court repeatedly ruled that evidence of Torres's prior inconsistent statements about the robberies was not admissible because it was \"collateral.\" For example, in response to defendants' request to impeach Torres's claim that Rodríguez had pleaded for his life before being shot, the court said, \"it's collateral source, collateral impeachment by extrinsic evidence because whether he said, no, no, oryes, yes ... that all doesn't go directly to the issues of guilt or innocence of the two defendants.\"</p>\n<p>It is true that this circuit has said that \"[i]n light of the collateral issue rule, in order to be admissible, ... testimony must not only contradict a statement ... but also be material to [the defendant's] guilt or innocence.\" <i>United States v. Mulinelli-Navas,</i> 111 F.3d 983, 988 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>United States v. Payne,</i> 102 F.3d 289, 295 (7th Cir.1996)). However, it appears that the district court may have interpreted that statementor one like itto mean that in order to be material here, the extrinsic evidence at issue must relate to whether the defendant did or did not shoot Rodríguez, or whether he stole the money, and not how the shooting or robbery were carried out.</p>\n<p>This is too narrow a view. As has been noted, some of the details Catalán sought to impeachsuch as the defendants' and victim's behavior during the shooting plainly helped the government establish the premeditation that was charged as an aspect of the murder in count eight. Furthermore, several of the details were certainly relevant to the jury's consideration of the death penalty if the defendants were convicted.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See </i><i>Kines v. Butterworth,</i> 669 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> F.2d at 6, 12 (1st Cir.1981). Torres was the only eyewitness to the March 27 murder of his partner, and was also a witness to and victim of the November 30 robbery. He had testified that the crimes were committed in a certain way, and the defendants sought to impeach him by introducing evidence through his prior inconsistent statements that the crimes were not committed that way. His accounts of the robberies and murder were unquestionably material to the government's case against Catalán, including its request for the death penalty, even if the impeachment of Torres on details of those accounts may not have exculpated Catalán from involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Catalán argued below and argues on appeal that the trial court should have permitted the impeachment because it went to matters brought out on direct examination by the government, not through cross-examination by the defendant. That distinction is significant. The government's own belief that Torres's account of the details of the robberies and the murder were important supports the non-collateral nature of the inconsistencies identified by Catalán.<sup>[21]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Sotomayor-Vázquez,</i> 249 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2001) (despite the prohibitions of Rule 404(b), \"[w]hen a defendant has, on direct examination, made a general denial of engaging in conduct material to the case, the prosecution may impeach that testimony by proving that the defendant did engage in that conduct on a prior occasion\"). Finally, Catalán argues that exposure of the inconsistencies would have revealed Torres's motive to testify falsely: \"fixing up all holes in the government's case, maximizing the chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death penalty verdict in modern times.\" This circuit has said that \"a witness's... motive to testify falsely is generally considered to be a non-collateral issue.\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, the district court erred in excluding the testimony of the agents because of its view that their testimony dealt with a collateral matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Harmless Error</h2>\n<p>Both of the district court's rationales for excluding the impeachment testimony of the five government agentsthat some of the statements were not inconsistent and that all of the proffered testimony was collateralwere erroneous applications of the rules of evidence. However, \"[v]iolation of a rule of evidence does not itself amount to a constitutional violation.\" <i>Evans v. Verdini,</i> 466 F.3d 141, 145 (1st Cir.2006). It is not necessary to decide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic evidence was an error of constitutional dimension. Under the circumstances of this case, even if there was a constitutional error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence against Catalán was overwhelming: he was found wounded at the scene of the March 27 robbery and murder, holding one of the two murder weapons, and he was later <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> identified in court as the perpetrator. That inculpatory evidence would not have been impeached by the evidence that he sought to introduce through any of the agents. Furthermore, Catalán was permitted to impeach Torres's credibility by extrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements through Bonilla and Ríos, whose interviews with Torres following the November 30 and March 6 incidents differed from Torres's accounts at trial.</p>\n<p>Of course, if Catalán had been sentenced to death, it might be necessary to decide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic evidence about the March 27 incident<sup>[22]</sup> was an error of constitutional dimension, because the harmless error analysis might well be different. As noted, in the penalty phase of the trial, the same jury that had decided appellants' guilt was asked to determine whether to impose the death penalty, and was expressly instructed that it could consider the evidence it heard in the guilt phase. Defense counsel expressed this concern at trial, arguing that if Torres's testimony went unimpeached, the defendants' lawyers would not later be able to \"unring the bell\" about the reprehensible details when it came time for the jury to deliberate about whether to impose the death penalty. That argument was apt, but, in the final analysis, the jury apparently did unring the bell.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. The Trial Court's <i>Sua Sponte</i> Comments</h2>\n<p>Catalán points to several portions in the trial transcript where the judge interrupted defense counsel, restricting or directing the course of defense counsel's examination. Catalán claims that these interruptions violated his Confrontation Clause right to cross-examine witnesses against him. After reading the excerpted portions of the transcript in context, it is clear that appellant's objections are groundless. In many places, the district court directed counsel on the proper way to conduct the examination; in others, the court reprimanded trial counsel for ignoring its earlier rulings. The court also interrupted the government's lawyers on occasion, and frequently sided with the defendants on objections. \"It is well-established that a judge is not a mere umpire; he is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct, and has a perfect rightalbeit a right that should be exercised with careto participate actively in the trial proper.\" <i>Logue v. Dore,</i> 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). After careful consideration of the trial transcript, it is clear that the trial court overstepped no boundaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Double Jeopardy</h2>\n<p>Catalán claims that some of his convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids punishing a person twice for the same offense. U.S. Const. amend. V. In <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), the Supreme Court set forth the following test for determining whether multiple punishments for related offenses violate the Double <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> Jeopardy Clause: \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"</p>\n<p>The government has sensibly conceded that the convictions for the offenses in counts eight and nine violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Count nine set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for carrying a firearm in furtherance of the March 27 robbery. Count eight set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(j) for use of firearm during the March 27th robbery, which resulted in the death of Rodríguez. Count nine was a lesser included offense of count eight, as it did not require proof of any fact not required for conviction on count eight. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d 3, 10 (1st Cir.2006) (a § 924(c)(1) offense can be a lesser included offense of a § 924(j) offense).<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, we reject Catalán's contention that his convictions on counts two and eight constitute a violation of double jeopardy. Because he did not raise this claim below, we review it for plain error. <i>United States v. Winter,</i> 70 F.3d 655, 659 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, Catalán must show that: 1) there was an error, 2) it was plain, 3) it affected a substantial right, and 4) it \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The firearm conviction on count two is for the use of a firearm in connection with the overall conspiracy to rob armored vehicles (the count one conspiracy), whereas the firearm conviction on count eight is for use of a firearm in connection with the substantive robbery committed on March 27 (the count seven robbery). Therefore, counts two and nine each \"require[ ] proof of a fact which the other does not.\" <i>Blockburger,</i> 284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. 180; <i>cf. </i><i>Marino,</i> 277 F.3d at 39 (\"[A] substantive RICO violation and a RICO conspiracy are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.\"). We therefore find no error, let alone plain error, in Catalán's conviction on count two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant Medina challenges: 1) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction of count eight (the murder count), 2) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction of counts five and six (the carjacking counts), 3) the district court's failure to allow him the opportunity for allocution before being sentenced to life imprisonment on count eight, and 4) the district court's calculation of the guideline sentencing range on count eight.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>Before discussing Medina's specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence against him on counts five, six, and eight, we discuss a more general challenge that he apparently intends to make for all of the counts that charge him with \"aiding and abetting\" in the perpetration of a crime. He contends that he could not have been convicted of aiding and abetting because no \"principal\" was charged with and convicted of the crimes. Appellant's claim is based on a mistaken understanding of our law. \"One who aids and abets a crime is punishable as a principal,\" <i>United States v. Carlos Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 507 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2, and \"an aider and abettor in the commission of a federal offense may be convicted, although the principal had been acquitted of the offense charged.\" <i>United States v. Cyr,</i> 712 F.2d 729, 732 (1st Cir.1983) (citing <i>Standefer v. United States,</i> 447 U.S. 10, 20, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980)). While \"[i]t is axiomatic that an aiding and abetting conviction requires proof that the substantive crime has been committed,\" <i>Cyr,</i> 712 F.2d at 732, there was overwhelming proof that the underlying crimesessentially robbery, use of firearms, carjacking, and murderwere committed. Among other evidence, there was testimony from Cruz, Torres, and Bravo which, taken together, detailed how armed assailants, pointing weapons, stole significant sums of cash from Ranger's guards on November 30, 2001 and March 27, 2002. Furthermore, Julía testified that his Ford Explorer was stolen from him by men pointing firearms at him, and the same Ford Explorer was later found abandoned with the engine running near the scene of the March 27 robbery. Julía's Glock, stolen along with the Explorer, was found inside the vehicle and had been fired several times during the robbery. Finally, and tragically, it is unquestionable that Rodríguez was gunned down on March 27 while performing his duties as a Ranger guard. The testimony of Torres, law enforcement officers who arrived at the scene, and forensics experts who examined the ballistics from the scene all consistently explain how Rodríguez was murdered in the course of the robbery. Simply put, there is nothing to appellant's claim that the evidence that any principal had actually committed these crimes was too thin for him to be convicted as an aider and abettor in the crimes.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Medina also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence undergirding his convictions for carjacking (count five), use of a firearm during carjacking (count six), and the murder of Rodríguez (count eight). We review sufficiency of the evidence challenges de novo, \"evaluating whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Meléndez-Torres,</i> 420 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Conviction for carjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119 requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant: 1) took or attempted to take from the person or presence of another, 2) a motor vehicle that had been \"transported shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce,\" 3) with \"force and violence or by intimidation\", 4) with \"intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\" 18 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> U.S.C. § 2119; <i>United States v. García-Alvarez,</i> 541 F.3d 8, 16 (1st. Cir.2008). A rational jury could have found each of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Julía testified that his green Ford Explorer was taken from him by two men on the night of March 26, 2002 and that one of the men pointed a nickel-plated pistol at Julía's face while demanding he exit the car. Co-conspirator Morales always carried a nickel-plated pistol. The same Ford Explorer, which the parties stipulated had traveled through interstate commerce, was found the next day near the scene of the robbery. Julía's Glock firearm, which had been in the glove compartment of the Ford Explorer when it was stolen, had been used during the robbery to shoot and kill Rodríguez. Torres identified Medina as the person who had used the Glock during the shootout. A government witness, Castro, testified that while he was a cellmate of Medina, Medina recounted his involvement in the carjacking as well as other crimes in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>There was also sufficient evidence to convict Medina on count six, the related offense of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in conjunction with the carjacking. Again, Julía testified that the men who had stolen the car had pointed a nickel-plated pistol at his face.</p>\n<p>Finally, there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that Medina was guilty of count eight, which charged that he aided and abetted the use of a firearm during a violent crime that unlawfully killed Rodríguez, with malice aforethought (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1111) \"and with premeditation.\" \"18 U.S.C. § 1111 `was intended to adopt the felony murder rule, and for a stated felony the `malice' element is satisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.'\" <i>United States v. Morales-Machuca,</i> 546 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Shea,</i> 211 F.3d 658, 674 (1st Cir.2000)). Therefore, murder that results from robbery is first degree murder. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (\"Every murder ... committed in the perpetration of ... robbery ... is murder in the first degree.\"). Nonetheless, the indictment also charged that defendants acted with premeditation. \"Premeditation\" contemplates a temporal dimension, which need only be an \"appreciable\" amount of time; \"it is the fact of deliberation, of second thought[,] that is important.\" <i>Frappier,</i> 807 F.2d at 261 (citing <i>Fisher,</i> 328 U.S. at 469 n. 3, 66 S.Ct. 1318). The judge instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote>[P]remeditation is typically associated with killing in cold blood and require[s] the period of time in which the accused deliberates or thinks the matter over before acting. The law does not specify or require any exact period of time that must pass between the formation of the intent to kill and the killing itself. But it must be long enough for the killer after forming the intent to kill to be fully consc[ious] of that intent.</blockquote>\n<p>A reasonable jury could have found all of the elements of count eight beyond a reasonable doubt. First, Torres identified Medina as having fired the first of several shots at Rodríguez, while Rodríguez was on the ground with his arms raised and was not holding a weapon. Medina bragged to his prison cellmate, Alamo, that he had obtained a Glock with a laser from a carjacking which he later used in the March 27 shootout. Government experts explained that the Glock had been fired several times at the scene, and that at least one of its bullets hit Rodríguez and would have proven fatal even if Rodríguez had not also been wounded by Catalán's Berretta. Finally, Medina was in possession of several newspaper articles about the March 27 robbery at the time of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> arrest. There was sufficient evidence not only that Medina \"aided and abetted\" the violent felony that brought about the death of Rodríguez, but that he also shared with Catalán the primary responsibility for that death.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, a rational jury could conclude that Medina is guilty of count eight as well as counts five and six. Therefore, we affirm all of the convictions against Medina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing Challenges</h2>\n<p>Medina challenges the district court's failure to allow him the opportunity to allocute before sentencing him on count eight, the felony murder charge. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A) requires that before imposing sentence a judge \"address the defendant personally and ask the defendant if the defendant wishes to make a statement in the defendant's own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" Medina was not afforded that opportunity before being sentenced on count eight.</p>\n<p>The government correctly concedes that Medina should be re-sentenced at a proceeding where he is present and afforded the opportunity to address the court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Burgos-Andújar,</i> 275 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2001) (due to the importance of Rule 32(i)(4)(A), which \"reflects our long tradition of giving all defendants the right to directly address the court and plead for mercy,\" \"if a sentencing court fails to provide a defendant with the chance to address the court, the reviewing court must remand the case for resentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice.\"). Therefore, we vacate Medina's sentence on count eight and remand to the district court for re-sentencing. Because we remand for resentencing, we need not reach Medina's alternative argument that the district court failed to comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the conviction and sentence of appellant Catalán on count nine and further direct that the special assessment on that count be removed. We further vacate Medina's sentence on count eight and remand for resentencing. All other convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN and STAHL, Circuit Judges, concurring.</p>\n<p>Although we concur in the result and in most of what our colleague has written, our reasons differ from his in rejecting one of the principal claims of error. Among other claims raised on appeal, Lorenzo Catalán-Roman (\"Catalán\") challenges the district court's exclusion of testimony from FBI agents that he contends would have impeached Eluber Torres-Alejandro's (\"Torres\") testimony, most importantly, Torres' testimony about the robbery and murder on March 27, 2002. Our colleague believes there was error but that it was harmless; in our view no error was committed by the district judge.</p>\n<p>Torres testified that Gilberto Rodríguez-Cabrera (\"Rodríguez\") had his hands in the air before any shots were fired, and that after Torres heard the first shot, Rodríguez fell backward, leaning against the front window of the credit union at which the robbery occurred; with his hands still <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> raised, Rodriguez then pleaded for his life before being shot by co-defendant Hernaldo Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\"); Rodríguez then fell to the ground wounded, after which Catalán shot him multiple times.<sup>[27]</sup> The allegedly inconsistent testimony that Catalán wanted to introduce was expected testimony from FBI agents, who interviewed Torres in the hospital, that Torres did not mention Rodríguez' raising of hands and pleading for his life.</p>\n<p>The district judge said that the omissions were not inconsistent with Torres' court testimony (the court testimony added details but did not contradict the hospital statements) and, in addition, the hand raising and pleading (if they occurred) were merely \"collateral\" to the issues on trial and therefore not proper subjects for impeachment by extrinsic evidence. Under applicable evidence law, either rulingif correctwould justify excluding the testimony, 1 K. Broun, <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> §§ 34, 36, at 152, 156 (6th ed. 2006), but Catalán disputes both rulings, contending that his constitutional right to present a fair defense was impaired by mistaken evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p>Although Catalán cites constitutional precedent, such as <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), he does not develop any constitutional claim independent of his assertion that the court misapplied familiar federal common-law doctrine on impeachment by inconsistency and the collateral issue rule. Even if we assumed <i>arguendo</i> that errors in applying those rules were themselves constitutional errorhardly like to be so in all casesit would affect only the harmless error standard to be applied, <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 22-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), and in this case we think there was no error by the district judge in finding the omissions not inconsistent with Torres' testimony.</p>\n<p>Starting with the issue of inconsistency, the ordinary rule is that earlier omissions in reciting the same storyalthough not literally contradictions of later testimonycan be used to impeach a witness for inconsistency (on cross examination of the witness but not necessarily by extrinsic evidence) <i>if</i> the omitted information was not stated earlier \"in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.\" <i>Jenkins v. Anderson,</i> 447 U.S. 231, 239, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980); <i>United States v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 320-21 (1st Cir. 2001). Ordinarily, one might think that lurid details of the kind supplied in Torres' trial testimony might well have been supplied in the prior FBI interview; so, if they were not, this would allow, although it would not compel, an inference of inconsistency and so make the omissions relevant.</p>\n<p>But the circumstances here were not ordinary. Torres was interviewed in the hospital, in pain and under medication; and while he was a critical witness, he was interviewed for only 15 to 20 minutes. Defense counsel asserted to the district court that one agent would testify that although Torres \"was in pain,\" in her opinion he was not \"incapacitated or incapable of being interviewed and providing information,\" but this does not mean that he was in the same condition as an ordinary witness or likely to be subject to the same degree or duration of questioning. Another agent testified (during co-defendant Medina's penalty phase) that such an interview usually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> lasts several hours and that Torres' interview was \"[o]bviously not\" conducted under ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>In addition, the agents' main job was to find out who were the robbers and who had done the shooting. That Torres would likely have volunteered from his hospital bed details about raised hands and pleading is far from obvious, and so the supposed inference of inconsistency is of very doubtful force. There was no proffer by Catalán, and no reason to believe, that any agent was prepared to testify that Torres had been asked about raised hands, pleading or anything else focusing on these details and had denied such happenings. Absent inconsistency, the failure to mention the details had no impeachment value.</p>\n<p>Although some trial judges might have left the matter to the jury, the district judge is entitled to make the threshold judgment as to inconsistency as an admissibility ruling, and such a call (like most other threshold admissibility rulings), is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 321. The trial judge found that in the circumstances it would not have been natural for Torres to add the details in question; and, given that admissibility depends not on <i>any</i> literal inconsistency but entirely on an inference about what a witness would likely have volunteered in these circumstances, we are not prepared to find an abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p>Likely the district judge would not have prevented Catalán from cross-examining Torres himself as to whether and why he had previously omitted details, and Catalán's counsel did ask Torres some questions about the March 27 interview with the FBI agents (although Torres largely testified only that he did not remember what happened in the interview). Typically, latitude is allowed in cross-examining the witness already on the stand whose reactions may be grist for the jury even without inconsistency. But before having <i>other</i> witnesses called, and trial time spent as well on exploring another dimension of Torres' medical condition, the district judge was entitled to insist on inconsistency and reasonably concluded that the omissions here did not qualify.</p>\n<p>Although it does not affect the outcome as to the omissions in this case, a further limitation exists on the right to call a separate witness to testify to inconsistent statements: the traditional rule is that <i>extrinsic evidence</i> of prior inconsistent statements by the witness can be offered only if the earlier statements also were relevant to the substance of the case (in jargon, were \"not collateral\"). <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1017, 173 L.Ed.2d 306 (2009); <i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1993). If so, the excursion required by extrinsic evidence is deemed worthwhile; otherwise, not.</p>\n<p>Here, the indictment charged premeditationalthough it could have relied on felony murder instead, 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (2006)<sup>[28]</sup>and one might think that the supposed hand raising and pleading could bear on premeditation. But forensic evidence established that Catalán shot Rodríguez after the latter had already been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> wounded by Medina, and Torres' testimony, unimpeached in this regard, merely confirmed this sequence of events. Shooting an already wounded man ordinarily meets the requirements of premeditationno particular interval is required, <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 518 F.2d 821, 826 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 423 U.S. 917, 96 S.Ct. 225, 46 L.Ed.2d 146 (1975)so as to guilt it scarcely mattered whether Rodríguez had raised his hands and pleaded.</p>\n<p>The lurid details about hand raising and pleading were relevantthat is, not collateralto the jury's <i>further</i> choice in the second phase of the trial as to whether to recommend death or life imprisonment. Thus, if the hospital-bed omissions were deemed inconsistent, extrinsic evidence of them would have to be allowed at that second stage. It is hard to imagine that at any penalty stage a judge would have excluded testimony bearing on the circumstances of the killing even if it consisted merely of Torres' failure to mention any details in an earlier interview.<sup>[29]</sup> In the event, the jury did not recommend the death penalty and the judge made clear his own default position was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A more direct contradiction, about which Catalán also complains, concerns Torres' testimony about the earlier robbery on November 30, 2001. At trial, Torres testified that he did not observe the November 30 robbery or the assailants; earlier, it appears, two other FBI agents had interviewed him about the robbery and he told the FBI agents (according to their notes) that he saw the robbery but \"froze\" and could not call for help and that he saw the assailants but could not describe them. At trial Catalán sought to have the agents testify to the inconsistency, but the trial judge ruled it a collateral issue.</p>\n<p>If Torres did make the earlier statements, they were certainly inconsistent and so went to his credibility, but (as already noted) this permits impeachment only through cross examination and not by extrinsic evidence unless the contradiction is material to the merits of the case. Here, it is hard to see how the contradiction is of any assistance to Catalán on the merits. He was not charged with participation in the November 30 robbery, and neither version of Torres' testimonythe one offered at trial or the one given earlier to the agentsimplicated Catalán in that robbery. Nor does Catalán offer in his brief any explanation beyond saying that the two versions contradict one another which goes only to credibility and not to the subject matter of the case.</p>\n<p>Catalán also claims that, beyond impeaching the specific facts in Torres' testimony, the excluded FBI agent testimony in both instances also would have demonstrated Torres' bias and improper motive in testifying, and so was not collateral. But this is not so and the claim is not persuasively explained; the excluded testimony did not establish what Torres' bias and improper motive were, it merely contradicted certain details in Torres' version of events. Nor did Catalán make this bias or motive argument in the district court: he argued only that Torres' testimony was inconsistent and Torres therefore not credible; the new ground is not only unsupported but forfeit. Fed.R.Evid. 103(a); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we conclude that with respect to the claimed evidentiary errors, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*479</span> district judge permissibly excluded the extrinsic evidence in question. Harmless error doctrine happens to produce the same result in this case, but it is important to future cases that governing evidence law be reaffirmed. Trials are full of such evidentiary rulings, often made under pressure, and those made here were within the province of the trial judge.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  David Morales-Machuca (\"Morales\"), an indicted co-conspirator, drove a blue Chevy Lumina, and Medina drove a two-toned motorcycle.</p>\n<p>[2]  According to Morales's ex-girlfriend, who testified at trial, Morales always carried a nickel-plated pistol.</p>\n<p>[3]  Sterling was quickly apprehended.</p>\n<p>[4]  18 U.S.C. § 2, included in all of the aiding and abetting charges, makes it illegal to aid and abet the commission of a federal offense.</p>\n<p>[5]  18 U.S.C. § 1951, under which appellants were charged, criminalizes only those robberies which \"obstruct[], delay[], or affect[]\" interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3). <i>See infra</i> Part II(B).</p>\n<p>[6]  Under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. § 3591 <i>et seq.,</i> \"[u]pon a recommendation under section 3593(e) that the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of release, the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly. Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser sentence that is authorized by law.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3594; <i>see also </i><i>Jones v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 373, 377-79, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (describing jury's role in imposing death penalty pursuant to the Federal Death Penalty Act).</p>\n<p>[7]  Beyond asserting that Torres's testimony about the March 6 incident was \"highly beneficial to the government on the issues of premeditation and participation in the conspiracy,\" Catalán does not develop an argument that, if the jury were to disbelieve Torres that Catalán was involved in the March 6 attempt, the substantial evidence of his participation in the March 27 robbery would have been insufficient to convict him of the conspiracy (count one) or aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy (count two). Because this argument is not developed \"beyond a cursory mention,\" <i>Cao v. Puerto Rico,</i> 525 F.3d 112, 114 n. 2 (1st Cir.2008), we deem it to be waived.</p>\n<p>[8]  Catalán also complains that the district court's order quashing the Bravo subpoena denied him his Sixth Amendment right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" U.S. Const. Amend. VI. This constitutional claim was not raised at trial, and we therefore review it for plain error. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d 29, 38 (1st. Cir.2009). Given our view about the minimal relevance of the tax records to the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act charges, there was no denial of Catalán's constitutional right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.</p>\n<p>[9]  The discussion from section C.1 through section C.5 reflects the views of the writing judge only. My colleagues express their separate views in the concurrence that follows this opinion.</p>\n<p>[10]  In his brief, Catalán also claims that Agents Marrero and Cruz would have been able to impeach Torres's trial account of the March 6 attempted robbery. As far as can be discerned from the record (appellant gives us no citations other than an unidentified quotation, and the agents' report is not included in the record), this is a misleading statement of the evidence. At no time during the extensive discussions and arguments over this matter during trialnot even when the defendants made a proffer about Agent Cruz's testimonywas it suggested that Marrero or Cruz had ever discussed the March 6 attempt with Torres. The record <i>does</i> indicate, however, that FBI agent José Rios Calzada conducted an interview of Torres after the March 6 attempt and that Torres's account of the attempt was different during that interview than it was at trial. Nonetheless, the defendants were permitted to call him to the stand and, for purposes of impeachment, they entered the 302 report of the interview into evidence. <i>See</i> discussion <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[11]  That distinction has no basis in the rules of evidence or the common law of impeachment. \"Any form of statement is acceptable\" for impeachment by prior inconsistent statement. 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 34 at n. 5 (6th ed. 2006). Federal Rule of Evidence 613(b) only requires that the impeached witness be \"afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the [prior statement] and the opposite party [be] afforded the opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon,\" and has no requirement that the witness have adopted the prior statement.</p>\n<p>[12]  The government argues that two of the five witnesses \"would have possibly presented cumulative testimony.\" Cruz and Marrero would presumably have given similar testimony, as would Ng and Alvarado. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 403 (relevant evidence may be excluded, among other reasons, if it constitutes \"needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"). For reasons discussed below, it is not crucial that this contention be resolved.</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Scheffer,</i> the Court wrote that:\n</p>\n<p>A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions. A defendant's interest in presenting such evidence may thus bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. As a result, state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials. Such rules do not abridge an accused's right to present a defense so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve. Moreover, we have found the exclusion of relevant evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[14]  The government argues that \"[s]ince the defendant failed to raise some of [the] specific claims or arguments at trial or below, the Court reviews the claims for plain error.\" The government's only specific contention in this regard is that Catalán did not raise the argument that the impeachment would expose Torres's bias or motive to testify, which, in the words of Catalán, was to \"fix[ ] up all holes in the government's case, maximizing the chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death penalty verdict in modern times.\" However, appellant argued below:\n</p>\n<p>The defense gets to say to the jury ... are these details things that would be left out... if they really happened? Or are these details that are being added on later to make it a better death penalty case? That's our right to argue....</p>\n<p>Although the issue is close, appellant's bias and motive argument is treated as having been properly raised. In addition to arguing that it would expose bias and motive, appellant unquestionably made the argument below that the impeachment would call into doubt Torres's credibility generally in the sense that, for whatever reason, he testified at trial to inflammatory details about the robberies and murder that he had not mentioned during prior interviews.</p>\n<p>[15]  The court offered this ruling as a supplemental basis for exclusion of the impeachment, after making its ruling on the collateral fact issue. <i>See infra</i> Part II(c)(4). This issue is discussed first, however, because it is the logical antecedent of the ruling that the impeachment was collateral.</p>\n<p>[16]  Although it is not included in the proffer, later discussions among the parties make clear that the 302 also recorded that Torres described a second shooter who, while wounded on the ground, fired several shots at the victim. However, this account of the second shooter, presumably Catalán, did not include the details of concern to appellant.</p>\n<p>[17]  The government could have secured a first degree murder conviction without specifically charging premeditation, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a), but it nonetheless included premeditation in the charge on count eight as an element of the charged offense. The judge instructed the jury that it must find both malice aforethought as well as premeditation in order to convict the defendants. Although the defendants were charged with \"aiding and abetting\" the commission of the murder in count eight, that charge did not lessen the mental state required to convict appellant of the murder charge. Even under the aiding and abetting theory of liability, the government was required to prove that Catalán \"consciously shared\" the principal's intent. <i>United States v. Mangual-Corchado,</i> 139 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.1998) (an aiding and abetting murder conviction \"required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Cirilo, before the murder occurred, consciously shared [the principal's] intention to kill Meijas and sought to ensure the success of the criminal enterprise....\").</p>\n<p>[18]  <i>See</i> 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 34 (6th ed. 2006):\n</p>\n<p>[W]hat degree of inconsistency between the witness's testimony and his previous statement is required? ... The test ought to be: Could the jury reasonably find that a witness who believed the truth of the facts testified to would be unlikely to make a prior statement of this tenor? ... Instead of restricting the use of prior statements by a mechanical test of inconsistency, in case of doubt the courts should lean toward receiving such statements to aid in evaluating the testimony. After all, the pretrial statements were made when memory was fresher and when there was less time for the play of bias. Thus, they are often more trustworthy than the testimony.</p>\n<p>[19]  <i>But see</i> 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 49 (6th ed. 2006) (\"Given Rule 402 [which provides that \"all relevant evidence is admissible\"], there is a powerful argument that the collateral fact rule was impliedly repealed by enactment of the Federal Rules. Under this reading of the Federal Rules, there is no rigid prohibition on introducing extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness on a collateral matter; rather, under Rule 403, the judge would make a practical judgment as to whether the importance of the witness's testimony and the impeachment warrants the expenditure of the additional trial time. However, the collateral fact rule was so ingrained at common law that many federal opinions continue to mention `collateral' evidence.\"). This circuit continues to apply the collateral fact rule. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>[20]  Because it is not necessary to this decision, the significance, if any, of the fact that Agents Ng and Alvarado would have testified about a robbery for which appellant was not charged (the November 30 robbery) is not addressed.</p>\n<p>[21]  However, this is not to suggest that testimony elicited on direct is always or automatically impeachable. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, 27 <i>Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Evid.</i> § 6096 (2d ed. 2005) (\"Some older authority suggests that the collateral matter doctrine applies only when the testimony to be contradicted was elicited on cross-examination. Under this approach, when a witness testifies to facts during direct examination she may be impeached by extrinsic evidence even if those facts are collateral. More recent authority and commentary rejects this approach, reasoning that contradiction as to a trivial matter wastes time and confuses the issues no matter whether the contradiction occurs on direct or cross examination.\").</p>\n<p>[22]  The desired impeachment through agents Ng and Alvarado was not relevant to the March 27 murder.</p>\n<p>[23]  Strangely, Catalán apparently did not seek to have any of the agents testify about Torres's out-of-court account of the March 27 robbery and murder during the penalty phase of the trial, even though the court clearly took a different view of the relevance of the evidence in that phase of the trial. For example, it allowed co-defendant Medina to present previously excluded impeachment by extrinsic evidence through Agent Marchand during Medina's penalty-phase case. (Catalán's penalty-phase case preceded Medina's.)</p>\n<p>[24]  Oddly, counsel for Medina has not also argued that Medina's convictions on counts eight and nine violate double jeopardy. Although in exceptional circumstances we may address arguments not raised by counsel, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Atkinson,</i> 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936), those circumstances are very rare and not present here. Other than a $100 special assessment imposed for count nine, Medina's conviction on count nine does not and cannot affect his sentence, which is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>[25]  In his pro se supplemental brief, Medina also argues that his \"conviction[s] and sentences on all counts must be vacated as the evidence was legally insufficient.\" However, while he presents detailed arguments about the insufficiency of the evidence for counts five, six, and eight, he does not even mention the other counts, let alone explain why the evidence was insufficient. Even affording him a more lenient standard because he is pro se on these claims, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Rodriguez,</i> 943 F.2d 104, 107 (1st Cir.1991), this argumentation is insufficient to bring the sufficiency of the evidence for claims one through four and seven before us. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[26]  18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) requires a sentencing court to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence....\"</p>\n<p>[27]  There is some discrepancy between the testimony, both as we read it and in the description of it given in the briefs, as to just when the hand raising occurred; we have chosen the version that seems to be best supported, but the differences are not material to the outcome.</p>\n<p>[28]  Count eight of the second superseding indictment charged Catalán under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) with aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to cause the death of a person in the course of a crime of violence, specifically, a robbery. Section 924(j)(1) cross-references 18 U.S.C. § 1111 and provides that if the killing is \"murder (as defined in section 1111),\" the perpetrator shall \"be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(j)(1). The indictment also explicitly cross-referenced the definition of murder in section 1111.</p>\n<p>[29]  There is no indication that Catalán sought to introduce the supposed omissions at the penalty phase, and the judge permitted codefendant Medina to introduce in the penalty phase testimony from Agent Carlos Marchand on the omissions in Torres' prior statements about March 27.</p>\n\n</div>",

The November 30 Armed Robbery</h2>\n<p>On November 30, 2001, James Cruz-Matias (\"Cruz\"), an armored truck guard working for Ranger American Armored Services (\"Ranger\"), was robbed at gunpoint while making a delivery of cash for his employer to the Saulo D. Rodriguez Credit Union in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. That day, Cruz worked as the messenger in a two-man team. As such, he had to carry the cash from the truck to the bank. His co-worker, Eluber Torres-Alejandro (\"Torres\"), was the driver and remained inside the truck during the delivery. As Cruz carried a bag containing $180,000 toward the door of the credit union, a man who had been waiting by the credit union's ATM approached him, pointed a gun at his face, and demanded the money. Two other assailants then appeared, also pointing guns toward Cruz's head. Cruz gave them the money. Before leaving, one of the assailants took Cruz's pistol from its holster, cocked it, and pointed it at Cruz's face. Instead of pulling the trigger, the assailants left with the gun and the $180,000, fleeing the parking lot in a gray or blue Jeep Cherokee Laredo. Soon after the robbery, Gurabo municipal police recovered nearby a burned-out blue Cherokee Laredo that had been carjacked from its owner two days before the robbery. Six fingerprints matching Medina's were retrieved from a newspaper left near the ATM, where the first assailant had been waiting just before the robbery. At trial, Cruz identified Medina as the first assailant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The March 6 Attempted Armed Robbery</h2>\n<p>On March 6, 2002, several men attempted to rob two Ranger guards. Torres was again working that day, acting this time as the messenger while his partner, Rodríguez, drove the truck. As Torres carried a bag containing $300,000 from the armored truck to the door of the Valenciano Credit Union in Juncos, Puerto Rico, a man appeared and walked towards him in the parking lot. The man made a gesture toward his waist, revealing a firearm tucked in his waistband. Torres and Rodríguez both pulled out their own weapons and pointed them towards the man, who had pulled out the pistol and managed to point it at Torres. Apparently realizing that he was outnumbered, the man turned and ran away. Torres saw a two-toned motorcycle and a blue Chevrolet Lumina depart from the parking lot.<sup>[1]</sup> At trial, Torres identified Catalán as the man who had walked toward him in the parking lot and flashed a weapon before fleeing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The March 26 Carjacking</h2>\n<p>On March 26, 2002, while parked in his green Ford Explorer outside his daughter's house and talking with her, Armando Jula-Diaz (\"Julía\") was approached by two assailants, one of whom pointed a nickel-plated pistol at him and demanded he turn over the vehicle.<sup>[2]</sup> The two assailants stole the Explorer, along with a black, 9mm Glock pistol that Julía had kept in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> D. The March 27 Armed Robbery and Murder</h2>\n<p>The next day, on March 27, 2002, Ranger guards Torres and Rodríguez were assigned to deliver $100,000 to the Saulo D. Rodríguez credit union in Gurabo. Torres, the driver, remained in the truck while Rodríguez, the messenger, exited with the money and walked towards the credit union. As Rodríguez approached the entrance, an assailant appeared and pointed a black, 9mm Glock pistol at his face and chest. A second assailant then appeared carrying a Beretta semi-automatic firearm. At trial, Torres identified the first assailant as Medina and the second as Catalán. Rodríguez raised his hands above his head in an act of surrender. As Catalán attempted to remove Rodríguez's firearm from its holster, Medina fired two shots at Rodríguez. Torres then opened the door of the armored truck and began firing at Catalán, who was hit and fell to the ground. Torres was shot in the left hand by a fourth indicted co-conspirator, Quester Sterling-Suarez (\"Sterling\"). Torres fell back into the truck and closed its doors.</p>\n<p>Medina took the money and fled the scene in a green Ford Explorer, leaving the injured Catalán behind. Rodríguez was still alive at this point. According to Torres, Rodríguez pleaded for his life just before Catalán, seated on the ground nearby, picked up his Beretta firearm and fired it several times into him. Sterling then arrived and tried to help Catalán, but fled the scene alone when police arrived.<sup>[3]</sup> Catalán was apprehended at the scene, seriously wounded and still holding the Beretta. Rodríguez died soon thereafter, having received a total of eight gunshot wounds, three of which would have proven fatal even independent of the other wounds. One of the fatal wounds came from Medina's 9mm Glock (the gun that had been stolen from Jula the day before), while the other two came from Catalán's Beretta. At the scene, the FBI obtained shell casings, bullet fragments, and bullets that matched Catalán's Beretta and Medina's Glock. Not far from the credit union, police recovered Jula's stolen green Ford Explorer with its doors open, the engine running, and a small tank of gasoline nearby. Inside the vehicle, they recovered the stolen Glock 9mm pistol used by Medina during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the robbery, Morales picked up his girlfriend, Jocelyn Serrano-Castro (\"Serrano\"), in his blue Chevrolet Lumina. She spent the day with him, during which time he switched the car he was driving, retrieved a pistol hidden behind a highway mile marker, and conversed with a fifth co-conspirator, Pablo Sanchez-Rodríguez (\"Sanchez\"), about \"getting rid\" of the blue Lumina. At six o'clock that evening, Serrano observed Morales retrieve a sack of cash from Sanchez and buy new cell phones with some of the cash. Several days after the robbery, she went with Morales to visit appellant Medina at his home. Medina and his wife had bought all new furniture. Medina told Serrano that he had \"scored a robbery and that they had to take everything out and bring in everything new.\"</p>\n<p>The FBI arrested Medina on April 2, 2002. The vehicle Medina was driving at the time of his arrest had three newspaper articles about the March 27 robbery in the glove compartment. After his arrest, he was housed in the same prison cell as Miguel Alamo-Castro (\"Alamo\"). At trial, Alamo testified that while they were cellmates Medina had revealed several incriminating details about the conspiracy to rob Ranger vehicles. For example, Medina <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> told Alamo that he had carjacked a green Ford Explorer from a man and his daughter the night before the March 27 robbery, stealing a 9 mm Glock in the process. He said that he had participated in the shootout during the March 27 robbery and that the FBI had recovered the gun he had used from the seat of the stolen Explorer after the robbery. Medina also told Alamo that he was going to use the robbery money to buy furniture and remodel his home, among other things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. The Indictment and Trial</h2>\n<p>Approximately one year later, on March 14, 2003, a grand jury returned a ten-count second superseding indictment charging Catalán, Medina, Morales, Sterling, and Sanchez with conspiracy to rob armored vehicles and a number of substantive offenses related to the conspiracy. Specifically, both Catalán and Medina were charged with: conspiracy to commit robbery of an armored vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3) (count one), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in relation to the conspiracy in count one, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count two),<sup>[4]</sup> aiding and abetting the March 27 robbery of an armored vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count seven), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit a crime of violence (the March 27 robbery) that resulted in the unlawful killing of Rodríguez, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1111 (count eight), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit a crime of violence (the March 27 robbery), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) (count nine). In addition, Medina was also charged with aiding and abetting the November 30, 2001 robbery of an armored vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (count three), aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit the November 30 robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3) (count four), aiding and abetting the March 26, 2002 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2119(1) (count five), and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit the March 26 carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(3) (count six). There were no charges based on the attempted robbery of March 6, 2002, nor was that attempted robbery cited as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Jury selection began on January 25, 2005 and lasted thirteen days. Three days before trial, Catalán moved to exclude evidence that he was involved in the March 6, 2002 attempted robbery or, alternatively, for the severance of his trial from Medina's. He claimed that if the trials were severed, Medina would testify that Catalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt. After an in camera conference with Medina's lawyer during which the lawyer made a proffer of his client's expected testimony, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>Trial began on March 7, 2005. At the conclusion of the government's case, both appellants moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The district court denied their motions. At the start of appellants' case, the government moved to exclude the testimony of several witnesses whom the defendants intended to call to impeach the testimony of Torres, the armored car guard who was shot in the hand during the March 27 robbery. After hearing argument on the matter, the court granted the government's motion in part, excluding the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> impeachment testimony of five law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p>On March 16, government witness Juan Bravo-Hernandez (\"Bravo\") moved to quash a subpoena for tax records that had been issued at the request of defendants. Bravo, the president and owner of Ranger American Armored Services, had been subpoenaed to produce Ranger's corporate tax returns as well as his personal tax returns. The trial court granted the motion to quash, determining that the tax documents could not be relevant to the interstate nexus inquiry,<sup>[5]</sup> which had already been established through Bravo's testimony and could not possibly be affected by any information contained in either the company's or Bravo's own tax returns. After completing their evidence, appellants again moved for a judgment of acquittal, and the trial court again denied their motions. The jury found each appellant guilty of every count charged against him. Because the defendants had been previously certified as eligible for the death penalty, the trial then proceeded to the death penalty phase, which lasted fifteen days. The same jury that decided appellants' guilt decided whether to impose the death penalty. At the conclusion of the penalty phase evidence, the jury did not agree to impose the death penalty upon either defendant. 18 U.S.C.A. § 3593(e)(3). In special verdict forms, it asked the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for Catalán and indicated that it could not agree to instruct the court to impose a life sentence for Medina.<sup>[6]</sup> Instead, the jury left Medina's sentence to the judge but indicated that it understood that the judge would impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. For count eight, the murder charge, the district court imposed on each defendant a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole; it later also imposed sentences for each of the other convictions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first confront Catalán's challenges to his convictions and sentence. Again, he challenges 1) the trial court's denial of his request to sever his trial from that of Medina, 2) the trial court's rulings restricting impeachment of Torres, including the court's decision to exclude extrinsic evidence that would allegedly impeach Torres's testimony, 3) the trial court's decision to quash the subpoena for tax records, and 4) the convictions on counts two, eight, and nine on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Severance</h2>\n<p>During jury selection, the defendants learned for the first time that the government planned to introduce testimony from Torres identifying Catalán as having been involved in the March 6 attempted robbery. Two-and-a-half weeks later, and four days before trial was to commence, Catalán moved to exclude the evidence, or alternatively, to sever his trial from that of Medina. He argued that if severance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> were granted, Medina would testify that Catalán had not been involved in the March 6 attempt. However, if severance were not granted it would be unfair for the government to present Torres's testimony about Catalán's involvement, as Catalán would not be able to rebut that account through Medina's testimony. In a hearing on the motion, Medina's lawyer confirmed that his client would testify for Catalán if the trials were severed. Following the hearing, the judge held an in camera conference with Medina's lawyer, who made a proffer of his client's expected testimony. The court then denied the motion to exclude the evidence and the alternative motion for severance. Catalán now challenges the denial of his motion for severance.</p>\n<p>We review the court's denial of a motion for severance for manifest abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2008), and affirm the lower court's decision unless the defendant makes a strong and convincing showing that prejudice resulted from the denial of severance, <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203173\"><a href=\"/opinion/203173/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2008). Defendants challenging the denial of severance must meet this high barrier on appeal because, as we have explained, in the normal course of events \"[p]ersons who are indicted together should be tried together, since this practice helps both to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve resources (judicial and prosecutorial).\" <i>United States v. Peña-Lora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770240\"><a href=\"/opinion/770240/united-states-v-luis-manuel-pea-lora-united-states-of-america-v-jorge/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p>In deciding the motion for severance based on the alleged need for the testimony of a co-defendant, district courts are to employ the two-tiered analysis set forth in <i>United States v. Drougas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1984). To meet the first tier of that test, a defendant must demonstrate: \"(1) a bona fide need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the testimony; (3) its exculpatory nature and effect; and (4) that the co-defendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195903\"><a href=\"/opinion/195903/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1231 (1st Cir.1995). If the defendant can make that showing, the court should move on to the second tier of the <i>Drougas</i> analysis and \"(1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant's theory of defense; (2) consider whether the testimony would be subject to substantial, damaging impeachment; (3) assess the counter arguments of judicial economy; and (4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Focusing on a first tier factor, the district court emphasized that Catalán had \"failed to make a detailed proffer for this court to evaluate the exculpatory nature of [Medina's] testimony.\" Given that Catalán was not charged with the March 6 attempted robbery, a proffer about the evidence's \"exculpatory nature\" would have been especially important to the district court's analysis. This is particularly so because the focus of the government's case against Catalán, naturally, was on the overt act charged against him in the indictment: the March 27 robbery and murder of Rodríguez. The government's strong evidence of Catalán's involvement in that robbery and the general conspiracy to rob armored truck guards included damning physical evidence and testimony linking Catalán to the scene of Rodríguez's murder, where Catalán had assisted the robbery and was apprehended holding the murder weapon.<sup>[7]</sup> Without a detailed proffer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*462</span> of the exculpatory nature of testimony about the March 6 attempted robbery, the district court was well within its discretion to conclude that Catalán had not shown a \"bona fide need for the testimony.\" <i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p>Although it concluded that Catalán had not met the first tier of the <i>Drougas</i> analysis, the district court nonetheless proceeded to explain that he had also not met the second tier. In particular, the court emphasized the untimeliness of the motion, the highly impeachable nature of the testimony, and Catalán's lack of an explanation of the testimony's significance to his defense. <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also, </i><i>Smith,</i> 46 F.3d at 1231 (\"Judicial economy is obviously not dispositive, but it is important in a lengthy conspiracy trial.\"). There was no manifest abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of the motion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Order to Quash the Subpoena for Tax Returns</h2>\n<p>Catalán objects to the district court's grant of Bravo's motion to quash a subpoena for his personal tax records and the tax records of his company, Ranger American Armored Security. A trial court may quash an \"unreasonable or oppressive\" subpoena, and we review the trial court's decision to quash for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Henry,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 30 (1st. Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The defendants were indicted under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which criminalizes robberies that have an effect on interstate commerce. <i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202004\"><a href=\"/opinion/202004/united-states-v-jimenez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2006). At trial, Bravo testified at length about the products his business regularly purchases from the mainland United States (such as specially equipped armored vehicles, weapons, and high-tech carrier's money bags). He also testified that the company was forced to pay high deductibles after each robbery, totaling $75,000, and explained that its insurer raised both its premium and deductible as a result of the robberies.</p>\n<p>The defendants sought the personal and corporate tax records of Bravo and his company to challenge the government's assertion that the robberies affected interstate commerce. The trial court granted Bravo's motion to quash, determining that the tax records could not be relevant to the question whether the robbery sufficiently affected interstate commerce. In granting the motion, the court relied on this circuit's settled case law that a robbery need only have \"a realistic probability of a de minimus effect on interstate commerce\" to bring it within the reach of the Hobbs Act. <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577004\"><a href=\"/opinion/577004/united-states-v-herbert-alan-butt-aka-alan-butt-united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)). \"One common method for the government to establish the required `de minimis' effect on interstate commerce is to show that the defendant's activity `minimally depletes the assets of an entity doing business in interstate commerce.'\" <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (quoting <i>United States v. Nguyen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772789\"><a href=\"/opinion/772789/united-states-v-kieu-minh-nguyen/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 54 (1st. Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>We agree that Bravo's testimony about his company's participation in interstate commerce (including its regular purchases of carrier money bags, weapons, and vehicles from the United States), combined with his testimony about the financial effects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*463</span> of the robberies, was sufficient to establish a de minimus effect on interstate commerce so as to bring the robberies within the reach of the Hobbs Act. We also agree that nothing in Bravo's personal or corporate tax returns could have negated the interstate nexus proven through Bravo's testimony, even if the company's bottom line was unchanged fromor, for that matter, even if it <i>improved</i> overthat of years past. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (de minimis effect established when defendant had threatened to extort $4,000 from a car dealer who participated in interstate commerce and a jury could have reasonably concluded that if the defendant had been successful the business's assets and purchasing power would have been at least temporarily depleted by $4,000). Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's exercise of its power to quash unreasonable subpoenas.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Restrictions on Impeachment<sup>[9]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Background</h2>\n<p>Catalán claims that his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him and his Due Process rights were unconstitutionally impeded by the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce extrinsic evidence that would have contradicted the testimony of the government's key eyewitness, Torres. Specifically, he argues that he should have been permitted to introduce the testimony of several FBI agents who would have impeached Torres's trial account of the robberies and the murder. Catalán claims that the agents' excluded testimony was \"crucial to the defense theory\" because he \"wished to argue... that Torres Alejandro was unworthy of belief because (among other reasons) he dramatically changed his version of events very shortly before trial, adding new and highly aggravating details.\"</p>\n<p>Catalán names five FBI agents whom he should have been allowed to call at trial. Agents Angel Marrero and María Cruz interviewed Torres shortly after the March 27 robbery, while he was in the hospital. Marrero and Cruz took notes of their interview in an official FBI FD-302 Form (\"302\"), a form for reporting and summarizing such an interview. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203875\"><a href=\"/opinion/203875/united-states-v-gonzalez-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam). The 302 of their interview, which purports to record Torres's account of the robbery, does not mention certain details which Torres gave in his trial testimony and which Catalán claims \"were directly relevant to the government's theory of premeditation and death penalty.\" For example, the 302 does not mention that Rodríguez pleaded for his life and held up his arms to shield himself before Catalán shot him several times at \"point blank range,\" or that Catalán glanced defiantly at Torres before taking that action.<sup>[10]</sup> Catalán argued below and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*464</span> argues again on appeal that the agents' testimony about the March 27 incident would have undermined Torres's credibility through impeachment by omission, because Torres would not have left out such important details in his first interview if they were true. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jenkins v. Anderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110298\"><a href=\"/opinion/110298/jenkins-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110298\"><a href=\"/opinion/110298/jenkins-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2124</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110298\"><a href=\"/opinion/110298/jenkins-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span> (1980) (\"Common law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.\").</p>\n<p>Catalán also wished to call FBI Agents Francisco Ng and Félix Alvarado, who interviewed Torres after the November 30 robbery and also filed a 302 report. He argues that their testimony would have impeached Torres's trial account of the November 30 robbery. Whereas Torres testified at trial that he had not observed the November 30 robbery, Alvarado and Ng's report of their interview recounts that Torres had seen the robbery but had \"frozen\" and was unable to call for help. Contrary to his trial testimony, the report states that Torres did see the assailants, although it also states that he said he could not provide a good description of them.</p>\n<p>Finally, Catalán claims that he should have been able to call Agent Carlos Marchand, the FBI's case agent, to impeach Torres's account of the March 27 robbery. Catalán claims that Agent Marchand would have testified that he had never heard certain details in Torres's trial account, such as that Rodríguez pleaded for his life before Catalán unloaded his pistol into him, until Torres testified at trial.</p>\n<p>The trial court excluded the testimony of all five agents, ruling that it constituted impeachment by prior inconsistent statement through extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter and that the prior statements offered through agents Cruz and Marrero were not in fact inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony. However, Catalán was permitted to impeach Torres's credibility by extrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements through two other witnesses. He was permitted to call Carlos Bonilla-Rivera, a security investigator for Ranger American who recorded a statement from Torres after the November 30 robbery that was signed by Torres. In that statement, contrary to his trial testimony, Torres said that he saw, and was able to describe, one of the assailants. The defendants also called Agent Ríos-Calzada, who interviewed Torres after the March 6 robbery and took a written statement from him that was inconsistent with his trial testimony. The written statement was entered into evidence. The court provided no explanation for why these witnesses could be called for impeachment and not the others, except that Torres had signed the statements he made to the two witnesses and therefore he had \"adopted\" the statements.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*465</span> On appeal, Catalán contests the court's decision to exclude the testimony of Agents Ng, Alvaredo, Cruz, Marrero, and Marchand.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Catalán's Constitutional Claims</h2>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment protects a criminal defendant's right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const. Amend. VI. Although the ability to pursue an impeaching line of inquiry with the introduction of extrinsic evidence supporting that inquiry might be viewed as part and parcel of the right to cross-examination, this circuit has yet to decide whether the Confrontation Clause provides defendants a right to impeach witnesses through extrinsic evidence. In <i>White v. Coplan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789351\"><a href=\"/opinion/789351/delvin-white-v-jane-coplan-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2005), for example, a criminal defendant was found to have the right under the Confrontation Clause to cross-examine his accusers about false allegations they had made in the past, but the panel did not reach the question whether he had a right to introduce extrinsic evidence about those allegations. It was specifically noted that \"cross-examination and extrinsic proof are two different issues.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25. The panel wrote that \"we are not endorsing any open-ended constitutional right to offer extrinsic evidence [for impeachment purposes]. Such an excursion requires more witnesses and documents, and so greater risk of confusion and delay....\" <i>Id.</i> at 26; <i>see also </i><i>Farley v. Lafler,</i> 193 Fed.Appx. 543, 547 (6th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (\"The Supreme Court has not recognized the sweep of the Confrontation Clause to extend beyond guaranteeing the criminal defendant's right[ ] to physically confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses to encompass the right to impeach an adverse witness by putting on a third-party witness.\") (quotation marks and citation omitted).

The Trial Court's Ruling on Inconsistency</h2>\n<p>The court ruled that the statement made by Torres at the hospital following the March 27 murder of Rodríguez, recorded in a 302 by agents Marerro and Cruz, was not inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony.<sup>[15]</sup> The court concluded that in light of Torres's injured condition at the time of the interview, the fact that he had taken pain medication, the short duration of the interview, and the fact that \"we don't know what type of questions the agents asked,\" it would not have been \"natural\" for Torres <span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> to include the aggravating details. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meserve,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 320-21 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Prior statements... that omit details included in a witness's trial testimony are inconsistent if it would have been `natural' for the witness to include the details in the earlier statement.\"). The substance of defendants' proffer specifically stated, however, that Agent Cruz would testify that in her estimation Torres was an appropriate subject for an interview. Defense counsel proffered that Agent Cruz would testify as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>She would say that she recognized that he was in pain, that he had been shot, I think it was in the left hand, that she, in accordance with procedure and policy, took notes during the interview, that she recorded all of the important things that he said about the event, that the notes were effectively transcribed into a written report which ... she reviewed, initialed, as did Mr. Marrero, for accuracy.... She said that while he was in pain, in her opinion he was a subject for an interview. She did not feel that he was incapacitated or incapable of being interviewed and providing information. That during the interview itself, as he described the events that took place on March 27th, at no time during that interview did he indicate Mr. Rodríguez has his arms raised in a submissive mode prior to being shot. He did not at any time indicate that, prior to Mr. Rodríguez being shot, in the position with his arms raised, did he hear him say, please, no, please, no, please, no, and he did not indicate in any way that prior to that, in the mode with his hands raised, that the assailant, who he later identified in court as Mr. Hernaldo Medina Villegas, approached him from the front and shot him twice in the chest.<sup>[16]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Defense counsel also proffered that Agent Cruz had stated that she did not remember whether the interview was conducted in a question and answer format, or whether she had simply recorded Torres's narrative.</p>\n<p>Unlike <i>Meserve,</i> on which the district court relied for its ruling that the omitted details were not inconsistent with Torres's trial testimony, the details omitted in Torres's earlier statement were not \"peripheral\" but went directly to the important element of premeditation as well as the possible imposition of the death penalty. <i>Cf. </i><i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 321 (where \"nuances [were] peripheral,\" district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding impeachment by omission through extrinsic evidence). As described in the discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Medina's conviction on the murder charge, <i>see infra</i> Part III(A), the indictment charged that the defendants had acted \"with premeditation\" in killing Rodríguez. With respect to premeditation, \"it is the fact of deliberation, of second thought[,] that is important.\" <i>United States v. Frappier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480541\"><a href=\"/opinion/480541/united-states-v-darlene-frappier-aka-darlene-boissonneault-darlene/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir. 1986) (<i>citing </i><i>Fisher v.

The victim crying out for his life before he was shot by the defendant was some of the government's most persuasive evidence that Catalán had acted with premeditation in shooting Rodríguez.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> Second, the impeachment was inconsistent in an important sense because the details that were essential to the government's death penalty case were left out of Torres's first interview. The same jury that decided the guilt phase was later asked to determine whether the death penalty was appropriate, and in doing so was specifically instructed that it could \"consider any evidence that was presented during the guilt phase of the trial.\" In the penalty phase, the jury was asked to consider whether certain \"statutory aggravating factors\" applied to the crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3591, 3592. These included whether the crime was committed in a \"heinous, cruel or depraved manner,\" and whether the victim was vulnerable.</p>\n<p>In the final analysis, the jury had to decide whether the murder of Rodríguez was a cold-blooded execution, or something else. Torres added several details at trial that went to that core issue and formed a central aspect of his narrative of the events of March 27, but which he had not mentioned in his earlier account. There was uncertainty about Torres's mental and physical condition at the time of the interview in the hospital, and the way in which the interview was conducted. Under these circumstances, it was an abuse of discretion for the court to determine that the crucial omissions in Marrero and Cruz's 302 report of their interview with Torres were \"natural\" and not inconsistent with his trial testimony. The significance of the omissions was a jury issue.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The Trial Court's Collateral Fact Rulings</h2>\n<p>Under the common law of evidence and the law of this circuit, impeachment by extrinsic evidence is normally restricted to impeachment on matters that are not collateral. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2008) (\"`It is well established that a party may not present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by contradiction on a collateral matter.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Beauchamp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600392\"><a href=\"/opinion/600392/united-states-v-michael-w-beauchamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993)).<sup>[19]</sup> A matter is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> considered collateral if \"`the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence, i.e., not relevant for a purpose other than mere contradiction of the in-court testimony of the witness.'\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4 (quoting 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 45 (4th ed. 1992)).</p>\n<p>The rule restricting impeachment to non-collateral matters is analogous to Rule 403's relevancy balancing test, which calls for relevant evidence to be excluded when its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by ... considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time....\" Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>see also </i><i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4. Although any demonstrated inconsistency in a witness's statement may impeach a witness's credibility, other concerns (such as wasting time and misleading the jury) become more important when the inconsistency at issue involves a statement relating to a matter that \"`is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence.'\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4 (quoting 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 45, 169 (4th ed. 1992)). On the other hand, when a statement that would be the subject of impeachment \"is logically relevant to the merits of the case as well as the witness's credibility, it is worth the additional court time entailed in hearing extrinsic evidence.\" 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence § 49</i> (6th ed. 2006).</p>\n<p>Over defendants' protestations to the contrary, the trial court repeatedly ruled that evidence of Torres's prior inconsistent statements about the robberies was not admissible because it was \"collateral.\" For example, in response to defendants' request to impeach Torres's claim that Rodríguez had pleaded for his life before being shot, the court said, \"it's collateral source, collateral impeachment by extrinsic evidence because whether he said, no, no, oryes, yes ... that all doesn't go directly to the issues of guilt or innocence of the two defendants.\"</p>\n<p>It is true that this circuit has said that \"[i]n light of the collateral issue rule, in order to be admissible, ... testimony must not only contradict a statement ... but also be material to [the defendant's] guilt or innocence.\" <i>United States v. Mulinelli-Navas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739903\"><a href=\"/opinion/739903/united-states-v-mara-mulinelli-navas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 988 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>United States v. Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"731019\"><a href=\"/opinion/731019/united-states-v-terrance-l-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 295 (7th Cir.1996)). However, it appears that the district court may have interpreted that statementor one like itto mean that in order to be material here, the extrinsic evidence at issue must relate to whether the defendant did or did not shoot Rodríguez, or whether he stole the money, and not how the shooting or robbery were carried out.</p>\n<p>This is too narrow a view. As has been noted, some of the details Catalán sought to impeachsuch as the defendants' and victim's behavior during the shooting plainly helped the government establish the premeditation that was charged as an aspect of the murder in count eight. Furthermore, several of the details were certainly relevant to the jury's consideration of the death penalty if the defendants were convicted.<sup>[20]</sup><i>See </i><i>Kines v. Butterworth,</i> 669 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> F.2d at 6, 12 (1st Cir.1981). Torres was the only eyewitness to the March 27 murder of his partner, and was also a witness to and victim of the November 30 robbery. He had testified that the crimes were committed in a certain way, and the defendants sought to impeach him by introducing evidence through his prior inconsistent statements that the crimes were not committed that way. His accounts of the robberies and murder were unquestionably material to the government's case against Catalán, including its request for the death penalty, even if the impeachment of Torres on details of those accounts may not have exculpated Catalán from involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Catalán argued below and argues on appeal that the trial court should have permitted the impeachment because it went to matters brought out on direct examination by the government, not through cross-examination by the defendant. That distinction is significant. The government's own belief that Torres's account of the details of the robberies and the murder were important supports the non-collateral nature of the inconsistencies identified by Catalán.<sup>[21]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Sotomayor-Vázquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199390\"><a href=\"/opinion/199390/united-states-v-sotomayor-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2001) (despite the prohibitions of Rule 404(b), \"[w]hen a defendant has, on direct examination, made a general denial of engaging in conduct material to the case, the prosecution may impeach that testimony by proving that the defendant did engage in that conduct on a prior occasion\"). Finally, Catalán argues that exposure of the inconsistencies would have revealed Torres's motive to testify falsely: \"fixing up all holes in the government's case, maximizing the chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death penalty verdict in modern times.\" This circuit has said that \"a witness's... motive to testify falsely is generally considered to be a non-collateral issue.\" <i>Beauchamp,</i> 986 F.2d at 4.</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, the district court erred in excluding the testimony of the agents because of its view that their testimony dealt with a collateral matter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Harmless Error</h2>\n<p>Both of the district court's rationales for excluding the impeachment testimony of the five government agentsthat some of the statements were not inconsistent and that all of the proffered testimony was collateralwere erroneous applications of the rules of evidence. However, \"[v]iolation of a rule of evidence does not itself amount to a constitutional violation.\" <i>Evans v. Verdini,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span>, 145 (1st Cir.2006). It is not necessary to decide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic evidence was an error of constitutional dimension. Under the circumstances of this case, even if there was a constitutional error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence against Catalán was overwhelming: he was found wounded at the scene of the March 27 robbery and murder, holding one of the two murder weapons, and he was later <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> identified in court as the perpetrator. That inculpatory evidence would not have been impeached by the evidence that he sought to introduce through any of the agents. Furthermore, Catalán was permitted to impeach Torres's credibility by extrinsic evidence of inconsistent statements through Bonilla and Ríos, whose interviews with Torres following the November 30 and March 6 incidents differed from Torres's accounts at trial.</p>\n<p>Of course, if Catalán had been sentenced to death, it might be necessary to decide whether the exclusion of the extrinsic evidence about the March 27 incident<sup>[22]</sup> was an error of constitutional dimension, because the harmless error analysis might well be different. As noted, in the penalty phase of the trial, the same jury that had decided appellants' guilt was asked to determine whether to impose the death penalty, and was expressly instructed that it could consider the evidence it heard in the guilt phase. Defense counsel expressed this concern at trial, arguing that if Torres's testimony went unimpeached, the defendants' lawyers would not later be able to \"unring the bell\" about the reprehensible details when it came time for the jury to deliberate about whether to impose the death penalty. That argument was apt, but, in the final analysis, the jury apparently did unring the bell.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. The Trial Court's <i>Sua Sponte</i> Comments</h2>\n<p>Catalán points to several portions in the trial transcript where the judge interrupted defense counsel, restricting or directing the course of defense counsel's examination. Catalán claims that these interruptions violated his Confrontation Clause right to cross-examine witnesses against him. After reading the excerpted portions of the transcript in context, it is clear that appellant's objections are groundless. In many places, the district court directed counsel on the proper way to conduct the examination; in others, the court reprimanded trial counsel for ignoring its earlier rulings. The court also interrupted the government's lawyers on occasion, and frequently sided with the defendants on objections. \"It is well-established that a judge is not a mere umpire; he is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct, and has a perfect rightalbeit a right that should be exercised with careto participate actively in the trial proper.\" <i>Logue v. Dore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197149\"><a href=\"/opinion/197149/logue-v-dore/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1045 (1st Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). After careful consideration of the trial transcript, it is clear that the trial court overstepped no boundaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Double Jeopardy</h2>\n<p>Catalán claims that some of his convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids punishing a person twice for the same offense. U.S. Const. amend. V. In <i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 304, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span> (1932), the Supreme Court set forth the following test for determining whether multiple punishments for related offenses violate the Double <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> Jeopardy Clause: \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"</p>\n<p>The government has sensibly conceded that the convictions for the offenses in counts eight and nine violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Count nine set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) for carrying a firearm in furtherance of the March 27 robbery. Count eight set forth a violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(j) for use of firearm during the March 27th robbery, which resulted in the death of Rodríguez. Count nine was a lesser included offense of count eight, as it did not require proof of any fact not required for conviction on count eight. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202004\"><a href=\"/opinion/202004/united-states-v-jimenez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2006) (a § 924(c)(1) offense can be a lesser included offense of a § 924(j) offense).<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>On the other hand, we reject Catalán's contention that his convictions on counts two and eight constitute a violation of double jeopardy. Because he did not raise this claim below, we review it for plain error. <i>United States v. Winter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196418\"><a href=\"/opinion/196418/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 659 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, Catalán must show that: 1) there was an error, 2) it was plain, 3) it affected a substantial right, and 4) it \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The firearm conviction on count two is for the use of a firearm in connection with the overall conspiracy to rob armored vehicles (the count one conspiracy), whereas the firearm conviction on count eight is for use of a firearm in connection with the substantive robbery committed on March 27 (the count seven robbery). Therefore, counts two and nine each \"require[ ] proof of a fact which the other does not.\" <i>Blockburger,</i> 284 U.S. at 304, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We therefore find no error, let alone plain error, in Catalán's conviction on count two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant Medina challenges: 1) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction of count eight (the murder count), 2) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction of counts five and six (the carjacking counts), 3) the district court's failure to allow him the opportunity for allocution before being sentenced to life imprisonment on count eight, and 4) the district court's calculation of the guideline sentencing range on count eight.<sup>[25]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> A.

While \"[i]t is axiomatic that an aiding and abetting conviction requires proof that the substantive crime has been committed,\" <i>Cyr,</i> 712 F.2d at 732, there was overwhelming proof that the underlying crimesessentially robbery, use of firearms, carjacking, and murderwere committed. Among other evidence, there was testimony from Cruz, Torres, and Bravo which, taken together, detailed how armed assailants, pointing weapons, stole significant sums of cash from Ranger's guards on November 30, 2001 and March 27, 2002. Furthermore, Julía testified that his Ford Explorer was stolen from him by men pointing firearms at him, and the same Ford Explorer was later found abandoned with the engine running near the scene of the March 27 robbery. Julía's Glock, stolen along with the Explorer, was found inside the vehicle and had been fired several times during the robbery. Finally, and tragically, it is unquestionable that Rodríguez was gunned down on March 27 while performing his duties as a Ranger guard. The testimony of Torres, law enforcement officers who arrived at the scene, and forensics experts who examined the ballistics from the scene all consistently explain how Rodríguez was murdered in the course of the robbery. Simply put, there is nothing to appellant's claim that the evidence that any principal had actually committed these crimes was too thin for him to be convicted as an aider and abettor in the crimes.</p>\n<p>More specifically, Medina also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence undergirding his convictions for carjacking (count five), use of a firearm during carjacking (count six), and the murder of Rodríguez (count eight). We review sufficiency of the evidence challenges de novo, \"evaluating whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Meléndez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201783\"><a href=\"/opinion/201783/united-states-v-melendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 48-49 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Conviction for carjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119 requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant: 1) took or attempted to take from the person or presence of another, 2) a motor vehicle that had been \"transported shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce,\" 3) with \"force and violence or by intimidation\", 4) with \"intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\" 18 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> U.S.C. § 2119; <i>United States v. García-Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203467\"><a href=\"/opinion/203467/united-states-v-garcia-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 16 (1st. Cir.2008). A rational jury could have found each of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Julía testified that his green Ford Explorer was taken from him by two men on the night of March 26, 2002 and that one of the men pointed a nickel-plated pistol at Julía's face while demanding he exit the car. Co-conspirator Morales always carried a nickel-plated pistol. The same Ford Explorer, which the parties stipulated had traveled through interstate commerce, was found the next day near the scene of the robbery. Julía's Glock firearm, which had been in the glove compartment of the Ford Explorer when it was stolen, had been used during the robbery to shoot and kill Rodríguez. Torres identified Medina as the person who had used the Glock during the shootout. A government witness, Castro, testified that while he was a cellmate of Medina, Medina recounted his involvement in the carjacking as well as other crimes in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>There was also sufficient evidence to convict Medina on count six, the related offense of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in conjunction with the carjacking. Again, Julía testified that the men who had stolen the car had pointed a nickel-plated pistol at his face.</p>\n<p>Finally, there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that Medina was guilty of count eight, which charged that he aided and abetted the use of a firearm during a violent crime that unlawfully killed Rodríguez, with malice aforethought (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1111) \"and with premeditation.\" \"18 U.S.C. § 1111 `was intended to adopt the felony murder rule, and for a stated felony the `malice' element is satisfied by the intent to commit the unlawful felony.'\" <i>United States v. Morales-Machuca,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v.

Therefore, murder that results from robbery is first degree murder. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (\"Every murder ... committed in the perpetration of ... robbery ... is murder in the first degree.\"). Nonetheless, the indictment also charged that defendants acted with premeditation. \"Premeditation\" contemplates a temporal dimension, which need only be an \"appreciable\" amount of time; \"it is the fact of deliberation, of second thought[,] that is important.\" <i>Frappier,</i> 807 F.2d at 261 (citing <i>Fisher,</i> 328 U.S. at 469 n. 3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></span>). The judge instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote>[P]remeditation is typically associated with killing in cold blood and require[s] the period of time in which the accused deliberates or thinks the matter over before acting. The law does not specify or require any exact period of time that must pass between the formation of the intent to kill and the killing itself. But it must be long enough for the killer after forming the intent to kill to be fully consc[ious] of that intent.</blockquote>\n<p>A reasonable jury could have found all of the elements of count eight beyond a reasonable doubt. First, Torres identified Medina as having fired the first of several shots at Rodríguez, while Rodríguez was on the ground with his arms raised and was not holding a weapon. Medina bragged to his prison cellmate, Alamo, that he had obtained a Glock with a laser from a carjacking which he later used in the March 27 shootout. Government experts explained that the Glock had been fired several times at the scene, and that at least one of its bullets hit Rodríguez and would have proven fatal even if Rodríguez had not also been wounded by Catalán's Berretta. Finally, Medina was in possession of several newspaper articles about the March 27 robbery at the time of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> arrest. There was sufficient evidence not only that Medina \"aided and abetted\" the violent felony that brought about the death of Rodríguez, but that he also shared with Catalán the primary responsibility for that death.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, a rational jury could conclude that Medina is guilty of count eight as well as counts five and six. Therefore, we affirm all of the convictions against Medina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentencing Challenges</h2>\n<p>Medina challenges the district court's failure to allow him the opportunity to allocute before sentencing him on count eight, the felony murder charge. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A) requires that before imposing sentence a judge \"address the defendant personally and ask the defendant if the defendant wishes to make a statement in the defendant's own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" Medina was not afforded that opportunity before being sentenced on count eight.</p>\n<p>The government correctly concedes that Medina should be re-sentenced at a proceeding where he is present and afforded the opportunity to address the court. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Burgos-Andújar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775958\"><a href=\"/opinion/775958/united-states-v-norma-burgos-andjar/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2001) (due to the importance of Rule 32(i)(4)(A), which \"reflects our long tradition of giving all defendants the right to directly address the court and plead for mercy,\" \"if a sentencing court fails to provide a defendant with the chance to address the court, the reviewing court must remand the case for resentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice.\"). Therefore, we vacate Medina's sentence on count eight and remand to the district court for re-sentencing. Because we remand for resentencing, we need not reach Medina's alternative argument that the district court failed to comply with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the conviction and sentence of appellant Catalán on count nine and further direct that the special assessment on that count be removed. We further vacate Medina's sentence on count eight and remand for resentencing. All other convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN and STAHL, Circuit Judges, concurring.</p>\n<p>Although we concur in the result and in most of what our colleague has written, our reasons differ from his in rejecting one of the principal claims of error. Among other claims raised on appeal, Lorenzo Catalán-Roman (\"Catalán\") challenges the district court's exclusion of testimony from FBI agents that he contends would have impeached Eluber Torres-Alejandro's (\"Torres\") testimony, most importantly, Torres' testimony about the robbery and murder on March 27, 2002. Our colleague believes there was error but that it was harmless; in our view no error was committed by the district judge.</p>\n<p>Torres testified that Gilberto Rodríguez-Cabrera (\"Rodríguez\") had his hands in the air before any shots were fired, and that after Torres heard the first shot, Rodríguez fell backward, leaning against the front window of the credit union at which the robbery occurred; with his hands still <span class=\"star-pagination\">*476</span> raised, Rodriguez then pleaded for his life before being shot by co-defendant Hernaldo Medina-Villegas (\"Medina\"); Rodríguez then fell to the ground wounded, after which Catalán shot him multiple times.<sup>[27]</sup> The allegedly inconsistent testimony that Catalán wanted to introduce was expected testimony from FBI agents, who interviewed Torres in the hospital, that Torres did not mention Rodríguez' raising of hands and pleading for his life.</p>\n<p>The district judge said that the omissions were not inconsistent with Torres' court testimony (the court testimony added details but did not contradict the hospital statements) and, in addition, the hand raising and pleading (if they occurred) were merely \"collateral\" to the issues on trial and therefore not proper subjects for impeachment by extrinsic evidence. Under applicable evidence law, either rulingif correctwould justify excluding the testimony, 1 K. Broun, <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> §§ 34, 36, at 152, 156 (6th ed. 2006), but Catalán disputes both rulings, contending that his constitutional right to present a fair defense was impaired by mistaken evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p>Although Catalán cites constitutional precedent, such as <i>Chambers v. Mississippi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108718\"><a href=\"/opinion/108718/chambers-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span> (1973), he does not develop any constitutional claim independent of his assertion that the court misapplied familiar federal common-law doctrine on impeachment by inconsistency and the collateral issue rule. Even if we assumed <i>arguendo</i> that errors in applying those rules were themselves constitutional errorhardly like to be so in all casesit would affect only the harmless error standard to be applied, <i>Chapman v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22-24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span> (1967), and in this case we think there was no error by the district judge in finding the omissions not inconsistent with Torres' testimony.</p>\n<p>Starting with the issue of inconsistency, the ordinary rule is that earlier omissions in reciting the same storyalthough not literally contradictions of later testimonycan be used to impeach a witness for inconsistency (on cross examination of the witness but not necessarily by extrinsic evidence) <i>if</i> the omitted information was not stated earlier \"in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.\" <i>Jenkins v.

Ordinarily, one might think that lurid details of the kind supplied in Torres' trial testimony might well have been supplied in the prior FBI interview; so, if they were not, this would allow, although it would not compel, an inference of inconsistency and so make the omissions relevant.</p>\n<p>But the circumstances here were not ordinary. Torres was interviewed in the hospital, in pain and under medication; and while he was a critical witness, he was interviewed for only 15 to 20 minutes. Defense counsel asserted to the district court that one agent would testify that although Torres \"was in pain,\" in her opinion he was not \"incapacitated or incapable of being interviewed and providing information,\" but this does not mean that he was in the same condition as an ordinary witness or likely to be subject to the same degree or duration of questioning. Another agent testified (during co-defendant Medina's penalty phase) that such an interview usually <span class=\"star-pagination\">*477</span> lasts several hours and that Torres' interview was \"[o]bviously not\" conducted under ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>In addition, the agents' main job was to find out who were the robbers and who had done the shooting. That Torres would likely have volunteered from his hospital bed details about raised hands and pleading is far from obvious, and so the supposed inference of inconsistency is of very doubtful force. There was no proffer by Catalán, and no reason to believe, that any agent was prepared to testify that Torres had been asked about raised hands, pleading or anything else focusing on these details and had denied such happenings. Absent inconsistency, the failure to mention the details had no impeachment value.</p>\n<p>Although some trial judges might have left the matter to the jury, the district judge is entitled to make the threshold judgment as to inconsistency as an admissibility ruling, and such a call (like most other threshold admissibility rulings), is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d at 321. The trial judge found that in the circumstances it would not have been natural for Torres to add the details in question; and, given that admissibility depends not on <i>any</i> literal inconsistency but entirely on an inference about what a witness would likely have volunteered in these circumstances, we are not prepared to find an abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p>Likely the district judge would not have prevented Catalán from cross-examining Torres himself as to whether and why he had previously omitted details, and Catalán's counsel did ask Torres some questions about the March 27 interview with the FBI agents (although Torres largely testified only that he did not remember what happened in the interview). Typically, latitude is allowed in cross-examining the witness already on the stand whose reactions may be grist for the jury even without inconsistency. But before having <i>other</i> witnesses called, and trial time spent as well on exploring another dimension of Torres' medical condition, the district judge was entitled to insist on inconsistency and reasonably concluded that the omissions here did not qualify.</p>\n<p>Although it does not affect the outcome as to the omissions in this case, a further limitation exists on the right to call a separate witness to testify to inconsistent statements: the traditional rule is that <i>extrinsic evidence</i> of prior inconsistent statements by the witness can be offered only if the earlier statements also were relevant to the substance of the case (in jargon, were \"not collateral\"). <i>United States v.

If so, the excursion required by extrinsic evidence is deemed worthwhile; otherwise, not.</p>\n<p>Here, the indictment charged premeditationalthough it could have relied on felony murder instead, 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (2006)<sup>[28]</sup>and one might think that the supposed hand raising and pleading could bear on premeditation. But forensic evidence established that Catalán shot Rodríguez after the latter had already been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*478</span> wounded by Medina, and Torres' testimony, unimpeached in this regard, merely confirmed this sequence of events. Shooting an already wounded man ordinarily meets the requirements of premeditationno particular interval is required, <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328623\"><a href=\"/opinion/328623/united-states-v-robert-lee-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 826 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span> (1975)so as to guilt it scarcely mattered whether Rodríguez had raised his hands and pleaded.</p>\n<p>The lurid details about hand raising and pleading were relevantthat is, not collateralto the jury's <i>further</i> choice in the second phase of the trial as to whether to recommend death or life imprisonment. Thus, if the hospital-bed omissions were deemed inconsistent, extrinsic evidence of them would have to be allowed at that second stage. It is hard to imagine that at any penalty stage a judge would have excluded testimony bearing on the circumstances of the killing even if it consisted merely of Torres' failure to mention any details in an earlier interview.<sup>[29]</sup> In the event, the jury did not recommend the death penalty and the judge made clear his own default position was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A more direct contradiction, about which Catalán also complains, concerns Torres' testimony about the earlier robbery on November 30, 2001. At trial, Torres testified that he did not observe the November 30 robbery or the assailants; earlier, it appears, two other FBI agents had interviewed him about the robbery and he told the FBI agents (according to their notes) that he saw the robbery but \"froze\" and could not call for help and that he saw the assailants but could not describe them. At trial Catalán sought to have the agents testify to the inconsistency, but the trial judge ruled it a collateral issue.</p>\n<p>If Torres did make the earlier statements, they were certainly inconsistent and so went to his credibility, but (as already noted) this permits impeachment only through cross examination and not by extrinsic evidence unless the contradiction is material to the merits of the case. Here, it is hard to see how the contradiction is of any assistance to Catalán on the merits. He was not charged with participation in the November 30 robbery, and neither version of Torres' testimonythe one offered at trial or the one given earlier to the agentsimplicated Catalán in that robbery. Nor does Catalán offer in his brief any explanation beyond saying that the two versions contradict one another which goes only to credibility and not to the subject matter of the case.</p>\n<p>Catalán also claims that, beyond impeaching the specific facts in Torres' testimony, the excluded FBI agent testimony in both instances also would have demonstrated Torres' bias and improper motive in testifying, and so was not collateral. But this is not so and the claim is not persuasively explained; the excluded testimony did not establish what Torres' bias and improper motive were, it merely contradicted certain details in Torres' version of events. Nor did Catalán make this bias or motive argument in the district court: he argued only that Torres' testimony was inconsistent and Torres therefore not credible; the new ground is not only unsupported but forfeit.

Cir.2009). Given our view about the minimal relevance of the tax records to the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act charges, there was no denial of Catalán's constitutional right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.</p>\n<p>[9]  The discussion from section C.1 through section C.5 reflects the views of the writing judge only. My colleagues express their separate views in the concurrence that follows this opinion.</p>\n<p>[10]  In his brief, Catalán also claims that Agents Marrero and Cruz would have been able to impeach Torres's trial account of the March 6 attempted robbery. As far as can be discerned from the record (appellant gives us no citations other than an unidentified quotation, and the agents' report is not included in the record), this is a misleading statement of the evidence. At no time during the extensive discussions and arguments over this matter during trialnot even when the defendants made a proffer about Agent Cruz's testimonywas it suggested that Marrero or Cruz had ever discussed the March 6 attempt with Torres. The record <i>does</i> indicate, however, that FBI agent José Rios Calzada conducted an interview of Torres after the March 6 attempt and that Torres's account of the attempt was different during that interview than it was at trial. Nonetheless, the defendants were permitted to call him to the stand and, for purposes of impeachment, they entered the 302 report of the interview into evidence. <i>See</i> discussion <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[11]  That distinction has no basis in the rules of evidence or the common law of impeachment. \"Any form of statement is acceptable\" for impeachment by prior inconsistent statement. 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 34 at n. 5 (6th ed. 2006). Federal Rule of Evidence 613(b) only requires that the impeached witness be \"afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the [prior statement] and the opposite party [be] afforded the opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon,\" and has no requirement that the witness have adopted the prior statement.</p>\n<p>[12]  The government argues that two of the five witnesses \"would have possibly presented cumulative testimony.\" Cruz and Marrero would presumably have given similar testimony, as would Ng and Alvarado. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 403 (relevant evidence may be excluded, among other reasons, if it constitutes \"needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"). For reasons discussed below, it is not crucial that this contention be resolved.</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Scheffer,</i> the Court wrote that:\n</p>\n<p>A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions. A defendant's interest in presenting such evidence may thus bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. As a result, state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials. Such rules do not abridge an accused's right to present a defense so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve. Moreover, we have found the exclusion of relevant evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[14]  The government argues that \"[s]ince the defendant failed to raise some of [the] specific claims or arguments at trial or below, the Court reviews the claims for plain error.\" The government's only specific contention in this regard is that Catalán did not raise the argument that the impeachment would expose Torres's bias or motive to testify, which, in the words of Catalán, was to \"fix[ ] up all holes in the government's case, maximizing the chances in securing Puerto Rico's first death penalty verdict in modern times.\" However, appellant argued below:\n</p>\n<p>The defense gets to say to the jury ... are these details things that would be left out... if they really happened? Or are these details that are being added on later to make it a better death penalty case? That's our right to argue....</p>\n<p>Although the issue is close, appellant's bias and motive argument is treated as having been properly raised. In addition to arguing that it would expose bias and motive, appellant unquestionably made the argument below that the impeachment would call into doubt Torres's credibility generally in the sense that, for whatever reason, he testified at trial to inflammatory details about the robberies and murder that he had not mentioned during prior interviews.</p>\n<p>[15]  The court offered this ruling as a supplemental basis for exclusion of the impeachment, after making its ruling on the collateral fact issue. <i>See infra</i> Part II(c)(4). This issue is discussed first, however, because it is the logical antecedent of the ruling that the impeachment was collateral.</p>\n<p>[16]  Although it is not included in the proffer, later discussions among the parties make clear that the 302 also recorded that Torres described a second shooter who, while wounded on the ground, fired several shots at the victim. However, this account of the second shooter, presumably Catalán, did not include the details of concern to appellant.</p>\n<p>[17]  The government could have secured a first degree murder conviction without specifically charging premeditation, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a), but it nonetheless included premeditation in the charge on count eight as an element of the charged offense. The judge instructed the jury that it must find both malice aforethought as well as premeditation in order to convict the defendants. Although the defendants were charged with \"aiding and abetting\" the commission of the murder in count eight, that charge did not lessen the mental state required to convict appellant of the murder charge. Even under the aiding and abetting theory of liability, the government was required to prove that Catalán \"consciously shared\" the principal's intent. <i>United States v. Mangual-Corchado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752407\"><a href=\"/opinion/752407/united-states-v-saul-mangual-corchado-united-states-of-america-v-ernesto/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1998) (an aiding and abetting murder conviction \"required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Cirilo, before the murder occurred, consciously shared [the principal's] intention to kill Meijas and sought to ensure the success of the criminal enterprise....\").</p>\n<p>[18]  <i>See</i> 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 34 (6th ed. 2006):\n</p>\n<p>[W]hat degree of inconsistency between the witness's testimony and his previous statement is required? ... The test ought to be: Could the jury reasonably find that a witness who believed the truth of the facts testified to would be unlikely to make a prior statement of this tenor? ... Instead of restricting the use of prior statements by a mechanical test of inconsistency, in case of doubt the courts should lean toward receiving such statements to aid in evaluating the testimony. After all, the pretrial statements were made when memory was fresher and when there was less time for the play of bias. Thus, they are often more trustworthy than the testimony.</p>\n<p>[19]  <i>But see</i> 1 <i>McCormick on Evidence</i> § 49 (6th ed. 2006) (\"Given Rule 402 [which provides that \"all relevant evidence is admissible\"], there is a powerful argument that the collateral fact rule was impliedly repealed by enactment of the Federal Rules. Under this reading of the Federal Rules, there is no rigid prohibition on introducing extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness on a collateral matter; rather, under Rule 403, the judge would make a practical judgment as to whether the importance of the witness's testimony and the impeachment warrants the expenditure of the additional trial time. However, the collateral fact rule was so ingrained at common law that many federal opinions continue to mention `collateral' evidence.\"). This circuit continues to apply the collateral fact rule. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>[20]  Because it is not necessary to this decision, the significance, if any, of the fact that Agents Ng and Alvarado would have testified about a robbery for which appellant was not charged (the November 30 robbery) is not addressed.</p>\n<p>[21]  However, this is not to suggest that testimony elicited on direct is always or automatically impeachable. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, 27 <i>Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Evid.</i> § 6096 (2d ed. 2005) (\"Some older authority suggests that the collateral matter doctrine applies only when the testimony to be contradicted was elicited on cross-examination. Under this approach, when a witness testifies to facts during direct examination she may be impeached by extrinsic evidence even if those facts are collateral. More recent authority and commentary rejects this approach, reasoning that contradiction as to a trivial matter wastes time and confuses the issues no matter whether the contradiction occurs on direct or cross examination.\").</p>\n<p>[22]  The desired impeachment through agents Ng and Alvarado was not relevant to the March 27 murder.</p>\n<p>[23]  Strangely, Catalán apparently did not seek to have any of the agents testify about Torres's out-of-court account of the March 27 robbery and murder during the penalty phase of the trial, even though the court clearly took a different view of the relevance of the evidence in that phase of the trial. For example, it allowed co-defendant Medina to present previously excluded impeachment by extrinsic evidence through Agent Marchand during Medina's penalty-phase case. (Catalán's penalty-phase case preceded Medina's.)</p>\n<p>[24]  Oddly, counsel for Medina has not also argued that Medina's convictions on counts eight and nine violate double jeopardy. Although in exceptional circumstances we may address arguments not raised by counsel, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Atkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102591\"><a href=\"/opinion/102591/united-states-v-atkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 160, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span> (1936), those circumstances are very rare and not present here. Other than a $100 special assessment imposed for count nine, Medina's conviction on count nine does not and cannot affect his sentence, which is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>[25]  In his pro se supplemental brief, Medina also argues that his \"conviction[s] and sentences on all counts must be vacated as the evidence was legally insufficient.\" However, while he presents detailed arguments about the insufficiency of the evidence for counts five, six, and eight, he does not even mention the other counts, let alone explain why the evidence was insufficient. Even affording him a more lenient standard because he is pro se on these claims, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Johnson v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567585\"><a href=\"/opinion/567585/leroy-h-johnson-jr-v-alex-rodriguez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.1991), this argumentation is insufficient to bring the sufficiency of the evidence for claims one through four and seven before us. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[26]  18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) requires a sentencing court to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence....\"</p>\n<p>[27]  There is some discrepancy between the testimony, both as we read it and in the description of it given in the briefs, as to just when the hand raising occurred; we have chosen the version that seems to be best supported, but the differences are not material to the outcome.</p>\n<p>[28]  Count eight of the second superseding indictment charged Catalán under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(j) with aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to cause the death of a person in the course of a crime of violence, specifically, a robbery. Section 924(j)(1) cross-references 18 U.S.C. § 1111 and provides that if the killing is \"murder (as defined in section 1111),\" the perpetrator shall \"be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(j)(1). The indictment also explicitly cross-referenced the definition of murder in section 1111.</p>\n<p>[29]  There is no indication that Catalán sought to introduce the supposed omissions at the penalty phase, and the judge permitted codefendant Medina to introduce in the penalty phase testimony from Agent Carlos Marchand on the omissions in Torres' prior statements about March 27.</p>\n\n</div>",
