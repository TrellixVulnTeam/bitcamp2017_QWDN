William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n        [Hon. Robert B. Collings, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the\nUnited States on February 3, 2005. We have substituted him for\nJohn Ashcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent.\nSee Fed. R.

Molina, Jr. Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice,\nwith whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, and David V. Bernal, Assistant Director, were on brief\nfor respondent, appellee.\n\n\n\n                           September 6, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     **\n          Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f          CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.    When we heard argument,\n\ntwo matters were consolidated before us:    (1) Ishak's petition for\n\nreview of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his\n\nmotion to reconsider its decision refusing him asylum and ordering\n\nhis removal; and (2) Ishak's appeal from the district court's\n\ndismissal, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, of the habeas\n\ncorpus petition he had brought to contest his deportation.\n\n          Before we had decided, the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (\"Real ID Act\"), went into effect.\n\nThis gave new and dispositive support to the district court's\n\nholding that it lacked jurisdiction over Ishak's habeas claims. It\n\nalso, however, transferred these same claims to our court, in the\n\nform of a new, statutorily-created petition for review. Because of\n\nthe relevance of the Real ID Act, we invited the parties to submit\n\nsupplemental briefing containing their views on its effects here.\n\nWe now affirm the district court's dismissal of the habeas corpus\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction, and we dismiss on the merits\n\nboth Ishak's original petition for review and the new petition for\n\nreview established by operation of the Real ID Act relative to\n\nIshak's habeas claims in the district court.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            Background\n\n          Ishak, a native and citizen of Egypt, entered the United\n\nStates on June 23, 1999 as a tourist.    He overstayed his visa and\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fapplied for asylum on July 21, 2000, claiming that he suffered past\n\npersecution      on     account        of   his     religion,     Coptic      Orthodox\n\nChristianity, his membership in a particular social group, and his\n\npolitical opinion.       Ishak also applied for withholding of removal,\n\nvoluntary   departure,      and        relief     under   the   Convention     Against\n\nTorture.\n\n            An asylum officer of the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS)1 conducted an interview of Ishak and determined that\n\nhe was ineligible for asylum.                 The asylum officer outlined her\n\nassessment in a memorandum in which she recommended referral to an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ).         The INS denied Ishak's asylum application\n\nand   referred    the    case     to    the     immigration     court   for    further\n\nproceedings.\n\n            On February 27, 2002, the IJ held a hearing at which\n\nIshak testified. The IJ rendered an oral decision, denying Ishak's\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture, and granting voluntary departure in\n\nlieu of removal.        In his oral decision, the IJ reviewed various\n\nparts of the record, including the asylum officer's assessment\n\nmemorandum, which he recited verbatim.                The IJ further stated that\n\nhe had \"observed the demeanor of [Ishak] during the time he [had]\n\n\n\n      1\n      On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nWe refer to the agency throughout this opinion as the INS.\n\n                                            -4-\n\ftestified\" and found his \"testimony to be less than candid, his\n\nanswers to be rambling, his answers not responsive to the questions\n\nasked, and his testimony not credible concerning the reasons for\n\nhis leaving Egypt and not wanting to return to Egypt.\"\n\n           Ishak filed a timely appeal with the BIA. He argued that\n\nhe had provided sufficient evidence to establish his eligibility\n\nfor asylum.    In the alternative, he contended that he had been\n\ndenied a fair hearing because of the lack of competent translation,\n\nthe inability to cross-examine the asylum officer after the IJ's\n\nreliance on her findings, and the IJ's antagonistic questioning on\n\ncross-examination.\n\n           On August 27, 2003, the BIA dismissed the appeal.          The\n\nBIA found that the IJ's adverse credibility finding was supported\n\nby the record.   Specifically, the BIA noted that it \"agree[d] with\n\nthe [IJ's] characterization that [Ishak] provided unresponsive\n\nanswers and was evasive . . . when the [IJ] asked questions to\n\nclarify implausibilities and inconsistencies in his testimony.\"\n\nThe BIA also found that \"[Ishak’s] testimony regarding his arrest\n\nand false accusation [was] too implausible and [had] too many\n\nunresolved    inconsistencies   to    establish   his   eligibility   for\n\nasylum.\"   Moreover, as to Ishak’s claim that he had no opportunity\n\nto cross-examine the asylum officer after the IJ had relied on her\n\nfindings, the BIA found that the IJ had \"merely agreed with the\n\nasylum officer's credibility finding, but [had] made his own\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcredibility finding based on his own observations at the merits\n\nhearing.\"\n\n            Ishak did not file with this court a petition for direct\n\nreview of the BIA's decision disposing of his appeal.               See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(1), (b) (2000).          On September 26, 2003, Ishak instead\n\nfiled a timely motion with the BIA to reconsider its August 27,\n\n2003 decision dismissing his appeal.            Ishak repeated the arguments\n\nhe had made in his appeal, and asserted that the BIA had made\n\nerrors of fact and law in conflict with this court's June 2003\n\ndecision of El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\nissued after he had filed his appeal but before the BIA entered its\n\nown decision dismissing the appeal.           Ishak claimed that, in light\n\nof El Moraghy, the IJ had misused the country condition reports as\n\na test for corroboration.         See id. at 204.\n\n            On December 3, 2003, the BIA rejected Ishak's motion to\n\nreconsider.     The BIA stated that it had considered the same\n\narguments   made     by   Ishak   in   the   motion   to    reconsider   before\n\nrendering an initial decision in his case.            The BIA \"decline[d] to\n\nrevisit\" those arguments and denied the motion.\n\n            On December 24, 2003, Ishak filed with this court a\n\ntimely    petition    for   direct     review    of   the   BIA's    denial   of\n\nreconsideration.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (2000).          In his petition\n\nfor review, Ishak requested a stay of removal, which this court\n\ndenied.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           On January 20, 2004, while the above petition for review\n\nof the BIA's denial of reconsideration was pending in this court,\n\nIshak filed in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts a petition for writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241, alleging that the immigration authorities had denied\n\nhim the right to a fair and impartial hearing.                He contended that\n\nthe IJ had misused the country condition reports and had failed to\n\nmake independent findings, as required by El Moraghy, and that the\n\nIJ's questioning on cross-examination was indicative of the unfair\n\nhearing he received.       The United States filed a return to the\n\nhabeas petition, arguing that the district court lacked habeas\n\njurisdiction.     According to the government, determinations of the\n\nkind Ishak sought to have reviewed in the district court could only\n\nbe reviewed by the court of appeals in a timely-filed statutory\n\npetition for review.       As Ishak had failed to pursue that avenue\n\nwhen open to him, the district court lacked jurisdiction to deal\n\nwith the issues that could have been but were not presented via the\n\nreview petition mechanism.\n\n           On    January   23,   2004,       the   district      court   dismissed\n\nIshak's habeas petition \"for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n\nIshak timely appealed to this court from the dismissal order.                     By\n\norder dated January 23, 2004, this court granted Ishak's emergency\n\nmotion for stay of removal.            We then consolidated (1) Ishak's\n\npetition   for   review    of    the   BIA's       denial   of    the    motion   to\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\freconsider; and (2) his appeal from the district court's dismissal\n\nof the habeas petition.\n\n             The above matters were briefed and argued to us.                  Before\n\nwe could render a decision, however, the President signed into law\n\nthe   Real   ID   Act,    Pub.   L.     No.    109-13,   119    Stat.   231.    This\n\nlegislation       largely   mooted       the     parties'      original   arguments\n\nconcerning whether the district court had habeas jurisdiction to\n\nresolve the due process claims Ishak put to that court.                    The Real\n\nID Act provides unequivocally that a petition for direct review in\n\nthe court of appeals shall be the exclusive means for judicial\n\nreview of an order of removal, and that cases pending in the\n\ndistrict     court   on   the    date    of    enactment    challenging    a   final\n\ndeportation order shall be transferred, in the form of petitions\n\nfor review, to the courts of appeals.               Real ID Act § 106, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.                 Cases so transferred are not\n\nsubject to the thirty-day filing deadline in section 242(b)(1) of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Id. § 106(c), 119 Stat.\n\nat 311; see infra.\n\n             Because of the Real ID Act's relevance, we invited and\n\nreceived supplemental briefing from the parties on its impact upon\n\ntheir contentions.        With the benefit of this additional briefing,\n\nwe now address, in their altered form, the issues before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                                   II.\n\n                 Jurisdiction of the District Court\n\nA.   Under Prior Law\n\n            Prior to enactment of the Real ID Act, the courts of\n\nappeals were divided over whether the district courts possessed\n\nhabeas    jurisdiction   to   consider   constitutional   challenges   to\n\ndeportation orders that so-called non-criminal aliens2 could but\n\ndid not raise by means of direct petitions for review filed in the\n\ncourts of appeals.3      Our circuit had left open whether, in a case\n\nlike Ishak's, habeas review was an alternative to a timely-filed\n\npetition for review in the court of appeals.      See Seale v. INS, 323\n\nF.3d 150, 153 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In its original argument made to us prior to enactment of\n\nthe Real ID Act, the government contended that, under then-existing\n\nlaw, Ishak lacked the right to challenge his deportation by habeas\n\n\n\n      2\n      We use \"criminal aliens\" as shorthand for aliens made\ndeportable by reason of having been convicted of crimes while in\nthis country which, by law, were grounds for deportation. Non-\ncriminal aliens are those who, like Ishak, are deportable for\nreasons other than criminal behavior while here.\n     3\n      Compare, e.g., Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2002)\n(holding that district courts have jurisdiction over habeas\npetitions brought by non-criminal aliens); Liu v. INS, 293 F.3d 36\n(2d Cir. 2002) (same); Chmakov v. Blackman, 266 F.3d 210 (3d Cir.\n2001) (same), with Laing v. Ashcroft, 370 F.3d 994, 999-1000 (9th\nCir. 2004) (dismissing habeas petition because alien failed to file\na timely petition for direct review); Lopez v. Heinauer, 332 F.3d\n507, 511 (8th Cir. 2003) (\"Because judicial review was available to\n[the noncriminal alien], the district court was not authorized to\nhear this § 2241 habeas petition.\").\n\n                                   -9-\n\fcorpus.    It argued that the provisions of the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n\n110 Stat. 1214 (1996), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and\n\nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n\n110 Stat. 3009 (1996), stripped the district court of jurisdiction\n\nover habeas petitions brought by non-criminal aliens.                Ishak\n\nreplied that, to the contrary, the Supreme Court's decision in INS\n\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), addressing the deportation of\n\ncriminal    aliens,   should   be    broadly   read   to   provide   that,\n\nnotwithstanding AEDPA and IIRIRA, district courts retained habeas\n\njurisdiction over non-criminal aliens' objections to a deportation\n\norder.     Id. at 314.    Those arguments are no longer germane,\n\nhowever, given enactment of the Real ID Act which, in the plainest\n\nof language, deprives the district courts of jurisdiction in\n\nremoval cases.4\n\nB.   Impact of the Real ID Act\n\n           Shortly after briefing and oral argument in this case,\n\nthe Real ID Act took effect.     See Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231\n\n(2005).    The Real ID Act amended section 242 of the INA, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252, to place review of all final removal orders, for both\n\ncriminal and non-criminal aliens, in the courts of appeals.          See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), amended by Real ID Act § 106, 109 Pub. L. No.\n\n\n\n      4\n      Ishak raises no constitutional challenge to the provisions of\nthe Real ID Act amending the INA.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.   By channeling review to the courts of\n\nappeals, Congress sought to streamline what it saw as \"bifurcated\n\nand piecemeal\" review of orders of removal.    See H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 109-72, at 173-75 (2005).\n\n          Section 106(a)(1)(B) of the Real ID Act created new INA\n\n§ 242(a)(5), which expressly bars habeas review, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241, of final orders of removal:\n\n     EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF REVIEW. -- Notwithstanding any other\n     provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including\n     section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, or any\n     other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651\n     of such title, a petition for review filed with an\n     appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this\n     section shall be the sole and exclusive means for\n     judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued\n     under any provision of this Act, except as provided in\n     subsection (e).    For purposes of this Act, in every\n     provision that limits or eliminates judicial review or\n     jurisdiction to review, the terms \"judicial review\" and\n     \"jurisdiction to review\" include habeas corpus review\n     pursuant to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code,\n     or any other habeas corpus provision, sections 1361 and\n     1651 of such title, and review pursuant to any other\n     provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory).\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(1)(B), Pub.\n\nL. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.\n\n          Section 106(a)(1)(B) of the Real ID Act also created new\n\nINA § 242(a)(4), which provides:\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or\n     nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, United\n     States Code, or any other habeas corpus provision . . .\n     a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of\n     appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole\n     and exclusive means of judicial review of any cause or\n     claim under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f     and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment\n     or Punishment . . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(4), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(1)(B), Pub.\n\nL. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310.\n\n            The Real ID Act also amended INA § 242(b)(9), which now\n\nprovides:\n\n     Judicial review of all questions of law and fact,\n     including    interpretation     and    application     of\n     constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any\n     action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien\n     from the United States under this subchapter shall be\n     available only in judicial review of a final order under\n     this section.    Except as otherwise provided in this\n     section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by habeas\n     corpus under section 2241 of title 28, United States\n     Code, or any other habeas corpus provision, by section\n     1361 or 1651 of such title, or by any other provision of\n     law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order\n     or such questions of law or fact.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(2), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311 (emphasis added).5\n\n            The Real ID Act provided that the amendments shall take\n\neffect on May 11, 2005, the date of the enactment of the Real ID\n\nAct, and shall apply to cases in which the final order of removal\n\nwas issued \"before, on, or after\" May 11, 2005.       Real ID Act §\n\n106(b), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.     The plain language\n\nof these amendments, in effect, strips the district court of habeas\n\njurisdiction over final orders of removal, including orders issued\n\n\n     5\n      The Real ID Act does not preclude, however, district court\nhabeas review over challenges to detention that are independent of\nchallenges to removal orders. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 109-72, at\n175.\n\n                                -12-\n\fprior to enactment of the Real ID Act.        As Ishak's final order of\n\nremoval was issued before May 11, 2005, the jurisdiction-stripping\n\nprovisions enacted by the Real ID Act apply to this case.            It is\n\nthus academic whether, in the prior legal landscape, the district\n\ncourt erred or did not err in concluding that it lacked habeas\n\njurisdiction.     Regardless whether the district court had habeas\n\njurisdiction under the law existing when it ordered the dismissal\n\nof   Ishak's    habeas   petition,     Congress   now   has   definitively\n\neliminated any provision for jurisdiction.         We accordingly affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment dismissing Ishak's habeas petition\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                     III.\n\n       Transfer of Habeas Proceeding in the District Court\n         to the Court of Appeals as a Petition for Review\n\n          Section 106(c) of the Real ID Act provides that, if a\n\nhabeas petition challenging a final order of removal \"is pending in\n\na district court on the date of the enactment\" of the Real ID Act,\n\n\"then the district court shall transfer the case . . . to the court\n\nof appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could\n\nhave been properly filed under [INA § 242(b)(2)].\"            Pub. L. No.\n\n109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.      The court of appeals is to treat the\n\ntransferred district court case \"as if it had been filed pursuant\n\nto a petition for review under such section 242, except that\n\nsubsection (b)(1) of such section shall not apply.\"            Id.   INA §\n\n242(b)(1), to which the above provision refers, provides that a\n\n                                     -13-\n\f\"petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the\n\ndate of the final order of removal.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (2000).\n\n            Here, Ishak did not file within the thirty-day time\n\nperiod a petition for review of the BIA’s order dismissing his\n\nappeal.   Instead, he filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider.   He\n\nconcedes that the motion to reconsider did not toll the thirty-day\n\ndeadline.    See Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359-60 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). Thereafter, he separately petitioned the district court for\n\na writ of habeas corpus claiming that the immigration proceedings\n\nresulting in his deportation were constitutionally infirm.\n\n            Both parties agree in their supplemental filings that,\n\nunder the terms of the Real ID Act, we must now treat Ishak's\n\nhabeas case and the instant appeal from the district court's\n\ndismissal of Ishak's habeas petition, as if the habeas case had\n\nbeen filed pursuant to a timely petition for direct review of the\n\nBIA's order affirming Ishak's deportation.   This is so even though\n\nthe thirty-day period for filing a petition for review has long\n\nsince expired.   See Real ID Act § 106(c), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119\n\nStat. at 311.\n\n            To be sure, the transfer provision in the Real ID Act\n\napplies to a habeas petition challenging a removal order that is\n\n\"pending in a district court\" on the date of enactment of the Act.\n\nId.   Here, on the date of enactment, the appeal from the district\n\ncourt's dismissal order was pending in our court; the habeas\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fpetition    itself   had   been     dismissed    in   the    district   court.\n\nNonetheless, we think the habeas case was still \"pending\" in the\n\ndistrict court within the meaning of the Real ID Act.                Until our\n\ncourt acted on the appeal, the case necessarily remained alive in\n\nthe lower court although dormant.           See 16A Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3949.1\n\nat 50-53 (3d ed. 1999 & Supp. 2005) (discussing the district\n\ncourt's    power   and   residual    jurisdiction     in    cases   pending   on\n\nappeal); cf. Kusay v. United States, 62 F.3d 192, 194 (2d Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that the district court retains jurisdiction over\n\n\"those aspects of the case [not] involved in the appeal\").\n\n            It is apparent from Congress' clear intent to place all\n\nreview of removal orders in the courts of appeals, see H.R. Conf.\n\nRep. No. 109-72, at 175, that habeas appeals from a district court\n\nthat are pending in this court on the effective date of the Real ID\n\nAct must be converted, along with the underlying district court\n\ncase, to petitions for review.6         See Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Some habeas appeals pending in this court may not be properly\nconverted before us to petitions for review. See INA § 242(b)(2),\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2) (2000) (\"The petition for review shall be\nfiled with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which\nthe immigration judge completed the proceedings.\"); Real ID Act §\n106(c), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311. But such is not the\ncase here. Because Ishak's immigration proceedings were held in\nBoston, Massachusetts, this court would be the proper venue for a\npetition for review. See INA § 242(b)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2)\n(2000).\n\n                                     -15-\n\fF.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 2005).          The government as well as the\n\npetitioner agrees with this interpretation.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n                  Merits of Claims Now Before Us\n\n           We accordingly now have before us two petitions for\n\nreview.   The first is the petition for review timely filed in this\n\ncourt by Ishak to review the BIA's denial               of his motion to\n\nreconsider its prior upholding of the INS removal order.                 The\n\nsecond is the converted habeas case originally brought in the\n\ndistrict court, challenging the constitutionality of the removal\n\nproceedings.    While   the   actual    issues   in   both   petitions   are\n\nremarkably similar, we shall consider them separately so as to\n\navoid confusion because of the difference in review standards and\n\ntiming.\n\nA.   Petition for Review Based Upon Denial of Motion to Reconsider\n\n           A court of appeals reviews BIA decisions on motions to\n\nreconsider solely for abuse of discretion.            Hossain v. Ashcroft,\n\n381 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2004).       \"In the reconsideration context,\n\nwe will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without\n\na 'rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\"\n\nZhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Nascimento\n\nv. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f             Ishak argues that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndenying his motion to reconsider because it failed to consider\n\nseveral issues related to our decision in El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,\n\n331 F.3d 195 (1st Cir. 2003): the IJ's misuse of the country\n\ncondition reports; the IJ's and the BIA's failure to make a\n\ncredibility finding; and the BIA's failure to exercise independent\n\njudgment in its decision.\n\n             1.    Misuse of the Country Condition Reports\n\n             In El Moraghy, a case on direct appeal, we criticized the\n\nIJ for several errors.         First, we noted that the IJ \"improperly\n\nimposed a requirement that the country condition reports refer\n\nspecifically to the petitioner or his family members.\" Id. at 204.\n\nIn other words, the IJ \"appear[ed] to have employed the country\n\ncondition reports solely as a test of direct corroboration, rather\n\nthan   for   the    purposes   of    providing   context   and   generalized\n\ncredibility assessment.\"       Id.\n\n             We do not see a similarly improper use of the country\n\ncondition reports here.        The IJ did note in his evidence summary\n\nthat the country condition reports submitted by Ishak did not refer\n\nto any members of his family.         But he said nothing further on this\n\nsubject.     It appears that his summary of the evidence was designed\n\nsolely for the purposes of providing context.          He did not tie this\n\nitem into a specific adverse finding.            On this record, we cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsay the BIA abused its discretion in not granting a rehearing based\n\non misuse of the country condition reports.\n\n            2. Failure to Make Credibility Findings and to Exercise\n            Independent Judgment\n\n            We also noted in El Moraghy the IJ's and the BIA's\n\nfailure to make findings as to credibility or past persecution.\n\nId. at 198.        We remanded the case for further consideration,\n\nbecause    the    absence     of   findings    as    to   credibility    or     past\n\npersecution prevented us from resolving the case on either of those\n\ngrounds.    Id.     Ishak argues that the IJ and the BIA similarly\n\nfailed to make credibility findings and that the BIA failed to\n\nexercise independent judgment in its decision.\n\n            Ishak, however, failed to raise these arguments before\n\nthe BIA.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1) (2000).              We lack jurisdiction\n\nover issues not raised before the BIA.              Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d\n\n754, 762 (1st Cir. 1992).            Due process claims may be exempt from\n\nthis procedural rule where resort to the BIA would be futile\n\nbecause of its lack of power to adjudicate constitutional issues.\n\nSee,   e.g.,     Sousa   v.   INS,    226   F.3d    28,   32   (1st   Cir.   2000);\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 762.          See infra.     In the petition for review\n\nof the denial of his motion to reconsider, however, Ishak does not\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the regulations or procedures\n\nthat   governed      his      hearing.        Instead,         he   complains     of\n\n\"irregularities which the BIA could have corrected if brought to\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fits attention.\"   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 763.        As Ishak did not\n\nraise these issues before the BIA, we cannot hear them now.\n\n          3.   Antagonistic Cross-Examination by the IJ\n\n          Ishak   also    contends   the   IJ's   antagonistic   cross-\n\nexamination \"is indicative of the unfair hearing [he] received\" and\n\nthat the BIA abused its discretion by \"[doing] nothing to address\n\nor remedy that legal error.\"     The IJ has broad discretion over the\n\nconduct of trial proceedings.     Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565,\n\n568 (1st Cir. 1999).     During Ishak's testimony, the IJ asked Ishak\n\nquestions, attempting to clarify portions of his testimony.         One\n\nmay infer from the record that the IJ's manner of questioning was\n\nbrusque and impatient.     But we cannot say the questioning was so\n\nobviously biased or unfair that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndetermining that the questioning did not make Ishak’s hearing\n\nunfair.   See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56 (1994)\n\n(holding that charges of judicial bias and partiality cannot be\n\nestablished solely by \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction,\n\nannoyance, and even anger\"); Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 327 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n          We accordingly reject Ishak's petition for review of the\n\nBIA's denial of his motion to reconsider its decision denying\n\nasylum and ordering his removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fB.   Petition for Review Based Upon Ishak's Habeas Case\n\n           A district court case transferred to a court of appeals\n\nunder the Real ID Act is to be treated \"as if it had been filed\n\npursuant to a petition for review . . . .\"        Real ID Act § 106(c),\n\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.        The court thus looks at the\n\nsame issues raised in the district court case but as if presented\n\nto it in a timely petition for review.\n\n           Ishak's claims in his converted district court case are\n\nessentially a reformulation of the arguments he raised in the\n\npetition   for   review   of   the   BIA's   denial   of   his   motion   to\n\nreconsider.      He presents those, however, as violations of his\n\nconstitutionally-protected right of due process, contending that\n\nthe IJ and the BIA violated his \"constitutional right to a fair\n\ntrial and informed decisions with specific and sound reasoning.\"\n\nHe argues that his hearing was not fair and impartial because the\n\nIJ misused the country condition reports, the IJ and the BIA failed\n\nto make credibility findings, and the BIA failed to exercise its\n\nindependent judgment, as required by El Moraghy. Ishak also argues\n\nthat the IJ's questioning on cross-examination was indicative of\n\nthe unfair hearing he received.\n\n           \"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles\n\naliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\"          Reno v.\n\nFlores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993).            We review a claim that an\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fadministrative law judge violated a party's right to due process de\n\nnovo.   Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 129 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           1.   Misuse of the Country Condition Reports\n\n           First, for essentially the same reasons we stated in\n\naffirming the BIA's denial of the motion to reconsider, we reject\n\nIshak's claim that his right to due process was violated by the\n\nIJ's misuse of the country condition reports under El Moraghy. See\n\nsupra p. 17.\n\n           2. Failure to Make Credibility Findings and to Exercise\n           Independent Judgment\n\n           Second, Ishak argues, based on El Moraghy, that his right\n\nto due process was violated because the IJ and the BIA improperly\n\nrelied on the asylum officer's assessment memorandum instead of\n\nmaking their own credibility findings, and that the BIA failed to\n\nexercise its independent judgment. As stated earlier, Ishak failed\n\nto raise these arguments to the BIA, and we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview issues not raised before the BIA.         Ravindran, 976 F.2d at\n\n762.    Due process claims may be exempt from this procedural rule\n\nwhere resort to the BIA would be futile because of its lack of\n\npower to adjudicate constitutional issues.        See, e.g., Sousa, 226\n\nF.3d at 32; Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 762.           A petitioner cannot,\n\nhowever,   obtain   review   of   unraised   procedural   errors   in   the\n\nadministrative process by simply alleging that such errors amount\n\nto due process violations.    Reid v. Engen, 765 F.2d 1457, 1461 (9th\n\nCir. 1985).     \"Unless an alien shows that his unraised due process\n\n                                   -21-\n\fclaims go beyond mere 'procedural errors,' which the BIA plainly\n\nmay address, [] this court lacks jurisdiction to hear them.\"\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 762.\n\n             Even assuming arguendo that Ishak's arguments that the IJ\n\nand the BIA failed to make credibility findings and that the BIA\n\nfailed to exercise independent judgment are claims that go beyond\n\nmere procedural errors, they lack merit.           It is true, as Ishak\n\npoints out, that the IJ recited the asylum officer's assessment\n\nmemorandum verbatim as part of his oral decision. The IJ, however,\n\nheld a hearing to allow Ishak to develop his claims, and, as the\n\nBIA noted, the IJ additionally \"made his own credibility finding\n\nbased on his own observations at the merits hearing.\"         In his oral\n\ndecision, the IJ stated, as already recited:\n\n      I have observed the demeanor of the respondent during the\n      time he has testified in these proceedings and find his\n      testimony to be less than candid, his answers to be\n      rambling, his answers not responsive to the questions\n      asked, and his testimony not credible concerning the\n      reasons for his leaving Egypt and not wanting to return\n      to Egypt.\n\nThe   IJ's   exhaustive   discussion   of   the   record   shows    that   he\n\nindependently reviewed the record and came to his own conclusion\n\nthat Ishak lacked credibility.      The fact that he also recited the\n\nasylum    officer's   assessment   memorandum     and   reached    the   same\n\nconclusion as the asylum officer does not render Ishak's hearing\n\nunfair.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f           On appeal, the BIA made its own credibility finding and\n\nexercised its independent judgment.          The BIA agreed with the IJ's\n\ncharacterization of Ishak's testimony as not responsive, but gave\n\nindependent reasons for its decision.          The BIA said that Ishak's\n\nunresponsive testimony occurred when the IJ was trying to clarify\n\n\"implausibilities and inconsistencies in his testimony.\"               The BIA\n\nalso found that \"[Ishak’s] testimony regarding his arrest and false\n\naccusation [was] too implausible and [had] too many unresolved\n\ninconsistencies to establish his eligibility for asylum.\" In light\n\nof the findings by the IJ and the BIA, we are unconvinced that\n\nIshak's right to due process was violated.\n\n           3.   Antagonistic Cross-Examination by the IJ\n\n           Finally, for essentially the same reasons stated earlier,\n\nsee supra pp. 18-19, we reject Ishak's contention that his right to\n\ndue   process   was   violated   by    the   IJ's   questioning   on   cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n                                       V.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n           We affirm the district court's dismissal of Ishak's\n\npetition for habeas corpus for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nWe deny the petition for review of the BIA's order denying the\n\nmotion to reconsider and deny the petition for review converted\n\nfrom Ishak's habeas petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f",

When we heard argument,\n\ntwo matters were consolidated before us:    (1) Ishak's petition for\n\nreview of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his\n\nmotion to reconsider its decision refusing him asylum and ordering\n\nhis removal; and (2) Ishak's appeal from the district court's\n\ndismissal, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, of the habeas\n\ncorpus petition he had brought to contest his deportation.\n\n          Before we had decided, the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005) (\"Real ID Act\"), went into effect.\n\nThis gave new and dispositive support to the district court's\n\nholding that it lacked jurisdiction over Ishak's habeas claims. It\n\nalso, however, transferred these same claims to our court, in the\n\nform of a new, statutorily-created petition for review. Because of\n\nthe relevance of the Real ID Act, we invited the parties to submit\n\nsupplemental briefing containing their views on its effects here.\n\nWe now affirm the district court's dismissal of the habeas corpus\n\npetition for lack of jurisdiction, and we dismiss on the merits\n\nboth Ishak's original petition for review and the new petition for\n\nreview established by operation of the Real ID Act relative to\n\nIshak's habeas claims in the district court.\n\n                                I.\n\n                            Background\n\n          Ishak, a native and citizen of Egypt, entered the United\n\nStates on June 23, 1999 as a tourist.    He overstayed his visa and\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fapplied for asylum on July 21, 2000, claiming that he suffered past\n\npersecution      on     account        of   his     religion,     Coptic      Orthodox\n\nChristianity, his membership in a particular social group, and his\n\npolitical opinion.       Ishak also applied for withholding of removal,\n\nvoluntary   departure,      and        relief     under   the   Convention     Against\n\nTorture.\n\n            An asylum officer of the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS)1 conducted an interview of Ishak and determined that\n\nhe was ineligible for asylum.                 The asylum officer outlined her\n\nassessment in a memorandum in which she recommended referral to an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ).         The INS denied Ishak's asylum application\n\nand   referred    the    case     to    the     immigration     court   for    further\n\nproceedings.\n\n            On February 27, 2002, the IJ held a hearing at which\n\nIshak testified. The IJ rendered an oral decision, denying Ishak's\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture, and granting voluntary departure in\n\nlieu of removal.        In his oral decision, the IJ reviewed various\n\nparts of the record, including the asylum officer's assessment\n\nmemorandum, which he recited verbatim.                The IJ further stated that\n\nhe had \"observed the demeanor of [Ishak] during the time he [had]\n\n\n\n      1\n      On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nWe refer to the agency throughout this opinion as the INS.\n\n                                            -4-\n\ftestified\" and found his \"testimony to be less than candid, his\n\nanswers to be rambling, his answers not responsive to the questions\n\nasked, and his testimony not credible concerning the reasons for\n\nhis leaving Egypt and not wanting to return to Egypt.\"\n\n           Ishak filed a timely appeal with the BIA. He argued that\n\nhe had provided sufficient evidence to establish his eligibility\n\nfor asylum.    In the alternative, he contended that he had been\n\ndenied a fair hearing because of the lack of competent translation,\n\nthe inability to cross-examine the asylum officer after the IJ's\n\nreliance on her findings, and the IJ's antagonistic questioning on\n\ncross-examination.\n\n           On August 27, 2003, the BIA dismissed the appeal.          The\n\nBIA found that the IJ's adverse credibility finding was supported\n\nby the record.   Specifically, the BIA noted that it \"agree[d] with\n\nthe [IJ's] characterization that [Ishak] provided unresponsive\n\nanswers and was evasive . . . when the [IJ] asked questions to\n\nclarify implausibilities and inconsistencies in his testimony.\"\n\nThe BIA also found that \"[Ishak’s] testimony regarding his arrest\n\nand false accusation [was] too implausible and [had] too many\n\nunresolved    inconsistencies   to    establish   his   eligibility   for\n\nasylum.\"   Moreover, as to Ishak’s claim that he had no opportunity\n\nto cross-examine the asylum officer after the IJ had relied on her\n\nfindings, the BIA found that the IJ had \"merely agreed with the\n\nasylum officer's credibility finding, but [had] made his own\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcredibility finding based on his own observations at the merits\n\nhearing.\"\n\n            Ishak did not file with this court a petition for direct\n\nreview of the BIA's decision disposing of his appeal.               See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(1), (b) (2000).          On September 26, 2003, Ishak instead\n\nfiled a timely motion with the BIA to reconsider its August 27,\n\n2003 decision dismissing his appeal.            Ishak repeated the arguments\n\nhe had made in his appeal, and asserted that the BIA had made\n\nerrors of fact and law in conflict with this court's June 2003\n\ndecision of El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200506\"><a href=\"/opinion/200506/el-moraghy-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2003),\n\nissued after he had filed his appeal but before the BIA entered its\n\nown decision dismissing the appeal.           Ishak claimed that, in light\n\nof El Moraghy, the IJ had misused the country condition reports as\n\na test for corroboration.         See id. at 204.\n\n            On December 3, 2003, the BIA rejected Ishak's motion to\n\nreconsider.     The BIA stated that it had considered the same\n\narguments   made     by   Ishak   in   the   motion   to    reconsider   before\n\nrendering an initial decision in his case.            The BIA \"decline[d] to\n\nrevisit\" those arguments and denied the motion.\n\n            On December 24, 2003, Ishak filed with this court a\n\ntimely    petition    for   direct     review    of   the   BIA's    denial   of\n\nreconsideration.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (2000).          In his petition\n\nfor review, Ishak requested a stay of removal, which this court\n\ndenied.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           On January 20, 2004, while the above petition for review\n\nof the BIA's denial of reconsideration was pending in this court,\n\nIshak filed in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts a petition for writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241, alleging that the immigration authorities had denied\n\nhim the right to a fair and impartial hearing.                He contended that\n\nthe IJ had misused the country condition reports and had failed to\n\nmake independent findings, as required by El Moraghy, and that the\n\nIJ's questioning on cross-examination was indicative of the unfair\n\nhearing he received.       The United States filed a return to the\n\nhabeas petition, arguing that the district court lacked habeas\n\njurisdiction.     According to the government, determinations of the\n\nkind Ishak sought to have reviewed in the district court could only\n\nbe reviewed by the court of appeals in a timely-filed statutory\n\npetition for review.       As Ishak had failed to pursue that avenue\n\nwhen open to him, the district court lacked jurisdiction to deal\n\nwith the issues that could have been but were not presented via the\n\nreview petition mechanism.\n\n           On    January   23,   2004,       the   district      court   dismissed\n\nIshak's habeas petition \"for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n\nIshak timely appealed to this court from the dismissal order.                     By\n\norder dated January 23, 2004, this court granted Ishak's emergency\n\nmotion for stay of removal.            We then consolidated (1) Ishak's\n\npetition   for   review    of    the   BIA's       denial   of    the    motion   to\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\freconsider; and (2) his appeal from the district court's dismissal\n\nof the habeas petition.\n\n             The above matters were briefed and argued to us.                  Before\n\nwe could render a decision, however, the President signed into law\n\nthe   Real   ID   Act,    Pub.   L.     No.    109-13,   119    Stat.   231.    This\n\nlegislation       largely   mooted       the     parties'      original   arguments\n\nconcerning whether the district court had habeas jurisdiction to\n\nresolve the due process claims Ishak put to that court.                    The Real\n\nID Act provides unequivocally that a petition for direct review in\n\nthe court of appeals shall be the exclusive means for judicial\n\nreview of an order of removal, and that cases pending in the\n\ndistrict     court   on   the    date    of    enactment    challenging    a   final\n\ndeportation order shall be transferred, in the form of petitions\n\nfor review, to the courts of appeals.               Real ID Act § 106, Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.                 Cases so transferred are not\n\nsubject to the thirty-day filing deadline in section 242(b)(1) of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Id. § 106(c), 119 Stat.\n\nat 311; see infra.\n\n             Because of the Real ID Act's relevance, we invited and\n\nreceived supplemental briefing from the parties on its impact upon\n\ntheir contentions.        With the benefit of this additional briefing,\n\nwe now address, in their altered form, the issues before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                                   II.\n\n                 Jurisdiction of the District Court\n\nA.   Under Prior Law\n\n            Prior to enactment of the Real ID Act, the courts of\n\nappeals were divided over whether the district courts possessed\n\nhabeas    jurisdiction   to   consider   constitutional   challenges   to\n\ndeportation orders that so-called non-criminal aliens2 could but\n\ndid not raise by means of direct petitions for review filed in the\n\ncourts of appeals.3      Our circuit had left open whether, in a case\n\nlike Ishak's, habeas review was an alternative to a timely-filed\n\npetition for review in the court of appeals.      See Seale v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781275\"><a href=\"/opinion/781275/michael-ar-seale-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In its original argument made to us prior to enactment of\n\nthe Real ID Act, the government contended that, under then-existing\n\nlaw, Ishak lacked the right to challenge his deportation by habeas\n\n\n\n      2\n      We use \"criminal aliens\" as shorthand for aliens made\ndeportable by reason of having been convicted of crimes while in\nthis country which, by law, were grounds for deportation.

Ishak\n\nreplied that, to the contrary, the Supreme Court's decision in INS\n\nv. St. Cyr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), addressing the deportation of\n\ncriminal    aliens,   should   be    broadly   read   to   provide   that,\n\nnotwithstanding AEDPA and IIRIRA, district courts retained habeas\n\njurisdiction over non-criminal aliens' objections to a deportation\n\norder.     Id. at 314.    Those arguments are no longer germane,\n\nhowever, given enactment of the Real ID Act which, in the plainest\n\nof language, deprives the district courts of jurisdiction in\n\nremoval cases.4\n\nB.   Impact of the Real ID Act\n\n           Shortly after briefing and oral argument in this case,\n\nthe Real ID Act took effect.     See Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231\n\n(2005).    The Real ID Act amended section 242 of the INA, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252, to place review of all final removal orders, for both\n\ncriminal and non-criminal aliens, in the courts of appeals.          See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), amended by Real ID Act § 106, 109 Pub. L. No.\n\n\n\n      4\n      Ishak raises no constitutional challenge to the provisions of\nthe Real ID Act amending the INA.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.   By channeling review to the courts of\n\nappeals, Congress sought to streamline what it saw as \"bifurcated\n\nand piecemeal\" review of orders of removal.    See H.R. Conf. Rep.\n\nNo. 109-72, at 173-75 (2005).\n\n          Section 106(a)(1)(B) of the Real ID Act created new INA\n\n§ 242(a)(5), which expressly bars habeas review, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241, of final orders of removal:\n\n     EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF REVIEW. -- Notwithstanding any other\n     provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including\n     section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, or any\n     other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651\n     of such title, a petition for review filed with an\n     appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this\n     section shall be the sole and exclusive means for\n     judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued\n     under any provision of this Act, except as provided in\n     subsection (e).    For purposes of this Act, in every\n     provision that limits or eliminates judicial review or\n     jurisdiction to review, the terms \"judicial review\" and\n     \"jurisdiction to review\" include habeas corpus review\n     pursuant to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code,\n     or any other habeas corpus provision, sections 1361 and\n     1651 of such title, and review pursuant to any other\n     provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory).\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(1)(B), Pub.\n\nL. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310-11.\n\n          Section 106(a)(1)(B) of the Real ID Act also created new\n\nINA § 242(a)(4), which provides:\n\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or\n     nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, United\n     States Code, or any other habeas corpus provision . . .\n     a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of\n     appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole\n     and exclusive means of judicial review of any cause or\n     claim under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f     and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment\n     or Punishment . . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(4), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(1)(B), Pub.\n\nL. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 310.\n\n            The Real ID Act also amended INA § 242(b)(9), which now\n\nprovides:\n\n     Judicial review of all questions of law and fact,\n     including    interpretation     and    application     of\n     constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any\n     action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien\n     from the United States under this subchapter shall be\n     available only in judicial review of a final order under\n     this section.    Except as otherwise provided in this\n     section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by habeas\n     corpus under section 2241 of title 28, United States\n     Code, or any other habeas corpus provision, by section\n     1361 or 1651 of such title, or by any other provision of\n     law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order\n     or such questions of law or fact.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), amended by Real ID Act § 106(a)(2), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311 (emphasis added).5\n\n            The Real ID Act provided that the amendments shall take\n\neffect on May 11, 2005, the date of the enactment of the Real ID\n\nAct, and shall apply to cases in which the final order of removal\n\nwas issued \"before, on, or after\" May 11, 2005.       Real ID Act §\n\n106(b), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.     The plain language\n\nof these amendments, in effect, strips the district court of habeas\n\njurisdiction over final orders of removal, including orders issued\n\n\n     5\n      The Real ID Act does not preclude, however, district court\nhabeas review over challenges to detention that are independent of\nchallenges to removal orders. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 109-72, at\n175.\n\n                                -12-\n\fprior to enactment of the Real ID Act.        As Ishak's final order of\n\nremoval was issued before May 11, 2005, the jurisdiction-stripping\n\nprovisions enacted by the Real ID Act apply to this case.            It is\n\nthus academic whether, in the prior legal landscape, the district\n\ncourt erred or did not err in concluding that it lacked habeas\n\njurisdiction.     Regardless whether the district court had habeas\n\njurisdiction under the law existing when it ordered the dismissal\n\nof   Ishak's    habeas   petition,     Congress   now   has   definitively\n\neliminated any provision for jurisdiction.         We accordingly affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment dismissing Ishak's habeas petition\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                     III.\n\n       Transfer of Habeas Proceeding in the District Court\n         to the Court of Appeals as a Petition for Review\n\n          Section 106(c) of the Real ID Act provides that, if a\n\nhabeas petition challenging a final order of removal \"is pending in\n\na district court on the date of the enactment\" of the Real ID Act,\n\n\"then the district court shall transfer the case . . . to the court\n\nof appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could\n\nhave been properly filed under [INA § 242(b)(2)].\"            Pub. L. No.\n\n109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.      The court of appeals is to treat the\n\ntransferred district court case \"as if it had been filed pursuant\n\nto a petition for review under such section 242, except that\n\nsubsection (b)(1) of such section shall not apply.\"            Id.   INA §\n\n242(b)(1), to which the above provision refers, provides that a\n\n                                     -13-\n\f\"petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the\n\ndate of the final order of removal.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (2000).\n\n            Here, Ishak did not file within the thirty-day time\n\nperiod a petition for review of the BIA’s order dismissing his\n\nappeal.   Instead, he filed with the BIA a motion to reconsider.   He\n\nconcedes that the motion to reconsider did not toll the thirty-day\n\ndeadline.    See Ven v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201300\"><a href=\"/opinion/201300/ven-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359-60 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). Thereafter, he separately petitioned the district court for\n\na writ of habeas corpus claiming that the immigration proceedings\n\nresulting in his deportation were constitutionally infirm.\n\n            Both parties agree in their supplemental filings that,\n\nunder the terms of the Real ID Act, we must now treat Ishak's\n\nhabeas case and the instant appeal from the district court's\n\ndismissal of Ishak's habeas petition, as if the habeas case had\n\nbeen filed pursuant to a timely petition for direct review of the\n\nBIA's order affirming Ishak's deportation.   This is so even though\n\nthe thirty-day period for filing a petition for review has long\n\nsince expired.   See Real ID Act § 106(c), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119\n\nStat. at 311.\n\n            To be sure, the transfer provision in the Real ID Act\n\napplies to a habeas petition challenging a removal order that is\n\n\"pending in a district court\" on the date of enactment of the Act.\n\nId.   Here, on the date of enactment, the appeal from the district\n\ncourt's dismissal order was pending in our court; the habeas\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fpetition    itself   had   been     dismissed    in   the    district   court.\n\nNonetheless, we think the habeas case was still \"pending\" in the\n\ndistrict court within the meaning of the Real ID Act.                Until our\n\ncourt acted on the appeal, the case necessarily remained alive in\n\nthe lower court although dormant.           See 16A Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3949.1\n\nat 50-53 (3d ed. 1999 & Supp. 2005) (discussing the district\n\ncourt's    power   and   residual    jurisdiction     in    cases   pending   on\n\nappeal); cf. Kusay v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (2d Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that the district court retains jurisdiction over\n\n\"those aspects of the case [not] involved in the appeal\").\n\n            It is apparent from Congress' clear intent to place all\n\nreview of removal orders in the courts of appeals, see H.R. Conf.\n\nRep. No. 109-72, at 175, that habeas appeals from a district court\n\nthat are pending in this court on the effective date of the Real ID\n\nAct must be converted, along with the underlying district court\n\ncase, to petitions for review.6         See Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Some habeas appeals pending in this court may not be properly\nconverted before us to petitions for review. See INA § 242(b)(2),\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2) (2000) (\"The petition for review shall be\nfiled with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which\nthe immigration judge completed the proceedings.\"); Real ID Act §\n106(c), Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311. But such is not the\ncase here. Because Ishak's immigration proceedings were held in\nBoston, Massachusetts, this court would be the proper venue for a\npetition for review. See INA § 242(b)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2)\n(2000).\n\n                                     -15-\n\fF.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 2005).          The government as well as the\n\npetitioner agrees with this interpretation.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n                  Merits of Claims Now Before Us\n\n           We accordingly now have before us two petitions for\n\nreview.   The first is the petition for review timely filed in this\n\ncourt by Ishak to review the BIA's denial               of his motion to\n\nreconsider its prior upholding of the INS removal order.                 The\n\nsecond is the converted habeas case originally brought in the\n\ndistrict court, challenging the constitutionality of the removal\n\nproceedings.    While   the   actual    issues   in   both   petitions   are\n\nremarkably similar, we shall consider them separately so as to\n\navoid confusion because of the difference in review standards and\n\ntiming.\n\nA.   Petition for Review Based Upon Denial of Motion to Reconsider\n\n           A court of appeals reviews BIA decisions on motions to\n\nreconsider solely for abuse of discretion.            Hossain v.

Misuse of the Country Condition Reports\n\n             In El Moraghy, a case on direct appeal, we criticized the\n\nIJ for several errors.         First, we noted that the IJ \"improperly\n\nimposed a requirement that the country condition reports refer\n\nspecifically to the petitioner or his family members.\" Id. at 204.\n\nIn other words, the IJ \"appear[ed] to have employed the country\n\ncondition reports solely as a test of direct corroboration, rather\n\nthan   for   the    purposes   of    providing   context   and   generalized\n\ncredibility assessment.\"       Id.\n\n             We do not see a similarly improper use of the country\n\ncondition reports here.        The IJ did note in his evidence summary\n\nthat the country condition reports submitted by Ishak did not refer\n\nto any members of his family.         But he said nothing further on this\n\nsubject.     It appears that his summary of the evidence was designed\n\nsolely for the purposes of providing context.          He did not tie this\n\nitem into a specific adverse finding.            On this record, we cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsay the BIA abused its discretion in not granting a rehearing based\n\non misuse of the country condition reports.\n\n            2. Failure to Make Credibility Findings and to Exercise\n            Independent Judgment\n\n            We also noted in El Moraghy the IJ's and the BIA's\n\nfailure to make findings as to credibility or past persecution.\n\nId. at 198.        We remanded the case for further consideration,\n\nbecause    the    absence     of   findings    as    to   credibility    or     past\n\npersecution prevented us from resolving the case on either of those\n\ngrounds.    Id.     Ishak argues that the IJ and the BIA similarly\n\nfailed to make credibility findings and that the BIA failed to\n\nexercise independent judgment in its decision.\n\n            Ishak, however, failed to raise these arguments before\n\nthe BIA.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1) (2000).              We lack jurisdiction\n\nover issues not raised before the BIA.              Ravindran v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762 (1st Cir. 1992).

INS,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199083\"><a href=\"/opinion/199083/sousa-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   32   (1st   Cir.   2000);\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 762.          See infra.     In the petition for review\n\nof the denial of his motion to reconsider, however, Ishak does not\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the regulations or procedures\n\nthat   governed      his      hearing.        Instead,         he   complains     of\n\n\"irregularities which the BIA could have corrected if brought to\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fits attention.\"   Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 763.        As Ishak did not\n\nraise these issues before the BIA, we cannot hear them now.\n\n          3.   Antagonistic Cross-Examination by the IJ\n\n          Ishak   also    contends   the   IJ's   antagonistic   cross-\n\nexamination \"is indicative of the unfair hearing [he] received\" and\n\nthat the BIA abused its discretion by \"[doing] nothing to address\n\nor remedy that legal error.\"     The IJ has broad discretion over the\n\nconduct of trial proceedings.     Aguilar-Solis v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n568 (1st Cir. 1999).     During Ishak's testimony, the IJ asked Ishak\n\nquestions, attempting to clarify portions of his testimony.         One\n\nmay infer from the record that the IJ's manner of questioning was\n\nbrusque and impatient.     But we cannot say the questioning was so\n\nobviously biased or unfair that the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndetermining that the questioning did not make Ishak’s hearing\n\nunfair.   See Liteky v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555-56 (1994)\n\n(holding that charges of judicial bias and partiality cannot be\n\nestablished solely by \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction,\n\nannoyance, and even anger\"); Morales v.

Petition for Review Based Upon Ishak's Habeas Case\n\n           A district court case transferred to a court of appeals\n\nunder the Real ID Act is to be treated \"as if it had been filed\n\npursuant to a petition for review . . . .\"        Real ID Act § 106(c),\n\nPub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 311.        The court thus looks at the\n\nsame issues raised in the district court case but as if presented\n\nto it in a timely petition for review.\n\n           Ishak's claims in his converted district court case are\n\nessentially a reformulation of the arguments he raised in the\n\npetition   for   review   of   the   BIA's   denial   of   his   motion   to\n\nreconsider.      He presents those, however, as violations of his\n\nconstitutionally-protected right of due process, contending that\n\nthe IJ and the BIA violated his \"constitutional right to a fair\n\ntrial and informed decisions with specific and sound reasoning.\"\n\nHe argues that his hearing was not fair and impartial because the\n\nIJ misused the country condition reports, the IJ and the BIA failed\n\nto make credibility findings, and the BIA failed to exercise its\n\nindependent judgment, as required by El Moraghy. Ishak also argues\n\nthat the IJ's questioning on cross-examination was indicative of\n\nthe unfair hearing he received.\n\n           \"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles\n\naliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\"          Reno v.\n\nFlores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112833\"><a href=\"/opinion/112833/reno-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306 (1993).

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200854\"><a href=\"/opinion/200854/mekhoukh-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           1.   Misuse of the Country Condition Reports\n\n           First, for essentially the same reasons we stated in\n\naffirming the BIA's denial of the motion to reconsider, we reject\n\nIshak's claim that his right to due process was violated by the\n\nIJ's misuse of the country condition reports under El Moraghy. See\n\nsupra p. 17.\n\n           2. Failure to Make Credibility Findings and to Exercise\n           Independent Judgment\n\n           Second, Ishak argues, based on El Moraghy, that his right\n\nto due process was violated because the IJ and the BIA improperly\n\nrelied on the asylum officer's assessment memorandum instead of\n\nmaking their own credibility findings, and that the BIA failed to\n\nexercise its independent judgment. As stated earlier, Ishak failed\n\nto raise these arguments to the BIA, and we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview issues not raised before the BIA.         Ravindran, 976 F.2d at\n\n762.    Due process claims may be exempt from this procedural rule\n\nwhere resort to the BIA would be futile because of its lack of\n\npower to adjudicate constitutional issues.        See, e.g., Sousa, 226\n\nF.3d at 32; Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 762.           A petitioner cannot,\n\nhowever,   obtain   review   of   unraised   procedural   errors   in   the\n\nadministrative process by simply alleging that such errors amount\n\nto due process violations.    Reid v. Engen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454529\"><a href=\"/opinion/454529/amelia-c-reid-v-donald-d-engen-administrator-federal-aviation/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1461 (9th\n\nCir. 1985).     \"Unless an alien shows that his unraised due process\n\n                                   -21-\n\fclaims go beyond mere 'procedural errors,' which the BIA plainly\n\nmay address, [] this court lacks jurisdiction to hear them.\"\n\nRavindran, 976 F.2d at 762.\n\n             Even assuming arguendo that Ishak's arguments that the IJ\n\nand the BIA failed to make credibility findings and that the BIA\n\nfailed to exercise independent judgment are claims that go beyond\n\nmere procedural errors, they lack merit.           It is true, as Ishak\n\npoints out, that the IJ recited the asylum officer's assessment\n\nmemorandum verbatim as part of his oral decision. The IJ, however,\n\nheld a hearing to allow Ishak to develop his claims, and, as the\n\nBIA noted, the IJ additionally \"made his own credibility finding\n\nbased on his own observations at the merits hearing.\"         In his oral\n\ndecision, the IJ stated, as already recited:\n\n      I have observed the demeanor of the respondent during the\n      time he has testified in these proceedings and find his\n      testimony to be less than candid, his answers to be\n      rambling, his answers not responsive to the questions\n      asked, and his testimony not credible concerning the\n      reasons for his leaving Egypt and not wanting to return\n      to Egypt.\n\nThe   IJ's   exhaustive   discussion   of   the   record   shows    that   he\n\nindependently reviewed the record and came to his own conclusion\n\nthat Ishak lacked credibility.      The fact that he also recited the\n\nasylum    officer's   assessment   memorandum     and   reached    the   same\n\nconclusion as the asylum officer does not render Ishak's hearing\n\nunfair.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f           On appeal, the BIA made its own credibility finding and\n\nexercised its independent judgment.          The BIA agreed with the IJ's\n\ncharacterization of Ishak's testimony as not responsive, but gave\n\nindependent reasons for its decision.          The BIA said that Ishak's\n\nunresponsive testimony occurred when the IJ was trying to clarify\n\n\"implausibilities and inconsistencies in his testimony.\"               The BIA\n\nalso found that \"[Ishak’s] testimony regarding his arrest and false\n\naccusation [was] too implausible and [had] too many unresolved\n\ninconsistencies to establish his eligibility for asylum.\" In light\n\nof the findings by the IJ and the BIA, we are unconvinced that\n\nIshak's right to due process was violated.\n\n           3.   Antagonistic Cross-Examination by the IJ\n\n           Finally, for essentially the same reasons stated earlier,\n\nsee supra pp. 18-19, we reject Ishak's contention that his right to\n\ndue   process   was   violated   by    the   IJ's   questioning   on   cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n                                       V.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n           We affirm the district court's dismissal of Ishak's\n\npetition for habeas corpus for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nWe deny the petition for review of the BIA's order denying the\n\nmotion to reconsider and deny the petition for review converted\n\nfrom Ishak's habeas petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f</pre>",
