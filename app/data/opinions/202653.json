This case presents an issue of\n\neligibility for benefits under the Individuals with Disabilities\n\nEducation Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. (Supp. 2006) (the \"IDEA\").\n\nWe have previously noted that such issues can require a \"difficult\n\nand sensitive\" analysis.      Greenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N., 358 F.3d\n\n150, 162 (1st Cir. 2004) (not reaching the eligibility question).\n\nThis   case   is   no   exception.         The    appellant,    Maine     School\n\nAdministrative     District   No.   55    (\"the   district\"),    appeals     the\n\ndistrict court's determination that the appellees' daughter (\"LI\")\n\nqualifies as a \"child with a disability\" eligible for special\n\neducation and related services under the IDEA as a result of her\n\nAsperger's Syndrome.      The appellees (\"Mr. and Mrs. I\" or \"the\n\nparents\") cross-appeal the district court's rulings that (1) even\n\nthough LI was entitled to IDEA services, her parents were not\n\nentitled to reimbursement of their expenses in unilaterally placing\n\nLI in a private school following the district's refusal to provide\n\nthose services and (2) the district would not be separately ordered\n\nto provide compensatory education services to reverse the effects\n\nof that decision on LI's progress.          We affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          We begin with an overview of the statutory framework.\n\nThe IDEA provides funding to each state \"to assist [it] to provide\n\nspecial   education     and   related       services    to     children     with\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdisabilities,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1411(a)(1), provided that \"[a] free\n\nappropriate public education is available to all children with\n\ndisabilities residing in the state . . . .\"         Id. § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n\nIn this sense, a \"free appropriate public education\" encompasses\n\n\"special education and related services,\" id. § 1401(9), including\n\n\"specially designed instruction, at no cost to parents, to meet the\n\nunique needs of a child with a disability . . . .\"        Id. § 1401(29).\n\n           To receive special education and related services under\n\nthe IDEA, a child must qualify as a \"child with a disability.\"             In\n\nrelevant part, a \"child with a disability\" is a child\n\n          (i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments\n     (including deafness), speech or language impairments,\n     visual   impairments   (including   blindness),   serious\n     emotional disturbance (referred to in this chapter as\n     \"emotional disturbance\"), orthopedic impairments, autism,\n     traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or\n     specific learning disabilities; and\n\n          (ii) who, by reason thereof, needs special education\n     and related services.\n\nId. § 1401(3)(A).        The Secretary of Education has promulgated a\n\nregulation defining each of the categories of disability set forth\n\nin § 1401(3)(A)(i). Those definitions, so far as they are relevant\n\nhere, require that each of the enumerated conditions \"adversely\n\naffect[]   a   child's    educational     performance\"   to   constitute   a\n\ndisability. 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.8(c)(1)(i) (2006) (autism), (c)(4)(i)\n\n(emotional disturbance),       (c)(9)(ii) (other health impairment).1\n\n\n     1\n     Although this regulation was amended during the pendency of\nthis appeal, none of the amendments affects our analysis.    See\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          The IDEA places the burden of identifying children with\n\ndisabilities upon each state.          20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A).             In\n\ndeciding whether a particular student has a disability under the\n\nIDEA, Maine uses a \"pupil evaluation team,\" or \"PET,\"               05-071-101\n\nMe. Code. R. § 9.4 (2006), consisting of the student's parents, a\n\nrepresentative     from    the   school      district,   and   a    number    of\n\neducational and other professionals. Id. § 8.6; see also 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1414(d)(1)(B).    Though the members of the PET attempt to achieve\n\nconsensus on this issue, the school district retains the \"ultimate\n\nresponsibility to ensure that a student is appropriately evaluated\"\n\nfor IDEA eligibility.      05-071-101 Me. Code. R. § 8.11(C).\n\n          The    parents    of   a   child    deemed   ineligible    for     IDEA\n\nbenefits can challenge that determination before an impartial\n\nhearing officer. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(b)(6), (f)(1)(A), (f)(3)(A).\n\nAfter the hearing, the officer issues a final administrative\n\ndecision, accompanied by findings of fact.               Id. §§ 1415(h)(4),\n\n(i)(1)(A).   Any party aggrieved by the decision can then file a\n\ncivil action in federal district court. Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A). Then\n\nthe \"trial court must make an independent ruling based on the\n\npreponderance of the evidence, but the Act contemplates that the\n\nsource of that evidence generally will be the administrative\n\n\ngenerally Assistance to States for the Education of Children With\nDisabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities,\n71 Fed. Reg. 46,540 (Aug. 14, 2006) (codified at 34 C.F.R. pt.\n300). For ease of reference, then, we cite to the current version\nof the regulation throughout.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fhearing record, with some supplementation at trial.\"                     Town of\n\nBurlington v. Dep't of Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 790 (1st Cir. 1984),\n\naff'd sub nom. Sch. Comm. v. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359 (1986)\n\n(\"Burlington\"); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C).\n\n              In    keeping   with   this    approach,    the   district    court\n\nreferred the case to a magistrate judge for proposed findings and\n\na recommended disposition, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) (2006),\n\nwhich were made based on the facts adduced at the due process\n\nhearing and supplemental evidence submitted by the parents.                   The\n\ndistrict court, in the absence of an objection from either side,\n\naccepted the magistrate's proposed findings wholesale.                     In the\n\ncontinued absence of any challenge to these factual findings, we\n\ntake the same tack.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                                       A.\n\n              LI attended Cornish Elementary School in Cornish, Maine,\n\nuntil 2003.        Though she excelled academically, by the fourth grade\n\nshe began to experience sadness, anxiety, and difficulty with peer\n\nrelationships. These problems persisted into the fifth grade, when\n\nLI   sought    to    distance   herself      physically    from   most   of   her\n\nclassmates. Her parents sought psychological counseling for LI and\n\nshe started taking a prescription anti-depressant. Her grades also\n\ndropped from \"high honors\" to \"honors.\"                   As the school year\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fprogressed, however, LI became more successful at interacting with\n\nher peers and participating in class.\n\n             During the summer recess preceding sixth grade, LI asked\n\nher mother, as she had the previous summer, to allow her to be\n\nhome-schooled.        LI    also   expressed   her   desire   to    attend   The\n\nCommunity School (\"TCS\"), a private school in South Tamworth, New\n\nHampshire, where her older sister had matriculated.               Nevertheless,\n\nLI started the 2003-2004 school year at Cornish, where Mrs. I\n\nbelieved her daughter would benefit, in particular, from her\n\nassigned sixth grade teacher.\n\n             By mid-September, however, LI was \"slacking off\" in her\n\nacademic work and regularly missing school, prompting a meeting\n\nbetween her teacher and Mrs. I.         At this meeting, also attended by\n\nLI, Mrs. I noticed cuts or scratches on her daughter's arms; the\n\nteacher offered that LI might have inflicted those wounds on\n\nherself during her \"lengthy bathroom breaks\" from class. According\n\nto the teacher, LI was also having continued trouble relating with\n\nher peers due to a \"serious lack of awareness\" of their social and\n\nemotional states, which bordered on \"hostility.\" The teacher added\n\nthat   she    could   not   \"reach\"   LI,   who   had   refused    to   complete\n\nassignments and shown a \"passive resistance to meeting learning\n\ngoals.\"      Yet the teacher considered LI \"a very bright young girl\n\nwith strong language and math skills . . . capable of powerful\n\ninsights in her reading and writing . . . .\"\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            The teacher and Mrs. I came up with a \"contract\" that\n\nwould have entitled LI to study more advanced topics in her areas\n\nof   interest   in   November   if    she   satisfactorily   completed   her\n\nassignments for October.         As October approached, however, LI\n\nrefused to sign the contract and stayed home from school on both\n\nSeptember 30 and October 1.          On October 1, following an argument\n\nwith Mrs. I over one of LI's academic assignments, LI deliberately\n\ningested excessive quantities of one her prescription drugs and two\n\nover-the-counter medications in a suicide attempt.\n\n            LI spent the balance of the day in the emergency room at\n\na nearby hospital and was discharged with instructions to remain\n\nout of school for two days under high safety precautions.                The\n\nhospital social worker also directed Mr. and Mrs. I to \"share with\n\n[LI] something that would change in her life, and produce a\n\npositive impact on her emotional functioning.\"               Based on LI's\n\ncomments to hospital personnel that she hated school, Mr. and Mrs.\n\nI told her that she would not have to return to Cornish Elementary\n\nand discussed enrollment at TCS as an alternative.\n\n            In the wake of her attempted suicide, LI met with a new\n\ncounselor, who, suspecting that LI might suffer from Asperger's\n\nSyndrome, referred her to Dr. Ellen Popenoe for neuropsychological\n\ntesting.2   Mr. and Mrs. I conveyed this information, as well as the\n\n\n      2\n      \"Asperger's disorder is a developmental disability on the\nautism spectrum that is associated with significant misperceptions\nof otherwise routine elements of daily life. It is a permanent\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnews of LI's suicide attempt, to the district's director of special\n\nservices, Jim McDevitt.      They added that LI would not return to\n\nCornish Elementary \"for the time being\" and that they were looking\n\nat other options, including TCS.         McDevitt explained the process\n\nfor seeking reimbursement from the district for placing LI in a\n\nprivate school and also told the parents that the district planned\n\nto convene a pupil evaluation team for LI at the end of the month.\n\nAt that meeting, the PET decided that LI should receive up to ten\n\nhours of tutoring outside of school each week pending completion of\n\nher neuropsychological testing.\n\n          The   testing,     finished     by   early   November,    further\n\nsuggested that LI had Asperger's Syndrome, as well as adjustment\n\ndisorder with depressed mood.3          Popeneo, the neuropsychologist,\n\nobserved that LI \"experiences significant limitations in many areas\n\nof   adaptive   skills\"     and   executive     skills,    \"which    likely\n\ncontribute[s]   to   her   behavioral    and   emotional   difficulties.\"4\n\n\ncondition that is not treatable with medication.\"          Greenland, 358\nF.3d at 154.\n     3\n      Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is characterized by\na psychological response to an identifiable stressor that results\nin the development of clinically significant emotional or\nbehavioral symptoms, i.e., depressed mood, tearfulness, or feelings\nof hopelessness. Am.

Executive skills are those necessary to think\nabstractly and to plan, initiate, monitor, and stop complex\n\n                                   -9-\n\fThese behavioral difficulties, particularly LI's poor pragmatic\n\nlanguage    abilities   and   restricted    range    of   social    interests,\n\nsupported a diagnosis of Asperger's.         Popeneo recommended that LI\n\nbegin seeing both a social skills coach, who would help her develop\n\nsocial abilities and judgment, and a therapist familiar with\n\nAsperger's, who would use a cognitive-behavioral approach.5\n\n            Popeneo   also    recommended   that    LI    undergo   a   speech-\n\nlanguage evaluation, which was completed in January 2004 by Amber\n\nLambke, a speech-language pathologist.             Lambke observed that LI\n\nsuffered \"significant social understanding deficits which impact\n\nher overall emotional and social well-being.\" Like Popeneo, Lambke\n\nrecommended that LI receive direct teaching of social skills.\n\n            In the meantime, McDevitt told Mrs. I that he would\n\nattempt to find LI a tutor in accordance with the PET's decision.\n\nMrs. I had not heard back from him by November 10, however, so she\n\nstarted home-schooling LI.       Despite additional prodding by Mrs. I\n\nin November and December, the district never provided a tutor as\n\nordered by the PET, nor explained its failure to do so.

Nat'l Ass'n of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists,\nhttp://www.nacbt.org/whatiscbt.htm (last visited January 26, 2007).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fwas having trouble getting LI to complete her assignments, and her\n\ncounselor believed that LI should resume formal schooling.\n\n             On January 5, 2004, LI began attending TCS. Although she\n\nwas withdrawn and isolated at the outset, over time LI developed\n\npositive relationships with some of her peers.                  She also thrived\n\nacademically, completing assignments at the seventh- and eighth-\n\ngrade level with ease.      TCS, however, provided LI with neither the\n\ndirect teaching of social skills nor the cognitive behavioral\n\ntherapy that had been recommended as treatment for her Asperger's.\n\n             When the PET reconvened in early March, it accepted\n\nPopenoe's conclusion that LI suffered from both Asperger's and\n\nadjustment disorder with depressed mood.            The PET also agreed that\n\nLI needed social skills and pragmatic language instruction.                    The\n\nPET, however, could not reach consensus on whether LI qualified as\n\na   \"child   with   a   disability\"    under      the   IDEA.    The   district's\n\nrepresentatives argued that LI's condition, whether denominated\n\n\"autism,\" \"emotional disturbance,\" or \"other health impairment,\" 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1401(3)(A)(i), had not affected her academic performance\n\n\"to a marked degree\" or \"over a long period of time,\" which they\n\ndeemed essential to IDEA eligibility.             The district then issued a\n\n\"prior written notice,\" id. § 1415(b)(3), announcing its refusal to\n\noffer   special     education   services     on   the   stated    basis   of   \"no\n\nsignificant adverse effect on education.\"                The district instead\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fasked the PET to consider LI's eligibility for services under the\n\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2000).\n\n            At     its   next   meeting,    the   PET     identified    LI    as   a\n\n\"qualified individual with a disability\" under the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, id. § 794(a), and recommended an array of services.                      These\n\nincluded close supervision throughout the school day; instruction\n\nin \"social pragmatics\"; access to the district's existing gifted\n\nand talented programming as well as additional programming provided\n\nthrough a consultant to be hired by the district; and placement in\n\nany elementary school within the district.                  The district also\n\noffered to supply a tutor to work with LI for three hours each day\n\nto ease her eventual transition back to the classroom.\n\n            Mr. and Mrs. I objected to this proposal as inadequate\n\nand    unduly    restrictive,     given    LI's   success     in   a    classroom\n\nenvironment at TCS and her apprehension over returning to public\n\nschool.    They wanted LI to remain at TCS for the balance of the\n\nacademic year with a view toward beginning her transition back to\n\npublic school in September 2004, and notified the district that\n\nthey    intended    to   seek   reimbursement     under    the   IDEA   for    LI's\n\nattendance at TCS.         LI completed the 2003-2004 academic year at\n\nTCS, and stayed on for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years as\n\nwell.     While she has done well academically, she continues to\n\nexperience \"atypical\" peer relationships and spent the summer of\n\n2004 shunning her TCS classmates in favor of solitary pursuits. LI\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\falso generally refuses to go outdoors or to eat more than a\n\nseverely limited variety of foods.            Her current social worker\n\nbelieves that, without social skills coaching, LI is unlikely to\n\nmaster   the   flexible    thinking,     problem   solving,   teamwork,      and\n\ncommunication abilities she will need for employment in the future.\n\n                                        B.\n\n             After the final PET decision, Mr. and Mrs. I requested a\n\ndue process hearing to challenge the district's refusal to identify\n\nLI as a child with a disability under the IDEA.                    The hearing\n\nofficer upheld the district's decision that LI was ineligible for\n\nIDEA services.      The hearing officer noted the parties' agreement\n\nthat LI had Asperger's and a depressive disorder, making her \"a\n\ntroubled young woman,\" but further observed that she was not\n\nentitled to IDEA benefits unless these disabilities \"'adversely\n\naffect[ed]' [her] educational performance.\"\n\n             The hearing officer recognized that both the IDEA and\n\nMaine's implementing regulations define \"educational performance\"\n\nto include more than just academic proficiency, but concluded that\n\nthe   IDEA   does   not   call   for   services    \"to   address    social   and\n\nemotional needs when there are no academic needs.\"                 Accordingly,\n\nbecause LI \"completes homework independently, is well behaved in\n\nclass, is successful at test taking and successfully completes\n\nprojects,\" the hearing officer determined that \"neither the [IDEA]\n\nnor the Maine Special Education Regulations require a school\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fdistrict to provide special education services to address what is\n\nessentially a mental health issue.\"\n\n            In response, Mr. and Mrs. I commenced an action in the\n\ndistrict court, which, as we have noted, referred the case to a\n\nmagistrate      judge.6   The     magistrate   judge     determined   that   the\n\nhearing officer erred in treating LI's lack of academic needs as\n\ndispositive of her IDEA eligibility when the correct standard, he\n\nbelieved, is whether a            disability \"manifest[s] itself in an\n\nadverse effect on the child's ability to learn.\" Nevertheless, the\n\nmagistrate judge ruled that LI did not meet this standard because\n\nher condition did not adversely affect her achievements as measured\n\nby   any   of    the   criteria    Maine     uses   to   define   \"educational\n\nperformance.\"      While the magistrate judge recognized that LI had\n\nfallen short of these benchmarks during the period in the fall of\n\n2003 when she had repeatedly missed school and attempted suicide,\n\nhe considered this episode too short-lived \"to trigger eligibility\n\nfor special-education services.\"\n\n            The district court, however, rejected the magistrate\n\njudge's recommended decision, concluding that LI's \"condition did\n\nadversely affect her educational performance as Maine defines that\n\nterm and that the events of the fall of 2003 cannot be isolated\n\n\n\n      6\n      In addition to seeking review of the hearing officer's\ndecision under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2), Mr. and Mrs. I also asserted\na claim for relief under the Rehabilitation Act, which was rejected\nby the district court. They have not pursued this claim on appeal.\n\n                                      -14-\n\ffrom [her] underlying condition.\"         416 F. Supp. 2d 147, 152 (D. Me.\n\n2006).     The district court determined that LI's Asperger's had\n\nexerted    an   adverse   effect    on   her   educational   performance     as\n\nmeasured by state criteria, most significantly in the areas of\n\nsocialization and communication. The district court also disagreed\n\nwith the view that any downturn in LI's educational performance was\n\ntoo fleeting to constitute an \"adverse effect.\"               Reasoning that\n\nneither the Maine regulations defining the disabilities listed in\n\n§ 1401(3)(A)(i) nor their federal counterparts used any restrictive\n\nmodifier in conjunction with the term \"adversely affects,\" the\n\ndistrict    court   ruled    that    \"any      negative   effect    should   be\n\nsufficient\" to constitute a disability under the IDEA.                   416 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 160 (emphasis added).\n\n            Turning to the second prong of the IDEA's eligibility\n\nstandard, 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A)(ii), the district court concluded\n\nthat LI needed special education and related services by reason of\n\nher disability.     First, the district court found that the PET had\n\nagreed to provide LI with a number of accommodations that fit the\n\ndefinition of \"special education\" under both the IDEA and Maine\n\nlaw,   including    one-on-one     tutoring     and   instruction   in   social\n\npragmatics.      Second, observing that \"the PET, the experts, the\n\nSchool District and the parents all initially believed that [LI]\n\n'needed' the identified services,\" the district court decided to\n\n\"hold the parties to their original understandings\" and therefore\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\ftreated \"need\" as an uncontested issue.           416 F. Supp. 2d at 167.\n\nBased on its determination that LI satisfied both elements of the\n\nIDEA eligibility test, the district court ordered the district \"to\n\nconvene a PET meeting . . . to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets\n\nher unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a\n\ndepressive disorder.\"7       Id.   at 168.\n\n              The district court also considered the parents' requests\n\nfor     additional   relief:   reimbursement      of     their    expenses   in\n\nunilaterally placing LI at TCS, and compensatory education to make\n\nup for the district's failure to identify her as eligible under the\n\nIDEA.       Though the district court found that Mr. and Mrs. I had\n\ngiven the requisite notice of the unilateral placement under Maine\n\nlaw, the court also ruled that their decision to enroll LI at TCS\n\nwas   not     \"'reasonably   calculated    to   enable    [her]    to   receive\n\neducational benefits'\" so as to entitle them to reimbursement. 416\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 172 (quoting Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v.\n\nCarter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 11 (1993) (further internal\n\nquotation marks omitted by district court)).              Finally, reasoning\n\nthat LI's \"IEP will necessarily take into account the effect of the\n\nschool district's failure to identify and offer [LI] special\n\n\n\n\n        7\n      The state must develop and implement an \"individualized\neducation program,\" or \"IEP,\" to meet the particularized needs of\neach child with a disability.         20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(4),\n1414(d)(1)(A)(i).\n\n                                    -16-\n\feducation services earlier,\" the district court did not separately\n\ngrant the parents' request for compensatory education. Id. at 173.\n\n                               III.\n\n           The district challenges the district court's conclusion\n\nthat LI qualifies as a \"child with a disability\" under the IDEA.\n\nWhile we have never expressly set forth our standard of review for\n\na district court's decision on IDEA eligibility, we have treated\n\n\"ultimate determinations in cases under the Act\" as mixed questions\n\nof fact and law.   Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983,\n\n990 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Ms. M ex rel. K.M. v. Portland Sch.\n\nComm., 360 F.3d 267, 272 (1st Cir. 2004); Kathleen H. v. Mass.\n\nDep't of Educ., 154 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998).   We agree with the\n\nparties that whether a student qualifies as \"a child with a\n\ndisability\" under § 1401(3) also poses a mixed legal and factual\n\ninquiry.   See J.D. ex rel. J.D. v. Pawlet Sch. Dist., 224 F.3d 60,\n\n64 (2d Cir. 2000); Yankton Sch. Dist. v. Schramm, 93 F.3d 1369,\n\n1374 (8th Cir. 1996).    Mixed questions generally \"fall along   a\n\ndegree-of-deference continuum, ranging from non-deferential plenary\n\nreview for law-dominated questions, to deferential review for fact-\n\ndominated questions.\" In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 432 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).   But we need not decide at the moment where\n\nalong the continuum the question of IDEA eligibility falls, as the\n\nparties agree that we should review the question for clear error.\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f             The district maintains, however, that the district court\n\narrived at its conclusion that LI is a \"child with a disability\"\n\nonly through a series of legal errors.             First, the district argues\n\nthat the district court misread the terms \"adversely affects\" and\n\n\"educational       performance\"    as    they     appear    in     the   regulatory\n\ndefinitions    of    the   disabilities        attributed    to    LI,   improperly\n\nextending the breadth of § 1401(3)(A)(i).                  Second, the district\n\nclaims that the district court similarly misinterpreted the term\n\n\"special education\" as it appears in § 1401(3)(A)(ii), the second\n\nprong   of   the    test   for   IDEA   eligibility.         The    district      also\n\nchallenges    the    determination       that    it   effectively        waived   the\n\nopportunity to dispute LI's need for special education.                   We review\n\nthese rulings of law de novo.                  Greenland, 358 F.3d at 156;\n\nManchester Sch. Dist. v. Crisman, 306 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                         A.\n\n                                         1.\n\n             Though the IDEA \"establishes a basic floor of education\"\n\nfor   children     with    disabilities,       guaranteeing       them   \"[a]     free\n\nappropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A), it does\n\nnot displace the states from their traditional role in setting\n\ntheir own educational policy.           Burlington, 736 F.2d at 788-89; see\n\nalso J.D., 224 F.3d at 65; Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874\n\nF.2d 1036, 1044 (5th Cir. 1989).              Each state thus remains free to\n\ncalibrate its own educational standards, provided it does not set\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fthem below the minimum level prescribed by the statute. Roland M.,\n\n910 F.2d at 987; Burlington, 736 F.2d at 788-89.\n\n              As we have seen, the right to special education and\n\nrelated services under the IDEA extends to children \"with\" one or\n\nmore of a variety of disabilities, 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A)(i), \"who,\n\nby reason thereof, need[] special education and related services.\"\n\nId. § 1401(3)(A)(ii).       The IDEA does not itself define any of the\n\nqualifying disabilities listed in § 1401(3)(A)(i), though the\n\nDepartment of Education has issued a regulation fleshing them out.\n\n34   C.F.R.    §    300.8(c).   The   regulatory   definitions,   with   one\n\nexception not relevant here, state, among other requirements, that\n\neach condition must \"adversely affect[] a child's educational\n\nperformance.\"        Id. § 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13).      In keeping with the\n\nIDEA's respect for state policy judgments, however, the regulation\n\ndoes not expand upon this phrase, \"leaving it to each State to give\n\nsubstance to these terms.\"            J.D., 224 F.3d at 65; see also\n\nGreenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N., No. 02-136-JD, 2003 WL 134023, at\n\n*8 (D.N.H. Mar. 19, 2003), aff'd on other grounds, 358 F.3d 150\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              It is here that the district's argument as to the proper\n\nscope of § 1401(3)(A) begins to encounter difficulty.                  While\n\nMaine's Department of Education has promulgated its own regulation\n\ndefining      the    disabilities   recognized   under   the   IDEA,   those\n\ndefinitions simply ape their federal counterparts, including the\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\frequirement that a disability \"adversely affect[] the student's\n\neducational performance.\"     05-071-101 Me. Code. R. §§ 3.2-3.14\n\n(2006).    The regulation, like its federal cousin, also does not\n\nfurther elaborate on this phrase, although Maine has adopted its\n\nown definition of \"educational performance\" for IDEA purposes:\n\n            The term \"educational performance\" includes academic\n      areas (reading, math, communication, etc.), non-academic\n      areas    (daily   life   activities,   mobility,    etc.),\n      extracurricular activities, progress in meeting goals\n      established for the general curriculum, and performance\n      on State-wide and local assessments.\n\nId.   §   2.7.   Despite   this   expansive   notion   of   educational\n\nperformance, and in the absence of any regulatory guidance as to\n\nthe term \"adversely affects,\" the district asks us to hold that a\n\nchild meets the first criterion of IDEA eligibility in Maine \"only\n\nif the student's condition imposes a significant negative impact on\n\nthe child's educational performance . . . limited to those areas of\n\nperformance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit,\n\nin accordance with law.\"    We decline to do so.\n\n            At the outset, Maine does not look only at \"areas of\n\nperformance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit\"\n\nwhen determining whether a child has a disability under the IDEA.\n\nThat much is clear from the regulatory definition of \"educational\n\nperformance\" itself, which counts \"performance on state-wide and\n\nlocal assessments\" as just one of a number of different indicators\n\nembraced by the concept.     As the district points out, the term\n\n\"general curriculum,\" which also appears in the definition of\n\n                                  -20-\n\feducational    performance,    has    a     narrower   meaning   under     the\n\nregulations,    i.e.,   \"the   school       administrative   unit's      local\n\ncurriculum for grades K-12 which incorporate the content standards\n\nand performance indicators of the Learning Results.\"8            05-071-101\n\nMe. Code. R. § 2.11.    Based on this definition, the district argues\n\nthat \"educational performance\" encompasses only those \"performance\n\nindicators\" measured as part of the local curriculum.9           Even if the\n\ndistrict's reading of \"general curriculum\" is correct, however, the\n\nfact remains that a student's progress in that regard comprises but\n\none of the aspects of \"educational performance\" as defined by the\n\nregulation.     More far-ranging measurements, such as \"academic\n\nareas\" and \"non-academic areas,\" are also included.\n\n          As the magistrate judge and the district court observed,\n\nMaine's broad definition of \"educational performance\" squares with\n\nthe broad purpose behind the IDEA: \"to ensure that all children\n\nwith disabilities have available to them a free and appropriate\n\npublic education that emphasizes special education and related\n\n\n\n     8\n      Maine's \"Learning Results\" are a \"statewide system\" developed\nto \"establish high academic standards at all grade levels\" in eight\ndifferent subject areas. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 6209\n(Supp. 2006).\n     9\n      More specifically, the district argues that, while Maine has\ndeveloped extensive performance indicators to measure progress\ntoward the \"Learning Results,\" 05-071-131 Me. Code R. §§ 1-8, state\nlaw does not require the use of these criteria, leaving measurement\nof student achievement to a \"local assessment system.\" Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 6202-A. We need not, and do not, pass upon\nthis argument. See Part III.A.2, infra.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for\n\nfurther education, employment, and independent living.\"                    20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400(d)(1)(A) (emphases added).              We have likewise held that the\n\nIDEA entitles qualifying children to services that \"target 'all of\n\n[their]    special     needs,'       whether    they    be   academic,     physical,\n\nemotional, or social.\"           Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,, 998 F.2d\n\n1083, 1089 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Burlington, 736 F.2d at 788).\n\nIt is true that we have also stated that IDEA services need not\n\naddress    \"problems     truly       'distinct'       from   learning     problems.\"\n\nGonzalez v. P.R. Dep't of Educ., 254 F.3d 350, 352 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nsee also Rome Sch. Comm.         v. Mrs. B., 247 F.3d 29, 33 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (noting that, in determining adequacy of IEP for emotionally\n\ndisturbed    boy,    \"[t]he      question       is    whether    [his]    behavioral\n\ndisturbances interfered with the child's ability to learn\").                    But\n\nit does not follow, as the hearing officer wrongly concluded, that\n\na child without \"academic needs\" is per se ineligible for IDEA\n\nbenefits, especially when the state has conditioned eligibility on\n\na standard that explicitly takes \"non-academic areas\" into account.\n\nSee Weixel v. Bd. of Educ., 287 F.3d 138, 150 (2d Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"IDEA's    coverage     is    not    limited    to    students    with    'learning\n\ndisabilities' . . . .\").         In other words, as the district admits,\n\n\"educational performance in Maine is more than just academics.\"\n\n            In   light    of     Maine's       broad    notion    of    \"educational\n\nperformance\" as the standard of IDEA eligibility, we see no basis\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\ffor restricting that standard to \"areas of performance actually\n\nbeing measured and assessed by the local unit.\"      Indeed, \"there is\n\nnothing in IDEA or its legislative history that supports the\n\nconclusion that . . . 'educational performance' is limited only to\n\nperformance that is graded.\"   See Robert A. Garda, Jr., Untangling\n\nEligibility Requirements Under the Individuals with Disabilities\n\nEducation Act, 69 Mo. L. Rev. 441,     471 (2003).   To be sure, some\n\nstates have adopted more circumscribed criteria for identifying\n\nchildren with disabilities under the IDEA, requiring, for example,\n\nthat a student perform poorly in a specific area of \"basic skills.\"\n\nSee J.D., 224 F.3d at 66 (discussing prior version of 22-000-06 Vt.\n\nCode Reg. §§ 2362(a)(2), (f) (2006)).     Maine, however, has chosen\n\nnot to do so.10   We therefore decline the district's invitation to\n\nreformulate state educational policy by narrowing the indicia of\n\neducational performance used as the test for IDEA eligibility under\n\nMaine law.   The district court properly articulated this standard\n\n\n     10\n       The Maine Department of Education has proposed amending its\nspecial education regulations to insert, inter alia, a requirement\nthat \"[a] child's disability must result in an adverse affect [sic]\non the child's ability to learn and/or perform the academic, daily\nliving, and/or age-relevant tasks required to demonstrate\neducational progress in the general curriculum.\"      Maine Unified\nSpecial Education Regulation § VII.3 (proposed Nov. 2006), to be\ncodified at 05-071-101 Me. Code R. § 1 et. seq., available at\nhttp://www.maine.gov/education/rulechanges.htm (last visited Feb.\n21, 2006). The proposed regulations also restrict the definition\nof \"educational performance\" for children older than five to\n\"academic areas (written literacy skills, math, communication,\netc.) [and] functional areas of performance (daily life activities)\n. . . .\" Id. § II.9. These draft regulations, still in the public\ncomment period, are not before us.\n\n                                -23-\n\fas \"whether [LI's] condition adversely affected her performance in\n\nany of the educational areas Maine has identified.\"               416 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 159 (footnote omitted).\n\n           The    district   also    argues    that   the    district   court\n\nmisconstrued the \"adversely affects\" component of the test to\n\ninclude   disabilities    with    \"any   adverse    effect   on    educational\n\nperformance, however slight . . . .\"            Id. at 160.       The correct\n\nformulation, the district urges, requires \"some significant impact\n\non educational performance.\"            In rejecting this proposal, the\n\ndistrict court reasoned that the phrase \"adversely affects,\" as it\n\nappears in the relevant regulations, \"has no qualifier such as\n\n'substantial,' 'significant,' or 'marked,'\" and declined to infer\n\nsuch a limitation \"from Maine's regulatory silence.\" Id. We agree\n\nwith this interpretation of the \"adversely affects\" standard.\n\n           Though the district marshals a number of arguments in\n\nsupport of its contrary position, they all sound a common theme:\n\nthat an unlimited definition of \"adversely affects\" will qualify\n\nevery child with one of the listed disabilities--no matter how\n\nminor--for IDEA benefits.        This contention, however, overlooks the\n\nstructure of the IDEA's eligibility standard, which requires not\n\nonly   that   a   child   have    one    of   the   listed   conditions,     §\n\n1401(3)(A)(i), but also that, \"by reason thereof,\" the child \"needs\n\nspecial education and related services,\" id. § 1401(3)(A)(ii).              So\n\na finding that a child meets the first criterion because his or her\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fdisability adversely affects educational performance--to whatever\n\ndegree--does not itself entitle the child to special education and\n\nrelated services under the IDEA.      See Mark C. Weber, Special\n\nEducation Law and Litigation Treatise § 2.2(1), at 2:4 (2d ed.\n\n2002); Garda, supra, at 490-91.   The child must also need special\n\neducation and related services by reason of the disability.11\n\n          In fact, an adverse effect on educational performance,\n\nstanding alone, does not even satisfy the first prong of the\n\neligibility test.   The child's condition must also possess the\n\nadditional characteristics required by the regulatory definitions\n\nof each of the disabilities enumerated in § 1401(3)(A)(i).   See   34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13); 05-071-101 Me. Code. R. §§ 3.2-3.14.\n\nFor example, to meet the first part of the eligibility standard on\n\nthe basis of autism, a child must have \"[1] a developmental\n\ndisability [2] significantly affecting [3] verbal and [4] nonverbal\n\ncommunication and [5] social interaction, [6] generally evident\n\nbefore age three, [7] that adversely affects a child's educational\n\nperformance.\"   34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(1)(i); 05-071-101 Me. Code. R.\n\n\n\n     11\n       In attacking this reasoning, the district argues that the\nsecond part of the definition of \"child with a disability\" is too\nbroad to function as a meaningful filter for IDEA eligibility. For\nthe reasons stated in Part III.B.2, infra, we do not have occasion\nto address the scope of that provision here. For the moment, we\nnote only that the district recognized, in its brief to the hearing\nofficer, that the first and second prongs of § 1401(3)(A) do\noperate in conjunction to determine eligibility. Post-Hrg. Memo.\nat 6 (\"'adverse effect' and the child's 'need for special education\nare intertwined . . . .\").\n\n                               -25-\n\f§ 3.2.   Thus, the \"adversely affects educational performance\"\n\nrequirement serves as but one of a list of factors that must be\n\npresent for a child's condition to qualify as a disability under §\n\n1401(3)(A)(i)--and, to receive IDEA benefits, the child must also\n\nneed special education and related services by reason of the\n\ndisability   under    §   1401(3)(A)(ii).      The   district   court's\n\ninterpretation of \"adversely affects,\" then, is unlikely to loose\n\nthe torrent of IDEA claims forecast by the district and its amici.\n\n          The district's specific arguments fare no better.         The\n\ndistrict contends that § 1401(3)(a)(i) fails to put the states on\n\nnotice that, as a condition of accepting federal money under the\n\nIDEA, they are required to provide benefits to children whose\n\nconditions have merely an \"adverse effect\" on their educational\n\nperformance. It is true that \"when Congress attaches conditions to\n\na State's acceptance of federal funds\" pursuant to its Spending\n\nClause authority, \"the conditions must be set out unambiguously\" so\n\nthat each state can intelligently decide whether to take the money\n\nand its accompanying obligations.       Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd.\n\nof Ed. v. Murphy, 126 S. Ct. 2455, 2459 (2006) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).      Based on this principle, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that whether the IDEA imposes a particular obligation on the\n\nstates depends, at the outset, on whether the IDEA \"furnishes clear\n\nnotice regarding the liability at issue . . . .\"       Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f           The principal place to look for such notice, of course,\n\nis the text of the IDEA itself.    Id.     The district asserts that the\n\nlanguage of § 1401(3)(A)(i) fails to clarify that a state's duty to\n\nprovide IDEA benefits extends to children with disabilities having\n\nonly an adverse effect on educational performance.           In fact, the\n\ndistrict   argues,    the   statute--through    its    use   of    the   term\n\n\"disability\"--limits    that   duty   to    children   whose      conditions\n\n\"significantly impact educational performance.\"         We disagree.\n\n           To properly understand \"disability\" as it appears in the\n\nIDEA, we do not, as the district implores, resort to dictionary\n\ndefinitions of the word \"disable,\" but to § 1401(3)(A)(i), which\n\nfunctions as the first part of the statutory definition of \"child\n\nwith a disability.\"    Section 1401(3)(A)(i), as the district court\n\nobserved, does not include the qualifying language urged upon us by\n\nthe district, but simply defines \"child with a disability\" as a\n\nchild \"with\" one of a number of specific conditions.12\n\n           The district also directs us to the more restrictive\n\nmeaning of the term \"disability\" under Title II of the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Because the IDEA\n\ncontains its own definition of the term, however, its appearance in\n\nother acts of Congress is of little moment.        See United States v.\n\n\n     12\n      Contrary to the district's suggestion, that § 1401(3)(A)(i)\nuses the words \"impairment\" or \"serious\" in naming some of the\ndisabilities set forth provides no basis for inferring that any\ncondition must be a \"serious impairment\" to meet the statutory\nstandard, let alone a \"significant impact\" requirement.\n\n                                  -27-\n\fMeade, 175 F.3d 215, 220-21 (1st Cir. 1999).         Putting aside the\n\ndifference between the legislative goals of the IDEA and these\n\nother acts, then, the IDEA simply defines \"disability\" differently\n\nthan they do.    Compare 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A) with 29 U.S.C. §\n\n705(9)(B) and 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as\n\n\"physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or\n\nmore major life activities\").    This clear disparity in text puts\n\nthe district's suggestion that we look to those other acts in\n\nconstruing the term \"disability\" here on par with comparing \"plums\n\nand pomegranates.\"   Meade, 175 F.3d at 221.\n\n           Given the express definition of \"disability\" set forth in\n\n§ 1401(3)(A)(i), we need look no further to conclude that the\n\nstatute sufficiently articulates the first prong of the standard\n\nfor IDEA eligibility and, in so doing, adequately informs the\n\nstates of the extent of their obligations.       Murphy, 126 S. Ct. at\n\n2463.   The district and its amici nevertheless argue that this\n\nstandard, as interpreted by the district court, flies in the face\n\nof   congressional   admonishments   against    identifying   too    many\n\nstudents as \"children with disabilities\" under the IDEA.            It is\n\ntrue that, in amending the Act in 1997, Congress voiced concern\n\nabout \"over identifying children as disabled when they may not be\n\ntruly disabled . . . particularly in urban schools with high\n\nproportions of minority students . . . .\"      H.R. Rep. No. 105-95, at\n\n89 (1997), reprinted in 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 86.       To remedy this\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fproblem, Congress changed the formula for calculating the funds due\n\neach state under the IDEA from one \"based on the number of children\n\nwith disabilities to a formula based on census and poverty . . . .\"\n\nId. at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85.\n\n            Notably, though, Congress thought this shift--rather than\n\nany alteration to the eligibility criteria--sufficient to address\n\nthe over-identification problem.         Id. at 89, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n87.    Congress specifically stated, in fact, that the change to the\n\nfunding formula \"should in no way be construed to modify the\n\nobligation of educational agencies to identify and serve students\n\nwith disabilities.\"    Id. at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85.        Congress\n\neschewed any change to the eligibility standard not only in 1997,\n\nbut also in 2004, when it amended the IDEA again.         Individuals with\n\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n\n446, § 602(3)(A), 118 Stat. 2647, 2652, codified at 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1401(3)(A). The Department of Education similarly declined, by and\n\nlarge, to tinker with its definitions of the § 1401(3)(A)(i)\n\ndisabilities when it issued regulations in response to the amended\n\nAct.    71 Fed. Reg. 46,540, 46,549-46,551 (Aug. 14, 2006).           Thus,\n\nalthough    the   district   and   its    amici   argue   that   an   over-\n\nidentification problem persists, we cannot tighten the standard for\n\nIDEA eligibility when Congress itself has chosen not to do so.13\n\n\n       13\n      Moreover, Congress took this course of action despite the\npresidential committee report touted by the district and its amici\nin support of their proffered standard.     President's Comm'n on\n\n                                   -29-\n\f           The   legislative     history,    then,    only   strengthens   our\n\nconviction that § 1401(3)(A)(i), as construed by the district\n\ncourt, does not offend the Spending Clause by springing hidden\n\nliabilities   upon      participating    states.       Furthermore,   as   the\n\ndistrict acknowledges, states deciding whether to enter into the\n\nIDEA bargain also have the benefit of the federal regulation\n\ndefining the disabilities set forth in § 1401(3)(A)(i).                 Those\n\ndefinitions, again, specifically require that each disability (save\n\none) \"adversely affect[] a child's educational performance.\"                34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13).          They do not contain the limiting\n\nlanguage   urged   by    the   district,    i.e.,    \"significantly   impacts\n\neducational performance.\"\n\n           We reject the district's argument that such a limitation\n\nlurks in the term \"adversely,\" which the district equates with\n\n\"calamitously\" or \"perniciously\" on the authority of an unabridged\n\ndictionary.      We think it considerably more likely that federal\n\nregulators used \"adverse\" in its ordinary sense, namely \"against.\"\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary 58 (8th ed. 2004); see also Webster's Third\n\n\nExcellence in Special Educ., A New Era: Revitalizing Special\nEducation for Children and Their Families (2002), available at\nhttp://www.ed.gov/inits/commissionsboards/whspecialeducation/\nindex.html (last visited Jan. 19, 2007). This report not only\nfurther expressed concern about over-identification, as the\ndistrict and its amici point out, but strongly criticized the\nregulatory definitions of the disabilities recognized by the IDEA.\nId. at 22.     Because neither Congress nor the Department of\nEducation   appears   to   have    acted   on   the    commission's\nrecommendations, however, the report is of little use in construing\nthe eligibility standards that have endured.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fNew International Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged)\n\n31 (1993) (giving primary definition of \"adverse\" as \"acting\n\nagainst or in a contrary direction\").14 In this way, the regulation\n\nsensibly demands that a disability cannot qualify a child for IDEA\n\nbenefits       unless    it     has   a   negative        effect   on    educational\n\nperformance; no effect, or a positive one, will not do.15                           The\n\nregulation       does    not,    however,        put   any    quantitative     limit,\n\n\"significant\" or otherwise, on the disability.\n\n               Maine's regulation, cribbed from 34 C.F.R. § 300.8, also\n\nrequires no particular degree of impact on educational performance.\n\n05-071-101 Me. Code. R. §§ 3.2-3.14. This fact alone distinguishes\n\nthis    case    from    the   decisions     of    other      courts,   cited   by   the\n\ndistrict, which derived a higher standard from state law.                           See\n\nJ.D., 224 F.3d at 66-67; Gregory M. ex rel. Ernest M. v. State Bd.\n\nof Educ., 891 F. Supp. 695, 702 (D. Conn. 1995); Doe ex rel. Doe v.\n\n\n\n       14\n      One district court recently used the secondary definition of\n\"adverse\" from a different dictionary--\"causing harm\"--to interpret\nthe \"adversely affects\" requirement, concluding that, when a\nstudent \"experiences only a slight impact on his educational\nperformance, it cannot be said that the student is harmed.\" Ashli\n& Gordon C. ex rel. Sidney C. v. Hawaii, No. 05-00429-HG-KSC, 2007\nWL 247761, at *9 (D. Hawai'i Jan. 23, 2007). In fact, however, the\nstudent is still \"harmed\"--if only slightly--so the court's\nconclusion does not follow from the definition it cites.       As a\nresult, Ashli & Gordon C. does not persuasively address the absence\nof any qualitative limitation in the regulatory language.\n       15\n      The \"adversely affects\" test also serves an additional\nfunction: ensuring that it is the \"enumerated disability, and not\nother factors\" that impacts educational performance. See Garda,\nsupra, at 486.\n\n                                          -31-\n\fBd. of Educ., 753 F. Supp. 65, 70 & n.9 (D. Conn. 1990).16                    In\n\nJ.D.,        for    example,   the   Second   Circuit   considered   a   Vermont\n\nregulation that defined \"adverse effect of the disability on\n\neducational performance\" to require a determination \"that the\n\nstudent is functioning significantly below expected age or grade\n\nnorms, in one or more of the basic skills.\"                   224 F.3d at 66\n\n(internal          quotation   marks   omitted).    This   provision     further\n\nrequired that the \"determination of adverse effect, usually defined\n\nas 1.0 standard deviation or its equivalent, shall be documented\n\nand supported by two or more measures of school performance,\" which\n\nwere themselves specified by the regulation.               Id.   Based on this\n\nstandard, the Second Circuit concluded that the child did not\n\nqualify for IDEA benefits because he was \"unable to identify at\n\nleast two school performance measures that point to an adverse\n\neffect,\" despite his emotional-behavioral disability.                Id. at 67.\n\n                   The Second Circuit reached its decision in J.D., then,\n\nby applying the highly specific definition of \"adversely affects\n\neducational performance\" set forth in state law, not by imposing\n\nits own gloss on that language, as the district invites us to do\n\nhere.        For the reasons we have stated, we decline that invitation.\n\n\n\n        16\n      The Connecticut decisions applied a now-superseded state\nregulation defining \"socially and emotionally maladjusted\" in part\nas \"a condition which 'significantly impedes the child's rate of\neducational development.'\" Doe, 753 F. Supp. at 70 n.9 (quoting\nConn. Agencies Regs. § 10-76a-1(m) (1989)); see also Gregory M.,\n891 F. Supp. at 702 (articulating same test).\n\n                                         -32-\n\fStates wishing to put meat on the bones of the \"adversely affects\"\n\nstandard are free to do so--provided, of course, they do not\n\ntransgress the \"floor\" of substantive protection set by the IDEA.17\n\nSee generally Burlington, 736 F.2d at 788-89. On its own, however,\n\nthe federal regulation does not contain the \"significant impact\"\n\nrequirement the district desires, and we cannot put it there.    The\n\ndistrict court correctly ruled that any negative impact, regardless\n\nof degree, qualifies as an \"adverse effect\" under the relevant\n\nfederal and state regulations defining the disabilities listed in\n\n§ 1401(3)(A)(i).\n\n                                2.\n\n          Because the district court applied the right standard, we\n\nreview its determination that LI has one of the disabilities\n\nincluded in § 1401(3)(A)(i) \"for clear error on the record as a\n\nwhole.\"   Ms. M., 360 F.3d at 272.    We find none.   As the hearing\n\nofficer noted, the parties agree that LI suffers from Asperger's,\n\n\n     17\n      Maine recently passed emergency legislation, effective May\n30, 2006, defining \"child with a disability,\" in relevant part, as:\n\"[f]or children at least 3 years of age and under 20 years of age\nevaluated in accordance with [20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(a)-(c)] as measured\nby both standardized, norm-referenced diagnostic instruments and\nappropriate procedures with delays or impairments such that the\nchildren need special education . . . with at least one\" of a\nnumber of specified conditions. An Act To Improve Early Childhood\nEducation, 2006 Me. Legis. Serv. 662, sec. A-15, § 7001(1-B)(B), to\nbe codified at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 7001(1-B)(B). The\nMaine Department of Education has also proposed a regulation\nimposing a number of requirements, similar to Vermont's, on the\nadverse effect determination. See Maine Unified Special Education\nRegulation, supra, § VII.3 These versions of the Maine definitions\nare not before us, however, and we express no opinion on them.\n\n                               -33-\n\fmanifested     in    her   poor   pragmatic    language      skills   and   social\n\nunderstanding difficulties, as well as from a depressive disorder\n\nbrought on by the stress of managing these problems; indeed, the\n\ndistrict       has    never       questioned     the    opinions       of        LI's\n\nneuropsychologist and speech therapist in this regard. The parties\n\ndisagree, however, on whether these conditions have adversely\n\naffected LI's educational performance in light of her strong\n\ngrades, generally nondisruptive classroom behavior, and what the\n\ndistrict court called her \"undisputed intellectual ability.\"                     416\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 161.          In a lengthy written opinion, the district\n\ncourt tackled this issue head on, ultimately finding that, despite\n\nLI's above-average academic performance, \"many of [her] social and\n\ncommunication deficits, including her isolation, inflexibility, and\n\nself-mutilation during schooltime, are precisely in the content\n\nareas and skills that Maine mandates educationally.\"                  Id. at 163.\n\nThis finding, the district court reasoned, compelled the conclusion\n\nthat   LI's    disability     had    exerted   an    adverse    effect      on   her\n\neducational performance under the governing standard.\n\n              Much of the district's challenge to this outcome relies\n\non its contention that the district court applied the \"adversely\n\naffects educational performance\" test too leniently, which we have\n\nalready rejected.          A few of the district's supplemental points,\n\nhowever, merit additional discussion.            First, the district argues\n\nthat   the     district     court   mistakenly      gauged    LI's    educational\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\fperformance on the basis of selected \"performance indicators,\" see\n\n05-071-131 Me. Code R. §§ 1-8, that Maine has developed to measure\n\nstudents' proficiency in various \"content standard subject areas.\"\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 6209.                This was error, the\n\ndistrict asserts, because Maine does not mandate the actual use of\n\nthe performance indicators by local school districts, but has\n\nsimply instructed them to develop their own \"local assessment\n\nsystems.\"     Id. § 6202-A.      While we have our doubts about this\n\nproposition, see 05-071-127 Me. Code R. § 4.02 (requiring each\n\ndistrict to \"implement a local assessment system as the measure of\n\nstudent progress on achievement of the content standards of the\n\nsystem of Learning Results established in\" 05-071-131 Me. Code R.\n\n§§   1-8),   the   district   court   did    not   assess   LI's   educational\n\nperformance solely by reference to the performance indicators. Our\n\nreview of the record convinces us that, even if the district court\n\nerred by also using the performance indicators to measure LI's\n\neducational performance, the error did not affect the outcome of\n\nits analysis.\n\n             In particular, the district court found that LI had\n\ndifficulty     with    \"communication,\"       an    area    of     \"educational\n\nperformance\" specifically incorporated in Maine's definition of\n\nthat term for IDEA purposes.      416 F. Supp. 2d at 162 & n.8 (quoting\n\n05-071-101 Me. Code R. § 2.7). The district disputes this finding,\n\nemphasizing certain aspects of both her educators' observations and\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fthe results of the testing conducted by Popeneo and Lambke.                      The\n\ndistrict    court,    however,    focused    on   other      aspects    of      those\n\nmaterials, such as the educators' reports of LI's \"distancing\"\n\nherself from her teachers and peers and, most significantly, the\n\nexperts' express conclusions        that LI had \"poor pragmatic language\n\nskills\" and \"significant social understanding deficits.\"                     416 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 161-63.     The district court was by no means required to\n\nsecond-guess these conclusions, especially after they had been\n\nunreservedly accepted by both the districts' representatives at the\n\nPET   and   the    hearing     officer.       Though    the    record      of    the\n\nadministrative hearing might permit a different view, the district\n\ncourt did not commit clear error in finding that LI's Asperger's\n\nhas impaired her ability to communicate.\n\n            Moreover,    the    district     court's    ruling      that   LI    had\n\ndemonstrated an adverse effect on her educational performance did\n\nnot rest solely on her deficits in communication, but also on other\n\ndifficulties implicating \"the career preparation component of the\n\nMaine general curriculum.\"         Id. at 162.         The district does not\n\nquestion that \"career preparation\"--which comprises one of the\n\n\"content standards\" dictated by statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n20-A, § 6209(2)(A), rather than one of the \"performance indicators\"\n\nestablished   by     regulation--is       irrelevant    to    the   \"educational\n\nperformance\" inquiry for purposes of the IDEA.                Indeed, the IDEA\n\nexists, in part, to ensure children with disabilities receive an\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\feducation preparing them for employment. 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A).\n\nNor does the district question the lower court's specific finding,\n\nconsistent with the opinion of LI's current social worker, that a\n\nnumber of LI's symptoms have hindered her in this area.           416 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 162.    This finding was itself an adequate basis for the\n\ndistrict's court's conclusion that LI's educational performance has\n\nsuffered, even if, as the district argues, her condition has not\n\nimpacted her communication skills.\n\n           Second, the district argues that the impact of LI's\n\ncondition on her educational performance, which it sees as limited\n\nto her suicide attempt and the events immediately preceding it in\n\nthe fall of 2003, was not sustained enough to constitute an adverse\n\neffect.   Though the magistrate judge accepted this point of view,\n\nthe district court disagreed, treating the suicide attempt as\n\nsimply the darkest point in the spectrum of LI's educational\n\ndifficulties.      There is ample support for this approach in the\n\nrecord.   The signs of LI's Asperger's revealed themselves in the\n\nfourth grade, when she began experiencing difficulty with peer\n\nrelationships, and first translated into a measurable impact on her\n\nschoolwork in the fifth and sixth grades, when her grades declined.\n\nMore importantly, there is every indication that these symptoms\n\nwill persist, to one degree or another: they have not completely\n\nsubsided since LI's enrollment at TCS, and both Popeneo and LI's\n\ncurrent   social   worker   believe   that   continued   intervention   is\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\fessential to LI's long-term success.                In light of this evidence,\n\nthe district's argument that LI's suicide attempt did not adversely\n\naffect her educational performance is beside the point; as Popeneo\n\nexplained, the suicide attempt was but a manifestation of LI's\n\nAsperger's and associated depression.               The district court properly\n\ntreated these disorders, rather than the suicide attempt, as the\n\nrelevant condition for assessing the impact of LI's disability upon\n\nher educational performance.\n\n            Third, the district charges that the district court\n\n\"committed legal error\" by ruling that LI met the first prong of\n\nthe standard for IDEA eligibility without assigning her one of the\n\ndisabilities listed in § 1401(3)(A)(i).                As we have pointed out,\n\nthat   a   condition      \"adversely       affects     a    child's   educational\n\nperformance\" functions as just one of the essential elements of\n\neach of the qualifying disabilities as defined in the regulation,\n\nso a determination that a child has one of those disabilities would\n\nordinarily demand a showing as to each of those elements.                    Here,\n\nhowever, the district court specifically noted that, while the\n\nparties    were   at    odds   as   to    whether    LI's    condition   adversely\n\naffected her educational performance, they were in agreement that\n\nher condition otherwise \"fit[] within those enumerated\" by §\n\n1401(3)(A)(i).         416 F. Supp. 2d at 156.              The district has not\n\nquestioned this observation.             Because the district did not dispute\n\nbelow whether LI satisfied the additional criteria of any of the\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\frelevant disability categories, its argument that the district\n\ncourt should have chosen from among those categories is forfeit.\n\nSee, e.g., States Res. Corp. v. Arch. Team, Inc., 433 F.3d 73, 85\n\n(1st   Cir. 2005) (\"This circuit religiously follows the rule that\n\nissues not presented to the district court cannot be raised on\n\nappeal.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).        There was no error\n\nin the district court's § 1401(3)(A)(i) analysis.\n\n                                     B.\n\n           The   district    also   argues   that   the   district   court\n\nmisapplied § 1401(3)(A)(ii), which requires that a child \"need[]\n\nspecial education and related services\" as a result of his or her\n\ndisability in order to qualify for them under the IDEA.                The\n\ndistrict asserts two errors: first, the district court used the\n\nwrong definition of \"special education,\" and, second, it found that\n\nthe district had waived any argument that LI does not \"need\"\n\nspecial education based on the position it took before the PET and\n\nthe hearing officer.        We believe the district court correctly\n\ndefined \"special education\" under § 1401(3)(A)(ii).            We do not\n\ndecide, however, whether the district court properly treated the\n\n\"need\" issue as waived, because the district has not adequately\n\nexplained to us why LI does not need special education, even under\n\nits view of the proper standard for making that determination.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f                                   1.\n\n          The IDEA defines \"special education,\" in relevant part,\n\nas \"specially designed instruction, at no cost to parents, to meet\n\nthe unique needs of a child with a disability . . . .\"         20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1401(29). A federal regulation, promulgated by the Department of\n\nEducation, elaborates:\n\n     Specially designed instruction means adapting, as\n     appropriate to the needs of an eligible child . . . , the\n     content, methodology, or delivery of instruction--\n\n     (i) To address the unique needs of the child that result\n     from the child's disability; and\n\n     (ii) To ensure access of the child to the general\n     curriculum, so that the child can meet the educational\n     standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency\n     that apply to all children.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (2006).18       As the district court noted,\n\nMaine law also contains its own definition of \"special education\":\n\n\"classroom, home, hospital, institutional or other instruction;\n\neducational diagnosis and evaluation; transportation and other\n\nsupportive     assistance,   services,   activities,   or   programs,   as\n\ndefined by the commissioner [of education], required by exceptional\n\nstudents.\"19    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 7001(5) (1993).\n\n\n     18\n      Again, this regulation was amended effective October 13,\n2006, but the amendment does not affect our analysis, so we cite to\nthe current version. See note 1, supra.\n     19\n      This definition is set forth as part of a statute requiring\neach school district to, inter alia, \"[p]rovide special education\nfor each exceptional student within its jurisdiction.\" Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 7202(5) (1993).      The statute defines\n\"exceptional student\" as a person between the ages of five and\n\n                                  -40-\n\f           The   district    court     ruled   that    a    number   of     the\n\ninterventions recommended by Popeneo and Lambke, and included in\n\nthe services offered by the PET under the Rehabilitation Act, were\n\n\"special education\" within the meaning of federal law as well as\n\n\"under Maine's broader definition.\"         416 F. Supp. 2d at 166.          In\n\nchallenging this conclusion, the district principally argues that\n\nthe   district   court   misinterpreted      Maine    law   to   exceed     IDEA\n\nrequirements as to the definition of \"special education.\"             We have\n\nlittle trouble with the district court's interpretation, given the\n\nexpansive language of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 7001(5),\n\nbut, in any event, that provision was not essential to the district\n\ncourt's view that LI needs special education.           The district court\n\nalso specifically ruled that certain of the services recommended\n\nfor LI constituted \"special education\" as defined by federal law.\n\n416 F. Supp. 2d at 166.\n\n           Most significantly, the district court reasoned that\n\n\"extra instructional offerings such as social-skills and pragmatic-\n\nlanguage instruction are 'specially designed instruction' to ensure\n\n[LI's] 'access . . . to the general curriculum.'\" Id. (quoting 34\n\nC.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3)).     The district protests that its proffered\n\n\"social   pragmatics     instruction,\"      which    \"was   aimed    more     at\n\n\ntwenty who \"[r]equires special education because of an impairment\nin one or more\" specified functions. Id. § 7001(2). As we have\nobserved, supra note 17, this provision was recently amended, as\nwere §§ 7001(5) and 7202(5), but the amended versions are not\nbefore us.\n\n                                     -41-\n\fcounseling LI at how she could better interact with others\" than at\n\ntraditional \"speech services,\" qualifies as a \"related service,\"\n\nnot \"special education,\" under the IDEA.        The district has it\n\nbackwards, however.    While \"speech-language pathology services\"\n\ncomprise a category of \"related services,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(A),\n\ndirectly teaching social skills and pragmatic language to LI\n\namounts to adapting the content of the usual instruction to address\n\nher unique needs and to ensure that she meets state educational\n\nstandards, viz., those defining educational performance to include\n\n\"communication\" and requiring progress in \"career preparation.\"20\n\nSee Part III.A.2, supra.   The district court did not err in ruling\n\nthat the services recommended for LI by her neuropsychologist and\n\nspeech-language pathologist, and agreed to by the PET as part of\n\nits Rehabilitation Act plan, are \"special education.\"\n\n                                   2.\n\n          The   district   also   challenges   the   district   court's\n\nresolution of whether LI \"needs\" the special education in question.\n\nThe district court made no finding on this point, electing to \"hold\n\n\n     20\n      Contrary to the district's reading, the Second Circuit in\nJ.D. did not \"conclude\" that \"training in peer relationship skills\n. . . is more akin to a related service rather than special\neducation.\" Rather, as we have discussed, the court in J.D. ruled\nthat the student did not qualify for IDEA benefits because his\ncondition did not adversely affect his educational performance in\nthe manner required for IDEA eligibility under Vermont law. 224\nF.3d at 67-68.    The court in J.D. therefore had no occasion to\ndefine \"training in peer relationship skills,\" which the defendant\nhad offered as part of a Rehabilitation Act plan, as either special\neducation or a related service under the IDEA, and did not do so.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fthe parties to their original understandings\" that \"'[n]eed' is not\n\na contested issue.\"          416 F. Supp. 2d at 168.         In support of this\n\ncourse of action, the district court noted that \"the factual record\n\non need is poorly developed\" because \"the PET meetings proceeded on\n\nthe basis that everyone agreed that LI 'needed' and should be\n\nafforded what the experts recommended for her\" and because the\n\ndistrict gave no indication that it disputed LI's need for special\n\neducation in either the prior written notice heralding its denial\n\nof IDEA benefits or its brief filed in advance of the due process\n\nhearing.   Id. 167.      Accordingly, the district court reasoned that\n\n\"[w]hether or not waiver is the correct term,\" it had no sensible\n\noption but to conclude that LI \"'needed' the identified services\"\n\nas the parties \"all initially believed.\"              Id.\n\n             The district insists that it preserved the issue of LI's\n\nneed for special education by presenting argument and evidence on\n\nthat score at the due process hearing.             We agree with the district\n\nthat it adduced some evidence at the hearing, in the form of\n\ntestimony from McDevitt, as to LI's need for special education.\n\nSpecifically, in response to a question from counsel for the\n\ndistrict     on    whether    he    believed   that    LI    \"requires     special\n\neducation,        specialized      instruction,    take     your   pick,   to   do\n\nacceptably well in school,\" McDevitt replied, \"No, I don't.\"                    He\n\nwent on to state his view that LI was \"having a successful time\" at\n\nTCS, even without \"special services.\"             McDevitt then explained why\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fthe district's offer of Rehabilitation Act services should not be\n\nconstrued as its opinion that \"these interventions are necessary\n\ninterventions     for     [LI]    to    participate        meaningfully   in    public\n\nschool,\" i.e., because they did not constitute special education,\n\nbut   accommodations      intended       to   make    LI    and   her   parents     feel\n\ncomfortable about her return to Cornish.\n\n            We need not decide whether this presentation came too\n\nlate to raise the issue of LI's need for special education, as the\n\ndistrict court ruled, because the district does not explain why LI\n\ndoes not need special education under the standard it urges us to\n\nfollow in making that determination.                 The district contends that\n\n\"whether a child needs special education for IDEA eligibility\n\nshould depend on whether that child requires special education to\n\nbenefit   in    those     areas    of    educational        performance      that   are\n\nadversely affected,\" but does not argue that LI does not pass that\n\ntest.   Instead, the district argues, based on McDevitt's testimony\n\nand LI's performance at TCS, that she does not need special\n\neducation \"to benefit from school\" or \"to do well in school.\"\n\n            But whether a child requires special education \"to do\n\nwell in school,\" or even \"to benefit from school,\" presents a\n\ndifferent      question    from    whether      the    child      requires     special\n\neducation \"to benefit in those areas of educational performance\n\nthat are adversely affected by her disability.\" The former inquiry\n\nconsiders the effect of special education on the child's overall\n\n\n                                         -44-\n\fachievement in school, while the latter focuses on the effect of\n\nspecial education on the components of that achievement hampered by\n\nthe child's disability.        See Garda, supra, at 498-99 (positing\n\n\"which    of   the   child's   performance    areas    must   need   special\n\neducation?\" as a crucial question in developing the test for IDEA\n\neligibility under § 1401(3)(A)(ii)).         Indeed, a child may \"do well\n\nin school\" without special education, accumulating a high grade\n\npoint average, but may nevertheless perform below acceptable levels\n\nin other areas, such as behavior.            See, e.g., In re Monrovia\n\nUnified Sch. Dist., 38 Inds. with Disabilities Educ. L. Reptr. (LRP\n\nPubl'ns) 84, at 342-43 (Cal. State Educ. Agency Nov. 27, 2002)\n\n(finding student to \"require special education to address social,\n\nbehavioral, and written expression needs\" despite \"good academic\n\nwork\").     The questions of whether such a child \"needs special\n\neducation\" under a proper interpretation of § 1401(3)(A)(ii)--and\n\nhow to articulate that interpretation in the first instance--have\n\ngenerated a cacophony of different answers.           See Garda, supra, at\n\n491-507 (surveying divergent authority).\n\n            We do not attempt to compose the correct standard of\n\n\"need\"    here.   We simply note the significant variance between the\n\nstandard the district urges us to adopt and the standard it argues\n\nhas been satisfied.       McDevitt's testimony may have supported a\n\nfinding that LI does not require special education \"to do well in\n\nschool,\" had the district court not ruled that the issue had been\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fwaived. But the district does not explain how such a finding would\n\nsupport the conclusion that LI does not \"need special education\"\n\nunder the IDEA and, in fact, argues that the proper inquiry\n\nincorporates a substantially different standard, i.e., whether LI\n\n\"requires    special   education   to     benefit   in   those    areas   of\n\neducational performance that are adversely affected.\"            Conversely,\n\nthe district does not explain how the evidence received at the due\n\nprocess hearing falls short of that standard.            The district has\n\ntherefore failed to show that the district court's treatment of the\n\n\"need\" issue as settled had any effect on its ultimate conclusion\n\nthat LI qualified for IDEA benefits.         Even if the district court\n\nerred in finding the district had waived the \"need\" argument, then,\n\nthe error was harmless. See Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski, 976\n\nF.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 1992) (treating district court's mistaken\n\nruling that parents waived procedural objections to development of\n\nIEPs as harmless error where alleged procedural flaws did not\n\nmeaningfully affect substance of IEPs).\n\n            The district has not directed us to any error undermining\n\nthe district court's determination that LI meets the second prong\n\nof the standard for IDEA eligibility, 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A)(ii).21\n\n\n     21\n      In its reply brief, the district contends that, even if LI\nin fact needed the services deemed special education by the\ndistrict court, she did not need them \"by reason of\" her condition\nas required by § 1401(3)(A)(ii).     Because the district did not\nraise this argument in its principal brief (or, for that matter,\nbefore the district court), we do not consider it.       See, e.g.,\nForcier v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 469 F.3d 178, 183 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                   -46-\n\fHaving found that the district court's ruling as to the first prong\n\nalso holds up, Part III.A, supra, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision that LI is eligible for services under the IDEA.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n            In their cross-appeal, the parents challenge the adequacy\n\nof the relief given as a remedy for the district's failure to\n\nprovide LI with IDEA benefits. First, they argue that the district\n\ncourt   wrongfully   denied   them     reimbursement      for   the   costs    of\n\nenrolling LI at TCS on the ground that it is not an educationally\n\nappropriate placement.      Second, they argue that the district court\n\nshould have explicitly ordered the district to provide LI with a\n\ncompensatory education as a remedy for its denial of IDEA services,\n\nrather than leaving that matter for the PET to decide in the first\n\ninstance.    We address these contentions in turn.\n\n                                       A.\n\n            The   IDEA   authorizes    a     district   court   reviewing     the\n\noutcome of a due process hearing to \"grant such relief as the court\n\ndetermines is appropriate.\"      20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).              The\n\nSupreme Court has read this provision, as it appeared in the\n\npredecessor to the IDEA, as empowering a court \"to order school\n\nauthorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private\n\nspecial education for a child if the court ultimately determines\n\nthat such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under\n\nthe Act.\"    Burlington, 471 U.S. at 369.          In accordance with this\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fholding, parents \"are entitled to reimbursement only if a federal\n\ncourt concludes both that the public placement violated IDEA and\n\nthat the private school placement was proper under the Act.\"\n\nFlorence County, 510 U.S. at 15.\n\n            We have identified reimbursement under the IDEA as \"'a\n\nmatter of equitable relief, committed to the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court.'\" Roland M., 910 F.2d at 999 (quoting Burlington,\n\n736 F.2d at 801).          Ordinarily, we review a district court's\n\ndecision to award or withhold equitable relief for an abuse of that\n\ndiscretion.     See,   e.g.,    Valentin-Almeyda    v.    Municipality      of\n\nAguadilla, 447 F.3d 85, 104 (1st Cir. 2006).             But, as the Court\n\nmade clear in Florence County, the right to reimbursement of\n\nprivate special education expenses depends in the first instance on\n\nwhether the private school placement was \"proper.\"               We consider\n\nthis threshold inquiry, like other conclusions demanded by the\n\nIDEA, as a mixed question of fact and law.        Part III, supra.       As we\n\ndid with the question of LI's eligibility for IDEA benefits, we\n\nwill review the propriety of her enrollment at TCS for clear error\n\nbased on the parties' accession to that standard.           Id.\n\n             Mr. and Mrs. I, however, claim that the district court\n\napplied the wrong test in deciding that TCS was not a \"proper\"\n\nplacement for LI, a question we review de novo.            Id.    Again, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the parents' decision to enroll LI at TCS\n\nwas   not   \"'reasonably    calculated    to   enable   [her]     to   receive\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\feducational benefits'\" so as to entitle them to reimbursement. 416\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 172 (quoting Florence County, 510 U.S. at 11\n\n(further internal quotation marks omitted by district court)).\n\nDespite the district court's recitation of this test, the parents\n\ninsist that it actually applied what they describe as a more\n\nrestrictive standard, derived from the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n\nBerger v. Medina City Sch. Dist., 348 F.3d 513 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\nThe   parents   contend   that   this   standard,   which   disallows\n\nreimbursement for a unilateral private placement that \"does not, at\n\na minimum, provide some element of special education services in\n\nwhich the public school placement was deficient,\" id. at 523, is at\n\nodds with Florence County.22\n\n\n\n\n      22\n      It should be noted that Florence County does not hold that\na private school placement must be \"reasonably calculated to enable\nthe child to receive educational benefits\" to give rise to\nreimbursement under the IDEA; in fact, whether the private\nplacement there was proper had been \"settled\" by the time the case\narrived at the Court. 510 U.S. at 12-13. While the \"reasonably\ncalculated\" language appears in the opinion, the Court used it only\nin quoting from the lower court decision being reviewed, which in\nturn took the language from the Court's earlier opinion in Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982). Rowley itself set forth the\n\"reasonably calculated\" test as the measure of the adequacy of an\nIEP, not the propriety of a private school placement. 458 U.S. at\n206-07. Nevertheless, we have previously held, based on Florence\nCounty, that \"a private school placement must be reasonably\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits\" to\nconstitute a proper placement.     Rafferty v. Cranston Pub. Sch.\nComm., 315 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We are bound by this prior holding, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Malouf, 466 F.3d 21, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2006), which, in any\nevent, the parties do not question.\n\n                                 -49-\n\f             Like the district court, we do not detect any tension\n\nbetween this aspect of the Sixth Circuit's holding in Berger and\n\nthe principle that a private school placement is improper unless it\n\nis reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\n\nbenefit.     416 F. Supp. at 172; see also Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ.,\n\n459   F.3d   356,   364-65   (2d   Cir.   2006)   (applying   \"reasonably\n\ncalculated\" test while discussing and distinguishing, but not\n\ncriticizing, Berger); Berger, 348 F.3d at 522 (quoting \"reasonably\n\ncalculated\" test).    In Burlington, the Supreme Court reasoned that\n\nbecause \"parents who disagree with the proposed IEP are faced with\n\na choice: go along with the IEP to the detriment of their child if\n\nit turns out to be appropriate or pay for what they consider to be\n\nthe appropriate placement,\" they are entitled to reimbursement of\n\nthe expenses of that placement if it turns out they were right in\n\nchoosing it.    471 U.S. at 370.    Implicit in this reasoning is the\n\nnotion that parents rightfully decide on a private placement when\n\nit addresses, at least in part, their child's special educational\n\nrequirements, while the IEP does not.\n\n             We do not see, then, how the decision to reject public\n\neducation in favor of enrolling a child in private school can be\n\ndescribed as \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\n\neducational benefit\" if the private school does not offer at least\n\n\"some element of special education services in which the public\n\nschool placement was deficient.\"      Berger, 348 F.3d at 523.    To hold\n\n\n                                   -50-\n\fotherwise would, in essence, embrace the argument we explicitly\n\nrejected in Rafferty: that the IDEA entitles a parent, at public\n\nexpense, to \"seek any alternative school she wishes if the public\n\neducation is inadequate.\"        315 F.3d at 27.\n\n           Accordingly, the district court did not apply the wrong\n\nstandard in finding that TCS is not an appropriate private school\n\nplacement under the IDEA because it \"does not offer any of the\n\nspecial education services recommended by the experts or the PET.\"\n\n416 F. Supp. 2d at 173.        We are left, then, to review this finding\n\nfor clear error, and discern none.            Although both of the experts\n\nwho examined LI, as well as her present social worker, have\n\nstressed that LI needs direct teaching of social skills to manage\n\nthe effects of her Asperger's, it is undisputed that TCS has never\n\nprovided   her   with    this    service,     or   any    roughly   equivalent\n\nintervention.    TCS has also not supplied the cognitive behavioral\n\ntherapy recommended by Popeneo or the close supervision or one-on-\n\none tutoring offered by the PET as part of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nplan.   The district court did not clearly err in judging TCS an\n\ninappropriate private placement in the absence of any of these\n\nspecial education services.\n\n           The parents resist this conclusion on two principal\n\ngrounds.    First,      they   liken    certain    of    TCS's   distinguishing\n\nfeatures to the interventions recommended for LI and found by the\n\ndistrict court to constitute \"special education\" in assessing LI's\n\n\n                                       -51-\n\feligibility under the IDEA.        As we have recognized, a private\n\nplacement need provide only \"some element of the special education\n\nservices\" missing from the public alternative in order to qualify\n\nas reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\n\nbenefit.     Berger, 348 F.3d at 523 (emphasis added).            Nor must the\n\nplacement meet every last one of the child's special education\n\nneeds.   Frank G., 459 F.3d at 365.        But the reasonableness of the\n\nprivate placement necessarily depends on the nexus between the\n\nspecial education required and the special education provided.\n\nHere, the connection between, for example, the one-on-one tutoring\n\nrecommended for LI and the relatively small student-faculty ratio\n\nboasted by TCS was more than remote enough to support the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the choice of the private school was not\n\nreasonably    calculated   to   ensure    that   LI   received     educational\n\nbenefit--particularly in light of the fact that, as we have just\n\ndiscussed, TCS did not offer anything approaching the direct\n\nteaching of social skills unanimously endorsed by the professionals\n\nwho have tested and treated LI.\n\n             Second, the parents protest that, laboring under the\n\ntrauma of LI's suicide attempt and facing a lack of cooperation\n\nfrom   the   district,   they   acted    reasonably    by   any    measure   in\n\nunilaterally placing LI at TCS.          We sympathize with the family's\n\nemotional upheaval, and we certainly do not condone the district's\n\napparent inattention to the task of locating a tutor for LI as it\n\n\n                                   -52-\n\frepeatedly promised it would.        And we cannot doubt that TCS, where\n\nLI's sister had prospered and where LI herself had expressed\n\ninterest in attending even before the events of the fall of 2003,\n\nmust have seemed an attractive solution to an exceedingly difficult\n\nset of circumstances.         But these considerations cannot change the\n\nfact that TCS, where LI has remained for more than two full\n\nacademic years, simply does not provide the special education\n\nservices that LI's mental health professionals have prescribed.\n\nThe district court did not commit clear error when it found that\n\nTCS is not an appropriate private placement under the IDEA.23\n\n                                      B.\n\n            Finally, Mr. and Mrs. I challenge the district court's\n\nrefusal to order the district to provide LI with compensatory\n\neducation.      We     have    recognized   that,   as   another   form   of\n\n\"appropriate relief\" available under § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), a court\n\nmay require \"compensatory education\" in the form of \"further\n\nservices, in compensation for past deprivations\" of IDEA benefits.\n\nMe. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. R., 321 F.3d 9, 17-18 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    Compensatory education, like reimbursement, is a form of\n\nequitable    relief.   G ex rel. RG v. Fort Bragg Dependent Schs., 343\n\nF.3d 295,    309 (4th Cir. 2003); accord Ms. M, 360 F.3d at 273-74.\n\n\n     23\n      We do not reach, then, the district's alternative arguments\nfor affirmance: that the parents failed to provide the requisite\nnotice of their intent to enroll LI in private school at public\nexpense, and that the district offered LI a free and appropriate\npublic education in the form of its Rehabilitation Act plan.\n\n                                     -53-\n\fAccordingly,      we   review    the     district   court's      decision   on\n\ncompensatory education for abuse of discretion.            Part IV.A, supra.\n\n            The district court considered the parents' request for\n\ncompensatory education in light of the other relief granted, namely\n\nits order to the district \"to convene a PET meeting in accordance\n\nwith State and Federal law to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets\n\nher unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a\n\ndepressive disorder.\"     416 F. Supp. 2d at 168.         Noting that \"[t]he\n\nIEP necessarily will take into account the effect of the School\n\nDistrict's failure to identify and offer special education services\n\nearlier,\"   the    district     court   declined    to   order   compensatory\n\neducation on the theory that the PET could better assess \"what\n\nspecial education [LI] needs at this point           . . . .\"     Id. at 173.\n\n            This approach strikes us as sensible and, moreover, not\n\nan abuse of the district court's discretion.                As the parents\n\nacknowledge, it is not unheard of for a compensatory education\n\nclaim to be remanded to the responsible educational authority for\n\nconsideration, particularly where \"the district court does not\n\nbelieve that the record is sufficient to permit it to make the\n\nhighly nuanced judgments necessary to resolve the claim . . . .\"\n\nMr. R, 321 F.3d at 20.          The parents, in fact, do not appear to\n\nobject to such an approach here, provided we \"ensure at the very\n\nleast that guidelines governing the type, form, intensity, and\n\nduration of services are specified to assist the parties in moving\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\fforward   without   confusion   or    acrimony.\"     This    is   a    worthy\n\nobjective, to be sure, but we are not up to the task.\n\n           Like the district court, we confront an administrative\n\nrecord naturally devoid of any evidence as to the effect of the\n\ndistrict's failure to offer IDEA services to LI over the past two\n\nyears and counting, since LI's eligibility for those services was\n\nprecisely what was at issue in the due process hearing.                 As a\n\nresult, any \"guidelines\" that we might set forth to \"govern\" the\n\nresolution of the compensatory education claim would amount to an\n\nimproper advisory opinion, just as it would have been a highly\n\nspeculative exercise for the district court to attempt to resolve\n\nthe claim on its merits.      The district court ordered the district\n\nto convene a PET, in accordance with applicable law, for the\n\npurpose of formulating an IEP for LI that meets her needs, and\n\nfurther   recognized   that   this   task   would   necessarily       require\n\nresolution of the compensatory education inquiry.           We do not view\n\nthis as an abuse of discretion, and Mr. and Mrs. I have not\n\nprovided us with any authority to the contrary.\n\n                                     V.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\f",

We have previously noted that such issues can require a \"difficult and sensitive\" analysis. <i>Greenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N.,</i> 358 F.3d 150, 162 (1st Cir.2004) (not reaching the eligibility question). This case is no exception. The appellant, Maine School Administrative District No. 55 (\"the district\"), appeals the district court's determination that the appellees' daughter (\"LI\") qualifies as a \"child with a disability\" eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA as a result of her Asperger's Syndrome. The appellees (\"Mr. and Mrs. I\" or \"the parents\") cross-appeal the district court's rulings that (1) even though LI was entitled to IDEA services, her parents were not entitled to reimbursement of their expenses in unilaterally placing LI in a private school following the district's refusal to provide those services and (2) the district would not be separately ordered to provide compensatory education services to reverse the effects of that decision on LI's progress. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an overview of the statutory framework. The IDEA provides funding to each state \"to assist [it] to provide special education and related services to children with disabilities,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1411(a)(1), provided that \"[a] free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities residing in the state. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1412(a)(1)(A). In this sense, a \"free appropriate public education\" encompasses \"special education and related services,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1401(9), including \"specially designed instruction, at no cost to parents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1401(29).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To receive special education and related services under the IDEA, a child must qualify as a \"child with a disability.\" In relevant part, a \"child with a disability\" is a child</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this chapter as \"emotional disturbance\"), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1401(3)(A). The Secretary of Education has promulgated a regulation defining each of the categories of disability set forth in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). Those definitions, so far as they are relevant here, require that each of the enumerated conditions \"adversely affect[ ] a child's educational performance\" to constitute a disability. 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.8(c)(1)(i) (2006) (autism), (c)(4)(i) (emotional disturbance), (c)(9)(ii) (other health impairment).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IDEA places the burden of identifying children with disabilities upon each state. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(3)(A). In deciding whether a particular student has a disability under the IDEA, Maine uses a \"pupil evaluation team,\" or \"PET,\" 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 9.4 (2006), consisting of the student's parents, a representative from the school district, and a number of educational and other professionals. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8.6; <i>see also</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1414(d)(1)(B). Though the members of the PET attempt to achieve consensus on this issue, the school district retains the \"ultimate responsibility to ensure that a student is appropriately evaluated\" for IDEA eligibility. 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 8.11(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents of a child deemed ineligible for IDEA benefits can challenge that determination before an impartial hearing officer. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1415(b)(6), (f)(1)(A), (f)(3)(A). After the hearing, the officer issues a final administrative decision, accompanied by findings of fact. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1415(h)(4), (i)(1)(A). Any party aggrieved by the decision can then file a civil action in federal district court. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1415(i)(2)(A). Then the \"trial court must make an independent ruling based on the preponderance of the evidence, but the Act contemplates that the source of that evidence generally will be the administrative hearing record, with some supplementation at trial.\" <i>Town of Burlington v. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 736 F.2d 773, 790 (1st Cir.1984), <i>aff'd sub nom. Sch. Comm. v.

The district court, in the absence of an objection from either side, accepted the magistrate's proposed findings wholesale. In the continued absence of any challenge to these factual findings, we take the same tack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LI attended Cornish Elementary School in Cornish, Maine, until 2003. Though she excelled academically, by the fourth grade she began to experience sadness, anxiety, and difficulty with peer relationships. These problems persisted into the fifth grade, when LI sought to distance herself physically from most of her classmates. Her parents sought psychological counseling for LI and she started taking a prescription anti-depressant. Her grades also dropped from \"high honors\" to \"honors.\" As the school year progressed, however, LI became more successful at interacting with her peers and participating in class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer recess preceding sixth grade, LI asked her mother, as she had the previous summer, to allow her to be home-schooled. LI also expressed her desire to attend The Community School (\"TCS\"), a private school in South Tamworth, New Hampshire, where her older sister had matriculated. Nevertheless, LI started the 2003-2004 school year at Cornish, where Mrs. I believed her daughter would benefit, in particular, from her assigned sixth grade teacher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By mid-September, however, LI was \"slacking off\" in her academic work and regularly missing school, prompting a meeting between her teacher and Mrs. I. At this meeting, also attended by LI, Mrs. I noticed cuts or scratches on her daughter's arms; the teacher offered that LI might have inflicted those wounds on herself during her \"lengthy bathroom breaks\" from class. According to the teacher, LI was also having continued trouble relating with her peers due to a \"serious lack of awareness\" of their social and emotional states, which bordered on \"hostility.\" The teacher added that she could not \"reach\" LI, who had refused to complete assignments and shown a \"passive resistance to meeting learning goals.\" Yet the teacher considered LI \"a very bright young girl with strong language and math skills . . . capable of powerful insights in her reading and writing. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The teacher and Mrs. I came up with a \"contract\" that would have entitled LI to study more advanced topics in her areas of interest in November if she satisfactorily completed her assignments for October. As October approached, however, LI refused to sign the contract and stayed home from school on both September 30 and October 1. On October 1, following an argument with Mrs. I over one of LI's academic assignments, LI deliberately ingested excessive quantities of one her prescription drugs and two over-the-counter medications in a suicide attempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LI spent the balance of the day in the emergency room at a nearby hospital and was discharged with instructions to remain out of school for two days under high safety precautions. The hospital social worker also directed Mr. and Mrs. I to \"share with [LI] something that would change in her life, and produce a positive impact on her emotional functioning.\" Based on LI's comments to hospital personnel that she hated school, Mr. and Mrs. I told her that she would not have to return to Cornish Elementary and discussed enrollment at TCS as an alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the wake of her attempted suicide, LI met with a new counselor, who, suspecting that LI might suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, referred her to Dr. Ellen Popenoe for neuropsychological testing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mr. and Mrs. I conveyed this information, as well as the news of LI's suicide attempt, to the district's director of special services, Jim McDevitt. They added that LI would not return to Cornish Elementary \"for the time being\" and that they were looking at other options, including TCS. McDevitt explained the process for seeking reimbursement from the district for placing LI in a private school and also told the parents that the district planned to convene a pupil evaluation team for LI at the end of the month. At that meeting, the PET decided that LI should receive up to ten hours of tutoring outside of school each week pending completion of her neuropsychological testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testing, finished by early November, further suggested that LI had Asperger's Syndrome, as well as adjustment disorder with depressed mood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Popeneo, the neuropsychologist, observed that LI \"experiences significant limitations in many areas of adaptive skills\" and executive skills, \"which likely contribute[s] to her behavioral and emotional difficulties.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These behavioral difficulties, particularly LI's poor pragmatic language abilities and restricted range of social interests, supported a diagnosis of Asperger's. Popeneo recommended that LI begin seeing both a social skills coach, who would help her develop social abilities and judgment, and a therapist familiar with Asperger's, who would use a cognitive-behavioral approach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Popeneo also recommended that LI undergo a speech-language evaluation, which was completed in January 2004 by Amber Lambke, a speech-language pathologist. Lambke observed that LI suffered \"significant social understanding deficits which impact her overall emotional and social well-being.\" Like Popeneo, Lambke recommended that LI receive direct teaching of social skills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, McDevitt told Mrs. I that he would attempt to find LI a tutor in accordance with the PET's decision. Mrs. I had not heard back from him by November 10, however, so she started home-schooling LI. Despite additional prodding by Mrs. I in November and December, the district never provided a tutor as ordered by the PET, nor explained its failure to do so. While LI preferred home-schooling to attending Cornish Elementary, Mrs. I was having trouble getting LI to complete her assignments, and her counselor believed that LI should resume formal schooling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 2004, LI began attending TCS. Although she was withdrawn and isolated at the outset, over time LI developed positive relationships with some of her peers. She also thrived academically, completing assignments at the seventh&#8212; and eighth-grade level with ease. TCS, however, provided LI with neither the direct teaching of social skills nor the cognitive behavioral therapy that had been recommended as treatment for her Asperger's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the PET reconvened in early March, it accepted Popenoe's conclusion that LI suffered from both Asperger's and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The PET also agreed that LI needed social skills and pragmatic language instruction. The PET, however, could not reach consensus on whether LI qualified as a \"child with a disability\" under the IDEA. The district's representatives argued that LI's condition, whether denominated \"autism,\" \"emotional disturbance,\" or \"other health impairment,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), had not affected her academic performance \"to a marked degree\" or \"over a long period of time,\" which they deemed essential to IDEA eligibility. The district then issued a \"prior written notice,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1415(b)(3), announcing its refusal to offer special education services on the stated basis of \"no significant adverse effect on education.\" The district instead asked the PET to consider LI's eligibility for services under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its next meeting, the PET identified LI as a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the Rehabilitation Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 794(a), and recommended an array of services. These included close supervision throughout the school day; instruction in \"social pragmatics\"; access to the district's existing gifted and talented programming as well as additional programming provided through a consultant to be hired by the district; and placement in any elementary school within the district. The district also offered to supply a tutor to work with LI for three hours each day to ease her eventual transition back to the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. and Mrs. I objected to this proposal as inadequate and unduly restrictive, given LI's success in a classroom environment at TCS and her apprehension over returning to public school. They wanted LI to remain at TCS for the balance of the academic year with a view toward beginning her transition back to public school in September 2004, and notified the district that they intended to seek reimbursement under the IDEA for LI's attendance at TCS. LI completed the 2003-2004 academic year at TCS, and stayed on for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years as well. While she has done well academically, she continues to experience \"atypical\" peer relationships and spent the summer of 2004 shunning her TCS classmates in favor of solitary pursuits. LI also generally refuses to go outdoors or to eat more than a severely limited variety of foods. Her current social worker believes that, without social skills coaching, LI is unlikely to master the flexible thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and communication abilities she will need for employment in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the final PET decision, Mr. and Mrs. I requested a due process hearing to challenge the district's refusal to identify LI as a child with a disability under the IDEA. The hearing officer upheld the district's decision that LI was ineligible for IDEA services. The hearing officer noted the parties' agreement that LI had Asperger's and a depressive disorder, making her \"a troubled young woman,\" but further observed that she was not entitled to IDEA benefits unless these disabilities \"`adversely affect[ed]' [her] educational performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer recognized that both the IDEA and Maine's implementing regulations define \"educational performance\" to include more than just academic proficiency, but concluded that the IDEA does not call for services \"to address social and emotional needs when there are <i>no</i> academic needs.\" Accordingly, because LI \"completes homework independently, is well behaved in class, is successful at test taking and successfully completes projects,\" the hearing officer determined that \"neither the [IDEA] nor the Maine Special Education Regulations require a school district to provide special education services to address what is essentially a mental health issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Mr. and Mrs. I commenced an action in the district court, which, as we have noted, referred the case to a magistrate judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The magistrate judge determined that the hearing officer erred in treating LI's lack of academic needs as dispositive of her IDEA eligibility when the correct standard, he believed, is whether a disability \"manifest[s] itself in an adverse effect on the child's ability to learn.\" Nevertheless, the magistrate judge ruled that LI did not meet this standard because her condition did not adversely affect her achievements as measured by any of the criteria Maine uses to define \"educational performance.\" While the magistrate judge recognized that LI had fallen short of these benchmarks during the period in the fall of 2003 when she had repeatedly missed school and attempted suicide, he considered this episode too short-lived \"to trigger eligibility for special-education services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, rejected the magistrate judge's recommended decision, concluding that LI's \"condition did adversely affect her educational performance as Maine defines that term and that the events of the fall of 2003 cannot be isolated from [her] underlying condition.\" 416 F.Supp.2d 147, 152 (D.Me.2006). The district court determined that LI's Asperger's had exerted an adverse effect on her educational performance as measured by state criteria, most significantly in the areas of socialization and communication. The district court also disagreed with the view that any downturn in LI's educational performance was too fleeting to constitute an \"adverse effect.\" Reasoning that neither the Maine regulations defining the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) nor their federal counterparts used any restrictive modifier in conjunction with the term \"adversely affects,\" the district court ruled that \"<i>any</i> negative effect should be sufficient\" to constitute a disability under the IDEA. 416 F.Supp.2d at 160 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second prong of the IDEA's eligibility standard, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii), the district court concluded that LI needed special education and related services by reason of her disability. First, the district court found that the PET had agreed to provide LI with a number of accommodations that fit the definition of \"special education\" under both the IDEA and Maine law, including one-on-one tutoring and instruction in social pragmatics. Second, observing that \"the PET, the experts, the School District and the parents all initially believed that [LI] `needed' the identified services,\" the district court decided to \"hold the parties to their original understandings\" and therefore treated \"need\" as an uncontested issue. 416 F.Supp.2d at 167. Based on its determination that LI satisfied both elements of the IDEA eligibility test, the district court ordered the district \"to convene a PET meeting . . . to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets her unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a depressive disorder.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 168.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also considered the parents' requests for additional relief: reimbursement of their expenses in unilaterally placing LI at TCS, and compensatory education to make up for the district's failure to identify her as eligible under the IDEA. Though the district court found that Mr. and Mrs. I had given the requisite notice of the unilateral placement under Maine law, the court also ruled that their decision to enroll LI at TCS was not \"`reasonably calculated to enable [her] to receive educational benefits'\" so as to entitle them to reimbursement. 416 F.Supp.2d at 172 (quoting <i>Florence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter,</i> 510 U.S. 7, 11, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed.2d 284 (1993) (further internal quotation marks omitted by district court)). Finally, reasoning that LI's \"IEP will necessarily take into account the effect of the school district's failure to identify and offer [LI] special education services earlier,\" the district court did not separately grant the parents' request for compensatory education. <i>Id.</i> at 173.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district challenges the district court's conclusion that LI qualifies as a \"child with a disability\" under the IDEA. While we have never expressly set forth our standard of review for a district court's decision on IDEA eligibility, we have treated \"ultimate determinations in cases under the Act\" as mixed questions of fact and law. <i>Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm.,</i> 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>see also Ms. M ex rel. K.M. v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> 360 F.3d 267, 272 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Kathleen H. v. Mass. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 154 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998). We agree with the parties that whether a student qualifies as \"a child with a disability\" under &#167; 1401(3) also poses a mixed legal and factual inquiry. <i>See J.D. ex rel. J.D. v. Pawlet Sch. Dist.,</i> 224 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir.2000); <i>Yankton Sch. Dist. v. Schramm,</i> 93 F.3d 1369, 1374 (8th Cir.1996). Mixed questions generally \"fall along a degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from non-deferential plenary review for law-dominated questions, to deferential review for fact-dominated questions.\" <i>In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig.,</i> 432 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005). But we need not decide at the moment where along the continuum the question of IDEA eligibility falls, as the parties agree that we should review the question for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district maintains, however, that the district court arrived at its conclusion that LI is a \"child with a disability\" only through a series of legal errors. First, the district argues that the district court misread the terms \"adversely affects\" and \"educational performance\" as they appear in the regulatory definitions of the disabilities attributed to LI, improperly extending the breadth of &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). Second, the district claims that the district court similarly misinterpreted the term \"special education\" as it appears in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii), the second prong of the test for IDEA eligibility. The district also challenges the determination that it effectively waived the opportunity to dispute LI's need for special education. We review these rulings of law de novo. <i>Greenland,</i> 358 F.3d at 156; <i>Manchester Sch. Dist. v.

State Bd. of Educ.,</i> 874 F.2d 1036, 1044 (5th Cir.1989). Each state thus remains free to calibrate its own educational standards, provided it does not set them below the minimum level prescribed by the statute. <i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 987; <i>Burlington,</i> 736 F.2d at 788-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen, the right to special education and related services under the IDEA extends to children \"with\" one or more of a variety of disabilities, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), \"who, by reason thereof, need[ ] special education and related services.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). The IDEA does not itself define any of the qualifying disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), though the Department of Education has issued a regulation fleshing them out. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.8(c). The regulatory definitions, with one exception not relevant here, state, among other requirements, that each condition must \"adversely affect[ ] a child's educational performance.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13). In keeping with the IDEA's respect for state policy judgments, however, the regulation does not expand upon this phrase, \"leaving it to each State to give substance to these terms.\" <i>J.D.,</i> 224 F.3d at 65; <i>see also Greenland Sch. Dist. v. Amy N.,</i> No. 02-136-JD, 2003 WL 1343023, at *8 (D.N.H. Mar. 19, 2003), <i>aff'd on other grounds,</i> 358 F.3d 150 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is here that the district's argument as to the proper scope of &#167; 1401(3)(A) begins to encounter difficulty. While Maine's Department of Education has promulgated its own regulation defining the disabilities recognized under the IDEA, those definitions simply ape their federal counterparts, including the requirement that a disability \"adversely affect[ ] the student's educational performance.\" 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167;&#167; 3.2-3.14 (2006). The regulation, like its federal cousin, also does not further elaborate on this phrase, although Maine has adopted its own definition of \"educational performance\" for IDEA purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"educational performance\" includes academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc.), non-academic areas (daily life activities, mobility, etc.), extracurricular activities, progress in meeting goals established for the general curriculum, and performance on State-wide and local assessments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.7. Despite this expansive notion of educational performance, and in the absence of any regulatory guidance as to the term \"adversely affects,\" the district asks us to hold that a child meets the first criterion of IDEA eligibility in Maine \"only if the student's condition imposes a significant negative impact on the child's educational performance . . . limited to those areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit, in accordance with law.\" We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, Maine does not look only at \"areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit\" when determining whether a child has a disability under the IDEA. That much is clear from the regulatory definition of \"educational performance\" itself, which counts \"performance on state-wide and local assessments\" as just one of a number of different indicators embraced by the concept. As the district points out, the term \"general curriculum,\" which also appears in the definition of educational performance, has a narrower meaning under the regulations, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the school administrative unit's local curriculum for grades K-12 which incorporate the content standards and performance indicators of the Learning Results.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 2.11. Based on this definition, the district argues that \"educational performance\" encompasses only those \"performance indicators\" measured as part of the local curriculum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Even if the district's reading of \"general curriculum\" is correct, however, the fact remains that a student's progress in that regard comprises but one of the aspects of \"educational performance\" as defined by the regulation. More far-ranging measurements, such as \"academic areas\" and \"non-academic areas,\" are also included.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the magistrate judge and the district court observed, Maine's broad definition of \"educational performance\" squares with the broad purpose behind the IDEA: \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free and appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, <i>employment,</i> and <i>independent living.</i>\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A) (emphases added). We have likewise held that the IDEA entitles qualifying children to services that \"target `<i>all</i> of [their] special needs,' whether they be academic, physical, emotional, or social.\" <i>Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> 998 F.2d 1083, 1089 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>Burlington,</i> 736 F.2d at 788). It is true that we have also stated that IDEA services need not address \"problems truly `distinct' from learning problems.\" <i>Gonzalez v. P.R. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 254 F.3d 350, 352 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Rome Sch. Comm. v. Mrs. B.,</i> 247 F.3d 29, 33 n.3 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that, in determining adequacy of IEP for emotionally disturbed boy, \"[t]he question is whether [his] behavioral disturbances interfered with the child's ability to learn\"). But it does not follow, as the hearing officer wrongly concluded, that a child without \"academic needs\" is per se ineligible for IDEA benefits, especially when the state has conditioned eligibility on a standard that explicitly takes \"non-academic areas\" into account. <i>See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 287 F.3d 138, 150 (2d Cir.2002) (\"IDEA's coverage is not limited to students with `learning disabilities'. . . .\"). In other words, as the district admits, \"educational performance in Maine is more than just academics.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Maine's broad notion of \"educational performance\" as the standard of IDEA eligibility, we see no basis for restricting that standard to \"areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit.\" Indeed, \"there is nothing in IDEA or its legislative history that supports the conclusion that . . . `educational performance' is limited only to performance that is graded.\" <i>See</i> Robert A. Garda, Jr., <i>Untangling Eligibility Requirements Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,</i> 69 Mo. L.Rev. 441, 471 (2003). To be sure, some states have adopted more circumscribed criteria for identifying children with disabilities under the IDEA, requiring, for example, that a student perform poorly in a specific area of \"basic skills.\" <i>See J.D.,</i> 224 F.3d at 66 (discussing prior version of 22-000-06 Vt. Code Reg. &#167;&#167; 2362(a)(2), (f) (2006)). Maine, however, has chosen not to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We therefore decline the district's invitation to reformulate state educational policy by narrowing the indicia of educational performance used as the test for IDEA eligibility under Maine law. The district court properly articulated this standard as \"whether [LI's] condition adversely affected her performance in any of the educational areas Maine has identified.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 159 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also argues that the district court misconstrued the \"adversely affects\" component of the test to include disabilities with \"any adverse effect on educational performance, however slight. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 160. The correct formulation, the district urges, requires \"some significant impact on educational performance.\" In rejecting this proposal, the district court reasoned that the phrase \"adversely affects,\" as it appears in the relevant regulations, \"has no qualifier such as `substantial,' `significant,' or `marked,'\" and declined to infer such a limitation \"from Maine's regulatory silence.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree with this interpretation of the \"adversely affects\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district marshals a number of arguments in support of its contrary position, they all sound a common theme: that an unlimited definition of \"adversely affects\" will qualify every child with one of the listed disabilities&#8212;no matter how minor&#8212;for IDEA benefits. This contention, however, overlooks the structure of the IDEA's eligibility standard, which requires not only that a child have one of the listed conditions, &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), but also that, \"by reason thereof,\" the child \"needs special education and related services,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). So a finding that a child meets the first criterion because his or her disability adversely affects educational performance&#8212;to whatever degree&#8212;does not itself entitle the child to special education and related services under the IDEA. <i>See</i> Mark C. Weber, <i>Special Education Law and Litigation Treatise</i> &#167; 2.2(1), at 2:4 (2d ed.2002); Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 490-91. The child must also need special education and related services by reason of the disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, an adverse effect on educational performance, standing alone, does not even satisfy the first prong of the eligibility test. The child's condition must also possess the additional characteristics required by the regulatory definitions of each of the disabilities enumerated in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13); 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167;&#167; 3.2-3.14. For example, to meet the first part of the eligibility standard on the basis of autism, a child must have \"[1] a developmental disability [2] significantly affecting [3] verbal and [4] nonverbal communication and [5] social interaction, [6] generally evident before age three, [7] that adversely affects a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.8(c)(1)(i); 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 3.2. Thus, the \"adversely affects educational performance\" requirement serves as but one of a list of factors that must be present for a child's condition to qualify as a disability under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i)&#8212;and, to receive IDEA benefits, the child must also need special education and related services by reason of the disability under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). The district court's interpretation of \"adversely affects,\" then, is unlikely to loose the torrent of IDEA claims forecast by the district and its amici.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district's specific arguments fare no better. The district contends that &#167; 1401(3)(a)(i) fails to put the states on notice that, as a condition of accepting federal money under the IDEA, they are required to provide benefits to children whose conditions have merely an \"adverse effect\" on their educational performance. It is true that \"when Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal funds\" pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, \"the conditions must be set out unambiguously\" so that each state can intelligently decide whether to take the money and its accompanying obligations. <i>Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 2455, 2459, 165 L.Ed.2d 526 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on this principle, the Supreme Court has held that whether the IDEA imposes a particular obligation on the states depends, at the outset, on whether the IDEA \"furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue. . . .\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal place to look for such notice, of course, is the text of the IDEA itself. <i>Id.</i> The district asserts that the language of &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) fails to clarify that a state's duty to provide IDEA benefits extends to children with disabilities having only an adverse effect on educational performance. In fact, the district argues, the statute&#8212;through its use of the term \"disability\"&#8212;limits that duty to children whose conditions \"significantly impact educational performance.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To properly understand \"disability\" as it appears in the IDEA, we do not, as the district implores, resort to dictionary definitions of the word \"disable,\" but to &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), which functions as the first part of the statutory definition of \"child with a disability.\" Section 1401(3)(A)(i), as the district court observed, does not include the qualifying language urged upon us by the district, but simply defines \"child with a disability\" as a child \"with\" one of a number of specific conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also directs us to the more restrictive meaning of the term \"disability\" under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Because the IDEA contains its own definition of the term, however, its appearance in other acts of Congress is of little moment. <i>See United States v. Meade,</i> 175 F.3d 215, 220-21 (1st Cir.1999). Putting aside the difference between the legislative goals of the IDEA and these other acts, then, the IDEA simply defines \"disability\" differently than they do. <i>Compare</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A) <i>with</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 705(9)(B) <i>and</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\"). This clear disparity in text puts the district's suggestion that we look to those other acts in construing the term \"disability\" here on par with comparing \"plums and pomegranates.\" <i>Meade,</i> 175 F.3d at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the express definition of \"disability\" set forth in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), we need look no further to conclude that the statute sufficiently articulates the first prong of the standard for IDEA eligibility and, in so doing, adequately informs the states of the extent of their obligations. <i>Murphy,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2463. The district and its amici nevertheless argue that this standard, as interpreted by the district court, flies in the face of congressional admonishments against identifying too many students as \"children with disabilities\" under the IDEA. It is true that, in amending the Act in 1997, Congress voiced concern about \"over identifying children as disabled when they may not be truly disabled . . . particularly in urban schools with high proportions of minority students . . . .\" H.R.Rep.

To remedy this problem, Congress changed the formula for calculating the funds due each state under the IDEA from one \"based on the number of children with disabilities to a formula based on census and poverty. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, though, Congress thought this shift&#8212;rather than any alteration to the eligibility criteria&#8212;sufficient to address the over-identification problem. <i>Id.</i> at 89, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 87. Congress specifically stated, in fact, that the change to the funding formula \"should in no way be construed to modify the obligation of educational agencies to identify and serve students with disabilities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85. Congress eschewed any change to the eligibility standard not only in 1997, but also in 2004, when it amended the IDEA again. Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-446, &#167; 602(3)(A), 118 Stat. 2647, 2652, <i>codified at</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A). The Department of Education similarly declined, by and large, to tinker with its definitions of the &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) disabilities when it issued regulations in response to the amended Act. 71 Fed.Reg. 46,540, 46,549-46,551 (Aug. 14, 2006). Thus, although the district and its amici argue that an over-identification problem persists, we cannot tighten the standard for IDEA eligibility when Congress itself has chosen not to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history, then, only strengthens our conviction that &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), as construed by the district court, does not offend the Spending Clause by springing hidden liabilities upon participating states. Furthermore, as the district acknowledges, states deciding whether to enter into the IDEA bargain also have the benefit of the federal regulation defining the disabilities set forth in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). Those definitions, again, specifically require that each disability (save one) \"adversely affect[ ] a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13). They do not contain the limiting language urged by the district, <i>i.e.,</i> \"significantly impacts educational performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the district's argument that such a limitation lurks in the term \"adversely,\" which the district equates with \"calamitously\" or \"perniciously\" on the authority of an unabridged dictionary. We think it considerably more likely that federal regulators used \"adverse\" in its ordinary sense, namely \"against.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 58 (8th ed.2004); <i>see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged)</i> 31 (1993) (giving primary definition of \"adverse\" as \"acting against or in a contrary direction\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In this way, the regulation sensibly demands that a disability cannot qualify a child for IDEA benefits unless it has a negative effect on educational performance; no effect, or a positive one, will not do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The regulation does not, however, put any quantitative limit, \"significant\" or otherwise, on the disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's regulation, cribbed from 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.8, also requires no particular degree of impact on educational performance. 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167;&#167; 3.2-3.14. This fact alone distinguishes this case from the decisions of other courts, cited by the district, which derived a higher standard from state law. <i>See J.D.,</i> 224 F.3d at 66-67; <i>Gregory M. ex rel. Ernest M. v. State Bd. of Educ.,</i> 891 F.Supp. 695, 702 (D.Conn.1995); <i>Doe ex rel. Doe v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 753 F.Supp. 65, 70 &amp; n. 9 (D.Conn. 1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> In <i>J.D.,</i> for example, the Second Circuit considered a Vermont regulation that defined \"adverse effect of the disability on educational performance\" to require a determination \"that the student is functioning significantly below expected age or grade norms, in one or more of the basic skills.\" 224 F.3d at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted). This provision further required that the \"determination of adverse effect, usually defined as 1.0 standard deviation or its equivalent, shall be documented and supported by two or more measures of school performance,\" which were themselves specified by the regulation. <i>Id.</i> Based on this standard, the Second Circuit concluded that the child did not qualify for IDEA benefits because he was \"unable to identify at least two school performance measures that point to an adverse effect,\" despite his emotional-behavioral disability. <i>Id.</i> at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit reached its decision in <i>J.D.,</i> then, by applying the highly specific definition of \"adversely affects educational performance\" set forth in state law, not by imposing its own gloss on that language, as the district invites us to do here. For the reasons we have stated, we decline that invitation. States wishing to put meat on the bones of the \"adversely affects\" standard are free to do so&#8212;provided, of course, they do not transgress the \"floor\" of substantive protection set by the IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>See generally Burlington,</i> 736 F.2d at 788-89. On its own, however, the federal regulation does not contain the \"significant impact\" requirement the district desires, and we cannot put it there. The district court correctly ruled that any negative impact, regardless of degree, qualifies as an \"adverse effect\" under the relevant federal and state regulations defining the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court applied the right standard, we review its determination that LI has one of the disabilities included in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) \"for clear error on the record as a whole.\" <i>Ms. M.,</i> 360 F.3d at 272. We find none. As the hearing officer noted, the parties agree that LI suffers from Asperger's, manifested in her poor pragmatic language skills and social understanding difficulties, as well as from a depressive disorder brought on by the stress of managing these problems; indeed, the district has never questioned the opinions of LI's neuropsychologist and speech therapist in this regard. The parties disagree, however, on whether these conditions have adversely affected LI's educational performance in light of her strong grades, generally nondisruptive classroom behavior, and what the district court called her \"undisputed intellectual ability.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 161. In a lengthy written opinion, the district court tackled this issue head on, ultimately finding that, despite LI's above-average academic performance, \"many of [her] social and communication deficits, including her isolation, inflexibility, and self-mutilation during schooltime, are precisely in the content areas and skills that Maine mandates educationally.\" <i>Id.</i> at 163. This finding, the district court reasoned, compelled the conclusion that LI's disability had exerted an adverse effect on her educational performance under the governing standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the district's challenge to this outcome relies on its contention that the district court applied the \"adversely affects educational performance\" test too leniently, which we have already rejected. A few of the district's supplemental points, however, merit additional discussion. First, the district argues that the district court mistakenly gauged LI's educational performance on the basis of selected \"performance indicators,\" <i>see</i> 05-071-131 Me. Code R. &#167;&#167; 1-8, that Maine has developed to measure students' proficiency in various \"content standard subject areas.\" Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 6209. This was error, the district asserts, because Maine does not mandate the actual use of the performance indicators by local school districts, but has simply instructed them to develop their own \"local assessment systems.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 6202-A. While we have our doubts about this proposition, <i>see</i> 05-071-127 Me.Code R. &#167; 4.02 (requiring each district to \"implement a local assessment system as the measure of student progress on achievement of the content standards of the system of Learning Results established in\" 05-071-131 Me.Code R. &#167;&#167; 1-8), the district court did not assess LI's educational performance solely by reference to the performance indicators. Our review of the record convinces us that, even if the district court erred by also using the performance indicators to measure LI's educational performance, the error did not affect the outcome of its analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, the district court found that LI had difficulty with \"communication,\" an area of \"educational performance\" specifically incorporated in Maine's definition of that term for IDEA purposes. 416 F.Supp.2d at 162 &amp; n. 8 (quoting 05-071-101 Me.Code R. &#167; 2.7). The district disputes this finding, emphasizing certain aspects of both her educators' observations and the results of the testing conducted by Popeneo and Lambke. The district court, however, focused on other aspects of those materials, such as the educators' reports of LI's \"distancing\" herself from her teachers and peers and, most significantly, the experts' express conclusions that LI had \"poor pragmatic language skills\" and \"significant social understanding deficits.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 161-63. The district court was by no means required to second-guess these conclusions, especially after they had been unreservedly accepted by both the districts' representatives at the PET and the hearing officer. Though the record of the administrative hearing might permit a different view, the district court did not commit clear error in finding that LI's Asperger's has impaired her ability to communicate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's ruling that LI had demonstrated an adverse effect on her educational performance did not rest solely on her deficits in communication, but also on other difficulties implicating \"the career preparation component of the Maine general curriculum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 162. The district does not question that \"career preparation\"&#8212;which comprises one of the \"content standards\" dictated by statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 6209(2)(A), rather than one of the \"performance indicators\" established by regulation&#8212;is irrelevant to the \"educational performance\" inquiry for purposes of the IDEA. Indeed, the IDEA exists, in part, to ensure children with disabilities receive an education preparing them for employment. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A). Nor does the district question the lower court's specific finding, consistent with the opinion of LI's current social worker, that a number of LI's symptoms have hindered her in this area. 416 F.Supp.2d at 162. This finding was itself an adequate basis for the district's court's conclusion that LI's educational performance has suffered, even if, as the district argues, her condition has not impacted her communication skills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district argues that the impact of LI's condition on her educational performance, which it sees as limited to her suicide attempt and the events immediately preceding it in the fall of 2003, was not sustained enough to constitute an adverse effect. Though the magistrate judge accepted this point of view, the district court disagreed, treating the suicide attempt as simply the darkest point in the spectrum of LI's educational difficulties. There is ample support for this approach in the record. The signs of LI's Asperger's revealed themselves in the fourth grade, when she began experiencing difficulty with peer relationships, and first translated into a measurable impact on her schoolwork in the fifth and sixth grades, when her grades declined. More importantly, there is every indication that these symptoms will persist, to one degree or another: they have not completely subsided since LI's enrollment at TCS, and both Popeneo and LI's current social worker believe that continued intervention is essential to LI's long-term success. In light of this evidence, the district's argument that LI's suicide attempt did not adversely affect her educational performance is beside the point; as Popeneo explained, the suicide attempt was but a manifestation of LI's Asperger's and associated depression. The district court properly treated these disorders, rather than the suicide attempt, as the relevant condition for assessing the impact of LI's disability upon her educational performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district charges that the district court \"committed legal error\" by ruling that LI met the first prong of the standard for IDEA eligibility without assigning her one of the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). As we have pointed out, that a condition \"adversely affects a child's educational performance\" functions as just one of the essential elements of each of the qualifying disabilities as defined in the regulation, so a determination that a child has one of those disabilities would ordinarily demand a showing as to each of those elements. Here, however, the district court specifically noted that, while the parties were at odds as to whether LI's condition adversely affected her educational performance, they were in agreement that her condition otherwise \"fit[ ] within those enumerated\" by &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). 416 F.Supp.2d at 156. The district has not questioned this observation. Because the district did not dispute below whether LI satisfied the additional criteria of any of the relevant disability categories, its argument that the district court should have chosen from among those categories is forfeit. <i>See, e.g., States Res. Corp. v. Arch. Team, Inc.,</i> 433 F.3d 73, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (\"This circuit religiously follows the rule that issues not presented to the district court cannot be raised on appeal.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). There was no error in the district court's &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also argues that the district court misapplied &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii), which requires that a child \"need[ ] special education and related services\" as a result of his or her disability in order to qualify for them under the IDEA. The district asserts two errors: first, the district court used the wrong definition of \"special education,\" and, second, it found that the district had waived any argument that LI does not \"need\" special education based on the position it took before the PET and the hearing officer. We believe the district court correctly defined \"special education\" under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). We do not decide, however, whether the district court properly treated the \"need\" issue as waived, because the district has not adequately explained to us why LI does not need special education, even under its view of the proper standard for making that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IDEA defines \"special education,\" in relevant part, as \"specially designed instruction, at no cost to parents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(29). A federal regulation, promulgated by the Department of Education, elaborates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specially designed instruction means adapting, as appropriate to the needs of an eligible child . . . , the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) To address the unique needs of the child that result from the child's disability; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) To ensure access of the child to the general curriculum, so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.39(b)(3) (2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> As the district court noted, Maine law also contains its own definition of \"special education\": \"classroom, home, hospital, institutional or other instruction; educational diagnosis and evaluation; transportation and other supportive assistance, services, activities, or programs, as defined by the commissioner [of education], required by exceptional students.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Me.Rev.Stat.

In challenging this conclusion, the district principally argues that the district court misinterpreted Maine law to exceed IDEA requirements as to the definition of \"special education.\" We have little trouble with the district court's interpretation, given the expansive language of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 7001(5), but, in any event, that provision was not essential to the district court's view that LI needs special education. The district court also specifically ruled that certain of the services recommended for LI constituted \"special education\" as defined by <i>federal</i> law. 416 F.Supp.2d at 166.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most significantly, the district court reasoned that \"extra instructional offerings such as social-skills and pragmatic-language instruction are `specially designed instruction' to ensure [LI's] `access . . . to the general curriculum.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.39(b)(3)). The district protests that its proffered \"social pragmatics instruction,\" which \"was aimed more at counseling LI at how she could better interact with others\" than at traditional \"speech services,\" qualifies as a \"related service,\" not \"special education,\" under the IDEA. The district has it backwards, however. While \"speech-language pathology services\" comprise a category of \"related services,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(26)(A), directly teaching social skills and pragmatic language to LI amounts to adapting the content of the usual instruction to address her unique needs and to ensure that she meets state educational standards, <i>viz.,</i> those defining educational performance to include \"communication\" and requiring progress in \"career preparation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> <i>See</i> Part III.A.2, <i>supra.</i> The district court did not err in ruling that the services recommended for LI by her neuropsychologist and speech-language pathologist, and agreed to by the PET as part of its Rehabilitation Act plan, are \"special education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also challenges the district court's resolution of whether LI \"needs\" the special education in question. The district court made no finding on this point, electing to \"hold the parties to their original understandings\" that \"`[n]eed' is not a contested issue.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 168. In support of this course of action, the district court noted that \"the factual record on need is poorly developed\" because \"the PET meetings proceeded on the basis that everyone agreed that LI `needed' and should be afforded what the experts recommended for her\" and because the district gave no indication that it disputed LI's need for special education in either the prior written notice heralding its denial of IDEA benefits or its brief filed in advance of the due process hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 167. Accordingly, the district court reasoned that \"[w]hether or not waiver is the correct term,\" it had no sensible option but to conclude that LI \"`needed' the identified services\" as the parties \"all initially believed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district insists that it preserved the issue of LI's need for special education by presenting argument and evidence on that score at the due process hearing. We agree with the district that it adduced some evidence at the hearing, in the form of testimony from McDevitt, as to LI's need for special education. Specifically, in response to a question from counsel for the district on whether he believed that LI \"requires special education, specialized instruction, take your pick, to do acceptably well in school,\" McDevitt replied, \"No, I don't.\" He went on to state his view that LI was \"having a successful time\" at TCS, even without \"special services.\" McDevitt then explained why the district's offer of Rehabilitation Act services should not be construed as its opinion that \"these interventions are necessary interventions for [LI] to participate meaningfully in public school,\" <i>i.e.,</i> because they did not constitute special education, but accommodations intended to make LI and her parents feel comfortable about her return to Cornish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether this presentation came too late to raise the issue of LI's need for special education, as the district court ruled, because the district does not explain why LI does not need special education under the standard it urges us to follow in making that determination. The district contends that \"whether a child needs special education for IDEA eligibility should depend on whether that child requires special education to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected,\" but does not argue that LI does not pass that test. Instead, the district argues, based on McDevitt's testimony and LI's performance at TCS, that she does not need special education \"to benefit from school\" or \"to do well in school.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whether a child requires special education \"to do well in school,\" or even \"to benefit from school,\" presents a different question from whether the child requires special education \"to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected by her disability.\" The former inquiry considers the effect of special education on the child's overall achievement in school, while the latter focuses on the effect of special education on the components of that achievement hampered by the child's disability. <i>See</i> Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 498-99 (positing \"which of the child's performance areas must need special education?\" as a crucial question in developing the test for IDEA eligibility under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii)). Indeed, a child may \"do well in school\" without special education, accumulating a high grade point average, but may nevertheless perform below acceptable levels in other areas, such as behavior. <i>See, e.g., In re Monrovia Unified Sch. Dist.,</i> 38 Inds. with Disabilities Educ. L. Reptr. (LRP Publ'ns) 84, at 342-43 (Cal. State Educ. Agency Nov. 27, 2002) (finding student to \"require special education to address social, behavioral, and written expression needs\" despite \"good academic work\"). The questions of whether such a child \"needs special education\" under a proper interpretation of &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii)&#8212;and how to articulate that interpretation in the first instance&#8212; have generated a cacophony of different answers. <i>See</i> Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 491-507 (surveying divergent authority).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not attempt to compose the correct standard of \"need\" here. We simply note the significant variance between the standard the district urges us to adopt and the standard it argues has been satisfied. McDevitt's testimony may have supported a finding that LI does not require special education \"to do well in school,\" had the district court not ruled that the issue had been waived. But the district does not explain how such a finding would support the conclusion that LI does not \"need special education\" under the IDEA and, in fact, argues that the proper inquiry incorporates a substantially different standard, <i>i.e.,</i> whether LI \"requires special education to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected.\" Conversely, the district does not explain how the evidence received at the due process hearing falls short of that standard. The district has therefore failed to show that the district court's treatment of the \"need\" issue as settled had any effect on its ultimate conclusion that LI qualified for IDEA benefits. Even if the district court erred in finding the district had waived the \"need\" argument, then, the error was harmless. <i>See Hampton Sch. Dist. v. Dobrowolski,</i> 976 F.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir.1992) (treating district court's mistaken ruling that parents waived procedural objections to development of IEPs as harmless error where alleged procedural flaws did not meaningfully affect substance of IEPs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district has not directed us to any error undermining the district court's determination that LI meets the second prong of the standard for IDEA eligibility, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Having found that the district court's ruling as to the first prong also holds up, Part III.A, <i>supra,</i> we affirm the district court's decision that LI is eligible for services under the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their cross-appeal, the parents challenge the adequacy of the relief given as a remedy for the district's failure to provide LI with IDEA benefits.

In accordance with this holding, parents \"are entitled to reimbursement <i>only</i> if a federal court concludes both that the public placement violated IDEA and that the private school placement was proper under the Act.\" <i>Florence County,</i> 510 U.S. at 15, 114 S.Ct. 361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have identified reimbursement under the IDEA as \"`a matter of equitable relief, committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.'\" <i>Roland M.,</i> 910 F.2d at 999 (quoting <i>Burlington,</i> 736 F.2d at 801). Ordinarily, we review a district court's decision to award or withhold equitable relief for an abuse of that discretion. <i>See, e.g., Valentin-Almeyda v. Municipality of Aguadilla,</i> 447 F.3d 85, 104 (1st Cir.2006). But, as the Court made clear in <i>Florence County,</i> the right to reimbursement of private special education expenses depends in the first instance on whether the private school placement was \"proper.\" We consider this threshold inquiry, like other conclusions demanded by the IDEA, as a mixed question of fact and law. Part III, <i>supra.</i> As we did with the question of LI's eligibility for IDEA benefits, we will review the propriety of her enrollment at TCS for clear error based on the parties' accession to that standard. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. and Mrs. I, however, claim that the district court applied the wrong test in deciding that TCS was not a \"proper\" placement for LI, a question we review de novo. <i>Id.</i> Again, the district court ruled that the parents' decision to enroll LI at TCS was not \"`reasonably calculated to enable [her] to receive educational benefits'\" so as to entitle them to reimbursement. 416 F.Supp.2d at 172 (quoting <i>Florence County,</i> 510 U.S. at 11, 114 S.Ct. 361 (further internal quotation marks omitted by district court)). Despite the district court's recitation of this test, the parents insist that it actually applied what they describe as a more restrictive standard, derived from the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>Berger v. Medina City Sch. Dist.,</i> 348 F.3d 513 (6th Cir.2003). The parents contend that this standard, which disallows reimbursement for a unilateral private placement that \"does not, at a minimum, provide some element of special education services in which the public school placement was deficient,\" <i>id.</i> at 523, is at odds with <i>Florence County.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we do not detect any tension between this aspect of the Sixth Circuit's holding in <i>Berger</i> and the principle that a private school placement is improper unless it is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit. 416 F.Supp. at 172; <i>see also Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 459 F.3d 356, 364-65 (2d Cir.2006) (applying \"reasonably calculated\" test while discussing and distinguishing, but not criticizing, <i>Berger</i>); <i>Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 522 (quoting \"reasonably calculated\" test). In <i>Burlington,</i> the Supreme Court reasoned that because \"parents who disagree with the proposed IEP are faced with a choice: go along with the IEP to the detriment of their child if it turns out to be appropriate or pay for what they consider to be the appropriate placement,\" they are entitled to reimbursement of the expenses of that placement if it turns out they were right in choosing it. 471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996. Implicit in this reasoning is the notion that parents rightfully decide on a private placement when it addresses, at least in part, their child's special educational requirements, while the IEP does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not see, then, how the decision to reject public education in favor of enrolling a child in private school can be described as \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit\" if the private school does not offer at least \"some element of special education services in which the public school placement was deficient.\" <i>Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523. To hold otherwise would, in essence, embrace the argument we explicitly rejected in <i>Rafferty:</i> that the IDEA entitles a parent, at public expense, to \"seek any alternative school she wishes if the public education is inadequate.\" 315 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court did not apply the wrong standard in finding that TCS is not an appropriate private school placement under the IDEA because it \"does not offer any of the special education services recommended by the experts or the PET.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 173. We are left, then, to review this finding for clear error, and discern none. Although both of the experts who examined LI, as well as her present social worker, have stressed that LI needs direct teaching of social skills to manage the effects of her Asperger's, it is undisputed that TCS has never provided her with this service, or any roughly equivalent intervention. TCS has also not supplied the cognitive behavioral therapy recommended by Popeneo or the close supervision or one-on-one tutoring offered by the PET as part of the Rehabilitation Act plan. The district court did not clearly err in judging TCS an inappropriate private placement in the absence of any of these special education services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents resist this conclusion on two principal grounds. First, they liken certain of TCS's distinguishing features to the interventions recommended for LI and found by the district court to constitute \"special education\" in assessing LI's eligibility under the IDEA. As we have recognized, a private placement need provide only \"<i>some element</i> of the special education services\" missing from the public alternative in order to qualify as reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit. <i>Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523 (emphasis added). Nor must the placement meet every last one of the child's special education needs. <i>Frank G.,</i> 459 F.3d at 365. But the reasonableness of the private placement necessarily depends on the nexus between the special education required and the special education provided. Here, the connection between, for example, the one-on-one tutoring recommended for LI and the relatively small student-faculty ratio boasted by TCS was more than remote enough to support the district court's conclusion that the choice of the private school was not reasonably calculated to ensure that LI received educational benefit&#8212;particularly in light of the fact that, as we have just discussed, TCS did not offer anything approaching the direct teaching of social skills unanimously endorsed by the professionals who have tested and treated LI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the parents protest that, laboring under the trauma of LI's suicide attempt and facing a lack of cooperation from the district, they acted reasonably by any measure in unilaterally placing LI at TCS. We sympathize with the family's emotional upheaval, and we certainly do not condone the district's apparent inattention to the task of locating a tutor for LI as it repeatedly promised it would. And we cannot doubt that TCS, where LI's sister had prospered and where LI herself had expressed interest in attending even before the events of the fall of 2003, must have seemed an attractive solution to an exceedingly difficult set of circumstances. But these considerations cannot change the fact that TCS, where LI has remained for more than two full academic years, simply does not provide the special education services that LI's mental health professionals have prescribed. The district court did not commit clear error when it found that TCS is not an appropriate private placement under the IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mr. and Mrs. I challenge the district court's refusal to order the district to provide LI with compensatory education. We have recognized that, as another form of \"appropriate relief\" available under &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), a court may require \"compensatory education\" in the form of \"further services, in compensation for past deprivations\" of IDEA benefits. <i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9, 17-18 (1st Cir.2003). Compensatory education, like reimbursement, is a form of equitable relief. <i>G ex rel. RG v.</i> <i>Fort Bragg Dependent Schs.,</i> 343 F.3d 295, 309 (4th Cir.2003); <i>accord Ms. M,</i> 360 F.3d at 273-74. Accordingly, we review the district court's decision on compensatory education for abuse of discretion. Part IV.A, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered the parents' request for compensatory education in light of the other relief granted, namely its order to the district \"to convene a PET meeting in accordance with State and Federal law to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets her unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a depressive disorder.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 168. Noting that \"[t]he IEP necessarily will take into account the effect of the School District's failure to identify and offer special education services earlier,\" the district court declined to order compensatory education on the theory that the PET could better assess \"what special education [LI] needs at this point. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 173.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach strikes us as sensible and, moreover, not an abuse of the district court's discretion. As the parents acknowledge, it is not unheard of for a compensatory education claim to be remanded to the responsible educational authority for consideration, particularly where \"the district court does not believe that the record is sufficient to permit it to make the highly nuanced judgments necessary to resolve the claim....\" <i>Mr. R,</i> 321 F.3d at 20. The parents, in fact, do not appear to object to such an approach here, provided we \"ensure at the very least that guidelines governing the type, form, intensity, and duration of services are specified to assist the parties in moving forward without confusion or acrimony.\" This is a worthy objective, to be sure, but we are not up to the task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we confront an administrative record naturally devoid of any evidence as to the effect of the district's failure to offer IDEA services to LI over the past two years and counting, since LI's eligibility for those services was precisely what was at issue in the due process hearing. As a result, any \"guidelines\" that we might set forth to \"govern\" the resolution of the compensatory education claim would amount to an improper advisory opinion, just as it would have been a highly speculative exercise for the district court to attempt to resolve the claim on its merits. The district court ordered the district to convene a PET, in accordance with applicable law, for the purpose of formulating an IEP for LI that meets her needs, and further recognized that this task would necessarily require resolution of the compensatory education inquiry. We do not view this as an abuse of discretion, and Mr. and Mrs. I have not provided us with any authority to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although this regulation was amended during the pendency of this appeal, none of the amendments affects our analysis<i>See generally</i> Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities, 71 Fed.

This case is no exception. The appellant, Maine School Administrative District No. 55 (\"the district\"), appeals the district court's determination that the appellees' daughter (\"LI\") qualifies as a \"child with a disability\" eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA as a result of her Asperger's Syndrome. The appellees (\"Mr. and Mrs. I\" or \"the parents\") cross-appeal the district court's rulings that (1) even though LI was entitled to IDEA services, her parents were not entitled to reimbursement of their expenses in unilaterally placing LI in a private school following the district's refusal to provide those services and (2) the district would not be separately ordered to provide compensatory education services to reverse the effects of that decision on LI's progress.

The district court, in the absence of an objection from either side, accepted the magistrate's proposed findings wholesale. In the continued absence of any challenge to these factual findings, we take the same tack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LI attended Cornish Elementary School in Cornish, Maine, until 2003. Though she excelled academically, by the fourth grade she began to experience sadness, anxiety, and difficulty with peer relationships. These problems persisted into the fifth grade, when LI sought to distance herself physically from most of her classmates. Her parents sought psychological counseling for LI and she started taking a prescription anti-depressant. Her grades also dropped from \"high honors\" to \"honors.\" As the school year progressed, however, LI became more successful at interacting with her peers and participating in class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer recess preceding sixth grade, LI asked her mother, as she had the previous summer, to allow her to be home-schooled. LI also expressed her desire to attend The Community School (\"TCS\"), a private school in South Tamworth, New Hampshire, where her older sister had matriculated. Nevertheless, LI started the 2003-2004 school year at Cornish, where Mrs. I believed her daughter would benefit, in particular, from her assigned sixth grade teacher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By mid-September, however, LI was \"slacking off\" in her academic work and regularly missing school, prompting a meeting between her teacher and Mrs. I. At this meeting, also attended by LI, Mrs. I noticed cuts or scratches on her daughter's arms; the teacher offered that LI might have inflicted those wounds on herself during her \"lengthy bathroom breaks\" from class. According to the teacher, LI was also having continued trouble relating with her peers due to a \"serious lack of awareness\" of their social and emotional states, which bordered on \"hostility.\" The teacher added that she could not \"reach\" LI, who had refused to complete assignments and shown a \"passive resistance to meeting learning goals.\" Yet the teacher considered LI \"a very bright young girl with strong language and math skills . . . capable of powerful insights in her reading and writing. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The teacher and Mrs. I came up with a \"contract\" that would have entitled LI to study more advanced topics in her areas of interest in November if she satisfactorily completed her assignments for October. As October approached, however, LI refused to sign the contract and stayed home from school on both September 30 and October 1. On October 1, following an argument with Mrs. I over one of LI's academic assignments, LI deliberately ingested excessive quantities of one her prescription drugs and two over-the-counter medications in a suicide attempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LI spent the balance of the day in the emergency room at a nearby hospital and was discharged with instructions to remain out of school for two days under high safety precautions. The hospital social worker also directed Mr. and Mrs. I to \"share with [LI] something that would change in her life, and produce a positive impact on her emotional functioning.\" Based on LI's comments to hospital personnel that she hated school, Mr. and Mrs. I told her that she would not have to return to Cornish Elementary and discussed enrollment at TCS as an alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the wake of her attempted suicide, LI met with a new counselor, who, suspecting that LI might suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, referred her to Dr. Ellen Popenoe for neuropsychological testing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mr. and Mrs. I conveyed this information, as well as the news of LI's suicide attempt, to the district's director of special services, Jim McDevitt. They added that LI would not return to Cornish Elementary \"for the time being\" and that they were looking at other options, including TCS. McDevitt explained the process for seeking reimbursement from the district for placing LI in a private school and also told the parents that the district planned to convene a pupil evaluation team for LI at the end of the month. At that meeting, the PET decided that LI should receive up to ten hours of tutoring outside of school each week pending completion of her neuropsychological testing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testing, finished by early November, further suggested that LI had Asperger's Syndrome, as well as adjustment disorder with depressed mood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Popeneo, the neuropsychologist, observed that LI \"experiences significant limitations in many areas of adaptive skills\" and executive skills, \"which likely contribute[s] to her behavioral and emotional difficulties.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These behavioral difficulties, particularly LI's poor pragmatic language abilities and restricted range of social interests, supported a diagnosis of Asperger's. Popeneo recommended that LI begin seeing both a social skills coach, who would help her develop social abilities and judgment, and a therapist familiar with Asperger's, who would use a cognitive-behavioral approach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Popeneo also recommended that LI undergo a speech-language evaluation, which was completed in January 2004 by Amber Lambke, a speech-language pathologist. Lambke observed that LI suffered \"significant social understanding deficits which impact her overall emotional and social well-being.\" Like Popeneo, Lambke recommended that LI receive direct teaching of social skills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, McDevitt told Mrs. I that he would attempt to find LI a tutor in accordance with the PET's decision. Mrs. I had not heard back from him by November 10, however, so she started home-schooling LI. Despite additional prodding by Mrs. I in November and December, the district never provided a tutor as ordered by the PET, nor explained its failure to do so. While LI preferred home-schooling to attending Cornish Elementary, Mrs. I was having trouble getting LI to complete her assignments, and her counselor believed that LI should resume formal schooling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 2004, LI began attending TCS. Although she was withdrawn and isolated at the outset, over time LI developed positive relationships with some of her peers. She also thrived academically, completing assignments at the seventh&#8212; and eighth-grade level with ease. TCS, however, provided LI with neither the direct teaching of social skills nor the cognitive behavioral therapy that had been recommended as treatment for her Asperger's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the PET reconvened in early March, it accepted Popenoe's conclusion that LI suffered from both Asperger's and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The PET also agreed that LI needed social skills and pragmatic language instruction. The PET, however, could not reach consensus on whether LI qualified as a \"child with a disability\" under the IDEA. The district's representatives argued that LI's condition, whether denominated \"autism,\" \"emotional disturbance,\" or \"other health impairment,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), had not affected her academic performance \"to a marked degree\" or \"over a long period of time,\" which they deemed essential to IDEA eligibility. The district then issued a \"prior written notice,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1415(b)(3), announcing its refusal to offer special education services on the stated basis of \"no significant adverse effect on education.\" The district instead asked the PET to consider LI's eligibility for services under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its next meeting, the PET identified LI as a \"qualified individual with a disability\" under the Rehabilitation Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 794(a), and recommended an array of services. These included close supervision throughout the school day; instruction in \"social pragmatics\"; access to the district's existing gifted and talented programming as well as additional programming provided through a consultant to be hired by the district; and placement in any elementary school within the district. The district also offered to supply a tutor to work with LI for three hours each day to ease her eventual transition back to the classroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. and Mrs. I objected to this proposal as inadequate and unduly restrictive, given LI's success in a classroom environment at TCS and her apprehension over returning to public school. They wanted LI to remain at TCS for the balance of the academic year with a view toward beginning her transition back to public school in September 2004, and notified the district that they intended to seek reimbursement under the IDEA for LI's attendance at TCS. LI completed the 2003-2004 academic year at TCS, and stayed on for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years as well. While she has done well academically, she continues to experience \"atypical\" peer relationships and spent the summer of 2004 shunning her TCS classmates in favor of solitary pursuits. LI also generally refuses to go outdoors or to eat more than a severely limited variety of foods. Her current social worker believes that, without social skills coaching, LI is unlikely to master the flexible thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and communication abilities she will need for employment in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the final PET decision, Mr. and Mrs. I requested a due process hearing to challenge the district's refusal to identify LI as a child with a disability under the IDEA. The hearing officer upheld the district's decision that LI was ineligible for IDEA services. The hearing officer noted the parties' agreement that LI had Asperger's and a depressive disorder, making her \"a troubled young woman,\" but further observed that she was not entitled to IDEA benefits unless these disabilities \"`adversely affect[ed]' [her] educational performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearing officer recognized that both the IDEA and Maine's implementing regulations define \"educational performance\" to include more than just academic proficiency, but concluded that the IDEA does not call for services \"to address social and emotional needs when there are <i>no</i> academic needs.\" Accordingly, because LI \"completes homework independently, is well behaved in class, is successful at test taking and successfully completes projects,\" the hearing officer determined that \"neither the [IDEA] nor the Maine Special Education Regulations require a school district to provide special education services to address what is essentially a mental health issue.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Mr. and Mrs. I commenced an action in the district court, which, as we have noted, referred the case to a magistrate judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The magistrate judge determined that the hearing officer erred in treating LI's lack of academic needs as dispositive of her IDEA eligibility when the correct standard, he believed, is whether a disability \"manifest[s] itself in an adverse effect on the child's ability to learn.\" Nevertheless, the magistrate judge ruled that LI did not meet this standard because her condition did not adversely affect her achievements as measured by any of the criteria Maine uses to define \"educational performance.\" While the magistrate judge recognized that LI had fallen short of these benchmarks during the period in the fall of 2003 when she had repeatedly missed school and attempted suicide, he considered this episode too short-lived \"to trigger eligibility for special-education services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, rejected the magistrate judge's recommended decision, concluding that LI's \"condition did adversely affect her educational performance as Maine defines that term and that the events of the fall of 2003 cannot be isolated from [her] underlying condition.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477664/mrs-v-maine-school-administrative-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 152 (D.Me.2006). The district court determined that LI's Asperger's had exerted an adverse effect on her educational performance as measured by state criteria, most significantly in the areas of socialization and communication. The district court also disagreed with the view that any downturn in LI's educational performance was too fleeting to constitute an \"adverse effect.\" Reasoning that neither the Maine regulations defining the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) nor their federal counterparts used any restrictive modifier in conjunction with the term \"adversely affects,\" the district court ruled that \"<i>any</i> negative effect should be sufficient\" to constitute a disability under the IDEA. 416 F.Supp.2d at 160 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second prong of the IDEA's eligibility standard, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii), the district court concluded that LI needed special education and related services by reason of her disability. First, the district court found that the PET had agreed to provide LI with a number of accommodations that fit the definition of \"special education\" under both the IDEA and Maine law, including one-on-one tutoring and instruction in social pragmatics. Second, observing that \"the PET, the experts, the School District and the parents all initially believed that [LI] `needed' the identified services,\" the district court decided to \"hold the parties to their original understandings\" and therefore treated \"need\" as an uncontested issue. 416 F.Supp.2d at 167. Based on its determination that LI satisfied both elements of the IDEA eligibility test, the district court ordered the district \"to convene a PET meeting . . . to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets her unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a depressive disorder.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 168.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also considered the parents' requests for additional relief: reimbursement of their expenses in unilaterally placing LI at TCS, and compensatory education to make up for the district's failure to identify her as eligible under the IDEA. Though the district court found that Mr. and Mrs. I had given the requisite notice of the unilateral placement under Maine law, the court also ruled that their decision to enroll LI at TCS was not \"`reasonably calculated to enable [her] to receive educational benefits'\" so as to entitle them to reimbursement. 416 F.Supp.2d at 172 (quoting <i>Florence County Sch.

While Maine's Department of Education has promulgated its own regulation defining the disabilities recognized under the IDEA, those definitions simply ape their federal counterparts, including the requirement that a disability \"adversely affect[ ] the student's educational performance.\" 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167;&#167; 3.2-3.14 (2006). The regulation, like its federal cousin, also does not further elaborate on this phrase, although Maine has adopted its own definition of \"educational performance\" for IDEA purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"educational performance\" includes academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc.), non-academic areas (daily life activities, mobility, etc.), extracurricular activities, progress in meeting goals established for the general curriculum, and performance on State-wide and local assessments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.7. Despite this expansive notion of educational performance, and in the absence of any regulatory guidance as to the term \"adversely affects,\" the district asks us to hold that a child meets the first criterion of IDEA eligibility in Maine \"only if the student's condition imposes a significant negative impact on the child's educational performance . . . limited to those areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit, in accordance with law.\" We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, Maine does not look only at \"areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit\" when determining whether a child has a disability under the IDEA. That much is clear from the regulatory definition of \"educational performance\" itself, which counts \"performance on state-wide and local assessments\" as just one of a number of different indicators embraced by the concept. As the district points out, the term \"general curriculum,\" which also appears in the definition of educational performance, has a narrower meaning under the regulations, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the school administrative unit's local curriculum for grades K-12 which incorporate the content standards and performance indicators of the Learning Results.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 2.11. Based on this definition, the district argues that \"educational performance\" encompasses only those \"performance indicators\" measured as part of the local curriculum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Even if the district's reading of \"general curriculum\" is correct, however, the fact remains that a student's progress in that regard comprises but one of the aspects of \"educational performance\" as defined by the regulation. More far-ranging measurements, such as \"academic areas\" and \"non-academic areas,\" are also included.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the magistrate judge and the district court observed, Maine's broad definition of \"educational performance\" squares with the broad purpose behind the IDEA: \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free and appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, <i>employment,</i> and <i>independent living.</i>\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A) (emphases added). We have likewise held that the IDEA entitles qualifying children to services that \"target `<i>all</i> of [their] special needs,' whether they be academic, physical, emotional, or social.\" <i>Lenn v.

But it does not follow, as the hearing officer wrongly concluded, that a child without \"academic needs\" is per se ineligible for IDEA benefits, especially when the state has conditioned eligibility on a standard that explicitly takes \"non-academic areas\" into account. <i>See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777316\"><a href=\"/opinion/777316/frances-weixel-and-rose-weixel-v-the-board-of-education-of-the-city-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 150 (2d Cir.2002) (\"IDEA's coverage is not limited to students with `learning disabilities'. . . .\"). In other words, as the district admits, \"educational performance in Maine is more than just academics.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Maine's broad notion of \"educational performance\" as the standard of IDEA eligibility, we see no basis for restricting that standard to \"areas of performance actually being measured and assessed by the local unit.\" Indeed, \"there is nothing in IDEA or its legislative history that supports the conclusion that . . . `educational performance' is limited only to performance that is graded.\" <i>See</i> Robert A. Garda, Jr., <i>Untangling Eligibility Requirements Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,</i> 69 Mo. L.Rev. 441, 471 (2003). To be sure, some states have adopted more circumscribed criteria for identifying children with disabilities under the IDEA, requiring, for example, that a student perform poorly in a specific area of \"basic skills.\" <i>See J.D.,</i> 224 F.3d at 66 (discussing prior version of 22-000-06 Vt. Code Reg. &#167;&#167; 2362(a)(2), (f) (2006)). Maine, however, has chosen not to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We therefore decline the district's invitation to reformulate state educational policy by narrowing the indicia of educational performance used as the test for IDEA eligibility under Maine law. The district court properly articulated this standard as \"whether [LI's] condition adversely affected her performance in any of the educational areas Maine has identified.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 159 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also argues that the district court misconstrued the \"adversely affects\" component of the test to include disabilities with \"any adverse effect on educational performance, however slight. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 160. The correct formulation, the district urges, requires \"some significant impact on educational performance.\" In rejecting this proposal, the district court reasoned that the phrase \"adversely affects,\" as it appears in the relevant regulations, \"has no qualifier such as `substantial,' `significant,' or `marked,'\" and declined to infer such a limitation \"from Maine's regulatory silence.\" <i>Id.</i> We agree with this interpretation of the \"adversely affects\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district marshals a number of arguments in support of its contrary position, they all sound a common theme: that an unlimited definition of \"adversely affects\" will qualify every child with one of the listed disabilities&#8212;no matter how minor&#8212;for IDEA benefits. This contention, however, overlooks the structure of the IDEA's eligibility standard, which requires not only that a child have one of the listed conditions, &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), but also that, \"by reason thereof,\" the child \"needs special education and related services,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). So a finding that a child meets the first criterion because his or her disability adversely affects educational performance&#8212;to whatever degree&#8212;does not itself entitle the child to special education and related services under the IDEA. <i>See</i> Mark C. Weber, <i>Special Education Law and Litigation Treatise</i> &#167; 2.2(1), at 2:4 (2d ed.2002); Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 490-91. The child must also need special education and related services by reason of the disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, an adverse effect on educational performance, standing alone, does not even satisfy the first prong of the eligibility test. The child's condition must also possess the additional characteristics required by the regulatory definitions of each of the disabilities enumerated in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13); 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167;&#167; 3.2-3.14. For example, to meet the first part of the eligibility standard on the basis of autism, a child must have \"[1] a developmental disability [2] significantly affecting [3] verbal and [4] nonverbal communication and [5] social interaction, [6] generally evident before age three, [7] that adversely affects a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.8(c)(1)(i); 05-071-101 Me.Code. R. &#167; 3.2. Thus, the \"adversely affects educational performance\" requirement serves as but one of a list of factors that must be present for a child's condition to qualify as a disability under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i)&#8212;and, to receive IDEA benefits, the child must also need special education and related services by reason of the disability under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). The district court's interpretation of \"adversely affects,\" then, is unlikely to loose the torrent of IDEA claims forecast by the district and its amici.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district's specific arguments fare no better. The district contends that &#167; 1401(3)(a)(i) fails to put the states on notice that, as a condition of accepting federal money under the IDEA, they are required to provide benefits to children whose conditions have merely an \"adverse effect\" on their educational performance. It is true that \"when Congress attaches conditions to a State's acceptance of federal funds\" pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, \"the conditions must be set out unambiguously\" so that each state can intelligently decide whether to take the money and its accompanying obligations. <i>Arlington Cent.

Based on this principle, the Supreme Court has held that whether the IDEA imposes a particular obligation on the states depends, at the outset, on whether the IDEA \"furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue. . . .\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal place to look for such notice, of course, is the text of the IDEA itself. <i>Id.</i> The district asserts that the language of &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) fails to clarify that a state's duty to provide IDEA benefits extends to children with disabilities having only an adverse effect on educational performance. In fact, the district argues, the statute&#8212;through its use of the term \"disability\"&#8212;limits that duty to children whose conditions \"significantly impact educational performance.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To properly understand \"disability\" as it appears in the IDEA, we do not, as the district implores, resort to dictionary definitions of the word \"disable,\" but to &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), which functions as the first part of the statutory definition of \"child with a disability.\" Section 1401(3)(A)(i), as the district court observed, does not include the qualifying language urged upon us by the district, but simply defines \"child with a disability\" as a child \"with\" one of a number of specific conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also directs us to the more restrictive meaning of the term \"disability\" under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Because the IDEA contains its own definition of the term, however, its appearance in other acts of Congress is of little moment. <i>See United States v. Meade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198461\"><a href=\"/opinion/198461/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 220-21 (1st Cir.1999). Putting aside the difference between the legislative goals of the IDEA and these other acts, then, the IDEA simply defines \"disability\" differently than they do. <i>Compare</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A) <i>with</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 705(9)(B) <i>and</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\"). This clear disparity in text puts the district's suggestion that we look to those other acts in construing the term \"disability\" here on par with comparing \"plums and pomegranates.\" <i>Meade,</i> 175 F.3d at 221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the express definition of \"disability\" set forth in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), we need look no further to conclude that the statute sufficiently articulates the first prong of the standard for IDEA eligibility and, in so doing, adequately informs the states of the extent of their obligations. <i>Murphy,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 2463. The district and its amici nevertheless argue that this standard, as interpreted by the district court, flies in the face of congressional admonishments against identifying too many students as \"children with disabilities\" under the IDEA. It is true that, in amending the Act in 1997, Congress voiced concern about \"over identifying children as disabled when they may not be truly disabled . . . particularly in urban schools with high proportions of minority students . . . .\" H.R.Rep. No. 105-95, at 89 (1997), <i>reprinted in</i> 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 86. To remedy this problem, Congress changed the formula for calculating the funds due each state under the IDEA from one \"based on the number of children with disabilities to a formula based on census and poverty. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, though, Congress thought this shift&#8212;rather than any alteration to the eligibility criteria&#8212;sufficient to address the over-identification problem. <i>Id.</i> at 89, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 87. Congress specifically stated, in fact, that the change to the funding formula \"should in no way be construed to modify the obligation of educational agencies to identify and serve students with disabilities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 85. Congress eschewed any change to the eligibility standard not only in 1997, but also in 2004, when it amended the IDEA again. Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-446, &#167; 602(3)(A), 118 Stat. 2647, 2652, <i>codified at</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(3)(A). The Department of Education similarly declined, by and large, to tinker with its definitions of the &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) disabilities when it issued regulations in response to the amended Act. 71 Fed.Reg. 46,540, 46,549-46,551 (Aug. 14, 2006). Thus, although the district and its amici argue that an over-identification problem persists, we cannot tighten the standard for IDEA eligibility when Congress itself has chosen not to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history, then, only strengthens our conviction that &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i), as construed by the district court, does not offend the Spending Clause by springing hidden liabilities upon participating states. Furthermore, as the district acknowledges, states deciding whether to enter into the IDEA bargain also have the benefit of the federal regulation defining the disabilities set forth in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). Those definitions, again, specifically require that each disability (save one) \"adversely affect[ ] a child's educational performance.\" 34 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 300.8(c)(1)-(c)(13). They do not contain the limiting language urged by the district, <i>i.e.,</i> \"significantly impacts educational performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the district's argument that such a limitation lurks in the term \"adversely,\" which the district equates with \"calamitously\" or \"perniciously\" on the authority of an unabridged dictionary. We think it considerably more likely that federal regulators used \"adverse\" in its ordinary sense, namely \"against.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 58 (8th ed.2004); <i>see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged)</i> 31 (1993) (giving primary definition of \"adverse\" as \"acting against or in a contrary direction\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> In this way, the regulation sensibly demands that a disability cannot qualify a child for IDEA benefits unless it has a negative effect on educational performance; no effect, or a positive one, will not do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The regulation does not, however, put any quantitative limit, \"significant\" or otherwise, on the disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's regulation, cribbed from 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.8, also requires no particular degree of impact on educational performance. 05-071-101 Me.Code.

This provision further required that the \"determination of adverse effect, usually defined as 1.0 standard deviation or its equivalent, shall be documented and supported by two or more measures of school performance,\" which were themselves specified by the regulation. <i>Id.</i> Based on this standard, the Second Circuit concluded that the child did not qualify for IDEA benefits because he was \"unable to identify at least two school performance measures that point to an adverse effect,\" despite his emotional-behavioral disability. <i>Id.</i> at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit reached its decision in <i>J.D.,</i> then, by applying the highly specific definition of \"adversely affects educational performance\" set forth in state law, not by imposing its own gloss on that language, as the district invites us to do here. For the reasons we have stated, we decline that invitation. States wishing to put meat on the bones of the \"adversely affects\" standard are free to do so&#8212;provided, of course, they do not transgress the \"floor\" of substantive protection set by the IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> <i>See generally Burlington,</i> 736 F.2d at 788-89. On its own, however, the federal regulation does not contain the \"significant impact\" requirement the district desires, and we cannot put it there. The district court correctly ruled that any negative impact, regardless of degree, qualifies as an \"adverse effect\" under the relevant federal and state regulations defining the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court applied the right standard, we review its determination that LI has one of the disabilities included in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) \"for clear error on the record as a whole.\" <i>Ms. M.,</i> 360 F.3d at 272. We find none. As the hearing officer noted, the parties agree that LI suffers from Asperger's, manifested in her poor pragmatic language skills and social understanding difficulties, as well as from a depressive disorder brought on by the stress of managing these problems; indeed, the district has never questioned the opinions of LI's neuropsychologist and speech therapist in this regard. The parties disagree, however, on whether these conditions have adversely affected LI's educational performance in light of her strong grades, generally nondisruptive classroom behavior, and what the district court called her \"undisputed intellectual ability.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 161. In a lengthy written opinion, the district court tackled this issue head on, ultimately finding that, despite LI's above-average academic performance, \"many of [her] social and communication deficits, including her isolation, inflexibility, and self-mutilation during schooltime, are precisely in the content areas and skills that Maine mandates educationally.\" <i>Id.</i> at 163. This finding, the district court reasoned, compelled the conclusion that LI's disability had exerted an adverse effect on her educational performance under the governing standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the district's challenge to this outcome relies on its contention that the district court applied the \"adversely affects educational performance\" test too leniently, which we have already rejected. A few of the district's supplemental points, however, merit additional discussion. First, the district argues that the district court mistakenly gauged LI's educational performance on the basis of selected \"performance indicators,\" <i>see</i> 05-071-131 Me. Code R. &#167;&#167; 1-8, that Maine has developed to measure students' proficiency in various \"content standard subject areas.\" Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 6209. This was error, the district asserts, because Maine does not mandate the actual use of the performance indicators by local school districts, but has simply instructed them to develop their own \"local assessment systems.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 6202-A. While we have our doubts about this proposition, <i>see</i> 05-071-127 Me.Code R. &#167; 4.02 (requiring each district to \"implement a local assessment system as the measure of student progress on achievement of the content standards of the system of Learning Results established in\" 05-071-131 Me.Code R. &#167;&#167; 1-8), the district court did not assess LI's educational performance solely by reference to the performance indicators. Our review of the record convinces us that, even if the district court erred by also using the performance indicators to measure LI's educational performance, the error did not affect the outcome of its analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In particular, the district court found that LI had difficulty with \"communication,\" an area of \"educational performance\" specifically incorporated in Maine's definition of that term for IDEA purposes. 416 F.Supp.2d at 162 &amp; n. 8 (quoting 05-071-101 Me.Code R. &#167; 2.7). The district disputes this finding, emphasizing certain aspects of both her educators' observations and the results of the testing conducted by Popeneo and Lambke. The district court, however, focused on other aspects of those materials, such as the educators' reports of LI's \"distancing\" herself from her teachers and peers and, most significantly, the experts' express conclusions that LI had \"poor pragmatic language skills\" and \"significant social understanding deficits.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 161-63. The district court was by no means required to second-guess these conclusions, especially after they had been unreservedly accepted by both the districts' representatives at the PET and the hearing officer. Though the record of the administrative hearing might permit a different view, the district court did not commit clear error in finding that LI's Asperger's has impaired her ability to communicate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's ruling that LI had demonstrated an adverse effect on her educational performance did not rest solely on her deficits in communication, but also on other difficulties implicating \"the career preparation component of the Maine general curriculum.\" <i>Id.</i> at 162. The district does not question that \"career preparation\"&#8212;which comprises one of the \"content standards\" dictated by statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 6209(2)(A), rather than one of the \"performance indicators\" established by regulation&#8212;is irrelevant to the \"educational performance\" inquiry for purposes of the IDEA. Indeed, the IDEA exists, in part, to ensure children with disabilities receive an education preparing them for employment. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(d)(1)(A). Nor does the district question the lower court's specific finding, consistent with the opinion of LI's current social worker, that a number of LI's symptoms have hindered her in this area. 416 F.Supp.2d at 162. This finding was itself an adequate basis for the district's court's conclusion that LI's educational performance has suffered, even if, as the district argues, her condition has not impacted her communication skills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district argues that the impact of LI's condition on her educational performance, which it sees as limited to her suicide attempt and the events immediately preceding it in the fall of 2003, was not sustained enough to constitute an adverse effect. Though the magistrate judge accepted this point of view, the district court disagreed, treating the suicide attempt as simply the darkest point in the spectrum of LI's educational difficulties. There is ample support for this approach in the record. The signs of LI's Asperger's revealed themselves in the fourth grade, when she began experiencing difficulty with peer relationships, and first translated into a measurable impact on her schoolwork in the fifth and sixth grades, when her grades declined. More importantly, there is every indication that these symptoms will persist, to one degree or another: they have not completely subsided since LI's enrollment at TCS, and both Popeneo and LI's current social worker believe that continued intervention is essential to LI's long-term success. In light of this evidence, the district's argument that LI's suicide attempt did not adversely affect her educational performance is beside the point; as Popeneo explained, the suicide attempt was but a manifestation of LI's Asperger's and associated depression. The district court properly treated these disorders, rather than the suicide attempt, as the relevant condition for assessing the impact of LI's disability upon her educational performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district charges that the district court \"committed legal error\" by ruling that LI met the first prong of the standard for IDEA eligibility without assigning her one of the disabilities listed in &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). As we have pointed out, that a condition \"adversely affects a child's educational performance\" functions as just one of the essential elements of each of the qualifying disabilities as defined in the regulation, so a determination that a child has one of those disabilities would ordinarily demand a showing as to each of those elements. Here, however, the district court specifically noted that, while the parties were at odds as to whether LI's condition adversely affected her educational performance, they were in agreement that her condition otherwise \"fit[ ] within those enumerated\" by &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i). 416 F.Supp.2d at 156. The district has not questioned this observation. Because the district did not dispute below whether LI satisfied the additional criteria of any of the relevant disability categories, its argument that the district court should have chosen from among those categories is forfeit. <i>See, e.g., States Res. Corp. v. Arch. Team, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201972\"><a href=\"/opinion/201972/states-resources-v-architectural-team/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (\"This circuit religiously follows the rule that issues not presented to the district court cannot be raised on appeal.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). There was no error in the district court's &#167; 1401(3)(A)(i) analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also argues that the district court misapplied &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii), which requires that a child \"need[ ] special education and related services\" as a result of his or her disability in order to qualify for them under the IDEA. The district asserts two errors: first, the district court used the wrong definition of \"special education,\" and, second, it found that the district had waived any argument that LI does not \"need\" special education based on the position it took before the PET and the hearing officer. We believe the district court correctly defined \"special education\" under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii). We do not decide, however, whether the district court properly treated the \"need\" issue as waived, because the district has not adequately explained to us why LI does not need special education, even under its view of the proper standard for making that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IDEA defines \"special education,\" in relevant part, as \"specially designed instruction, at no cost to parents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(29). A federal regulation, promulgated by the Department of Education, elaborates:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specially designed instruction means adapting, as appropriate to the needs of an eligible child . . . , the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) To address the unique needs of the child that result from the child's disability; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) To ensure access of the child to the general curriculum, so that the child can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to all children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.39(b)(3) (2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> As the district court noted, Maine law also contains its own definition of \"special education\": \"classroom, home, hospital, institutional or other instruction; educational diagnosis and evaluation; transportation and other supportive assistance, services, activities, or programs, as defined by the commissioner [of education], required by exceptional students.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 7001(5) (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that a number of the interventions recommended by Popeneo and Lambke, and included in the services offered by the PET under the Rehabilitation Act, were \"special education\" within the meaning of federal law as well as \"under Maine's broader definition.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 166. In challenging this conclusion, the district principally argues that the district court misinterpreted Maine law to exceed IDEA requirements as to the definition of \"special education.\" We have little trouble with the district court's interpretation, given the expansive language of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 7001(5), but, in any event, that provision was not essential to the district court's view that LI needs special education. The district court also specifically ruled that certain of the services recommended for LI constituted \"special education\" as defined by <i>federal</i> law. 416 F.Supp.2d at 166.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most significantly, the district court reasoned that \"extra instructional offerings such as social-skills and pragmatic-language instruction are `specially designed instruction' to ensure [LI's] `access . . . to the general curriculum.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.39(b)(3)). The district protests that its proffered \"social pragmatics instruction,\" which \"was aimed more at counseling LI at how she could better interact with others\" than at traditional \"speech services,\" qualifies as a \"related service,\" not \"special education,\" under the IDEA. The district has it backwards, however. While \"speech-language pathology services\" comprise a category of \"related services,\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401(26)(A), directly teaching social skills and pragmatic language to LI amounts to adapting the content of the usual instruction to address her unique needs and to ensure that she meets state educational standards, <i>viz.,</i> those defining educational performance to include \"communication\" and requiring progress in \"career preparation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> <i>See</i> Part III.A.2, <i>supra.</i> The district court did not err in ruling that the services recommended for LI by her neuropsychologist and speech-language pathologist, and agreed to by the PET as part of its Rehabilitation Act plan, are \"special education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district also challenges the district court's resolution of whether LI \"needs\" the special education in question. The district court made no finding on this point, electing to \"hold the parties to their original understandings\" that \"`[n]eed' is not a contested issue.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 168. In support of this course of action, the district court noted that \"the factual record on need is poorly developed\" because \"the PET meetings proceeded on the basis that everyone agreed that LI `needed' and should be afforded what the experts recommended for her\" and because the district gave no indication that it disputed LI's need for special education in either the prior written notice heralding its denial of IDEA benefits or its brief filed in advance of the due process hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 167. Accordingly, the district court reasoned that \"[w]hether or not waiver is the correct term,\" it had no sensible option but to conclude that LI \"`needed' the identified services\" as the parties \"all initially believed.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district insists that it preserved the issue of LI's need for special education by presenting argument and evidence on that score at the due process hearing. We agree with the district that it adduced some evidence at the hearing, in the form of testimony from McDevitt, as to LI's need for special education. Specifically, in response to a question from counsel for the district on whether he believed that LI \"requires special education, specialized instruction, take your pick, to do acceptably well in school,\" McDevitt replied, \"No, I don't.\" He went on to state his view that LI was \"having a successful time\" at TCS, even without \"special services.\" McDevitt then explained why the district's offer of Rehabilitation Act services should not be construed as its opinion that \"these interventions are necessary interventions for [LI] to participate meaningfully in public school,\" <i>i.e.,</i> because they did not constitute special education, but accommodations intended to make LI and her parents feel comfortable about her return to Cornish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether this presentation came too late to raise the issue of LI's need for special education, as the district court ruled, because the district does not explain why LI does not need special education under the standard it urges us to follow in making that determination. The district contends that \"whether a child needs special education for IDEA eligibility should depend on whether that child requires special education to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected,\" but does not argue that LI does not pass that test. Instead, the district argues, based on McDevitt's testimony and LI's performance at TCS, that she does not need special education \"to benefit from school\" or \"to do well in school.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But whether a child requires special education \"to do well in school,\" or even \"to benefit from school,\" presents a different question from whether the child requires special education \"to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected by her disability.\" The former inquiry considers the effect of special education on the child's overall achievement in school, while the latter focuses on the effect of special education on the components of that achievement hampered by the child's disability. <i>See</i> Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 498-99 (positing \"which of the child's performance areas must need special education?\" as a crucial question in developing the test for IDEA eligibility under &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii)). Indeed, a child may \"do well in school\" without special education, accumulating a high grade point average, but may nevertheless perform below acceptable levels in other areas, such as behavior. <i>See, e.g., In re Monrovia Unified Sch. Dist.,</i> 38 Inds. with Disabilities Educ. L. Reptr. (LRP Publ'ns) 84, at 342-43 (Cal. State Educ. Agency Nov. 27, 2002) (finding student to \"require special education to address social, behavioral, and written expression needs\" despite \"good academic work\"). The questions of whether such a child \"needs special education\" under a proper interpretation of &#167; 1401(3)(A)(ii)&#8212;and how to articulate that interpretation in the first instance&#8212; have generated a cacophony of different answers. <i>See</i> Garda, <i>supra,</i> at 491-507 (surveying divergent authority).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not attempt to compose the correct standard of \"need\" here. We simply note the significant variance between the standard the district urges us to adopt and the standard it argues has been satisfied. McDevitt's testimony may have supported a finding that LI does not require special education \"to do well in school,\" had the district court not ruled that the issue had been waived. But the district does not explain how such a finding would support the conclusion that LI does not \"need special education\" under the IDEA and, in fact, argues that the proper inquiry incorporates a substantially different standard, <i>i.e.,</i> whether LI \"requires special education to benefit in those areas of educational performance that are adversely affected.\" Conversely, the district does not explain how the evidence received at the due process hearing falls short of that standard. The district has therefore failed to show that the district court's treatment of the \"need\" issue as settled had any effect on its ultimate conclusion that LI qualified for IDEA benefits. Even if the district court erred in finding the district had waived the \"need\" argument, then, the error was harmless. <i>See Hampton Sch. Dist. v.

The Supreme Court has read this provision, as it appeared in the predecessor to the IDEA, as empowering a court \"to order school authorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private special education for a child if the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.\" <i>Burlington,</i> 471 U.S. at 369, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ordinarily, we review a district court's decision to award or withhold equitable relief for an abuse of that discretion. <i>See, e.g., Valentin-Almeyda v.

But, as the Court made clear in <i>Florence County,</i> the right to reimbursement of private special education expenses depends in the first instance on whether the private school placement was \"proper.\" We consider this threshold inquiry, like other conclusions demanded by the IDEA, as a mixed question of fact and law.

In <i>Burlington,</i> the Supreme Court reasoned that because \"parents who disagree with the proposed IEP are faced with a choice: go along with the IEP to the detriment of their child if it turns out to be appropriate or pay for what they consider to be the appropriate placement,\" they are entitled to reimbursement of the expenses of that placement if it turns out they were right in choosing it. 471 U.S. at 370, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1996</span></span>. Implicit in this reasoning is the notion that parents rightfully decide on a private placement when it addresses, at least in part, their child's special educational requirements, while the IEP does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not see, then, how the decision to reject public education in favor of enrolling a child in private school can be described as \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit\" if the private school does not offer at least \"some element of special education services in which the public school placement was deficient.\" <i>Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523. To hold otherwise would, in essence, embrace the argument we explicitly rejected in <i>Rafferty:</i> that the IDEA entitles a parent, at public expense, to \"seek any alternative school she wishes if the public education is inadequate.\" 315 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court did not apply the wrong standard in finding that TCS is not an appropriate private school placement under the IDEA because it \"does not offer any of the special education services recommended by the experts or the PET.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 173. We are left, then, to review this finding for clear error, and discern none. Although both of the experts who examined LI, as well as her present social worker, have stressed that LI needs direct teaching of social skills to manage the effects of her Asperger's, it is undisputed that TCS has never provided her with this service, or any roughly equivalent intervention. TCS has also not supplied the cognitive behavioral therapy recommended by Popeneo or the close supervision or one-on-one tutoring offered by the PET as part of the Rehabilitation Act plan. The district court did not clearly err in judging TCS an inappropriate private placement in the absence of any of these special education services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parents resist this conclusion on two principal grounds. First, they liken certain of TCS's distinguishing features to the interventions recommended for LI and found by the district court to constitute \"special education\" in assessing LI's eligibility under the IDEA. As we have recognized, a private placement need provide only \"<i>some element</i> of the special education services\" missing from the public alternative in order to qualify as reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit. <i>Berger,</i> 348 F.3d at 523 (emphasis added). Nor must the placement meet every last one of the child's special education needs. <i>Frank G.,</i> 459 F.3d at 365. But the reasonableness of the private placement necessarily depends on the nexus between the special education required and the special education provided. Here, the connection between, for example, the one-on-one tutoring recommended for LI and the relatively small student-faculty ratio boasted by TCS was more than remote enough to support the district court's conclusion that the choice of the private school was not reasonably calculated to ensure that LI received educational benefit&#8212;particularly in light of the fact that, as we have just discussed, TCS did not offer anything approaching the direct teaching of social skills unanimously endorsed by the professionals who have tested and treated LI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the parents protest that, laboring under the trauma of LI's suicide attempt and facing a lack of cooperation from the district, they acted reasonably by any measure in unilaterally placing LI at TCS. We sympathize with the family's emotional upheaval, and we certainly do not condone the district's apparent inattention to the task of locating a tutor for LI as it repeatedly promised it would. And we cannot doubt that TCS, where LI's sister had prospered and where LI herself had expressed interest in attending even before the events of the fall of 2003, must have seemed an attractive solution to an exceedingly difficult set of circumstances. But these considerations cannot change the fact that TCS, where LI has remained for more than two full academic years, simply does not provide the special education services that LI's mental health professionals have prescribed. The district court did not commit clear error when it found that TCS is not an appropriate private placement under the IDEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mr. and Mrs. I challenge the district court's refusal to order the district to provide LI with compensatory education. We have recognized that, as another form of \"appropriate relief\" available under &#167; 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), a court may require \"compensatory education\" in the form of \"further services, in compensation for past deprivations\" of IDEA benefits. <i>Me.

Accordingly, we review the district court's decision on compensatory education for abuse of discretion. Part IV.A, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered the parents' request for compensatory education in light of the other relief granted, namely its order to the district \"to convene a PET meeting in accordance with State and Federal law to develop an IEP for [LI] that meets her unique needs as a student with Asperger's Syndrome and a depressive disorder.\" 416 F.Supp.2d at 168. Noting that \"[t]he IEP necessarily will take into account the effect of the School District's failure to identify and offer special education services earlier,\" the district court declined to order compensatory education on the theory that the PET could better assess \"what special education [LI] needs at this point. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 173.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach strikes us as sensible and, moreover, not an abuse of the district court's discretion. As the parents acknowledge, it is not unheard of for a compensatory education claim to be remanded to the responsible educational authority for consideration, particularly where \"the district court does not believe that the record is sufficient to permit it to make the highly nuanced judgments necessary to resolve the claim....\" <i>Mr. R,</i> 321 F.3d at 20. The parents, in fact, do not appear to object to such an approach here, provided we \"ensure at the very least that guidelines governing the type, form, intensity, and duration of services are specified to assist the parties in moving forward without confusion or acrimony.\" This is a worthy objective, to be sure, but we are not up to the task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we confront an administrative record naturally devoid of any evidence as to the effect of the district's failure to offer IDEA services to LI over the past two years and counting, since LI's eligibility for those services was precisely what was at issue in the due process hearing. As a result, any \"guidelines\" that we might set forth to \"govern\" the resolution of the compensatory education claim would amount to an improper advisory opinion, just as it would have been a highly speculative exercise for the district court to attempt to resolve the claim on its merits. The district court ordered the district to convene a PET, in accordance with applicable law, for the purpose of formulating an IEP for LI that meets her needs, and further recognized that this task would necessarily require resolution of the compensatory education inquiry. We do not view this as an abuse of discretion, and Mr. and Mrs. I have not provided us with any authority to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court in its entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although this regulation was amended during the pendency of this appeal, none of the amendments affects our analysis<i>See generally</i> Assistance to States for the Education of Children With Disabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities, 71 Fed.
