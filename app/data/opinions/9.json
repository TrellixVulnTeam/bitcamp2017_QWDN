Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n           Torruella, Baldock,* and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Frank E. Guerra-Pujol, for appellant.\n     Susana I. Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General,\nDepartment of Justice, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with whom Irene\nS. Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General, Leticia Casalduc-Rabell,\nDeputy Solicitor General, and Zaira Z. Girón-Anadón, Deputy\nSolicitor General, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                          February 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.       Plaintiff Iván Rocafort is the\n\npresident and primary shareholder of Plaintiff-Appellant Pleasures\n\nof San Patricio, Inc. (PSP), a tobacco and wine shop in Puerto\n\nRico.1    PSP regularly imports and sells little cigars made in the\n\nmainland United States and is the exclusive distributor of Cheyenne\n\nLittle Cigars in Puerto Rico.       The United States Department of the\n\nTreasury has classified little cigars as a different tobacco\n\nproduct from cigarettes.         Section 2009 of the 1994 Puerto Rico\n\nInternal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on cigarettes but not\n\non little cigars.     Prior to 2007, PSP had never been required to\n\npay Puerto Rico’s cigarette excise tax on its imported little\n\ncigars.    In 2007, PSP ordered $40,000 worth of Cheyenne Little\n\nCigars from a manufacturer in North Carolina.         Defendant Secretary\n\nof the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury, Juan Méndez-Torres,\n\nfor the first time refused to release PSP’s shipment of Cheyenne\n\nLittle Cigars until PSP paid the cigarette excise tax. PSP alleges\n\nDefendant acted pursuant to Circular Letter of Internal Revenue No.\n\n05-08 dated August 17, 2005 (Circular Letter) which PSP claims\n\nimposes Puerto Rico’s cigarette tax only on little cigars produced\n\nin the United States.\n\n            In October 2007, PSP filed suit in Puerto Rico federal\n\ndistrict    court   requesting    \"the    immediate   release   of   [PSP’s]\n\n\n     1\n       Though both Plaintiff Rocafort and Plaintiff-Appellant PSP\nsued in federal court and later in the Commonwealth courts, for\nsimplicity’s sake we refer only to PSP.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fshipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars . . .,” “a permanent injunction\n\nagainst    the     selective      and   discriminatory       imposition    of   the\n\ncigarette       excise    [tax]    upon   Cheyenne     Little    Cigars”    and   a\n\ndeclaration “that the excise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code\n\nof Puerto Rico Section 2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little\n\nCigars.”    PSP asserted Defendant’s application of the cigarette\n\nexcise    tax    solely    to   mainland-made     little     cigars   constitutes\n\nunconstitutional         interference     with   and   discrimination      against\n\ninterstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause, Article\n\nI, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n\n            The district court granted Defendant’s motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction in August 2008.                     The district court\n\nconcluded the Butler Act, 48 U.S.C. § 872, prevented it from\n\nhearing the suit because the Act prohibits the filing of suits in\n\nfederal courts “‘for the purpose of restraining the assessment or\n\ncollection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico.’\"\n\nPleasures of San Patricio, Inc. v. Méndez-Torres, 2008 WL 4191251,\n\nat *1 (D.P.R. Aug. 29, 2008) (quoting 48 U.S.C. § 872).                   The court\n\nwas \"firmly convinced that this is a prototypical Butler Act case\n\nas [PSP] is explicitly challenging the validity of a tax and\n\n[Defendant]’s authority to assess it.\"                 Id.    Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court declared it did not have jurisdiction to entertain\n\nthe suit.       Id. at *2.      PSP’s timely appeal to our Court followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f            At oral argument, counsel for both parties revealed that\n\nwhile    this   appeal    was    pending,     PSP   filed    an    action    in   a\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico trial court and received a partial\n\nsummary   judgment,      which   was   at    that   time    on    appeal    to   the\n\nCommonwealth appellate court.          We, therefore, ordered both parties\n\nto file English translations of the proceedings and associated\n\ncomplaints, pleadings, motions and briefs in PSP’s related case\n\nbefore the Commonwealth trial and appellate courts.                    Defendant\n\nresponded to our order by filing 436 pages in no apparent order\n\nwithout a uniform page numbering system (some page numbers are\n\nhandwritten, others are typed in various fonts and sizes, and some\n\nplaced over the page’s text).               Defendant evidently thought it\n\nappropriate to divide the documents into six parts but failed to\n\nlabel any of these six parts.            Defendant provides an “Addendum\n\nIndex” which does not appear to correspond to what it actually\n\nfiled.    Looking at the first page and last page of each part, Part\n\nII allegedly contains pages 36 through 235; Part III allegedly\n\ncontains pages 236 through 260; Part IV allegedly contains pages 54\n\nthrough 123; Part V allegedly contains pages 124 through 226; and\n\nPart VI allegedly contains pages 180 through 226.                As for pages 260\n\nthrough 436, we are left to assume they are somewhere in those six\n\nparts; although, we have only been able to locate pages numbered\n\nthrough 338 scattered throughout the six parts because many of the\n\npages lack page numbers altogether.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we review the district court’s\n\nfinal order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo.    Murphy\n\nv. United States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995).      In light of\n\nthe proceedings in the Commonwealth    courts, we suspect this case\n\nis moot.     The parties’ inadequate compliance with our order,\n\nhowever, prevents us from definitively reaching a conclusion as to\n\nmootness.   Regardless, we can definitively conclude based upon the\n\nsubmissions that we lack subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n\nthe Butler Act because Commonwealth of Puerto Rico courts have\n\nprovided a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.    We, consequently,\n\naffirm the district court’s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            From what we can decipher, PSP apparently filed a lawsuit\n\nin the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in February 2009, after the\n\nfederal district court dismissed the instant case, against the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice\n\nchallenging the Circular Letter, requesting an injunction, and\n\ndemanding damages for the unlawful detention of its shipment.    See\n\nRocafort v. Dep’t of the Treasury, No. E PE2009-0057 (Court of\n\nFirst Instance, Caguas Superior Court, filed February 20, 2009).\n\nPSP alleged Defendant Méndez-Torres implemented the Circular Letter\n\nin contravention of Puerto Rico’s Small Business Administrative and\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (SBARFA), 3 L.P.R.A. §§ 2251–2262.    The\n\nCourt of First Instance granted partial summary judgment and\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fentered a judgment in PSP’s favor.             The court considered whether\n\nDefendant Méndez-Torres acted in conformity with the SBARFA in\n\nissuing the Circular Letter and, if properly issued, whether the\n\nCircular     Letter         promulgates      an     invalid    administrative\n\ninterpretation of Section 2009 of the Internal Revenue Code.                   PSP\n\ndoes not appear to have raised Commerce Clause arguments before the\n\nCourt of First Instance. Ultimately, the court concluded Defendant\n\nMéndez-Torres acted in contravention of the SBARFA in issuing the\n\nCircular     Letter        and   relied   upon      an   invalid      regulatory\n\ninterpretation in seizing the shipment of little cigars.                       The\n\ncourt, therefore, granted PSP’s motion for partial summary judgment\n\nand ordered the Department of the Treasury to release the shipment\n\nimmediately.     Defendants then filed a petition for certiorari\n\nbefore the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Appellate Court.                        See\n\nRocafort v. Dep’t of the Treasury, No. KLCE2009-01542, Petition for\n\nCertiorari (Appellate Court, Judicial Region of Caguas, filed\n\nOctober 26, 2009).         That is the last documentation we have of this\n\ncase in the Commonwealth courts.             Neither party has supplemented\n\nthe record pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) to inform us whether\n\nthe Appellate Court has granted the petition for certiorari, let\n\nalone whether it has affirmed the Court of First Instance’s partial\n\nsummary judgment in favor of PSP.                 The parties have also not\n\ninformed us whether the Department of the Treasury has complied\n\nwith   the   Court    of    First   Instance’s     September   2009    order   by\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\freleasing the shipment.     As a result, we cannot conclusively\n\ndetermine that the Commonwealth proceedings render the case before\n\nus moot.   We, therefore, proceed to determine whether the Butler\n\nAct deprives us of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n                                II.\n\n           The Butler Act states, in relevant part: \"No suit for the\n\npurpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax\n\nimposed by the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\"    48\n\nU.S.C. § 872.   The Act is “a close analogue to the Tax Injunction\n\nAct (‘TIA’) applicable to Puerto Rico.\"       Coors Brewing Co. v.\n\nMéndez-Torres, 562 F.3d 3, 13 (1st Cir. 2009).    \"The two statutes\n\nemploy different language (i.e. the [TIA] includes an express\n\nexception that the Butler Act lacks), but ‘have been construed in\n\npari materia.’\"   United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, 318\n\nF.3d 323, 330 n.11 (1st Cir. 2003)(quoting Trailer Marine Transp.\n\nCorp. v. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1992)).     For this\n\nreason, we apply the Butler Act in the same manner as the TIA.\n\nCarrier Corp. v. Perez, 677 F.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir. 1982).    The TIA\n\nlimits the jurisdiction of a federal court to entertain a suit\n\nseeking to enjoin the levying or collection of a state tax where \"a\n\nplain, speedy and efficient remedy\" exists in state court.     Id. at\n\n164; see also United Parcel Serv., 318 F.3d at 330 n.11.         Two\n\nconditions must, therefore, be satisfied before the Butler Act will\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fdeprive a federal court of jurisdiction: first, the suit must\n\nattempt to restrain the assessment or collection of a Puerto Rico\n\ntax; and second, local courts must provide the plaintiff a plain,\n\nspeedy, and efficient remedy.     Carrier, 677 F.2d at 164.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          As to the first condition, similar to the TIA, \"[n]ot\n\nevery statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the Secretary\n\n[of the Treasury]’s ability to collect a tax is immune from attack\n\nin federal court by virtue of the Butler Act’s jurisdictional bar.\"\n\nUnited Parcel Serv., 318 F.3d at 331. The Act’s jurisdictional bar\n\nonly extends to:\n\n          \"[C]ases where taxpayers were repeatedly using\n          the federal courts to raise questions of state\n          or federal law going to the validity of the\n          particular taxes imposed upon them—not to a\n          case where a taxpayer contended that an\n          unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax\n          admittedly due violated his constitutional\n          rights . . . .\"\n\nId. (quoting Wells v. Malloy, 510 F.2d 74, 77 (2d Cir. 1975)).\n\n          In   Coors   Brewing   Co.    v.   Méndez-Torres,   we    further\n\nclarified the scope of the Butler Act in the wake of the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88 (2004).             Hibbs v.\n\nWinn dealt with the scope of the TIA, but we concluded in Coors:\n\n          [S]ince the Butler Act is read in parallel to\n          the TIA, and since it similarly only restricts\n          the district courts from entertaining suits\n          “for the purpose of restraining the assessment\n          or collection” of taxes of Puerto Rico, we\n          read it, according to Hibbs, to only apply\n          where plaintiffs seek to challenge taxes in a\n\n                                  -8-\n\f           way that would reduce the flow of state tax\n           revenue.\n\nCoors, 562 F.3d at 14.     For this reason, we concluded that despite\n\nthe Butler Act the district court had jurisdiction to entertain\n\nCoors’s suit challenging an exemption in Puerto Rico’s taxing\n\nscheme   which    specified     a   lower    tax    rate    for    small    brewers\n\n(generally local brewers).          Id. at 16.     Coors sought a declaration\n\nthat the exemption was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause\n\nas well as an injunction prohibiting the Puerto Rico Secretary of\n\nthe Treasury from allowing any taxpayer to pay only the reduced tax\n\nrate provided by the small brewers exemption and requiring the\n\nSecretary to impose the higher tax rate on all brewers.                    Id. at 5.\n\nBecause Coors did not seek to lower the tax rate on itself, \"rather\n\nthan eliminat[ing] a potential source of revenue, the relief Coors\n\nrequest[ed] would simply eliminate a tax law affording preferential\n\ntax treatment to certain taxpayers.\"             Id. at 16.       Accordingly, we\n\nconcluded that under Hibbs, Coors’s action was not barred by the\n\nButler Act.      Id.\n\n           At first blush, PSP’s suit appears similar to the one we\n\ndetermined fell beyond the scope of the Butler Act in Coors.                      PSP\n\nraised a Commerce Clause objection to Defendant placing a higher\n\ntax on mainland-made little cigars than locally-made little cigars.\n\nSimilarly,    Coors    raised   a    Commerce      Clause    challenge       to   the\n\nSecretary’s imposing a higher tax on large brewers than on small\n\nbrewers.     But, critically, the two suits differ in the relief\n\n                                       -9-\n\frequested.   Coors requested an injunction requiring all brewers,\n\nlarge and small, to pay the higher large-brewer tax, thereby\n\nincreasing the revenue flowing to Puerto Rico.     In contrast, PSP\n\nrequested in its amended complaint that the federal district court\n\n\"order the immediate release of [PSP’s] shipment of Cheyenne Little\n\nCigars . . ., . . . issue a permanent injunction against the\n\nselective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise\n\n[tax] upon Cheyenne Little Cigars, [and]. . . declare that the\n\nexcise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico Section\n\n2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little Cigars.\"    PSP did not\n\nrequest an injunction requiring Defendant to apply the cigarette\n\nexcise tax to all little cigars, including those made in Puerto\n\nRico.   Consequently, rather than increase the revenue generated by\n\nPuerto Rico’s tax laws, PSP’s requested relief \"would reduce the\n\nflow of [Puerto Rico] tax revenue.\"      Coors, 562 F.3d at 14.   We\n\nmust, therefore, conclude PSP’s suit does fall within the ambit of\n\nsuits barred by the Butler Act.\n\n                                  B.\n\n           Now that we have determined PSP’s suit is within the\n\nscope of suits barred by the Butler Act, we must decide whether\n\nPuerto Rico local courts provide a plain, speedy, and efficient\n\nremedy.   Carrier, 677 F.2d at 164.    PSP argues in its briefs that\n\nit lacks such a remedy for two reasons: first, Puerto Rico tax\n\nprocedure requires it to sell its little cigars at a loss; second,\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fthe   Supreme   Court   of   Puerto        Rico   does   not   recognize   the\n\napplicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico.2\n\n          The Supreme Court has clarified that the requirement of\n\na plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in state court is only a\n\nprocedural one and is, therefore, satisfied merely when “certain\n\nprocedural criteria” are met.     Rosewell v. LaSalle National Bank,\n\n450 U.S. 503, 522 (1981); Carrier, 677 F.2d at 165.            A state remedy\n\nmeets these minimal procedural criteria so long as it “provides a\n\ntaxpayer with a ‘full hearing and judicial determination’ at which\n\nshe may raise all constitutional objections to the tax” and may\n\ntherefrom seek review before the Supreme Court. Rosewell, 450 U.S.\n\nat 515 n.19.\n\n                                      1.\n\n          Puerto Rico law evidently requires individuals contesting\n\nan imposed tax to pay the tax and then apply to the Secretary of\n\nthe Treasury for a refund.     See 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 (“[N]o credit or\n\nreimbursement of any tax covered by §§ 261 and 262 of this title\n\nshall be granted unless the taxpayer shows . . . he has sustained\n\n\n      2\n       PSP also suggested at oral argument that it lacked a plain,\nspeedy, and efficient remedy in the Commonwealth Courts because\nsuch an action is time barred. First, we note we have no way of\nknowing if the Commonwealth courts have determined PSP’s suit is\ntime barred because the parties’ addendum does not indicate any\nCommonwealth court has ruled on the issue yet. Second, because PSP\nraised this argument for the first time at oral argument, we refuse\nto consider it. See Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones, 443 F.3d 134,\n138 (1st Cir. 2006); Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe burden of the payment of the tax.”); Carrier, 677 F.2d at 164.3\n\nState     refund   actions   that   allow   protesting    taxpayers   the\n\nopportunity for state judicial review of their constitutional and\n\nfederal claims generally constitute a plain, speedy, and efficient\n\nremedy.     See California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393,\n\n416–17 (1982); Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S.\n\n293, 300 (1943).     But Puerto Rico requires taxpayers not only to\n\npay the tax before seeking redress, but also to in fact have\n\nsuffered the economic burden of the tax.        13 L.P.R.A. § 261; see\n\nalso Venrod Corp. v. Sec’y of the Treasury of the Commw. of Puerto\n\nRico, 704 F. Supp. 21, 23 (D.P.R. 1989)(\"[N]ot only must the\n\nplaintiff have paid the tax, but . . . it ‘must have in fact\n\nsuffered the economic burden of the tax.’\" (quoting Pedro A. Pizá,\n\nInc. v. Tax Court, 72 P.R.R. 302, 304 (1951))).          If the Secretary\n\n\n\n     3\n       At oral argument, Plaintiff stated that PSP would have to\npay the imposed tax in order to request injunctive or declaratory\nrelief in the Commonwealth courts.       Defendant’s counsel took\ncontradictory positions on the matter. The addendum submitted by\nthe parties does not clarify this confusion, nor does it establish\nwhether PSP has already paid the tax or posted a bond as part of\nthe litigation in the Commonwealth courts. Although, seemingly if\nPSP had paid the tax prior to filing suit in the Commonwealth\ncourts, Defendant would have released the shipment, and PSP would\nnot have requested the Commonwealth court to order Defendant to\nrelease the shipment but would have instead requested a tax refund.\nSince PSP did request the release of the shipment in the suit\nbefore the Commonwealth trial court, PSP, in theory, has not yet\nbeen made to pay the tax. But for reasons discussed herein the\nanswer to those questions does not affect our plain, speedy, and\nefficient remedy analysis in this case. We, therefore, take PSP’s\nclaim in its briefs and at oral argument that it must first pay the\ntax to challenge it in the Commonwealth courts as true.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdecides against the taxpayer, he may appeal the decision in the\n\nlocal Puerto Rico courts and, thereafter, seek review of any final\n\nCommonwealth court decision with the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.    Carrier, 677 F.2d at 164.          This means only taxpayers who\n\nhave absorbed the challenged taxes and not passed them on to their\n\nvendees may sue for a refund in Commonwealth courts.                   Venrod, 704\n\nF. Supp. at 23.      Quoting Venrod, PSP asserts:\n\n            This puts [a] plaintiff in a catch-22\n            situation anent the state remedy: it can\n            either pass the burden of the tax on to the\n            ultimate purchaser, which will make [the taxed\n            product] uncompetitive, and thereby forego any\n            remedy for an allegedly illegal tax, or it can\n            absorb the tax, sell the [taxed product] at a\n            loss, and attempt to obtain a refund.\n\nId. at 24.    In Venrod, the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico reasoned that while we had previously\n\ndetermined    in     Carrier    that    Puerto     Rico’s     refund     procedure\n\nconstituted a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy, we did not\n\nencounter the catch-22 scenario described.              Id.    As a result, the\n\nVenrod    district    court    proceeded      to   conclude   \"a    remedy   which\n\nrequires for its availability the selling of the [taxed product] at\n\na loss is not plain, speedy, and efficient.\"                Id.    In Carrier, we\n\nreviewed the exact same Puerto Rico tax refund procedure under 13\n\nL.P.R.A. § 261 that the district court in Venrod discussed; we just\n\ndid so seven years earlier.4           Carrier, 677 F.2d at 164.          At that\n\n\n     4\n       From what we can discover, 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 has only been\naltered once since 1954. In 2003, “Superior Court” was changed to\n\n                                       -13-\n\ftime, we concluded that Section 261 provided plaintiffs challenging\n\nPuerto Rico taxes a plain, speedy and efficient remedy.                             Id.   The\n\ndistrict court in Venrod correctly noted that the Carrier court did\n\nnot expressly pass on the catch-22 scenario Section 261 creates by\n\nrequiring plaintiffs to suffer the challenged tax.                        Venrod, 704 F.\n\nSupp. at 24.        However, we must assume that when the Carrier court\n\nstated it had evaluated the Puerto Rico refund procedure in Section\n\n261,   the   court      reviewed   it    in        its    brief      entirety   (only     two\n\nparagraphs long).        We, therefore, have good reason to conclude we\n\nhave already passed on Section 261's burden-bearing requirement.\n\n             Moreover, we independently fail to see how requiring a\n\ntaxpayer to sell taxed goods at a loss before suing for a refund\n\nfails to provide him an adequate remedy.                        First, if the taxpayer\n\nprevails     in   his    challenge      of    the        tax,   he    obtains   a    refund,\n\nreversing     the    detriment     the       tax    imposed       upon   him.        Second,\n\nrequiring a taxpayer to bear the burden of the tax does not\n\ndiminish Puerto Rico’s satisfaction of the Butler Act’s minimal\n\nprocedural requirements.           Puerto Rico continues to satisfy those\n\nminimal procedural requirements by providing a taxpayer a “full\n\nhearing and judicial determination” of all of her constitutional\n\nobjections to the tax, with review thereafter possible before the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court, regardless of its burden-bearing\n\n\n\n“Court of First Instance.”    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13 § 261\n(LexisNexis 2006). Otherwise, the text of the statute has remained\nthe same.\n\n                                         -14-\n\frequirement.    Third, Congress, and later the Supreme Court when\n\nasked to review state refund procedures, surely understood a\n\ntaxpayer might have to bear the economic burden of a tax in order\n\nto contest it in state courts.            When Congress first passed the\n\nButler Act’s cousin, the TIA, “Congress knew that state tax systems\n\ncommonly    provided      for   payment   of    taxes   under   protest    with\n\nsubsequent refund as their exclusive remedy.”             Rosewell, 450 U.S.\n\nat 523.    Then and now, a significant portion of taxpayers are not\n\nbusinesses or entities that can pass on their tax liabilities to\n\ntheir    consumers   or    employees,     but   instead   are   families    and\n\nindividuals who must bear the burden of their state tax liability\n\nrather than pass it on to someone else. Consequently, Congress and\n\nthe Court must have realized many taxpayers would have to absorb\n\nthe burden of a tax in order to contest it in state court.                Thus,\n\non the facts presented, we must conclude Puerto Rico’s requirement\n\nthat PSP absorb the burden of the tax prior to contesting it does\n\nnot deprive PSP of a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in Puerto\n\nRico courts.5\n\n\n     5\n       We note, however, some sister circuits have indicated that\nwhile generally a state refund procedure constitutes a plain,\nspeedy, and efficient remedy, requiring a taxpayer to pay an\nexorbitant or effectively punitive tax in order to challenge it may\npresent “such a heavy burden that to decline [federal] equitable\nrelief would be to deny judicial review altogether.” H.W. Denton\nv. City of Carrollton, Georgia, 235 F.2d 481, 485 (5th Cir. 1956);\nsee also Capitol Indus.-EMI, Inc. v. Bennett, 681 F.2d 1107, 1114\nn. 20 (9th Cir. 1982)(explaining that a state refund action may not\nconstitute an adequate remedy in special circumstances, such as\nwhen a taxpayer is unable to pay a proposed assessment); Sterling\n\n                                     -15-\n\f            Furthermore, in this case, the Commonwealth courts (even\n\nassuming contrary to logic that PSP has paid the contested tax)\n\nhave certainly provided PSP a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.\n\nPSP has already received a favorable partial judgment from the\n\nCommonwealth    trial   court   ordering   Defendant   to    release   its\n\nshipment.    Even if the Commonwealth Appellate Court reverses the\n\npartial judgment, \"[t]he Butler Act, at most, requires assurance\n\nthat a plaintiff will have an opportunity to make an argument in\n\n[local] court, not that he will win.\"      Id. at 165.      As Defendant’s\n\naddendum indicates, PSP has clearly had such an opportunity.\n\n                                   2.\n\n            We have also reviewed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico’s\n\ninterpretation of the Commerce Clause’s application to Puerto Rico,\n\nfinding it far less definitive than PSP asserts.            See Starlight\n\nSugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 143 (1st Cir. 2001) (concluding\n\nafter reviewing circuit and Puerto Rico Supreme Court precedent\n\nthat the Commerce Clause in the view of Puerto Rico courts may have\n\n“‘contours which are different’ from those when applied to the\n\n\nShoe Co. v. Norberg, 411 F. Supp. 128, 131 (D.R.I. 1976) (noting\nthat “it is settled law that prepayment as a prerequisite to\njudicial review does not prevent application of” the TIA, but that\n“[t]here is a qualification, however, where there is a factual\nshowing . . . that prepayment in order to secure judicial review\n‘poses such a heavy burden that to deny equitable relief is to deny\njudicial review entirely’” (quoting Denton, 235 F.2d at 485)). PSP\nhas never contended it is unable to pay the “six dollars and\nfifteen cents” excise tax allegedly imposed by Puerto Rico upon its\nshipment of little cigars.     As a result, we have no reason to\nbelieve that special circumstances of the nature other circuits\nhave discussed exist here to justify jurisdiction.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fStates.” (quoting R.C.A. v. Gov’t of the Capital, 91 P.R.R. 404,\n\n419 (P.R. 1964))); Carrier, 677 F.2d at 165 (explaining that the\n\nposition      taken   by   the    Supreme    Court    of   Puerto    Rico       on   the\n\napplicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico was far more\n\nflexible in R.C.A than the plaintiff suggested). Regardless, as we\n\nhave    previously    recognized,      we    need    not   address       the    precise\n\ncontours of Puerto Rico’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence in order to\n\nfind PSP has an adequate remedy under Puerto Rico law.                         Carrier,\n\n677 F.2d at 165.       Rather, we have concluded it is sufficient that\n\nplaintiffs are “free to make a Commerce Clause-based argument in\n\nthe courts of Puerto Rico, and to pursue those arguments to the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States if necessary.”                  Id.    The Butler\n\nAct    only   requires     that   local     courts   provide   a    plaintiff        the\n\nopportunity to make an argument, not that they guarantee the\n\nplaintiff’s success.        Id.    Given this reasoning and the fact that\n\nPSP has already availed itself of such an opportunity to make this\n\nargument by challenging the tax in the Commonwealth courts (though\n\nit evidently chose not to make Commerce Clause arguments), PSP’s\n\ncontention that the local courts do not provide a plain, speedy,\n\nand efficient remedy is meritless.\n\n                                       III.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f",

Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General, Leticia Casalduc-Rabell, Deputy Solicitor General, and Zaira Z. Girón-Anadón, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, BALDOCK,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Iván Rocafort is the president and primary shareholder of Plaintiff-Appellant Pleasures of San Patricio, Inc. (PSP), a tobacco and wine shop in Puerto Rico.<sup>[1]</sup> PSP regularly imports and sells little cigars made in the mainland United States and is the exclusive distributor of Cheyenne Little Cigars in Puerto Rico. The United States Department of the Treasury has classified little cigars as a different tobacco product from cigarettes. Section 2009 of the 1994 Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on cigarettes but not on little cigars. Prior to 2007, PSP had never been required to pay Puerto Rico's cigarette excise tax on its imported little cigars. In 2007, PSP ordered $40,000 worth of Cheyenne Little Cigars from a manufacturer in North Carolina. Defendant Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury, Juan Méndez-Torres, for the first time refused to release PSP's shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars until PSP paid the cigarette excise tax. PSP alleges Defendant acted pursuant to Circular Letter of Internal Revenue No. 05-08 dated August 17, 2005 (Circular Letter) which PSP claims imposes Puerto Rico's cigarette tax only on little cigars produced in the United States.</p>\n<p>In October 2007, PSP filed suit in Puerto Rico federal district court requesting \"the immediate release of [PSP's] shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars ...,\" \"a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise [tax] upon Cheyenne Little Cigars\" and a declaration \"that the excise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico Section 2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little Cigars.\" PSP asserted Defendant's application of the cigarette excise tax solely to mainland-made little cigars constitutes unconstitutional interference with and discrimination against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in August 2008. The district court concluded the Butler Act, 48 U.S.C. § 872, prevented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> it from hearing the suit because the Act prohibits the filing of suits in federal courts \"`for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico.'\" <i>Pleasures of San Patricio, Inc. v. Méndez-Torres,</i> Dkt. No. CIV. 07-1934CCC, 2008 WL 4191251, at *1 (D.P.R. Aug. 29, 2008) (quoting 48 U.S.C. § 872). The court was \"firmly convinced that this is a prototypical Butler Act case as [PSP] is explicitly challenging the validity of a tax and [Defendant]'s authority to assess it.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the district court declared it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit. <i>Id.</i> at *2. PSP's timely appeal to our Court followed.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, counsel for both parties revealed that while this appeal was pending, PSP filed an action in a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico trial court and received a partial summary judgment, which was at that time on appeal to the Commonwealth appellate court. We, therefore, ordered both parties to file English translations of the proceedings and associated complaints, pleadings, motions and briefs in PSP's related case before the Commonwealth trial and appellate courts. Defendant responded to our order by filing 436 pages in no apparent order without a uniform page numbering system (some page numbers are handwritten, others are typed in various fonts and sizes, and some placed over the page's text). Defendant evidently thought it appropriate to divide the documents into six parts but failed to label any of these six parts. Defendant provides an \"Addendum Index\" which does not appear to correspond to what it actually filed. Looking at the first page and last page of each part, Part II allegedly contains pages 36 through 235; Part III allegedly contains pages 236 through 260; Part IV allegedly contains pages 54 through 123; Part V allegedly contains pages 124 through 226; and Part VI allegedly contains pages 180 through 226. As for pages 260 through 436, we are left to assume they are somewhere in those six parts; although, we have only been able to locate pages numbered through 338 scattered throughout the six parts because many of the pages lack page numbers altogether. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we review the district court's final order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo. <i>Murphy v. United States,</i> 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995). In light of the proceedings in the Commonwealth courts, we suspect this case is moot. The parties' inadequate compliance with our order, however, prevents us from definitively reaching a conclusion as to mootness. Regardless, we can definitively conclude based upon the submissions that we lack subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Butler Act because Commonwealth of Puerto Rico courts have provided a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. We, consequently, affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>From what we can decipher, PSP apparently filed a lawsuit in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in February 2009, after the federal district court dismissed the instant case, against the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice challenging the Circular Letter, requesting an injunction, and demanding damages for the unlawful detention of its shipment. <i>See Rocafort v. Dep't of the Treasury,</i> No. EPE2009-0057 (Court of First Instance, Caguas Superior Court, filed February 20, 2009). PSP alleged Defendant Méndez-Torres implemented the Circular Letter in contravention of Puerto Rico's Small Business Administrative and Regulatory Flexibility Act (SBARFA), 3 L.P.R.A. §§ 2251-2262. The Court of First Instance granted partial summary judgment and entered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> a judgment in PSP's favor. The court considered whether Defendant Méndez-Torres acted in conformity with the SBARFA in issuing the Circular Letter and, if properly issued, whether the Circular Letter promulgates an invalid administrative interpretation of Section 2009 of the Internal Revenue Code. PSP does not appear to have raised Commerce Clause arguments before the Court of First Instance. Ultimately, the court concluded Defendant Méndez-Torres acted in contravention of the SBARFA in issuing the Circular Letter and relied upon an invalid regulatory interpretation in seizing the shipment of little cigars. The court, therefore, granted PSP's motion for partial summary judgment and ordered the Department of the Treasury to release the shipment immediately. Defendants then filed a petition for certiorari before the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Appellate Court. <i>See Rocafort v. Dep't of the Treasury,</i> No. KLCE2009-01542, Petition for Certiorari (Appellate Court, Judicial Region of Caguas, filed October 26, 2009). That is the last documentation we have of this case in the Commonwealth courts. Neither party has supplemented the record pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) to inform us whether the Appellate Court has granted the petition for certiorari, let alone whether it has affirmed the Court of First Instance's partial summary judgment in favor of PSP. The parties have also not informed us whether the Department of the Treasury has complied with the Court of First Instance's September 2009 order by releasing the shipment. As a result, we cannot conclusively determine that the Commonwealth proceedings render the case before us moot. We, therefore, proceed to determine whether the Butler Act deprives us of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Butler Act states, in relevant part: \"No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. § 872. The Act is \"a close analogue to the Tax Injunction Act (`TIA') applicable to Puerto Rico.\" <i>Coors Brewing Co. v. Méndez-Torres,</i> 562 F.3d 3, 13 (1st Cir.2009). \"The two statutes employ different language (<i>i.e.</i> the [TIA] includes an express exception that the Butler Act lacks), but `have been construed <i>in pari materia.</i>'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 330 n. 11 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,</i> 977 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1992)). For this reason, we apply the Butler Act in the same manner as the TIA. <i>Carrier Corp. v. Perez,</i> 677 F.2d 162, 164 (1st Cir.1982). The TIA limits the jurisdiction of a federal court to entertain a suit seeking to enjoin the levying or collection of a state tax where \"a plain, speedy and efficient remedy\" exists in state court. <i>Id.</i> at 164; <i>see also </i><i>United Parcel Serv.,</i> 318 F.3d at 330 n. 11. Two conditions must, therefore, be satisfied before the Butler Act will deprive a federal court of jurisdiction: first, the suit must attempt to restrain the assessment or collection of a Puerto Rico tax; and second, local courts must provide the plaintiff a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>As to the first condition, similar to the TIA, \"[n]ot every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the Secretary [of the Treasury]'s ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in federal court by virtue of the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar.\" <i>United Parcel Serv.,</i> 318 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 331. The Act's jurisdictional bar only extends to:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[C]ases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of state or federal law going to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon themnot to a case where a taxpayer contended that an unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax admittedly due violated his constitutional rights....\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Wells v. Malloy,</i> 510 F.2d 74, 77 (2d Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p>In <i>Coors Brewing Co. v. Méndez-Torres</i><i>,</i> we further clarified the scope of the Butler Act in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Hibbs v. Winn,</i> 542 U.S. 88, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). <i>Hibbs v. Winn</i> dealt with the scope of the TIA, but we concluded in <i>Coors:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[S]ince the Butler Act is read in parallel to the TIA, and since it similarly only restricts the district courts from entertaining suits \"for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection\" of taxes of Puerto Rico, we read it, according to <i>Hibbs,</i> to only apply where plaintiffs seek to challenge taxes in a way that would reduce the flow of state tax revenue.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Coors,</i> 562 F.3d at 14. For this reason, we concluded that despite the Butler Act the district court had jurisdiction to entertain Coors's suit challenging an exemption in Puerto Rico's taxing scheme which specified a lower tax rate for small brewers (generally local brewers). <i>Id.</i> at 16. Coors sought a declaration that the exemption was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause as well as an injunction prohibiting the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury from allowing any taxpayer to pay only the reduced tax rate provided by the small brewers exemption and requiring the Secretary to impose the higher tax rate on all brewers. <i>Id.</i> at 5. Because Coors did not seek to lower the tax rate on itself, \"rather than eliminat[ing] a potential source of revenue, the relief Coors request[ed] would simply eliminate a tax law affording preferential tax treatment to certain taxpayers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16. Accordingly, we concluded that under <i>Hibbs,</i> Coors's action was not barred by the Butler Act. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>At first blush, PSP's suit appears similar to the one we determined fell beyond the scope of the Butler Act in <i>Coors.</i> PSP raised a Commerce Clause objection to Defendant placing a higher tax on mainland-made little cigars than locally-made little cigars. Similarly, Coors raised a Commerce Clause challenge to the Secretary's imposing a higher tax on large brewers than on small brewers. But, critically, the two suits differ in the relief requested. Coors requested an injunction requiring all brewers, large and small, to pay the higher large-brewer tax, thereby increasing the revenue flowing to Puerto Rico. In contrast, PSP requested in its amended complaint that the federal district court \"order the immediate release of [PSP's] shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars..., ... issue a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise [tax] upon Cheyenne Little Cigars, [and] ... declare that the excise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico Section 2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little Cigars.\" PSP did not request an injunction requiring Defendant to apply the cigarette excise tax to all little cigars, including those made in Puerto Rico. Consequently, rather than increase the revenue generated by Puerto Rico's tax laws, PSP's requested relief \"would reduce the flow of [Puerto Rico] tax revenue.\" <i>Coors,</i> 562 F.3d at 14. We must, therefore, conclude <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> PSP's suit does fall within the ambit of suits barred by the Butler Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Now that we have determined PSP's suit is within the scope of suits barred by the Butler Act, we must decide whether Puerto Rico local courts provide a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. PSP argues in its briefs that it lacks such a remedy for two reasons: first, Puerto Rico tax procedure requires it to sell its little cigars at a loss; second, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico does not recognize the applicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has clarified that the requirement of a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in state court is only a procedural one and is, therefore, satisfied merely when \"certain procedural criteria\" are met. <i>Rosewell v. LaSalle National Bank,</i> 450 U.S. 503, 522, 101 S.Ct. 1221, 67 L.Ed.2d 464 (1981); <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 165. A state remedy meets these minimal procedural criteria so long as it \"provides a taxpayer with a `full hearing and judicial determination' at which she may raise all constitutional objections to the tax\" and may therefrom seek review before the Supreme Court. <i>Rosewell,</i> 450 U.S. at 515 n. 19, 101 S.Ct. 1221.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico law evidently requires individuals contesting an imposed tax to pay the tax and then apply to the Secretary of the Treasury for a refund. <i>See</i> 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 (\"[N]o credit or reimbursement of any tax covered by §§ 261 and 262 of this title shall be granted unless the taxpayer shows ... he has sustained the burden of the payment of the tax.\"); <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164.<sup>[3]</sup> State refund actions that allow protesting tax-payers the opportunity for state judicial review of their constitutional and federal claims generally constitute a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <i>See </i><i>California v. Grace Brethren Church,</i> 457 U.S. 393, 416-17, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982); <i>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman,</i> 319 U.S. 293, 300, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407 (1943). But Puerto Rico requires taxpayers not only to pay the tax before seeking redress, but also to in fact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> have suffered the economic burden of the tax. 13 L.P.R.A. § 261; <i>see also </i><i>Venrod Corp. v. Sec'y of the Treasury of the Commw. of Puerto Rico,</i> 704 F.Supp. 21, 23 (D.P.R.1989)(\"[N]ot only must the plaintiff have paid the tax, but ... it `must have in fact suffered the economic burden of the tax.'\" (quoting <i>Pedro A. Pizá, Inc. v. Tax Court,</i> 72 P.R.R. 302, 304 (1951))). If the Secretary decides against the taxpayer, he may appeal the decision in the local Puerto Rico courts and, thereafter, seek review of any final Commonwealth court decision with the Supreme Court of the United States. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. This means only taxpayers who have absorbed the challenged taxes and not passed them on to their vendees may sue for a refund in Commonwealth courts. <i>Venrod,</i> 704 F.Supp. at 23. Quoting <i>Venrod,</i> PSP asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>This puts [a] plaintiff in a catch-22 situation anent the state remedy: it can either pass the burden of the tax on to the ultimate purchaser, which will make [the taxed product] uncompetitive, and thereby forego any remedy for an allegedly illegal tax, or it can absorb the tax, sell the [taxed product] at a loss, and attempt to obtain a refund.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 24. In <i>Venrod,</i> the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico reasoned that while we had previously determined in <i>Carrier</i> that Puerto Rico's refund procedure constituted a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy, we did not encounter the catch-22 scenario described. <i>Id.</i> As a result, the <i>Venrod</i> district court proceeded to conclude \"a remedy which requires for its availability the selling of the [taxed product] at a loss is not plain, speedy, and efficient.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Carrier,</i> we reviewed the exact same Puerto Rico tax refund procedure under 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 that the district court in <i>Venrod</i> discussed; we just did so seven years earlier.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. At that time, we concluded that Section 261 provided plaintiffs challenging Puerto Rico taxes a plain, speedy and efficient remedy. <i>Id.</i> The district court in <i>Venrod</i> correctly noted that the <i>Carrier</i> court did not expressly pass on the catch-22 scenario Section 261 creates by requiring plaintiffs to suffer the challenged tax. <i>Venrod,</i> 704 F.Supp. at 24. However, we must assume that when the <i>Carrier</i> court stated it had evaluated the Puerto Rico refund procedure in Section 261, the court reviewed it in its brief entirety (only two paragraphs long). We, therefore, have good reason to conclude we have already passed on Section 261's burden-bearing requirement.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we independently fail to see how requiring a taxpayer to sell taxed goods at a loss before suing for a refund fails to provide him an adequate remedy. First, if the taxpayer prevails in his challenge of the tax, he obtains a refund, reversing the detriment the tax imposed upon him. Second, requiring a taxpayer to bear the burden of the tax does not diminish Puerto Rico's satisfaction of the Butler Act's minimal procedural requirements. Puerto Rico continues to satisfy those minimal procedural requirements by providing a taxpayer a \"full hearing and judicial determination\" of all of her constitutional objections to the tax, with review thereafter possible before the United States Supreme Court, regardless of its burden-bearing requirement. Third, Congress, and later the Supreme Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> when asked to review state refund procedures, surely understood a taxpayer might have to bear the economic burden of a tax in order to contest it in state courts. When Congress first passed the Butler Act's cousin, the TIA, \"Congress knew that state tax systems commonly provided for payment of taxes under protest with subsequent refund as their exclusive remedy.\" <i>Rosewell,</i> 450 U.S. at 523, 101 S.Ct. 1221. Then and now, a significant portion of taxpayers are not businesses or entities that can pass on their tax liabilities to their consumers or employees, but instead are families and individuals who must bear the burden of their state tax liability rather than pass it on to someone else. Consequently, Congress and the Court must have realized many taxpayers would have to absorb the burden of a tax in order to contest it in state court. Thus, on the facts presented, we must conclude Puerto Rico's requirement that PSP absorb the burden of the tax prior to contesting it does not deprive PSP of a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in Puerto Rico courts.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, in this case, the Commonwealth courts (even assuming contrary to logic that PSP has paid the contested tax) have certainly provided PSP a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. PSP has already received a favorable partial judgment from the Commonwealth trial court ordering Defendant to release its shipment. Even if the Commonwealth Appellate Court reverses the partial judgment, \"[t]he Butler Act, at most, requires assurance that a plaintiff will have an opportunity to make an argument in [local] court, not that he will win.\" <i>Id.</i> at 165. As Defendant's addendum indicates, PSP has clearly had such an opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>We have also reviewed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's interpretation of the Commerce Clause's application to Puerto Rico, finding it far less definitive than PSP asserts. <i>See </i><i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> 253 F.3d 137, 143 (1st Cir. 2001) (concluding after reviewing circuit and Puerto Rico Supreme Court precedent that the Commerce Clause in the view of Puerto Rico courts may have \"`contours which are different' from those when applied to the States.\" (quoting <i>R.C.A. v. Gov't of the Capital,</i> 91 P.R.R. 404, 419 (P.R.1964))); <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 165 (explaining that the position taken by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the applicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico was far more flexible in <i>R.C.A</i> than the plaintiff suggested). Regardless, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> as we have previously recognized, we need not address the precise contours of Puerto Rico's Commerce Clause jurisprudence in order to find PSP has an adequate remedy under Puerto Rico law. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 165. Rather, we have concluded it is sufficient that plaintiffs are \"free to make a Commerce Clause-based argument in the courts of Puerto Rico, and to pursue those arguments to the Supreme Court of the United States if necessary.\" <i>Id.</i> The Butler Act only requires that local courts provide a plaintiff the opportunity to make an argument, not that they guarantee the plaintiff's success. <i>Id.</i> Given this reasoning and the fact that PSP has already availed itself of such an opportunity to make this argument by challenging the tax in the Commonwealth courts (though it evidently chose not to make Commerce Clause arguments), PSP's contention that the local courts do not provide a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy is meritless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Though both Plaintiff Rocafort and Plaintiff-Appellant PSP sued in federal court and later in the Commonwealth courts, for simplicity's sake we refer only to PSP.</p>\n<p>[2]  PSP also suggested at oral argument that it lacked a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the Commonwealth Courts because such an action is time barred. First, we note we have no way of knowing if the Commonwealth courts have determined PSP's suit is time barred because the parties' addendum does not indicate any Commonwealth court has ruled on the issue yet. Second, because PSP raised this argument for the first time at oral argument, we refuse to consider it. <i>See </i><i>Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones,</i> 443 F.3d 134, 138 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> 424 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  At oral argument, Plaintiff stated that PSP would have to pay the imposed tax in order to request injunctive or declaratory relief in the Commonwealth courts. Defendant's counsel took contradictory positions on the matter. The addendum submitted by the parties does not clarify this confusion, nor does it establish whether PSP has already paid the tax or posted a bond as part of the litigation in the Commonwealth courts. Although, seemingly if PSP had paid the tax prior to filing suit in the Commonwealth courts, Defendant would have released the shipment, and PSP would not have requested the Commonwealth court to order Defendant to release the shipment but would have instead requested a tax refund. Since PSP did request the release of the shipment in the suit before the Commonwealth trial court, PSP, in theory, has not yet been made to pay the tax. But for reasons discussed herein the answer to those questions does not affect our plain, speedy, and efficient remedy analysis in this case. We, therefore, take PSP's claim in its briefs and at oral argument that it must first pay the tax to challenge it in the Commonwealth courts as true.</p>\n<p>[4]  From what we can discover, 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 has only been altered once since 1954. In 2003, \"Superior Court\" was changed to \"Court of First Instance.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13 § 261 (LexisNexis 2006). Otherwise, the text of the statute has remained the same.</p>\n<p>[5]  We note, however, some sister circuits have indicated that while generally a state refund procedure constitutes a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy, requiring a taxpayer to pay an exorbitant or effectively punitive tax in order to challenge it may present \"such a heavy burden that to decline [federal] equitable relief would be to deny judicial review altogether.\" <i>Denton v. City of Carrollton, Georgia,</i> 235 F.2d 481, 485 (5th Cir.1956); <i>see also </i><i>Capitol Indus.-EMI, Inc. v. Bennett,</i> 681 F.2d 1107, 1114 n. 20 (9th Cir.1982)(explaining that a state refund action may not constitute an adequate remedy in special circumstances, such as when a taxpayer is unable to pay a proposed assessment); <i>Sterling Shoe Co. v. Norberg,</i> 411 F.Supp. 128, 131 (D.R.I. 1976) (noting that \"it is settled law that prepayment as a prerequisite to judicial review does not prevent application of\" the TIA, but that \"[t]here is a qualification, however, where there is a factual showing ... that prepayment in order to secure judicial review `poses such a heavy burden that to deny equitable relief is to deny judicial review entirely'\" (quoting <i>Denton,</i> 235 F.2d at 485)). PSP has never contended it is unable to pay the \"six dollars and fifteen cents\" excise tax allegedly imposed by Puerto Rico upon its shipment of little cigars. As a result, we have no reason to believe that special circumstances of the nature other circuits have discussed exist here to justify jurisdiction.</p>\n\n</div>",

Girón-Anadón, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, BALDOCK,<sup>[*]</sup> and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Iván Rocafort is the president and primary shareholder of Plaintiff-Appellant Pleasures of San Patricio, Inc. (PSP), a tobacco and wine shop in Puerto Rico.<sup>[1]</sup> PSP regularly imports and sells little cigars made in the mainland United States and is the exclusive distributor of Cheyenne Little Cigars in Puerto Rico. The United States Department of the Treasury has classified little cigars as a different tobacco product from cigarettes. Section 2009 of the 1994 Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on cigarettes but not on little cigars. Prior to 2007, PSP had never been required to pay Puerto Rico's cigarette excise tax on its imported little cigars. In 2007, PSP ordered $40,000 worth of Cheyenne Little Cigars from a manufacturer in North Carolina. Defendant Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury, Juan Méndez-Torres, for the first time refused to release PSP's shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars until PSP paid the cigarette excise tax. PSP alleges Defendant acted pursuant to Circular Letter of Internal Revenue No. 05-08 dated August 17, 2005 (Circular Letter) which PSP claims imposes Puerto Rico's cigarette tax only on little cigars produced in the United States.</p>\n<p>In October 2007, PSP filed suit in Puerto Rico federal district court requesting \"the immediate release of [PSP's] shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars ...,\" \"a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise [tax] upon Cheyenne Little Cigars\" and a declaration \"that the excise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico Section 2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little Cigars.\" PSP asserted Defendant's application of the cigarette excise tax solely to mainland-made little cigars constitutes unconstitutional interference with and discrimination against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in August 2008. The district court concluded the Butler Act, 48 U.S.C. § 872, prevented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> it from hearing the suit because the Act prohibits the filing of suits in federal courts \"`for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico.'\" <i>Pleasures of San Patricio, Inc. v. Méndez-Torres,</i> Dkt. No. CIV. 07-1934CCC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4191251</span></span>, at *1 (D.P.R. Aug. 29, 2008) (quoting 48 U.S.C. § 872). The court was \"firmly convinced that this is a prototypical Butler Act case as [PSP] is explicitly challenging the validity of a tax and [Defendant]'s authority to assess it.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the district court declared it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit. <i>Id.</i> at *2. PSP's timely appeal to our Court followed.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, counsel for both parties revealed that while this appeal was pending, PSP filed an action in a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico trial court and received a partial summary judgment, which was at that time on appeal to the Commonwealth appellate court. We, therefore, ordered both parties to file English translations of the proceedings and associated complaints, pleadings, motions and briefs in PSP's related case before the Commonwealth trial and appellate courts. Defendant responded to our order by filing 436 pages in no apparent order without a uniform page numbering system (some page numbers are handwritten, others are typed in various fonts and sizes, and some placed over the page's text). Defendant evidently thought it appropriate to divide the documents into six parts but failed to label any of these six parts. Defendant provides an \"Addendum Index\" which does not appear to correspond to what it actually filed. Looking at the first page and last page of each part, Part II allegedly contains pages 36 through 235; Part III allegedly contains pages 236 through 260; Part IV allegedly contains pages 54 through 123; Part V allegedly contains pages 124 through 226; and Part VI allegedly contains pages 180 through 226. As for pages 260 through 436, we are left to assume they are somewhere in those six parts; although, we have only been able to locate pages numbered through 338 scattered throughout the six parts because many of the pages lack page numbers altogether. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we review the district court's final order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo. <i>Murphy v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195855\"><a href=\"/opinion/195855/murphy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir. 1995). In light of the proceedings in the Commonwealth courts, we suspect this case is moot. The parties' inadequate compliance with our order, however, prevents us from definitively reaching a conclusion as to mootness. Regardless, we can definitively conclude based upon the submissions that we lack subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Butler Act because Commonwealth of Puerto Rico courts have provided a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. We, consequently, affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>From what we can decipher, PSP apparently filed a lawsuit in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in February 2009, after the federal district court dismissed the instant case, against the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice challenging the Circular Letter, requesting an injunction, and demanding damages for the unlawful detention of its shipment. <i>See Rocafort v. Dep't of the Treasury,</i> No. EPE2009-0057 (Court of First Instance, Caguas Superior Court, filed February 20, 2009). PSP alleged Defendant Méndez-Torres implemented the Circular Letter in contravention of Puerto Rico's Small Business Administrative and Regulatory Flexibility Act (SBARFA), 3 L.P.R.A. §§ 2251-2262. The Court of First Instance granted partial summary judgment and entered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> a judgment in PSP's favor. The court considered whether Defendant Méndez-Torres acted in conformity with the SBARFA in issuing the Circular Letter and, if properly issued, whether the Circular Letter promulgates an invalid administrative interpretation of Section 2009 of the Internal Revenue Code. PSP does not appear to have raised Commerce Clause arguments before the Court of First Instance. Ultimately, the court concluded Defendant Méndez-Torres acted in contravention of the SBARFA in issuing the Circular Letter and relied upon an invalid regulatory interpretation in seizing the shipment of little cigars. The court, therefore, granted PSP's motion for partial summary judgment and ordered the Department of the Treasury to release the shipment immediately. Defendants then filed a petition for certiorari before the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Appellate Court. <i>See Rocafort v. Dep't of the Treasury,</i> No. KLCE2009-01542, Petition for Certiorari (Appellate Court, Judicial Region of Caguas, filed October 26, 2009). That is the last documentation we have of this case in the Commonwealth courts. Neither party has supplemented the record pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) to inform us whether the Appellate Court has granted the petition for certiorari, let alone whether it has affirmed the Court of First Instance's partial summary judgment in favor of PSP. The parties have also not informed us whether the Department of the Treasury has complied with the Court of First Instance's September 2009 order by releasing the shipment. As a result, we cannot conclusively determine that the Commonwealth proceedings render the case before us moot. We, therefore, proceed to determine whether the Butler Act deprives us of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Butler Act states, in relevant part: \"No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by the laws of Puerto Rico shall be maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. § 872. The Act is \"a close analogue to the Tax Injunction Act (`TIA') applicable to Puerto Rico.\" <i>Coors Brewing Co. v. Méndez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203750\"><a href=\"/opinion/203750/coors-brewing-co-v-mendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2009). \"The two statutes employ different language (<i>i.e.</i> the [TIA] includes an express exception that the Butler Act lacks), but `have been construed <i>in pari materia.</i>'\" <i>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200320\"><a href=\"/opinion/200320/united-parcel-v-flores-galarza/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 330 n. 11 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Trailer Marine Transp.

For this reason, we apply the Butler Act in the same manner as the TIA. <i>Carrier Corp. v. Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403543\"><a href=\"/opinion/403543/carrier-corporation-v-hon-julio-cesar-perez-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 164 (1st Cir.1982). The TIA limits the jurisdiction of a federal court to entertain a suit seeking to enjoin the levying or collection of a state tax where \"a plain, speedy and efficient remedy\" exists in state court. <i>Id.</i> at 164; <i>see also </i><i>United Parcel Serv.,</i> 318 F.3d at 330 n. 11. Two conditions must, therefore, be satisfied before the Butler Act will deprive a federal court of jurisdiction: first, the suit must attempt to restrain the assessment or collection of a Puerto Rico tax; and second, local courts must provide the plaintiff a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>As to the first condition, similar to the TIA, \"[n]ot every statutory or regulatory obligation that may aid the Secretary [of the Treasury]'s ability to collect a tax is immune from attack in federal court by virtue of the Butler Act's jurisdictional bar.\" <i>United Parcel Serv.,</i> 318 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 331. The Act's jurisdictional bar only extends to:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[C]ases where taxpayers were repeatedly using the federal courts to raise questions of state or federal law going to the validity of the particular taxes imposed upon themnot to a case where a taxpayer contended that an unusual sanction for non-payment of a tax admittedly due violated his constitutional rights....\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Wells v.

Méndez-Torres</i><i>,</i> we further clarified the scope of the Butler Act in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Hibbs v. Winn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span> (2004). <i>Hibbs v. Winn</i> dealt with the scope of the TIA, but we concluded in <i>Coors:</i></p>\n<blockquote>[S]ince the Butler Act is read in parallel to the TIA, and since it similarly only restricts the district courts from entertaining suits \"for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection\" of taxes of Puerto Rico, we read it, according to <i>Hibbs,</i> to only apply where plaintiffs seek to challenge taxes in a way that would reduce the flow of state tax revenue.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Coors,</i> 562 F.3d at 14. For this reason, we concluded that despite the Butler Act the district court had jurisdiction to entertain Coors's suit challenging an exemption in Puerto Rico's taxing scheme which specified a lower tax rate for small brewers (generally local brewers). <i>Id.</i> at 16. Coors sought a declaration that the exemption was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause as well as an injunction prohibiting the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury from allowing any taxpayer to pay only the reduced tax rate provided by the small brewers exemption and requiring the Secretary to impose the higher tax rate on all brewers. <i>Id.</i> at 5. Because Coors did not seek to lower the tax rate on itself, \"rather than eliminat[ing] a potential source of revenue, the relief Coors request[ed] would simply eliminate a tax law affording preferential tax treatment to certain taxpayers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16. Accordingly, we concluded that under <i>Hibbs,</i> Coors's action was not barred by the Butler Act. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>At first blush, PSP's suit appears similar to the one we determined fell beyond the scope of the Butler Act in <i>Coors.</i> PSP raised a Commerce Clause objection to Defendant placing a higher tax on mainland-made little cigars than locally-made little cigars. Similarly, Coors raised a Commerce Clause challenge to the Secretary's imposing a higher tax on large brewers than on small brewers. But, critically, the two suits differ in the relief requested. Coors requested an injunction requiring all brewers, large and small, to pay the higher large-brewer tax, thereby increasing the revenue flowing to Puerto Rico. In contrast, PSP requested in its amended complaint that the federal district court \"order the immediate release of [PSP's] shipment of Cheyenne Little Cigars..., ... issue a permanent injunction against the selective and discriminatory imposition of the cigarette excise [tax] upon Cheyenne Little Cigars, [and] ... declare that the excise tax of the 1994 Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico Section 2009 [is] not applicable to Cheyenne Little Cigars.\" PSP did not request an injunction requiring Defendant to apply the cigarette excise tax to all little cigars, including those made in Puerto Rico. Consequently, rather than increase the revenue generated by Puerto Rico's tax laws, PSP's requested relief \"would reduce the flow of [Puerto Rico] tax revenue.\" <i>Coors,</i> 562 F.3d at 14. We must, therefore, conclude <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> PSP's suit does fall within the ambit of suits barred by the Butler Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Now that we have determined PSP's suit is within the scope of suits barred by the Butler Act, we must decide whether Puerto Rico local courts provide a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. PSP argues in its briefs that it lacks such a remedy for two reasons: first, Puerto Rico tax procedure requires it to sell its little cigars at a loss; second, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico does not recognize the applicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has clarified that the requirement of a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in state court is only a procedural one and is, therefore, satisfied merely when \"certain procedural criteria\" are met. <i>Rosewell v.

A state remedy meets these minimal procedural criteria so long as it \"provides a taxpayer with a `full hearing and judicial determination' at which she may raise all constitutional objections to the tax\" and may therefrom seek review before the Supreme Court. <i>Rosewell,</i> 450 U.S. at 515 n. 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110435\"><a href=\"/opinion/110435/rosewell-v-lasalle-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But Puerto Rico requires taxpayers not only to pay the tax before seeking redress, but also to in fact <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> have suffered the economic burden of the tax. 13 L.P.R.A. § 261; <i>see also </i><i>Venrod Corp. v. Sec'y of the Treasury of the Commw. of Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440982/venrod-corp-v-secy-of-treas-of-com-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

If the Secretary decides against the taxpayer, he may appeal the decision in the local Puerto Rico courts and, thereafter, seek review of any final Commonwealth court decision with the Supreme Court of the United States. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. This means only taxpayers who have absorbed the challenged taxes and not passed them on to their vendees may sue for a refund in Commonwealth courts. <i>Venrod,</i> 704 F.Supp. at 23. Quoting <i>Venrod,</i> PSP asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>This puts [a] plaintiff in a catch-22 situation anent the state remedy: it can either pass the burden of the tax on to the ultimate purchaser, which will make [the taxed product] uncompetitive, and thereby forego any remedy for an allegedly illegal tax, or it can absorb the tax, sell the [taxed product] at a loss, and attempt to obtain a refund.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 24. In <i>Venrod,</i> the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico reasoned that while we had previously determined in <i>Carrier</i> that Puerto Rico's refund procedure constituted a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy, we did not encounter the catch-22 scenario described. <i>Id.</i> As a result, the <i>Venrod</i> district court proceeded to conclude \"a remedy which requires for its availability the selling of the [taxed product] at a loss is not plain, speedy, and efficient.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Carrier,</i> we reviewed the exact same Puerto Rico tax refund procedure under 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 that the district court in <i>Venrod</i> discussed; we just did so seven years earlier.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 164. At that time, we concluded that Section 261 provided plaintiffs challenging Puerto Rico taxes a plain, speedy and efficient remedy. <i>Id.</i> The district court in <i>Venrod</i> correctly noted that the <i>Carrier</i> court did not expressly pass on the catch-22 scenario Section 261 creates by requiring plaintiffs to suffer the challenged tax. <i>Venrod,</i> 704 F.Supp. at 24. However, we must assume that when the <i>Carrier</i> court stated it had evaluated the Puerto Rico refund procedure in Section 261, the court reviewed it in its brief entirety (only two paragraphs long). We, therefore, have good reason to conclude we have already passed on Section 261's burden-bearing requirement.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we independently fail to see how requiring a taxpayer to sell taxed goods at a loss before suing for a refund fails to provide him an adequate remedy. First, if the taxpayer prevails in his challenge of the tax, he obtains a refund, reversing the detriment the tax imposed upon him. Second, requiring a taxpayer to bear the burden of the tax does not diminish Puerto Rico's satisfaction of the Butler Act's minimal procedural requirements. Puerto Rico continues to satisfy those minimal procedural requirements by providing a taxpayer a \"full hearing and judicial determination\" of all of her constitutional objections to the tax, with review thereafter possible before the United States Supreme Court, regardless of its burden-bearing requirement. Third, Congress, and later the Supreme Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> when asked to review state refund procedures, surely understood a taxpayer might have to bear the economic burden of a tax in order to contest it in state courts. When Congress first passed the Butler Act's cousin, the TIA, \"Congress knew that state tax systems commonly provided for payment of taxes under protest with subsequent refund as their exclusive remedy.\" <i>Rosewell,</i> 450 U.S. at 523, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110435\"><a href=\"/opinion/110435/rosewell-v-lasalle-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>. Then and now, a significant portion of taxpayers are not businesses or entities that can pass on their tax liabilities to their consumers or employees, but instead are families and individuals who must bear the burden of their state tax liability rather than pass it on to someone else. Consequently, Congress and the Court must have realized many taxpayers would have to absorb the burden of a tax in order to contest it in state court. Thus, on the facts presented, we must conclude Puerto Rico's requirement that PSP absorb the burden of the tax prior to contesting it does not deprive PSP of a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in Puerto Rico courts.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, in this case, the Commonwealth courts (even assuming contrary to logic that PSP has paid the contested tax) have certainly provided PSP a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy. PSP has already received a favorable partial judgment from the Commonwealth trial court ordering Defendant to release its shipment. Even if the Commonwealth Appellate Court reverses the partial judgment, \"[t]he Butler Act, at most, requires assurance that a plaintiff will have an opportunity to make an argument in [local] court, not that he will win.\" <i>Id.</i> at 165. As Defendant's addendum indicates, PSP has clearly had such an opportunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>We have also reviewed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's interpretation of the Commerce Clause's application to Puerto Rico, finding it far less definitive than PSP asserts. <i>See </i><i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199435\"><a href=\"/opinion/199435/soto-v-sugar-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 143 (1st Cir. 2001) (concluding after reviewing circuit and Puerto Rico Supreme Court precedent that the Commerce Clause in the view of Puerto Rico courts may have \"`contours which are different' from those when applied to the States.\" (quoting <i>R.C.A. v. Gov't of the Capital,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span>, 419 (P.R.1964))); <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 165 (explaining that the position taken by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the applicability of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico was far more flexible in <i>R.C.A</i> than the plaintiff suggested). Regardless, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> as we have previously recognized, we need not address the precise contours of Puerto Rico's Commerce Clause jurisprudence in order to find PSP has an adequate remedy under Puerto Rico law. <i>Carrier,</i> 677 F.2d at 165. Rather, we have concluded it is sufficient that plaintiffs are \"free to make a Commerce Clause-based argument in the courts of Puerto Rico, and to pursue those arguments to the Supreme Court of the United States if necessary.\" <i>Id.</i> The Butler Act only requires that local courts provide a plaintiff the opportunity to make an argument, not that they guarantee the plaintiff's success. <i>Id.</i> Given this reasoning and the fact that PSP has already availed itself of such an opportunity to make this argument by challenging the tax in the Commonwealth courts (though it evidently chose not to make Commerce Clause arguments), PSP's contention that the local courts do not provide a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy is meritless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Though both Plaintiff Rocafort and Plaintiff-Appellant PSP sued in federal court and later in the Commonwealth courts, for simplicity's sake we refer only to PSP.</p>\n<p>[2]  PSP also suggested at oral argument that it lacked a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the Commonwealth Courts because such an action is time barred. First, we note we have no way of knowing if the Commonwealth courts have determined PSP's suit is time barred because the parties' addendum does not indicate any Commonwealth court has ruled on the issue yet. Second, because PSP raised this argument for the first time at oral argument, we refuse to consider it. <i>See </i><i>Nieves-Vega v. Ortiz-Quiñones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202131\"><a href=\"/opinion/202131/nieves-vega-v-ortiz-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 138 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Surprenant v. Rivas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201815\"><a href=\"/opinion/201815/surprenant-v-rivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  At oral argument, Plaintiff stated that PSP would have to pay the imposed tax in order to request injunctive or declaratory relief in the Commonwealth courts. Defendant's counsel took contradictory positions on the matter. The addendum submitted by the parties does not clarify this confusion, nor does it establish whether PSP has already paid the tax or posted a bond as part of the litigation in the Commonwealth courts. Although, seemingly if PSP had paid the tax prior to filing suit in the Commonwealth courts, Defendant would have released the shipment, and PSP would not have requested the Commonwealth court to order Defendant to release the shipment but would have instead requested a tax refund. Since PSP did request the release of the shipment in the suit before the Commonwealth trial court, PSP, in theory, has not yet been made to pay the tax. But for reasons discussed herein the answer to those questions does not affect our plain, speedy, and efficient remedy analysis in this case. We, therefore, take PSP's claim in its briefs and at oral argument that it must first pay the tax to challenge it in the Commonwealth courts as true.</p>\n<p>[4]  From what we can discover, 13 L.P.R.A. § 261 has only been altered once since 1954. In 2003, \"Superior Court\" was changed to \"Court of First Instance.\" <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13 § 261 (LexisNexis 2006). Otherwise, the text of the statute has remained the same.</p>\n<p>[5]  We note, however, some sister circuits have indicated that while generally a state refund procedure constitutes a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy, requiring a taxpayer to pay an exorbitant or effectively punitive tax in order to challenge it may present \"such a heavy burden that to decline [federal] equitable relief would be to deny judicial review altogether.\" <i>Denton v. City of Carrollton, Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"240006\"><a href=\"/opinion/240006/h-w-denton-and-international-union-of-electrical-radio-and-machine/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 485 (5th Cir.1956); <i>see also </i><i>Capitol Indus.-EMI, Inc. v.

Norberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1643727\"><a href=\"/opinion/1643727/sterling-shoe-co-v-norberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

PSP has never contended it is unable to pay the \"six dollars and fifteen cents\" excise tax allegedly imposed by Puerto Rico upon its shipment of little cigars. As a result, we have no reason to believe that special circumstances of the nature other circuits have discussed exist here to justify jurisdiction.</p>\n\n</div>",
